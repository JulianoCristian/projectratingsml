capacity by targeted farmers in nine\n            vulnerable districts. Negative impacts include: local air\n            pollution, minimal local air pollution, pollution of surface\n            water due to runoff and improper application, impede\n            movement of livestock due to gullies, disposal of used oil,\n            and disposal of used spare parts. Mitigation measures\n            include: use enclosed trucks/cover fertilizer stocks; store\n            seeds away from dwellings and stored food; train farmers and\n            extension worker on the right application rates and contour\n            farming; proper ventilation of seed stores; training on soil\n            and water conservation; avoid disposal used oil into or near\n            water bodies; regular preventive maintenance; accidental\n            spillage near water bodies must be immediately cleaned; and\n            training on soil and water conservation techniques for\n            participating members of the Seed Growers Association to be\n            able to avoid soil degradation."}, "docdt": "2010-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
