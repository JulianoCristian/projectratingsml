                       Restructuring Paper
1.    The closing date for the Gambia Emergency Agricultural
     Production Project (GEAPP), Grant No. TF096106, P119892,
     will be extended from August 31, 2011 until December 31,
     2011. This Trust Fund grant of US$ 7.5 million to the Republic
     of The Gambia (Recipient) was made available by the
     European Union Food Crisis Rapid Respond Facility Trust
     Fund under the Global Food Crisis Response Program (the
     Grant), of which US$ 3.7 million remains undisbursed. The
     Grant became effective on March 1, 2010.
2.   The Project’s overall objectives are to improve access to agricultural inputs, equipment and
     postharvest storage capacity by targeted farmers in nine vulnerable districts. Such overall
     Project objectives remain unchanged and continue to be considered achievable as progress
     in Project implementation remains satisfactory. The performance of the Project coordination
     unit is also satisfactory. Furthermore, there has been no suspension of disbursement for this
     Grant and there are no overdue audit reports and interim financial reports.



3.   The proposed extension is necessary to provide the Recipient with adequate implementation
     time to complete all Project activities and the achievement of the Project’s objectives,
     including the full rehabilitation of the 35 village seed storage facilities and 3 seed
     multiplication centers envisaged in the Project. An action plan has been established to
     ensure Project completion within the proposed timeframe.



4.   To date, several important results have already become visible. The assessment of key
     performance indicators reveal that from a target of 20,000 farmers, 60,039 farmers have
     actually received improved millet and rice seeds. The same results apply to farmers who
     received the recommended doses of compound and urea fertilizers. In terms of farm
     machinery and equipment supply, the target of 667 organized farmer groups is fully
     reached. All procurement process for the rehabilitation of storage facilities for increased
     village-level grain and seed post-harvest storage capacity in targeted districts is completed.

5.   This will be the first extension of the Gambia Emergency Agricultural Production Project,
     Grant TF096106.
