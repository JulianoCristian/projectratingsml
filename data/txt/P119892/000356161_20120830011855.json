Agriculture\n            Production Project for Gambia were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory; risk to development outcome was moderate; Bank\n            performance was satisfactory and grantee performance was\n            also satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: lack of\n            effective sensitization and adequate human resource in\n            implementing institutions hinder delivery of emergency\n            operations. Less complex and simply designed projects that\n            also take into consideration the institutional capacities of\n            the country is more likely to be successful. Interventions\n            that help to mitigate climate change effects, such as\n            adverse weather, would help boost production and alleviate\n            poverty of beneficiaries. Close monitoring of annual plans\n            as well as approved procurement plans are critical to\n            completing emergency projects of this nature. It can be\n            problematic using short-term emerging funding for long-term\n            funding activities. The administrative agreements should\n            clearly define reporting chain as well as the\n            responsibilities of the Bank to the European Union (EU)\n            delegation operating in the recipient countries."}, "docdt": "2012-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
