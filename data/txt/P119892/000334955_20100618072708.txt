EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Introduction and Background 
Despite several measures taken by Government since 2007 to mitigate the impact of 
rising food and fuel prices, the country and particularly the rural areas are still 
confronting food crisis due mainly to depleted food stocks, low purchasing power 
and low level of production. 
 
The Gambia Government sought assistance to enhance agricultural productivity and 
domestic food crop production by providing direct support to farmers through the 
provision of agricultural inputs and equipment. Following an inter-agency 
assessment mission in August 2008 comprising the Food and Agricultural 
Organization (FAO), World Bank (WB), World Food Programme (WFP) and the 
Page  7
6
International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the Gambia Emergency 
Agricultural Production Project (GEAPP) was developed in 2009.  
 
The GEAPP is funded by the World Bank as a grant from the European Union Food 
Crisis Response Facility Trust Fund in an amount of 5.3 million Euros. The GEAPP 
focuses on: 
-
Increasing access to agricultural inputs 
and equipment for 20,000 farmers and 667 farmer groups. 
-
Increasing post-harvest storage capacity 
through the rehabilitation of 35 village based facilities. 
-
Laying the foundation of a sustainable 
farmer based seed multiplication.  
-
Networking through the rehabilitation of 
four existing seed multiplication centres. 
 
As an emergency grant, it shall be implemented over an 18-month period and is 
intended to increase cereal (millet and rice) production in 10
 
districts identified as 
the most vulnerable with regards food security based on various criteria and factors. 
 
These districts are in the following Local Government Areas (LGAs): 
 
Brikama LGA
 
Mansakonko LGA 
 
Kerewan LGA 
Foni Bintang   
Jarra West 
 
 
Lower Nuimi

In as much as the GEAPP is developed to benefit farmers, the same project could 
cause environmental and social problems that can affect the same farmers today or in 
future. Therefore, this Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) 
was prepared to ensure that potential negative adverse environmental impacts and 
social risks related to the project activities are identified and assessed. The relevant 
and appropriate mitigation measures have also been provided to prevent or reduce 
these adverse impacts. 
 
Objectives of the ESMF 
The objectives of the GEAPP Environmental and Social Management Framework 
(ESMF) are: 
 
-
To identify, assess and manage potential 
negative environmental impacts associated with the project and ensure that 
appropriate mitigating measures are taken. 
 
-
To establish clear procedures and 
methods for environmental and social planning review and implementation. 
Page  8
7
-
To specify appropriate roles and 
responsibilities and outline the necessary reporting procedures, for managing and 
monitoring environmental and social concerns related to the Project activities. 
 
-
To determine the training, capacity 
building, and technical assistance needed to successfully implement the 
provisions of the ESMF. 
 
-
To establish the Project funding required 
to implement the ESMF. 
 
-
To provide practical information 
resources for implementing the ESMF. 
 
Methodology used to prepare the ESMF 
In preparing this ESMF, literature review and consultation with various stakeholders 
were done and the collected information analysed.  
 
Consultations were held with personnel in the following relevant institutions: 
-
the Ministry of Agriculture - GEAPP 
Project Coordination Unit; Regional Agricultural Directors (RADs) and 
extension workers; the Soil and Water Management Unit (SWMU); 
Plant Protection Services (PPS); National Agricultural Research 
Institute; Participatory Integrated Watershed Management Project 
(PIWAMP) and the Gambia Lowland Agricultural Development Project  
 
-
the National Environment Agency (NEA)  
 
We also conducted field visits to the sample district, Foni Kansala, and held 
discussions with the Village Development Committees and the farmer groups 
(“kafoos”) in the three villages – Dobong, Burock and Kampant. The sample 
represents high, medium and low populated villages respectively.  
 
The information collected from the consultations were used in developing the ESMF 
in addition to other information from the desktop review and consultant’s 
experience.  
 
Summary of the outcome of the consultations 
All the partners consulted discussed the potential benefits of this project, however, 
some of the environmental and social issues repeatedly raised include: 
1.  The need for soil conservation  
2.  The need for sensitization of the relevant extension workers  
3.  The GEAPP to consider women with regards ownership as their powers and 
rights are limited  
4.  The need for support from the GEAPP for a successful Project execution and 
specifically related to monitoring. 
5.  Village Development Committees (VDCs) have vast experience in managing 
and advising on similar issues.

6.  Proper seed storage is important in increasing agricultural production 
7. 
A number of agricultural projects are concurrently being implemented. 
8. 
The GEAPP’s provision of free inputs was received with joy by the farmers, 
however, the importance of considering equipment running and maintenance 
costs was mentioned.  
9. 
Appropriate timing of farming activities is important for various reasons.. 
 
Impact screening 
The principles and method used to evaluate the potential significant impacts  
The significance of impacts were characterised as (i) moderate positive, (ii) high 
positive (iii) moderate negative (iv) high negative and (v) no discernible impact, 
considering the combination of various factors such as the type of activities, 
sensitivity of receptors, impact duration and geographical coverage amongst others. 
 
This screening to evaluation the significance of potential impacts of this Project was 
based largely on expert opinion, information from the consultations and experience 
of similar agricultural projects.  
 
Project Description and Objectives 
The project has three components:  
 
1. 
Provision of agricultural inputs and 
equipment 
2. 
Rehabilitation of post harvest and seed 
multiplication infrastructure 
3. 
Support to project coordination 
monitoring and evaluation.  
 
Provision of Agricultural Inputs and Equipment 
This component will support the provision of agricultural production inputs (seeds 
and fertilizer) to beneficiaries. About 3000 tons of fertilizer (1500 tons of Nitrogen, 
Phosphorus and Potassium - NPK; 1500 tons of urea and 525 tons of certified seeds 
(25 tons early millet seeds and 500 tons of rice seeds) will be purchased and 
distributed to 20,000 millet and rice farmers.  
 
The project will also provide pieces of machinery including (power tillers 300, 
seeders and sine-hoes 367).  
 
Rehabilitation of Seed Multiplication and Post Harvest Infrastructure  
Three seed centres located in different parts of the country are identified by the 
project for rehabilitation and the project will support the rehabilitation of 35 village 
level storage facilities to minimize post harvest losses.  
 
Institutional arrangements for GEAPP implementation and monitoring 
The GEAPP will be implemented by the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) of The 
Gambia’s Africa Emergency Locust Project (GM-AELP) under the Ministry of 
Agriculture.  
 
The Project Coordination Unit will be responsible for procuring and delivering the 
inputs to the regional headquarters. Based on the 
GEAPP District and Village Level 
Page  10

Agricultural Inputs Distribution Plan
,
the Regional Agricultural Directors will 
facilitate the transportation of the inputs to the villages; the Non-Governmental 
Organisations (NGOs) contracted by the project will be responsible for distribution 
of inputs at the village levels. 
 
The Village Development Committees (VDCs) and the women farmer groups 
(Kafoos) will participate fully in the distribution of the inputs at the village level. 
 
The GEAPP will provide incremental funds to the PCU for coordination, 
communication, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) activities. The agricultural 
services will provide specialised training and technical services to farmers. NEA will 
be responsible for monitoring the environmental impacts to ensure that the project is 
implemented according to the ESMF and environmental laws of the Gambia.

Policy, Legislative and Institutional Framework for the GEAPP ESMF 
 
The main law with regards the ESMF is the National Environment Management Act 
(NEMA), 1994, which was reviewed in addition to the Public Health Act, 1990 and 
the Local Government Act 2002. 
 
Institutional structures for the National Environment Agency, The Ministry of 
Agriculture and local government were also explored. 
 
Policies reviewed include: The Gambia Environmental Action Plan; the Second 
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP II) 2007-2011; the Agriculture and Natural 
Resources Sector Policy 2009-2015and World Bank Safeguard Policy4.01. 
 
Environmental and Social Assessment of GEAPP 
The environmental evaluation aims to bring into focus, for the purposes of ensuring 
that the project is executed in an environmentally sound manner, all important 
environmental and social issues taken into consideration. Its findings are intended to 
assist in decision-making processes involved in project implementation.  
 
The aim of such study is that environmental and social considerations can be 
integrated into the design as much as possible at the conceptual stage. This is a 
preventive measure, which aims to prevent or minimise the negative impacts of the 
project.  
 
The objectives of environmental assessments are to identify and exploit 
environmental opportunities and benefits of a proposed project; manage negative 
impacts and ensure that project activities comply with relevant standards and 
legislation at the national and international levels. Like this ESMF, it is important to 
formulate practical, time-bound and cost-effective recommendations to mitigate any 
potential significant adverse environmental and social impacts that could arise during 
construction and operations. 
 
Screening of project sites 
 
The VADPs and farmers complete the screening checklist by identifying applicable 
impacts and the recommended classification to be finalised with the EIA Programme 
Officer. The Executive Director of NEA approves the classification which decides what 
is to proceed.  
According to the World Bank’s OP4.01, category B projects vary in impacts from site to 
site, thus, GEAPP activities may require more studies based on specific sites. Category 
B
may require limited scope EIA whose terms of reference will be developed by the EIA 
Programme Officer at NEA and a consultant sought by the PCU to carry out the study. 
This will be validated by the multi -sectoral EIA Working Group then a decision made 
to reject, approve with or without conditions of implementation. As in this ESMF, 
identified mitigation measures shall be accompanied by corresponding parties for 
implementation and those responsible for monitoring.  
 
Page  12
11 
 
|To ensure this process is effective, it is important to train the VADPs and NEA 
Regional Officers in environmental assessment procedures.  
 
Evaluation of impacts 
Using the method earlier discussed, the various issues on the physical, biological and 
socioeconomic parameters were rated and the summarised under potential positive 
and negative impacts. 
 
Potential Positive Impacts  
The main aim of the Project is to enhance crop yield. Therefore, it is expected that 
the various activities will contribute towards increased harvest for beneficiaries and 
subsequently more income. 
 
Sensitization programmes under the GEAPP ESMF will assist in more understanding 
of farming activity timing, soil conservation and integrated pest management, thus, 
preventing environmental degradation and also avoiding sensitive areas. 
During the consultations, the project impacts discussed included more income and 
less need for physical labour, hence children will be released to attend school. 
 
Potential Negative Impacts 
Impacts on the Physical Environment 
The provision of farming implements such as power tillers, sine hoes and seeders to 
the farmers could have negative impacts on the physical environment. If these 
implements are not used properly they could encourage erosion especially when the 
topography consists of steep slopes and sandy soils. Deep tillage makes the soil more 
erodible and, thus, more soil will be carried downstream. This may result to gully 
formation which can change the landscape of the area in extreme circumstances. It 
may also carry sediments downstream to the lowlands, thus, covering the fertile 
lowland and rendering it unproductive or reduce its productivity. 
 
In almost all the villages visited, runoff water was a problem; gullies are observed 
and the farmers expressed their concerns on the issue of controlling erosion. The 
consultant concluded that the supply of farming implements should be preceded by 
training on soil and water conservation techniques such as contour farming and the 
creation of diversions. The extension workers at the village level should be trained 
and they in turn train farmers. 
 
The availability of free inputs and equipment could encourage farmers to expand the 
land to be cultivated. This expansion could encroach into forest or sites of cultural 
significance unless controlled by full implementation of the ESMF. 
 
Negative Impacts on the Biological Environment 
Over application of fertiliser could lead to the pollution of surface water bodies. 
Such pollution could affect aquatic organisms such as fish. Many of the villages to 
benefit from the project are situated close to the River Gambia or one of its 
tributaries. Due to the runoff volumes, most of the fertiliser could be washed away 
Page  13
12 
 
into water bodies unless soil and water conservation techniques are implemented. 
Farmers also need to be trained on the right application rates to avoid over 
application. Movement of wildlife and livestock for food and water could be affected 
indirectly, if their paths are badly affected by erosion. 
 
Negative Impacts on the Socio-economic Environment 
The issue of giving the implements and inputs for free is expected to cause instability 
in the community. In all our consultations with the farmers the issue of the quantities 
to be given came up and whether or not it will be ‘enough’ for everyone. The fact 
that it is free makes distribution very difficult because community members that do 
not have allocations will be dissatisfied with the project and this could be a source of 
conflict among community members. 
 
Women also fear that unless a specified amount is allocated to them, men may take 
everything or most of it. The implements that are to be issued without the draft 
animals to operate them is another constraint. This means only those with draft 
animals can have them. Most of these people already have some implements and 
giving them another one could lead to them selling one. Giving these implements to 
people without animals will also mean they borrow or hire animals from the owners. 
They will only get animals when the owners are ready with their work. This will 
have a significant negative impact on timely cultivation which will invariably affect 
productivity. Timely cultivation is also a method of integrated pest management in 
view of the fact that pesticides are not issued as part of the project. 
 
The availability of free inputs and equipment could free up some cash with the 
farmers and they may spend that on pesticides in view of the fact that pesticides are 
not part of the project. 
 
The Following are Mitigation Measures for the Potential Negative Impacts 
earlier explained: 
 
Fertilizer distribution and use 
1. 
Use enclosed trucks  or cover fertilizer 
stocks during transportation 
2. 
Train farmers and extension worker on 
the right application rates and contour farming 
3.  Equitable and fair distribution of inputs. Community ownership of inputs and 
targeting of groups rather than individuals. Practice traditional conflict 
resolution systems. 
4. 
Good farming techniques to be utilised by 
farmers 
 
Seed Distribution and use

Monitoring and evaluation of the ESMF 
Monitoring of the ESMF implementation is essential in ensuring the project is 
environmentally sound, by checking that the recommended mitigation measures have 
been carried out effectively in a timely manner.  
 
Monitoring and evaluation of the ESMF will be mainstreamed in the general 
monitoring system of the GEAPP at various levels.  
 
The VADPs shall monitor the ESMF implementation at local level whilst they will 
in turn be monitored by the National Environment Agency Regional Programme 
Officer. To ensure proper coordination at field level, we propose Regional 
Environment Coordination Teams headed by the NEA to coordinate the general 
implementation of the ESMF.  The team shall comprise the NEA Regional 
Programme Officer and Regional Agricultural Directorate (DADO and Plant 
Protection specialist). 
 
It is the responsibility of the GEAPP Monitoring and Evaluation Officer to ensure 
that both the VADPs and NEA Officers are facilitated as requested to monitor the 
ESMF implementation. Memorandums of Understanding should be developed in this 
respect. Notwithstanding, random joint monitoring is recommended at an early stage 
to ensure consistency. 
 
It is recommended that an independent environmental auditor be contracted to 
undertake a midterm performance review to prevent bias in reporting and 
recommend any necessary corrective measures on time.   
 
Reporting 
Effective communication between the local monitors and the NEA and PCU is 
essential.  
 
Monthly reporting of monitoring and evaluation results is recommended from the 
VADPs to the PCU through the Regional Environment Coordination Team. 
 
The PCU shall in turn evaluate the reports and facilitate immediate improvement 
considering the short length of the project duration.  
 
The independent environmental auditor shall review the ESMF implementation from 
the beneficiary level to the local monitors and PCU levels. 
Page  17

Capacity enhancement and training requirements 
 
Environmental Training and Sensitisation 
Training and sensitisation will be required at all levels: Monitoring and Evaluation 
Officers of the GEAPP, RADs, VADPs, NEA Regional Programme Officers, NEA 
Regional Environmental Inspectors, Community Development Assistants and 
beneficiary farmers. 
 
The PCU shall collaborate with the relevant institutions for the required specialists to 
deliver a range of technical training on environmental and social management issues 
to the target groups. The VADPs shall carry out step down sensitisation sessions for 
the farmers.  
 
Capacity Enhancement 
In addition to human resources, there is some capacity at all levels to implement the 
mitigation measures of this ESMF, however, as understood during the consultations, 
there is limited resources in the implementing institutions, which needs enhancement 
for success.  
 
For both the Department of Agriculture Regional Agricultural Centres and National 
Environment Agency Regional Offices, support is required to supplement resources 
for monitoring and reporting. The agricultural technical units such as NARI and PPS 
may also be supported for effective implementation. A sample baseline survey of 
water quality in target areas has also been proposed by the SWMU and Department 
of Water Resources.  
 
ESMF Implementing Budget 
The total ESMF implementation budget for capacity building in monitoring and 
training, / sensitization programmes is $62,300.00.
Page  18
17 
 
Recommendations for implementation of the ESMF 
The ESMF highlights the following recommendations for effective implementation: 
 
-
Policy and decision makers from all 
relevant institutions must be sensitised on the Project ESMF before 
project activities commence at district level. 
-
All training and sensitisation programmes 
must take place before project activities commence at district level.  
-
Harmonise the World Bank and Gambia 
EIA procedures to avoid confusion and make the process more user 
friendly. 
-
Enhance monitoring of the importation, 
sale and use of illegal pesticides most of which comes through the 
porous borders with Senegal and sold at the “lumos”.  
-
We recommend the inputs be provided as 
a
grant to farming groups only, however, where individual farmers are 
benefiting, in order to ensure sustainability and equitable distribution, we 
recommend token cost recovery from farmers to be managed by the 
VDCs. 
-
Establishment of a Regional Environment 
Coordination Team comprising of the NEA Regional Programme Officer 
and Regional Agricultural Directorate (DADO and Plant Protection 
specialist) 
-
An independent environmental audit 
carried out mid-term of project ESMF implementation.  
-
Based on the outcome of the inventory, it 
is recommended to calculate the cost of collection and disposal of any 
hazardous waste or obsolete pesticides found.

 Introduction 
 1.1 Background 
As in other Sahelian countries, the food security situation in The Gambia is severely 
and regularly affected by erratic rainfall patterns. The 2004 locust invasion combined 
with several years of drought conditions are the main factors behind the recent drop 
in domestic cereal production. Since 2005 the total food grain production has 
declined by 35 percent and the gap between consumption needs and domestic 
production levels increased from 65,000 metric tons in 2004 to 150,000 metric tons 
in 2007. 
 
Beginning in 2007, rising food and fuel cost pushed the annual inflation rate in The 
Gambia by 6 percent in 2008. Despite several measures taken by Government since 
2007 to mitigate the impact of rising food and fuel prices, the country and 
particularly the rural areas are still confronting food crisis due mainly to depleted 
food stocks, low purchasing power and low level of production. 
 
In response to the food crisis and soaring prices affecting the country, The Gambia 
Government in addition to taking mitigating measures, sought the assistance of the 
international donor community to enhance agricultural productivity and domestic 
food crop production by providing direct support to farmers through the provision of 
agricultural inputs and equipment. Following an inter-agency assessment mission in 
August 2008 comprising the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), World 
Bank (WB), World Food Programme (WFP) and the International Fund for 
Agricultural Development (IFAD), the Gambia Emergency Agricultural Production 
Project (GEAPP) was developed in 2009.  
 
The GEAPP is funded by the World Bank as a grant from the European Union Food 
Crisis Response Facility Trust Fund in an amount of 5.3 million Euros. The 
Emergency Agricultural Production Project will focus on: 
 
i.  Increasing access to agricultural inputs and equipment for 20,000 farmers and   
 
667 farmer groups. 
ii.  Increasing post-harvest storage capacity through the rehabilitation of 35  
 
village based facilities. 
iii.  Laying the foundation of a sustainable farmer based seed multiplication.  
iv.  Networking through the rehabilitation of four existing seed multiplication  
 
centres. 
 
The operation will be implemented over an 
18-month period
and is intended to 
increase cereal (millet and rice) production in 
ten (10) 
districts identified as the most 
vulnerable. The ten districts were selected by The Gambia Government and the 
World Bank on the basis of a World Food Programme Report of 2008 as the most 
vulnerable, in terms of food security based on various criteria and factors. 
Page  20
19 
 
These districts are in the following Local Government Areas (LGAs): 
 
Brikama LGA
Mansakonko LGA
Kerewan LGA
Foni Bintang   
Jarra West 
 
 
Lower Nuimi 
Foni 
Kansala 
     Upper 
Nuimi 
Foni Bondali   
 
Jangjanbureh LGA
Basse LGA
Niamina East   
 
 Wuli 
Niani  
 
 
 
Sandu 
 
The estimated population in the 10 districts is 260,000; about 20,000 farmers and 
667 farmers groups will benefit from the project assistance. 
 
Despite the benefits, implementation of the above noted project activities are likely 
to have negative environmental impacts, for example, loss of vegetation, soil 
erosion, land degradation, deforestation and surface water pollution. At the social 
level, the project activities could generate adverse effects such as social conflicts and 
exclusion of vulnerable groups such as women from actively participating in the 
project and having direct access to the agricultural inputs and implements.  
 
It is within this context that this Environmental and Social Management Framework 
(ESMF) was prepared to ensure that potential negative adverse environmental 
impacts and social risks related to project activities are identified and assessed. The 
relevant and appropriate mitigation measures have also been provided to cope with 
these adverse impacts. 
 
1.2 Objectives of the ESMF 
The objectives of the GEAPP Environmental and Social Management Framework 
(ESMF) are: 
·
To identify, assess and manage potential 
negative environmental impacts associated with the project and ensure that 
appropriate mitigating measures are taken. 
·
To establish clear procedures and methods for environmental and social 
planning review and implementation 
·
To specify appropriate roles and responsibilities and outline the necessary 
reporting procedures, for managing and monitoring environmental and social 
concerns related to the Project activities. 
·
To determine the training, capacity building, and technical assistance needed 
to successfully implement the provisions of the ESMF. 
·
To establish the Project funding required to implement the ESMF. 
·
To provide practical information resources for implementing the ESMF. 
Page  21
20 
 
Although the potential environmental and social impacts of the infrastructure 
investments under the project are expected to be generally minimal, potentially 
significant, localised impacts may occur, thus requiring appropriate mitigation 
measures. The potential environmental impacts would be addressed in the context of 
this ESMF. 
 
1.3 Methodology used to prepare the ESMF 
The approaches adopted by the consultant in preparing the ESMF include, review of 
existing literature, consultation with various relevant stakeholders including the 
communities to benefit from the project; field visits and collection of secondary data 
and analysis.  
 
The literature reviewed included the GEAPP and the Gambia Africa Emergency 
Locust Project (AELP) appraisal documents, the Gambia Community Development 
Project ESMF, World Bank Safeguard Policies, GEAPP District and Village Level 
Agricultural Inputs Distribution Plan, GEAPP Seed Production and Supply Plan, 
AELP Environmental Management Plan for Construction / Rehabilitation of 
Pesticide Stores, and AELP Environmental Impact Assessment of Locust Control in 
The Gambia. The Participatory Integrated Watershed Management Project 
(PIWAMP) and Gambia Lowland Development Project (GALDEP) projects were 
also reviewed.  
 
The approach used in preparing the framework was very participatory. All the 
institutions that will be involved in the implementation of the project including the 
technical departments of the Ministry of Agriculture, its extension workers, and the 
National Environment Agency (NEA) were consulted.  
 
We had meetings with institutional stakeholders mainly those concerned directly 
with the project; these include the Project Coordination Unit of the GEAPP, the 
Regional Agricultural Directors (RADs) and their extension workers, the Soil and 
Water Management Unit (SWMU), Plant Protection Services (PPS), and National 
Agricultural Research Institute. A detailed summary of the consultations is shown in 
ANNEX 1. 
 
We also conducted field visits to the sample district in the Western Region viz Foni 
Kansala and had discussions with the Village Development Committees and the 
farmer groups (“kafoos”) in the three villages visited – Dobong, Burock and 
Kampant. The sample represents high, medium and low populated villages 
respectively, in order to assess any variance in issues for consideration. 
 
The data collected were used to support the environmental study that will involve 
many components of the ESMF; including initial screening, impact identification 
and assessment, mitigation measures, legal and institutional framework, management 
and monitoring mechanisms and capacity building. 
 
Page  22
21 
 
1.3.1 Summary of the outcome of the consultations 
All the partners consulted discussed the potential benefits of this project, however, 
some of the environmental and social issues repeatedly raised include: 
i. 
The need for soil conservation that shall prevent future reduction in 
agricultural productivity resulting from increased runoff, erosion, 
sedimentation  
ii. 
The need for sensitization of the relevant extension workers and farmers on 
the required measures for successful implementation of the ESMF treating 
the identified areas of concern. 
iii. 
The GEAPP to consider women with regards ownership as their powers and 
rights are limited due to some cultural and traditional customs.  
iv. 
The need for support from the GEAPP for a successful Project execution and 
specifically related to monitoring of the ESMF implementation. 
v. 
Village Development Committees (VDCs) have vast experience in managing 
and advising villagers on the use and maintenance of communal property. 
However, allocation of farming inputs to farming groups, rather than 
individuals will be the best option in preventing conflict whilst contributing 
towards sustainability.   
vi. 
Proper seed storage is important in increasing agricultural production, thus, 
the rehabilitation of seed stores was highly welcomed. Sensitization on store 
management was also highlighted. 
vii. 
A number of agricultural projects are concurrently being implemented, and in 
some cases, in the same farming villages. Therefore, to avoid confusing the 
farmers, constant collaboration was discussed for cumulative positive 
impacts. 
viii. 
The GEAPP’s provision of free inputs was received with joy by the farmers, 
however, the importance of considering equipment running and maintenance 
costs was mentioned. For sustainability, stakeholders must also plan to 
benefit beyond the Project. 
ix. 
Appropriate timing of farming activities to prevent pest infestations, seed 
spoilage and potential negative impacts linked to borrowing or renting 
animals for farming where farming groups do not own animals and must 
await for owners to finish work in their farms first. 
 
1.3.2 Impact screening 
The principles and method used to evaluate the potential significant impacts  
 
The project activities can present potential risks based on the surrounding 
environment (physical, natural and social) they take place.  
 
The interaction of the hazard of an activity with the sensitivity of the surrounding 
environment leads to an impact. The occurrence and significance of the impact 
depends on level of compatibility of both the type of activity and the type of the 
environment.  
 
The significance of an impact will be characterised as (i) moderate positive, (ii) high 
positive (iii) moderate negative (iv) high negative and (v) no discernible impact, 
considering the combination of various factors including the following: 
Page  23
22 
 
·
The project activities leading to hazards and risks: their nature, magnitude,  
indirect or indirect 
·
The sensitivity of the receptor: for the beneficiaries, for instance, is the 
receptor a woman, child or elderly (considered as more sensitive) or a man? 
Sensitive physical or biological environments? 
·
Temporary scale: Will the impact have effect in the short, medium 
(temporary) or long term (nearly permanently)? 
·
Geographical scale: Does the impact affect one family, one village, one 
region, country, etc? 
·
Are there cumulative minor or localised negative impacts leading to major 
problems? Amongst others. 
 
This screening to evaluate the significance of potential impacts of this Project was 
based largely on expert opinion, information from the consultations and experience 
of similar agricultural projects.  
 
2.0 Project Description and Objectives 
 
The project has three components:  
 
(i) 
Provision of agricultural inputs and equipment 
(ii) 
Rehabilitation of post harvest and seed multiplication infrastructure 
(iii) 
Support to project coordination monitoring and evaluation.  
 
The primary objective of the GEAPP is to enhance productivity and domestic food 
production in the short and medium term in order to increase rural income and 
ensure food security.  
 
About 20,000 farmers and 667 farmers groups in ten districts have been targeted to 
benefit from the project assistance based on the vulnerability of their area to food 
insecurity. 
 
2.1 Provision of Agricultural Inputs and Equipment 
This component will support the provision of agricultural production inputs (seeds 
and fertilizer) to beneficiaries. About 3000 tons of fertilizer (1500 tons of Nitrogen, 
Phosphorus and Potassium - NPK; 1500 tons of urea and 525 tons of certified seeds 
(25 tons early millet seeds and 500 tons of rice seeds) will be purchased and 
distributed to 20,000 millet and rice farmers. This support will cover about 5000 
hectares of rice and is expected to generate, under favourable climate conditions, 
additional 6000 tons of cereal. 
 
The project will also provide pieces of machinery including (power tillers 300, 
seeders and sine-hoes 367). Beneficiaries will be trained by technical departments on 
the use, operation and maintenance of the equipment. The equipment will be given to 
organi
sed village groups (“kafoos”) which already have procedures in place for 
shared use and maintenance of such equipment. This activity will increase labour 
productivity by decreasing the time required for field preparation and weeding.  
Page  24
23 
 
2.2 Rehabilitation of Seed Multiplication and Post Harvest Infrastructure  
2.2.1 Rehabilitation of Seed Multiplication centres  
Three seed centres located in different parts of the country identified by the project 
will be rehabilitated and upgraded by the installation of irrigation facilities, fencing, 
provision of machinery/tools, provision of an operational budget and production 
inputs to engage in all year round seed production. Each centre will be responsible 
for producing the foundation seeds and registered classes of rice and maize seeds for 
the specialised seed grower associations, groups or individuals operating within their 
agricultural area. 
 
The centres will also serve as entry point for new rice and maize varieties released 
by the agricultural research system. 
 
The centre will also serve as model farms where farmers can see the effect of 
recommended crop production practices. The centres will function as training sites 
and field visits by interested training teams within and outside the country. It is 
anticipated that by the end of the second season of production, 12,795 metric tons of 
certified seeds, comprising 781 metric tons of upland rice, 3125 metric tons of maize 
and 8888 metric tons of lowland rice will be available to the farming committees. 
 
2.2.2 Rehabilitation of Village Level Post Harvest / Seed Storage Facilities  
The project will support the rehabilitation of 35 village level storage facilities to 
minimize post harvest losses in the ten districts identified as the most vulnerable. 
The facilities are owned by villages and managed by the Village Development 
Committees. Training on proper storage techniques will be contracted to NARI and 
PPS through MOUs at the beginning of the Project implementation. 
 
2.3 Institutional arrangements for GEAPP implementation 
2.3.1 Project Implementation 
The GEAPP will be implemented by the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) of The 
Gambia’s Africa Emergency Locust Project (GM-AELP) under the Ministry of 
Agriculture.  
 
The organisations and institutions that took part in the 2006 crop loss compensation 
distribution of agricultural inputs will be utilised for the GEAPP agricultural inputs 
distribution as discussed in the 
GEAPP District and Village Level Agricultural 
Inputs Distribution Plan.
 
The Project Coordination Unit will be responsible for procuring and delivering the 
inputs to the regional headquarters. Based on the 
GEAPP District and Village Level 
Agricultural Inputs Distribution Plan
,
the Regional Agricultural Directors will 
facilitate the transportation of the inputs to the villages; the Non-Governmental 
Page  25
24 
 
Organisations (NGOs) contracted by the project will be responsible for distribution 
of inputs at the village levels. 
 
The Village Development Committees (VDCs) and the women farmer groups 
(Kafoos) will participate fully in the distribution of the inputs at the village level. 
The agricultural inputs to be distributed at the village will be based on the 
distribution methods agreed by the VDCs. 
 
2.3.2 Project Coordination and Monitoring  
The GEAPP will provide incremental funds to the PCU for coordination, 
communication, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) activities. This component 
will strengthen the capacity of the PCU to adequately monitor activities and will 
support field staff and partners implementing the project through the provision of 
fuel and office supply amongst others. At the close of the AELP the project will 
absorb the full cost of maintaining the PCU for the life of the GEAPP.  
 
The agricultural services will provide specialised training and technical services to 
farmers. NEA will be responsible for monitoring the environmental impacts to 
ensure that the project is implemented according to the ESMF and environmental 
laws of the Gambia.  
 
3.0 
Biophysical and Socio-economic Environment   of the 
Country 
 
3.1 Biophysical environment 
 
3.1.1 Climate and Vegetation  
The Gambia lies in the Sahelian belt with a sudano-sahelian type of climate 
characterised by a long season from October to early June and a short rainy season 
from mid-June to early October. Rainfall in most parts of the country is about 1020 
mm, ranging from 800 mm in the east to 1700 mm at the western end of the country. 
 
Drought has affected rainfall and for the past 15 years has been creating erratic and 
unexpected rains and in most years reduced rain. With the economy heavily 
dependent on rain fed agriculture, these adverse conditions have resulted in negative 
agricultural production, eroding farmer’s productivity and their purchasing power. 
 
The natural vegetation type is Guinea Savanah woodland in the west and changes 
into typical open Sudan Savanah towards the eastern part of the country. This area is 
characterised by extensive marginal lands with laterite ridges and shallow soils 
unsuitable for crop production.  
 
Along the River Gambia are mangroves; these are found in the central area, and their 
ecosystem has remained stable over the years although now threatened by the 
clearing of swamps for rice cultivation in the rural areas or the cutting down of the 
Page  26
25 
 
mangroves for oyster harvesting and fuelwood. The ESMF shall prevent or reduce 
such activities related to rice cultivation. 
 
3.1.2 Drainage  
Except for a few coastal streams in the Kombo peninsula and Lower Nuimi, natural 
drainage in the Gambia is centred along the River Gambia and its tributaries. As it 
enters the Gambia territory 680 kilometres from the source in the Fouta Dallon 
Highlands in Guinea Conakry, the River Gambia flows generally along an east - west 
axis with 85% of the runoff generated outside The Gambia where larger part of the 
drainage basin is located. 
 
3.1.3 Geology and landscape 
Most of the surface of The Gambia is derived from a sandstone formation known as 
the ‘Continental Terminal’ (Dunsmore et al., 1976). Structurally, it contains layers of 
sandstone mixed with beds of quartz gravel, sand and clay and ironpan layers. 
 
The parent material of the dominant soils of The Gambia is composed predominantly 
of quartz and kaolin which was the result of weathering of the ‘Continental 
Terminal’ formation.  
 
The upper tertiary consists of mainly poor consolidation sandstones which are white 
to pink or red in colour. They are composed of quartz grains with minor amount of 
stable heavy minerals such as ilmenite, zircon, tourmaline, saturolite and rutile. The 
clay stones are commonly kaolintic which are found within the stratigraphic 
sequence sometimes forming thick beds in areas.  
 
3.1.4 Soil  
Four basic elements make up the landscape of the Gambia; flat areas represent the 
recent past composing the flood plan in which alluvial material was deposited. This 
landscape lies adjacent to the main river and its upper tributaries. Narrow bands of 
similar alluvium occur in the depression associated with minor tributaries and are 
subjected to water logging.  
 
Lying above the alluvial flats occur the alluvial slopes being very gently slopy areas 
covered by the alluvial deposits of eroded tertiary plateau. The remainder of the 
terrain comprises a tertiary plateau which two different levels may be distinguished. 
The upper plateau is the dominant element of the landscape in the eastern sector of 
the country. West of Farafenni on the North Bank and Bwiam on the South Bank this 
sector occur only rarely. The lower plateau level is exposed by dissection and 
erosion of the high platen and forms the basic landscape of most of the North Bank 
and Western Regions. Further east, this segment occurs in depression, associated 
with tributary streams. 
 
A
common set of soil characteristics include low cation exchange capacity; low 
inherent fertility; strong consistencies and poorly developed structures; and medium 
to high base saturations.  
Page  27
26 
 
Furthermore, soils of The Gambia are locally classified based on physiographic 
positions into upland, lowland and colluvio-alluvial soils. 
 
The upland soils occur along the plateau and its footslopes. They are freely drained 
soils which have loamy sands and sandy clay to clay loam subsoil. 
 
The lowland soils occur along the banks of the River Gambia and its tributaries. 
They are characterised by hydromorphic properties. They are heavy textured 
consisting of silt loam surface and silty clay or clay subsoil and are poorly drained. 
These areas the generally utilised in swamp rice cultivation.  Between the uplands 
and lowlands are the transitional soils with coarse textured surface that overlies finer 
textured subsoils and are somewhat poorly drained. 
 
3.1.5 Water Resources  
The water resources of The Gambia comprise seasonal rains, ephemeral ponds, 
depression storage and the perennial main River Gambia as well as the two aquifer 
systems underlie the entire Country. 
3.1.5.1 Surface Water   
 
Rainfall in The Gambia is generally between the months of June and October with 
maximum precipitation occurring in August. Over the past three decades, reduction 
in rainfall has resulted in current drought years. The mean annual rainfall in 1968 of  
1, 1000mm now stands at 900 mm. 
 
The River Gambia is tidal throughout its length within the estuarine zone distinct, 
particularly in the eastern-most part of the country. Despite large areas, The 
Gambia’s basin section contributes little to the flow of the river. The bulk of the flow 
is derived from the headwater regions and middle basin in Guinea and Senegal, 
which together form 86 percent of the basin. 
3.1.5.2 Ground Water   
 
Exploitable ground water occurs in the shallow sandstone and the deep sandstone 
aquifers separated by marls, clay and argillaceous limestone. Both aquifers occur 
throughout the country. In some places the shallow aquifer consists of two units, the 
phreatic occurring depths between 10 and 30 meters below ground level, and semi-
confined at depth between 40 and 120 meters. The deep sandstone aquifer occurs at 
depth exceeding 250 meters and is estimated to hold reserves of low quality water in 
the order of 80km
3. 
The other is estimated to hold about 0.125 km
3
of good quality 
water. 
 
3.1.6 Wildlife 
Wildlife in the Gambia is of vast variety, although diversity is reducing and some 
species only remain in small populations at limited areas. The main treats to wildlife 
are hunting, impacts from destruction of habitats or movement paths, and sometimes 
killings for farm and farmer protection. 
 
Page  28
27 
 
Reserves and national parks have been designated as legally protected areas in an 
aim to preserve diversity, encourage wildlife population growth for scientific stidies, 
education and tourism purposes. Under this ESMF, extension workers will be 
sensitised on the need to prevent encroachment for farming activities within these 
areas of ecological significance. 
 
3.2 Socio - Economic Environment  
3.2.1 Health 
 The health service delivery system in The Gambia is three tier based on the Primary 
Health Care Strategy. Currently, there are five hospitals across the country, six major 
health centres and thirty-two minor health facilities. At the primary (community) 
level 492 health posts exist. The public service delivery is complimented by NGO 
and private run facilities (Ministry of Health, 2009). 
 
One of the goals of the Gambian health policy is to empower communities to be 
active partners in managing their health. Thus, the GEAPP ESMF bears in mind 
potential risks to health from inappropriate use of pesticides, use of equipment and 
potential diseases of water associated with swamp rice farming. 
 
3.2.2 Population growth and Distribution   
The Gambia’s population stood at 1.3 million people in 2003 according to the 
Population and Housing Census Report. The age distribution of the population 
continued to skew towards the younger age bands. Those aged 0-15 years comprise 
about 44 percent of the total population. This has a lot of implication in the provision 
of social services and distribution of meagre resources in the economy.  
 
Women constitute 51 percent of the population and provide most of the labour in rice 
and horticultural production. However, they are a vulnerable group and have limited 
access to land when it comes to ownership.

3.2.3 Agriculture, Livestock Production and Marketing 
Nearly 75 percent of the rural population of The Gambia are employed in 
agriculture. This sector c
ontributes between 20 to 33 percent to the country’s GDP. 
The agricultural sector is characterized by subsistence production of rain fed food 
crops (coarse grain, rice etc) semi-intensive cash crop production (groundnut and 
horticultural production) and traditional livestock raising. Farming systems in The 
Gambia are characterized by a wide range of production and cropping patterns; the 
two farming systems are upland and low land. The upland system involves crops 
such as groundnut, millet, sorghum, maize and horticultural crops as well as 
livestock husbandry. The lowland rainfall farming system is predominantly rice 
based (swamp rice) and is mainly done by women.  
 
Several environmental factors affect agricultural production. Irrational utilisation of 
resources including soil, vegetation cover and water resources are only a few. The 
traditional nature of production puts little or no emphasis on environmental 
management. Land degradation, deforestation, water use, agrochemical utilisation 
and salination significantly reduce agricultural production.   
 
According to the Agriculture and Natural Resources Policy, on-farm maize yields 
have declined due to low fertility of the upland soils, coupled with inadequate 
application of fertilizers, mainly due to lack of knowledge and inadequate access to 
the input because of its relatively high costs
.
The full potential of the crop could be 
fully exploited if there are quality seeds, fertilizers and farm implements in addition 
to proper post-harvest processing. 
 
Key constraints in swamp rice production relate to timely operations, access to 
swamp land, salt intrusion and low input use.  
 
Upland rice production has great prospects owing to the introduction of the New 
Rice for Africa (NERICA – a drought tolerant rice variety) into the farming system 
of the country in 2005.  
Availability of farming equipment and functioning infrastructure are issues in most 
of the villages. Seed stores are completely out of use due to structural damage or are 
used to temporarily store non agricultural property which can resist the effects of 
dampness and pests. From the visits, disused agricultural equipment and harvested 
plants for local drinks were mainly found in the stores. Even though the plants will 
be cooked before consumption, potential agrochemical contamination was likely as 
the store might have been previously used to store seeds dressed in pesticides. 
Some of the problems of the existing seed stores include pest infestations such as 
termites and rodents, missing or leaking roofs and cracks in walls. 
 
Although the farmers discussed the importance of proper seed stores, none of the 
sample villages had plans to rehabilitate them. The issue of sustainability was always 
raised to ensure that if a store is chosen for rehabilitation by the GEAPP, at least the 
VDCs must maintain them hence they have ownership. 
 
The stores are strategically located for ease of access and security, however, one of 
the stores visited was right adjacent to an occupied residence. The topography 
around stores might have also changed over time allowing soil deposition from the 
Page  30
29 
 
uplands and this also means that easy access of rain water into stores in lower 
grounds. 
 
The GEAPP shall positively contribute in dealing with these shortcomings in the 
villages of intervention.  
 
3.2.4 Forestry 
–
human linkages 
The forests of The Gambia are important with multiple functions, particularly those 
of subsistence needs for the rural communities. 
 
The upland forests provide fuel wood energy, construction and building materials, 
food and local medicine for both rural and urban settlement. The forests contribute 
significantly to the socio-economic development of the country by providing 
resources, job opportunities and income.  
 
The coastal forest, including the mangrove forests, provide the local communities 
with wood products for construction and energy. The coastal forests also provide 
protection against coastal and river bank erosion and breeding grounds for many 
varieties of fish, oysters, and other sea mammals. The mangroves which provide  
natural habitat for oysters also provide many communities, mostly women, with 
some source of subsistence through sale of the mangroves plant, fuel wood and 
oysters. 
 
3.2.5  Land Tenure and Property Rights  
Property rights and land tenure provide equal incentives to all for improved land 
management. The State Lands Act of 1990 and the Land Acquisition and 
Compensation Act, 1990, which takes care of land tenure and property rights, has a 
caution land acquisition plan. The Act designates State Lands in Banjul, the Kanifing 
Municipality, Kombo South, Kombo Central and Kombo North to be administrated 
by the State rather than by districts authority. Women in rural areas have limited 
access to the ownership of land.  
 
3.2.6 Women in development 
In the Gambian society in general and particularly in the rural settings, there is 
conservation about issues that concern women. There is gradual advancement and 
national laws and policies are incorporating women issues as stated in the 
international conventions adopted by The Gambia.  
 
The Women’s Federation has also been established to help bring to the forefront 
concerns of women across the Country. There are also financial credit systems such 
as those by the Village Savings and Credit Agency and the Gambia Women’s 
Financial Association put in place to encourage improvement in the economic power 
of women, thus subsequently, build capacity to control their lives and natural 
environments. Special education programmes also encourage girls to attend formal 
schooling in an aim to prepare them for decision making. Gender considerations are 
included in the important national development guides Poverty Reduction Strategy 
Page  31
30 
 
Papers and Vision 2020: The Gambia Incorporated. However, positive difference can 
only be meaningful if started at the grassroots. 
 
The GEAPP recognises the importance of gender mainstreaming and will be 
working with women farming groups, especially in rice growing, at village and 
association levels. Their vulnerability to ownership of land and property has been 
discussed with various stakeholders and the ESMF, in line with the Project’s input 
distribution plan, recommends the use of farming groups for combined capacity.  
 
3.2.7  Education 
The Government of the Gambia has education as one its priority areas and has put 
efforts in various means to quality education is accessible to all. Education projects 
have supported in teacher training, adult and non-formal education and tertiary 
education amongst many others. Access to schools is not a concern anymore 
according to the National Planning Commission (2010). 
 
In the local government areas where the Project districts fall, there are currently 21 
schools in the three districts of Brikama LGA; 25 in the two districts of Janjanbureh 
LGA; 33 in the two districts of Basse LGA; 10 in the only district of Mansakonko 
and 46 in the two districts of Kerewan LGA. The majority of schools are lower 
basic.  
During the consultations, the project impacts discussed included more income and 
less need for labour, hence children will be released to attend school.

4.0 
LegislatVe, Policy and Institutional Framework for the 
GEAPP ESMF 
4.1 Gambian legislation  
In order to have a thorough appreciation of the institutional mandates, the various 
pieces of legislation that concern the environmental issues of the Gambia Emergency 
Agricultural Production Project will be highlighted with a view of indicating the 
mandates, legal requirements and standards that the framework should consider. 
 
4.1.1 
National Environment Management Act (NEMA), 1994 
The National Environment Management Act (NEMA) was enacted in 1994 to carry 
out its duty of environmental protection and management. The NEMA empowers the 
NEA with powers to: 
 
·
establish criteria for environmental quality 
·
set the standards for environmental quality for effluent discharges and solid  
waste disposal  
·
identify materials, processes and wastes that are dangerous to human or  
animal health and the environment, and recommend to the NEMC to make 
regulations and establish guidelines for the management of materials, 
processes and wastes. 
·
prepare guidelines for managing environmental disasters including those of  
major oil spills, gas leakages, and spills of other hazardous substances. The 
NEA has powers to decide who would be responsible for any clean up and 
generally what should be done when such discharges take place. 
·
appoint environmental inspectors who are empowered, among other things,  
to take samples of articles or substances which the Act prescribes and submit 
them for testing or analysis; and to carry out periodic inspections of 
establishments whose activities are likely to significantly impact on the 
environment.  
 
To coordinate management of the environment in a holistic manner, the NEA 
operates the following interlinked programmes:  
·
Environmental Impact Assessment  
·
Agriculture and Natural Resources 
Management 
·
Disaster Preparedness and Contingency 
Planning 
·
Environmental Quality 
·
Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides 
Control and Management 
·
Elimination of Ozone Depleting 
Substances

Environmental Information Systems 
4.1.1.2 Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) 
According to Part V of the NEMA 1994, an EIA should be required for such types of 
project. Once the concept for the project is decided, the developer of the project shall 
be required to submit a project brief to the National Environmental Agency (NEA). 
The project brief is accompanied by a duly completed screening form; based on the 
information on the brief and screening form, NEA will decide if an environmental 
impact study is required and will provide the terms of reference for it. 
 
If after considering the project brief, the agency in consultation with the lead 
department (Ministry of Agriculture in this case) is of the view that the proposed 
project will not have significant adverse impacts on the environment, it may approve 
the project. 
 
If the NEA determines that the project may have a significant impact on the 
environment, it shall require that an environmental impact study be made in 
accordance with the provisions of the NEMA 1994. 
 
Where the NEA has determined that an environmental impact study be conducted, it 
shall prepare terms of reference for the developer to undertake the study and produce 
an environmental impact statement on completing the study.  
 
Projects are classified ‘A’ meaning a full EIA study is required; temporarily ‘B’ 
when more information is required to make a decision; and ‘C’ where a full EIA 
study is not required although approval may be with conditions. Considering the 
environmental and social issues of the GEAPP, the World Bank has categorized it B 
which is equivalent to a Class C according to procedures of the Gambia. Although 
very major negative impacts are not anticipated, the development of this ESMF shall 
guide implementers in protecting the environment. 
 
To guide the process, the 
EIA Procedures
 and
 EIA Guidelines 
were developed
 
summarising expectations by all parties during the different stages of the process. 
The EIA Guidelines have specific outline for agricultural projects. 
 
4.1.2 Public Health Act, 1990 
The Public Health Act was enacted to make provision for public and environmental 
health and related matters. The Act empowers the Minister of Health to make 
regulations relating to the collection, removal and sanitary disposal of rubbish, night 
soil and other offending matter. The Act also mandates the Director of Health 
Services, who heads the Department of Public Health (DPH), inter alia, to abate 
nuisances and to remove or correct any condition that may be injurious to public 
health. 
 
Page  35

.1.3 Local Government Act 2002 
The act was enacted in 2002 to establish and regulate a decentralised local 
government system for the Gambia. It makes provision for the functions, powers and 
duties of local authorities and for matters connected therewith.  According to Part II 
of the act, the Gambia is demarcated into divisions (now regions), areas, cities and 
municipalities. 
 
Part IV establishes the powers and functions of local Government institutions which 
includes among other things the provision of agricultural services to the communities 
within its jurisdiction in accordance with national policy guidelines. 
 
Part V establishes the functions of the councils in planning and implementing social 
services programmes and projects for general welfare of the community. Part V 
continued to establish a Village Development Committee for each village or cluster 
of villages.  
 
4.2 Policies 
 
4.2.1 
The Gambia Environmental Action Plan 
The Gambia Environmental Action Plan is a framework for continuous 
policy planning and decision making on national environmental issues and 
natural resource management. Environmental Impact Assessment is one of 
the tools used to achieve the objectives of the Action Plan.  
 
Its participatory approach considered inter-sectoral issues in implementing 
policy objectives to: 
·
Evaluate state of The Gambia environment 
·
Promote rational use of natural resources for sustainable development 
·
Improve health and quality of life through environmental management 
·
Preserve or restore balance of ecosystems 
·
Strengthen relevant institutions for better management and coordination 
·
Encourage use of renewable energy and include environmental strategies in 
other government development policies and activities 
 
4.2.2 The Second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP II) 2007-2011 
Poverty varies greatly across multiple dimensions and there is need for urgent action 
approached through broad-based policies at sectoral levels. Priorities include rapid 
economic growth and poverty reduction; higher output of productive sector; more 
coverage of basic services and security; enhance local community governance; and 
mainstream cross-cutting issues. The PRSP is also based on the Millennium 
Development Goals and Vision 2020: The Gambia Incorporated.  
 
Mid-term review of the PRSP II, amongst others, indicates that M&E systems differ 
and are not necessarily based on existing strategies. Therefore, it is difficult to 
Page  36
35 
 
measure effectiveness of various sector projects such as the GEAPP. The Ministry of 
Agriculture has the responsibility to report GEAPP activities to the National 
Planning Commission.  
 
4.2.2 
Agriculture and Natural Resources Sector Policy 2009-2015 
Poverty causes and problems in the country have been found to be largely rural and 
agrarian based. Thus, making it the most dominant sector at the centre of the 
planning and implementation of poverty reduction strategies in the country.  
 
The agriculture and natural resources sector has high potential to achieve food 
security, increase incomes, generate employment and foreign exchange earnings. 
These strengths have positioned the sector to be central to 
the country’s economic 
growth and development, and as such, it has been identified as a prime sector for 
investments to reduce poverty, meet the Vision 2020 objectives and the MDG 1 
“....to halve the proportion of the poor and those who suffer from hunger.”  
 
A
clear policy framework would be necessary to provide a logical basis for the 
planning, support to, and management of the sector for the contributions it should 
make towards poverty reduction and economic growth. Unfortunately, the sector 
does not possess any such governance instrument presently, hence, need for urgent 
endorsement of this policy by Parliament. 
 
4.3 Institutional Framework for the GEAPP ESMF Implementation 
4.3.1 The National Environment Agency 
The National Environment Management Act, 1994, required the establishment of a 
governing body, National Environment Management Council (NEMC), and the 
National Environment Agency (NEA). To supplement these bodies, technical 
working groups and committees were also created under the Act that would be 
charged with the duty of caring for the environment in its many facets.  
 
The NEMC is chaired by the President of The Gambia and has Ministers from 
related institutions as members. The NEMC approves environmental policies to be 
enacted, promotes the integration of environmental considerations into all aspects of 
social and economic planning, oversees the NEA and adopts relevant guidelines and 
regulations. In environmental impact assessment, the NEMC makes the final 
decision in examination of proceedings where the NEA fails to resolve conflicts as a 
result of claimed unfair or discriminatory procedures.  
 
The NEA is the principle institution responsible for the management of the 
environment on behalf of the Government. It is semi-autonomous and has powers to 
enforce specific legislation under its purview. With regards environmental impact 
assessment, NEA coordinates, administers and supervises the process with 
participation from government departments, the public, non-governmental 
organisations and independent technical experts. 
 
Page  37
36 
 
The NEA is headed by an Executive Director, and its ten programme areas 
mentioned in section 4.1.1 are coordinated by Senior Programme and Programme 
Officers under supervision of Directors of the Technical Services Network and the 
Inter-sectoral Network. Environmental Inspectors also exist to monitor compliance 
and advice the public. NEA has recently decentralised and operates offices in all the 
administrative areas of the Country as in figure 1. The regional officers shall be 
instrumental in the monitoring of this ESMF. 
 
As environmental management requires holistic approaches, the programmes are 
supported by Working Groups comprising of relevant institutions, and on ad hoc 
basis, Technical Advisory Committees reflecting specific expertise for advising the 
NEA on issues of national environmental importance.  
 
4.3.2 Local 
Government 
Part II of the Local Government Act, 2002, establishes the Area Councils, Municipal 
Councils and City Council to plan and provide social services to the communities. 
They are bodies corporate with powers to sue and be sued. They represent central 
government at localised levels and are currently headed by Mayors and Governors 
with support from Chief Executive Officers. 
 
The Village Development Committees were also established to be responsible of 
identifying local development needs and prioritising such needs in consultation with 
the villagers. The VDC is responsible for implementing and managing village 
development projects including the GEAPP and other programs. The VDC is also 
responsible for raising co-ordinating and managing financial resources at the village 
level and are also held accountable for such resources. 
 
4.4.3 The Ministry of Agriculture 
The Ministry of Agriculture is headed by a Deputy Minister who reports to the Head 
of State who is the Ministry of Agriculture. The Deputy Minister is supported by two 
Permanent Secretaries and three Deputy Permanent Secretaries. The Department of 
Agricultural Services is head by a Director General supported by six Regional 
Agricultural Directors and nine deputy directors heading nine technical service units. 
Those directly related to the ESMF include the Plant Protection Services, 
Department of Planning, Soil and Water Management Unit, National Agricultural 
Research Institute and the 
Agricultural Engineering Services.
 
Each Regional Agricultural Director (RAD) heads a regional agricultural directorate 
which consists of Principal Agricultural Officers from the various technical units and 
other support staff ranging from senior agricultural officers to District Agricultural 
Development officers and village agricultural development promoters. The District 
Agricultural Development officer is based at the District level and he/she supervises 
several Village agricultural development promoters and animal traction instructors. 
 
Page  38
37 
 
The Ministry of Agriculture is also the executing agency for a number of projects, 
including the GEAPP. The GEAPP Project Steering Committee is responsible for 
overall coordination whilst the PCU and its specialist staff shall have implementing 
and monitoring roles under this ESMF. 
 
4.4.4 Non- Governmental Organisations (NGOs) 
NGOs are involved in a wide range of projects at all levels in the Country and are 
coordinated by the Association of Non-Governmental Organisations and the NGO 
Affairs Agency. NGOs shall be recruited to implement at field level, particularly, 
distribution of inputs. 
 
4.4 World Bank Safeguard Policy 
Environmental Assessment is one of the environmental, social, and legal Safeguard 
Policies of the World Bank and has been triggered by the GEAPP. OP 4.01 
Environmental Assessment, is used in the World to identify, avoid, and mitigate the 
potential negative environmental impacts associated with their operations and 
projects irrespective of location. It is helps to determine if other safeguard policies, 
which are more specific, are likely to be triggered as well. 
 
In World Bank operations, the purpose of Environmental Assessment is to improve 
decision making, to ensure that project options under consideration are sound and 
sustainable, and that potentially affected people have been properly consulted. The 
interrelated issues considered include natural environment, human health, social 
aspects, and transboundary aspects. 
 
World Bank Category B projects examine the project’s potential negative and 
positive environmental impacts and recommends any measures needed to prevent, 
minimize, mitigate,or compensate for adverse impacts and improve environmental 
performance. As all potential impacts are considered, it is similar to category A 
projects, however, at a narrower scale. 
 
It is a requirement under OP4.01 to disclose environmental assessment reports 
publicly in-country and sent to World Bank as per BP 17.50. 
 
Based on its safeguard policies, the World Bank has concluded that this Project does 
not need a full EIA study and categorized it ‘B’ as the impacts are localised and 
limited. However, the ESMF shall guide in mitigating the low impacts.  
 
The focus of this ESMF is on these potential negative environmental and social 
impacts to comply with OP 4.01. 
 
Page  39

5.0 ENVIRONMENTAL and social Assessment of GEAPP 
5.1 Environmental and Social Screening Process 
The environmental evaluation aims to bring into focus, for the purposes of ensuring 
that the project is executed in an environmentally sound manner, all important 
environmental and social issues taken into consideration. Its findings are intended to 
assist in decision-making processes involved in project implementation.  
 
Environmental screening is a preliminary environmental assessment which is carried 
out at a conceptual stage of a project in order to identify the main environmental and 
social issues that can be expected. This involves making a preliminary determination 
of the expected impacts of a proposed project on the environment and their relative 
significance. The extent of environmental management intervention shall be based 
on the outcome of the screening. 
 
The aim of such study is that environmental and social considerations can be 
integrated into the design as much as possible at the conceptual stage. This is a 
preventive measure, which aims to prevent or minimise the negative impacts of the 
project.  
 
Reactive measures (as opposed to preventive measures) are aimed at mitigating (or 
compensating) negative impacts from a project after the design has been completed 
or during project implementation. Preventive measures (such as measures which can 
be integrated into the implementation plan) are preferred to reactive measures. The 
mitigation measures may be more numerous, the costs of such measures may be 
higher, and, in worst case scenarios, the project could fail if an important 
environmental or social element is omitted in the implementation plan.  
 
The advantages of the assessment are therefore to: 
y
Gain stakeholders’ involvement, participation and ownership; 
y
Identify potential environmental and social impacts to ensure optimal and timely   
 
control of any risks associated with such impacts. 
 
The objectives of environmental assessments are to identify and exploit 
environmental opportunities and benefits of a proposed project; manage negative 
impacts and ensure that project activities comply with relevant standards and 
legislation at the national and international levels. Like this ESMF, it is important to 
formulate practical, time-bound and cost-effective recommendations to mitigate any 
potential significant adverse environmental and social impacts that could arise during 
construction and operations. 
 
5.2 GEAPP Level of Assessment 
This study is carried out at an early stage of the project, that is, a time when the exact 
locations where the inputs will be used are not determined. The districts are 
identified and the villages to benefit from the project but the beneficiary farms or 
farmer groups are not yet identified. At this stage of the project the main focus of the 
project concept is presented. The environmental assessment will be in line with this 
project stage and will aim at providing measures for the implementation of the 
project and guidance for continuous evaluation during monitoring. 
Page  40

5.3 The screening process and roles for screening 
The screening checklist employed for this ESMF was adopted from the standard 
Environmental Impact Assessment Screening form of the NEA. As most of the 
information regarding project description, activities and products are already known for 
the GEAPP, the potential environmental impacts to be considered shall be based on 
biological, physical and socio-economic environments with regards exact sites and 
boundaries.  Although farmers may extend their land without informing the Village 
Agricultural Development Promoters (VADPs), constant monitoring shall encourage 
timely intervention should there be any new concerns. 
 
The VADPs and farmers shall complete the screening checklist and identify applicable 
impacts. It is important that farmers participate in the screening, otherwise the necessary 
information cannot be obtained. In this way, they are also sensitised on issues to bear in 
mind during work. The screening always takes place before any activity commences so 
that recommended alternatives may be incorporated before actual implementation. 
 
The checklist shall be reviewed by the Regional Programme Officer and a 
recommendation for classification, including justification, is made in collaboration with 
the Programme Officer for Environmental Impact Assessment as required under the 
National Environment Management Act, 1994. This has to be endorsed by the NEA 
Executive Director.  Due to time constraints, and to ensure efficiency, it is recommdnded 
that the VADPs and NEA shall compare completed checklists with the general one in 
Chapter 6 of this ESMF, and where issues score below those in the general checklist, 
recommendation for alternative sites should be advised. This is evident hence activities 
shall not change, but impacts may differ based on specific characteristics of a site. 
Otherwise, the sites should be approved, noting that other considerations such as 
activities effects have already been given consideration under the ESMF and do not 
change. Furthermore, the screening should be performed in numbers at a time to ensure 
fast tracking as individual submissions are likely to face administrative delays and 
cropping seasons rely heavily on the rainy season which commences soon. 
 
Once the Executive Director of NEA makes a decision on the classification, 
implementation may proceed.  
 
According to the World Bank’s OP4.01, category B projects vary in impacts from site to 
site, thus, GEAPP activities may require more studies, environmental impact 
assessment, based on specific sites. Category B may require limited scope EIA whose 
terms of reference will be developed by the EIA Programme Officer at NEA and a 
consultant sought by the PCU to carry out the study. This will be validated by the multi -
sectoral EIA Working Group then a decision made to reject, approve with or without 
conditions of implementation. As in this ESMF, identified mitigation measures shall be 
accompanied by corresponding parties for implementation and those responsible for 
monitoring.  
 
In The Gambia, Class B means more information is required to make a decision – 
towards full study (A) or direct approval (C). However, Class C may still come with 
conditions rather than no environmental work as per WB procedures. Class A for both 
means major negative impacts and full EIA study.

The two systems have little differences which can be harmonised for better 
understanding, yet still compliance to both. It is recommended that the training of 
technical officers consider and treat this issue extensively.

Upon implementation of the project, monitoring as proposed in Chapter 8 will help to 
ensure all GEAPP intervention are environmentally sound. The NEA, various players 
under Ministry of Agriculture, contractors and farmers have responsibilities in 
implementation of mitigation measures or monitoring.  
 
5.3.2.Screening and subsequent monitoring indicators 
·
Target trainees receive their training before implementation 
·
Evidence of best practice in the way farmers work as compared to present 
·
Water quality does not degrade below that of the baselines to be established 
·
Safe waste management related to construction and equipment use 
·
Soil conservation translates to reduced gullies and depositions 
·
Communities are stable compared to history with regards land use, ownership 
and input distribution 
 
5.4 Selection Process of Beneficiaries 
The GEAPP District and Village Level Agricultural Inputs Distribution Plan (2010) 
used the following targeting criteria:
 
Page  42
41 
 
District / Village Level
·
Population 
–
consideration was given to the active farmers involved in the 
cultivation of early millet, upland and lowland rice as these were the seeds 
intended for distribution to the farmer beneficiaries. The district and village 
populations were also taken into consideration 
·
Land Availability - farmers to benefit from these inputs should be active in 
farming and have access to land. For early millet farmers beneficiaries must 
cultivate a minimum of 0.5 ha and 0.25 ha for upland and lowland rice. 
·
Ecology and Production Specialization – district/village involvement in early 
millet, upland and lowland rice production was taken into account.  
·
Production Capacities 
–
beneficiaries must have the capacity to mobilise 
adequate labour to be able to put the recommended crop production practices 
to allow maximising output. 
·
Extent to which villages benefited from AELP Crop Loss Compensation 
packages and CDDP interventions in the area of food security was also 
considered. 
·
Care was taken to avoid distribution to villages involved in The Gambia 
Government 
–
Taiwan upland rice expansion project which has similar 
objectives. 
·
Vulnerability of districts as described by the 2008 WFP Report was also 
considered. 
·
Another criteria employed in this exercise was the quantity of inputs 
available from the project i.e. 525 tons of seeds and 3000 tons of fertilizer. 
 
Household Level
·
Active farming population/available household; these are farmers who are 
active in the cultivation of early millet, upland or lowland rice. 
·
Poverty level –poor farmers with not less than 0.5ha under cultivation were 
deliberately targeted for early millet. 
·
Priority should be given to rice women rice farmers with access to farm land 
not less than 0.25ha. 
·
Existence of cohesive women farmer groups (particularly women “kafoos”) 
should also be taken into consideration.

6.2 Description of Main Environmental Impacts of the GEAPP 
6.2.1 Potential Positive Impacts  
·
The main aim of the Project is to enhance crop yield. Therefore, it is expected 
that the various activities will contribute towards increased harvest for 
beneficiaries and subsequently more income. 
·
Sensitization programmes under the GEAPP ESMF will assist in more 
understanding of farming activity timing, soil conservation and integrated 
pest management, thus, preventing environmental degradation and also 
avoiding sensitive areas. 
·
During the consultations, the project impacts discussed included more 
income and less need for physical labour, hence children will be released to 
attend school.
 
6.2.2 Potential Negative Impacts 
Negative Impacts on the Physical Environment
The provision of farming implements such as power tillers, sine hoes and seeders to the 
farmers could have negative impacts on the physical environment. If these implements 
are not used properly they could encourage erosion especially when the topography 
consists of steep slopes and sandy soils. Deep tillage makes the soil more erodible and, 
thus, more soil will be carried downstream. This may result to gully formation which 
can change the landscape of the area in extreme circumstances. It may also carry 
sediments downstream to the lowlands, thus, covering the fertile lowland and rendering 
it unproductive or reduce its productivity. 
 
In almost all the villages visited, runoff water was a problem; gullies are observed and 
the farmers expressed their concerns on the issue of controlling erosion. The consultant 
concluded that the supply of farming implements should be preceded by training on soil 
and water conservation techniques such as contour farming and the creation of 
diversions. The extension workers at the village level should be trained and they in turn 
train farmers. 
 
The availability of free inputs and equipment could encourage farmers to expand the 
land to be cultivated. This expansion could encroach into forest or sites of cultural 
significance unless controlled by full implementation of the ESMF. 
 
Negative Impacts on the Biological Environment
Over application of fertiliser could lead to the pollution of surface water bodies. Such 
pollution could affect aquatic organisms such as fish. Many of the villages to benefit 
from the project are situated close to the River Gambia or one of its tributaries. Due to 
the runoff volumes, most of the fertiliser could be washed away into water bodies unless 
soil and water conservation techniques are implemented. Farmers also need to be 
trained on the right application rates to avoid over application. Movement of wildlife 
and livestock for food and water could be affected indirectly, if their paths are badly 
affected by erosion. 
 
Page  45
44 
 
Negative Impacts on the Socio-economic Environment
The issue of giving the implements and inputs for free is expected to cause instability in 
the community. In all our consultations with the farmers the issue of the quantities to be 
given came up and whether or not it will be ‘enough’ for everyone. The fact that it is 
free makes distribution very difficult because community members that do not have 
allocations will be dissatisfied with the project and this could be a source of conflict 
among community members. 
 
Women also fear that unless a specified amount is allocated to them, men may take 
everything or most of it. The implements that are to be issued without the draft animals 
to operate them is another constraint. This means only those with draft animals can have 
them. Most of these people already have some implements and giving them another one 
could lead to them selling one. Giving these implements to people without animals will 
also mean they borrow or hire animals from the owners. They will only get animals 
when the owners are ready with their work. This will have a significant negative impact 
on timely cultivation which will invariably affect productivity. Timely cultivation is 
also a method of integrated pest management in view of the fact that pesticides are not 
issued as part of the project. 
 
To mitigate this important social impact, the VDCs shall participate in identifying 
beneficiaries based on the criteria indicated in the approved Inputs Distribution Plan 
for the Project with focus on farmer groups. In order to ensure sustainability of 
operation and equitable distribution we recommend token cost recovery from farmers 
to be managed by the VDCs, where individual farmers are benefiting. 
 
The availability of free inputs and equipment could free up some cash with the 
farmers and they may spend that on pesticides in view of the fact that pesticides are 
not part of the project. Farmers may buy pesticides that are banned or not 
recommended which may lead to negative environmental impacts.  
 
To mitigate this potential impact, farmers need to be sensitised on integrated pest 
management including continuous and timely monitoring of pest.

8.0  MONITORING AND EVALUATION OF THE ESMF 
8.1 Monitoring and Evaluation 
Monitoring of the ESMF implementation is essential in ensuring the project is 
environmentally sound, by checking that the recommended mitigation measures have 
been carried out effectively in a timely manner.  
 
Monitoring also helps in evaluating whether the measures recommended are 
adequate in preventing, reducing or compensating the identified negative impacts. 
Efficiency of the ESMF implementers and implementation structures should also be 
reviewed and the necessary changes made accordingly. 
 
The main issues to be monitored include the 
activities
 that have earlier been 
identified to have potential significant negative impacts on environmental 
parameters, society and the economy. All activities of the GEAPP must be 
considered in relation to traditional activities and similar projects in the beneficiary 
villages as it is impossible to consider some impacts in isolation when their effects 
result from a combination of factors. 
 
Monitoring and evaluation of the ESMF will be mainstreamed in the general 
monitoring system of the GEAPP at various levels.  
 
The VADPs shall monitor the ESMF implementation at local level whilst they will in 
turn be monitored by the National Environment Agency Regional Programme 
Officer. To ensure proper coordination at field level, we propose Regional 
Environment Coordination Teams headed by the NEA to coordinate the general 
implementation of the ESMF.  The team shall comprise the NEA Regional 
Programme Officer and Regional Agricultural Directorate (DADO and Plant 
Protection specialist). 
 
It is the responsibility of the GEAPP Monitoring and Evaluation Officer to ensure 
that all involved stakeholders are facilitated as requested to monitor the ESMF 
implementation. Memorandums of Understanding should be developed in this 
respect. Notwithstanding, random joint monitoring is recommended at an early stage 
to ensure consistency. 
 
It is recommended that an independent environmental auditor be contracted to 
undertake a midterm performance review to prevent bias in reporting and 
recommend any necessary corrective measures on time.   
 
8.2 Reporting 
Effective communication between the local monitors and the NEA and PCU is 
essential.  
 
Monthly reporting of monitoring and evaluation results is recommended from the 
VADPs to the PCU through the Regional Environment Coordination Team.

The PCU shall in turn evaluate the reports and facilitate immediate improvement 
considering the short length of the project duration.  
 
The independent environmental auditor shall review the ESMF implementation from 
the beneficiary level to the local monitors and PCU levels.

9.0 CAPACITY ENHANCEMENT AND TRAINING 
REQUIREMENTS 
 
During the study, a number of shortcomings were raised that may affect the 
implementation of the ESMF, and as a result a programme of environmental 
management training and institutional capacity enhancement is recommended for 
effective implementation.  
 
9.1 Environmental Training and Sensitisation 
Training and sensitisation will be required at all levels: Monitoring and Evaluation 
Officers of the GEAPP, RADs, VADPs, NEA Regional Programme Officers, NEA 
Regional Environmental Inspectors, Community Development Assistants and 
beneficiary farmers. 
 
The PCU shall collaborate with the relevant institutions for the required specialists to 
deliver a range of technical training on environmental and social management issues 
to the target groups. The VADPs shall carry out step down sensitisation sessions for 
the farmers.  
 
Capacity building in environmental knowledge for the identified technical partners 
shall include training on: 
·
environmental laws and regulations to give a background on the requirements 
they are expected to contribute towards 
·
importance of the ESMF and the need for timely implementation to ensure 
successful project whilst preserving the environment for future generations 
·
completing and evaluating screening and monitoring checklists giving particular 
attention to classification and categorization based on WB and Gambian 
procedures. 
·
understanding issues related to all potential adverse impacts and corresponding 
mitigation measures 
·
basic community development concepts to other interrelated issues do not 
negatively affect the GEAPP and its ESMF implementations 
·
means of keeping to reporting expectations 
·
store management including stock control and control of contamination 
·
monitoring techniques  
·
effective means for sensitisation and communication  
·
means of collaborating with other projects to avoid conflicts  
 
VDCs and Farmers will be sensitised and given practical demonstrations on all 
mitigation measures for their implementation and general community development. 
These include, good practice in farming to conserve soil properties, equipment 
utilisation and maintenance, integrated pest management and waste disposal.  
 
9.2 Capacity Enhancement 
In addition to human resources, there is some capacity at all levels to implement the 
mitigation measures of this ESMF, however, as understood during the consultations, 
Page  61
60 
 
there is limited resources in the implementing institutions, which needs enhancement 
for success.  
 
For both the Department of Agriculture Regional Agricultural Centres and National 
Environment Agency Regional Offices, support is required to supplement resources 
for monitoring and reporting. The agricultural technical units such as NARI and PPS 
may also be supported for effective implementation. A sample baseline survey of 
water quality in target areas has also been proposed by the SWMU and Department 
of Water Resources.  
 
9.3 ESMF Implementing BudgetMost of the mitigation activities do not need funds 
for implementation, rather the activities merely require attitude change and 
consideration of the environment at all times. Notwithstanding, to ensure the 
mitigation measures in the ESMF are implemented, training and sensitisation on the 
issues are essential in addition to constant monitoring. Therefore, as indicated in 
tables 9 and 10, the budget required for the ESMF implementation is: 
 
Monitoring - US $ 40,800.00 
Training and sensitisation 
–
US $18,000.00 
Possible need for further site specific environmental assessments – US $ 3,500.00 
 
TOTAL ESMF implementation budget: US $62,300.00

Recommendations 
The ESMF highlights the following recommendations for effective implementation: 
 
·
Policy and decision makers from all relevant institutions must be sensitised on 
the Project ESMF before project activities commence at district level. 
·
All training and sensitisation programmes must take place before project 
activities commence at district level.  
·
Harmonise the World Bank and Gambia 
EIA procedures to avoid confusion and make the process more user friendly. 
·
Enhance monitoring of the importation, sale and use of illegal pesticides most of 
which comes through the porous borders with Senegal and sold at the “lumos”.  
·
We recommend the inputs be provided as a grant to farming groups only, 
however, where individual farmers are benefiting, in order to ensure 
sustainability and equitable distribution, we recommend token cost recovery 
from farmers to be managed by the VDCs. 
·
Establishment of a Regional Environment Coordination Team comprising of the 
NEA Regional Programme Officer and Regional Agricultural Directorate 
(DADO and Plant Protection specialist) 
·
An independent environmental audit carried out mid-term of project ESMF 
implementation.

ANNEX 5: Guidelines for Construction Contractors  
Construction contractors are mainly involved in the rehabilitation of the seed stores and 
seed multiplication centres. It is recommended that the PCU ensures that all contracts 
include mitigation measures they are to implement. The major ones are: 
 
·
Prevention of localised dust during demolition by wetting. 
·
Take action as advised by NEA regarding waste disposal based on location. 
·
Collect raw materials such as sand and wood only from sites approved by 
Government. 
·
Employ local workers where works will be carried out 
·
Work according to standards and specifications as directed by the PCU to make 
pest proof stores 
·
Always liaise with the PCU for clarification 
·
Ensure the workplace is safe, healthy and secure 
·
Ensure construction materials are not left in public rights of way

ANNEX 6: Terms of Reference (TOR) for the Preparation of an Environmental 
and Social Management Framework for the Gambia Emergency Agricultural 
Production Project  
Background and Introduction 
The European Commission through the World Bank (The International Development 
Association) provided Government with grant of Euros 5.3 million to implement The 
Gambia Emergency Agricultural Production Project (GEAPP). GEAPP is a grant 
aimed at improving access to agricultural inputs and equipment for targets farmers 
within ten most vulnerable districts. It will be implanted during a period of eighteen 
(18) months, approved 5
th
 January 2010 and is intended to increase cereal (millet and 
rice) production in the ten districts identified as the most vulnerable. The targeted 
districts are in the Local Government Areas (LGAs) of Brikama (Foni Bintang , Foni 
Kansala , Foni Bondali), Masakonko, (Jarra West), Kerewan (Lower Nuimi , Upper 
Nuimi), Janjanbureh (Niamina East), Basse (wulli, Sandu) and Kuntaur (Niani). The 
estimated population of these ten districts is 238,000. About 20,000 farmers groups 
will benefit from project assistance. GEAPP will phase out by the 30
th
 June 2011. 
 
In implementing this project, an Environmental Social Management Framework 
(ESMF) has to be developed an implemented as part of the grant Agreement 
covenants for the effectiveness of the project. 
 
The applicable 
Bank Safeguard Policies, 
as specified in the project’s Integrated 
Safeguard Data Sheet (ISDS), are the following: 
 
OP/BP/GP 4.01 Environmental AssessmentOP 4.01 Environmental and Social 
Management Framework. This project has been rated as a Category B, because the 
potential adverse impacts on human population or environmentally important areas 
are assessed as being low. The purposed intervention will include:  
 
(i) 
Supply of fertilizers and implementation machines 
(ii) 
Rehabilitation of existing community storage facilities and,
 
(iii) 
 Installation of supplemented irrigation to enhance year around 
production of certified seed. No pesticides be procured. Despite the fact 
that the project will rehabilitate boreholes for complementary irrigation, 
OP/BP 4.01 is triggered as boreholes are not tapping transboundary 
aquifer. Accordingly, OP/BP 4.01 is triggered by the project. An 
Envirmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) will be 
prepared, with appropriate elements incorporated into the Project 
Implementation Manual. The ESMF will be publicly disclosed in The 
Gambia and a World Bank Infoshop within a period of 60 days after the 
effeteness of the project. 
 
Principles and Objectives 
The principles on which this Environmental and Social Management Framework 
(ESMF) is based are that the project will: 
Page  81
80 
 
(i) 
Support rural farming communities in providing agricultural inputs (seeds 
and fertilizer) strengthen their production capacities while avoiding or 
minimizing environmental and social safeguard concerns 
(ii) 
Support local farming communities in improving village seed storage 
facilities  
(iii) 
Provision of farming machinery and implements  
(iv) 
Strengthen of seed multiplication centers to supply certified seeds to 
farmers, more detailed environmental or social planning is required 
before inputs, machinery and infrastructure can provided 
(v) 
Enhance extension teams to assist communities in their agricultural 
production activities  
(vi) 
To support communities and extension teams in carrying out their 
respective roles by funding substantial training, information resources, 
and technical assistance; and  
(vii) 
Enhance review for assessing compliance, learning lessons, and 
improving future performance, as well a assessing the occurrence of and 
potential for cumulative impacts due to Project-funded and other 
development activities    
 
The specified Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Objective 
includes: 
 
·
To establish clear procedures and methodologies for the environmental and 
social planning review, approval and implementation of sub-projects to be 
financed under the project  
·
To specify appropriate roles and responsibilities, and outline the necessary 
reporting procedures, for managing and monitoring environmental and social 
concerns related to the project activities  
·
To determine the training, capacity building and technical assistance needed 
to successfully implement the provision of the ESMF 
·
To establish the project funding required to implement the ESMF 
requirements and  
·
To provide practical information resources for implementing the ESMF  
 
Although the potential environmental and social impacts of the infrastructure 
investments under the project are expected to be generally minimal, potentially 
significant localized impacts may occurs, thus required appropriate mitigation 
measures. Potential environmental impacts would be addressed in the context of this 
ESMF. 
 
Scope of Work
The preparation of the ESMF will adhere to the guidelines and formats provided in 
the Environmental and Social Management Framework for World Bank project with 
Multi Small-Scale Sub-Projects: a Toolkit (the ESMF Toolkit id attached). 
 
Preparation of the ESMF will include, inter alia, the research, interview and field 
work needed to develop:

arrangement  
(b) An understanding of the legislation, regulation and administration framework 
in which the project will operate, with a focus on requirements that will apply 
to the different phases of the sub-project cycle 
(c) A review of existing Environmental Impact Assessment document of the 
African Emergency Locust Project   
(d) An understanding of the institutional needs for implementing the ESMF. This 
should include a review of the authority and capacity of institution at 
different levels, and their capacity to manage and monitor ESMF 
implementation. The functions, inter-sectoral arrangements, management 
procedures and training, budgeting, and financial support 
(e) An understanding of the socio-economic characteristics of the project in 
order to (i) identify potential environmental and social impacts that might 
result from future infrastructure investment; (ii) identify the social 
characteristics of the project interventions areas (ethnicity, gender, age, 
socially excluded or geographically isolated, etc.) (iii) identify opportunities 
and constraints of the local institutions and propose mechanisms for fostering 
inclusion; (iv) propose appropriate mitigation measures; (v) outline 
environmental impact assessment procedures. 
(f)  A training and capacity building program for the institutions responsible for 
implementing the ESMF 
(g) Specification of requirements for technical assistance to communities, 
services provided and public-sector institutions to support their ESMF 
implementation work; and  
(h) The definition of a budget for implementing the ESMF
