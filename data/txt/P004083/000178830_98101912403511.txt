1.  THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
Contribution to the Economy
1.01      Since the early 1960's, manufacturing has been the fastest growing
sector in the Korean economy. Over the last five years, its growth reached
nearly 20% p.a., almost twice as fast as the 11.5% growth of aggregate GNP.
The industrial sector, which accounted for 12% of GNP in 1961, reached 30% in
1977. Manufacturing contributed 43% of the increment in GNP over the last decade
rising to 52% during the past five years. Manufactured products represented 89%
of commodity exports in 1977, compared with 82% in 1965 and 60% in 1960 (and 85%
in the first half of 1978). Industry has provided about one third of all jobs
created since 1963 and as much as 47% over the period 1971-75; with approximately
2.9 million people employed, the industrial sector accounted for 21% of the total
population employed in 1977 (and 23% in the first half of 1978) against 11% in
1966. One notable feature of Korea's rapid industrialization is that it has
substantially contributed to the improvement in the country's income distribution
which is now among the most equitable in the developing world.
1.02      Manufactured exports have been the principal engine of growth of
the Korean economy and the beneficial impact of the orientation towards
labor-intensive exports can be seen in the factor proportions and efficiency
of factor use in Korean manufacturing. The sector is typified by low capital/
output and capital/labor ratios and high rates of growth of productivity.
The unlagged incremental capital/output ratio in the manufacturing sector
was 1.3 (in 1970 prices) during 1965-76 and there has been no perceptible
increase in the ratio during the last five years despite the increased
relative importance of steel, petrochemicals, shipbuilding and machinery
industries. This reflects not only the pattern of industry with heavy
emphasis on labor intensive goods but also low construction costs and high
rates of utilization of capacity reflecting in turn good management and
organization. After falling between 1960 and 1966, the average cost of job
creation in manufacturing industry during the last decade has been stable at
about $5,000 in 1975 prices reflecting both changes in output mix and produc-
tivity improvement within existing industries. The high and sharply increas-
ing level of labor productivity has been a fundamental strength of the Korean
development process. Real wages costs still appear quite competitive inter-
nationally. Manufacturing wage rates in Korea are about one-fifth of those
in Japan, lower than in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore and higher than in
the Philippines, Malaysia and Thailand. In contrast, productivity levels
compare very favorably with the latter countries and are probably not too far
behind that of Japan in the traditional industries. The efficient use of
capital and the steady improvement in labor productivity have enabled the
Korean economy to maintain a GNP growth rate of nearly 11% p.a. during the
last decade while investing only about 26% of GNP on average.
1.03      Recent Performance.  The Korean economy recovered remarkably well
in 1976 and 1977 after the recessionary period of 1974-75. The performance
of the manufacturing sector was particularly impressive with a 26% real
growth of value added in 1976,/1 and 12% in 1977. Exports increased by
/1 Compared to 13% in 1975.

more than 40% in volume in 1976 and by about 32% in 1977, reaching US$10.0
billion in that year (and at least US$11.0 million is estimated for 1978). This
growth in exports was led by a strong demand for Korea's traditional export
products such as textile yarns, fabrics and clothing which maintained a share of
about 35% of total commodity exports. Korea's efforts at reducing the concen-
tration of its exports towards the US and Japan have met with considerable
success in recent years; in 1977 the combined share of the US and Japan dropped
to 52% (and in early 1978 was only 49%) from a level of 70% in 1974, essentially
as a result of the development of new markets in Europe (particularly Germany,
France and the United Kingdom) and the Middle East. Commodity exports to the
Middle East, earlier negligible, amounted to more than US$ 1.04 billion in 1977.
In 1977, Korea won construction contracts, mostly in the Middle East, worth
about US$3.5 billion (including the cost of materials and equipment supplied
from Korea).

Light manufactures have declined from 67% of total manufacturing value added
in 1971 to 62% in 1976. while heavy manufactures have risen from about 31% to
35% over the same period.  In coming years, the Government intends to encour-
age more skill-intensive subsectors such as machinery and electronics where
Korea enjoys a competitive advantage over other developing countries because
of its skilled labor resources. This deepening of the Korean industrial
structure represents a major objective of the Fourth Five-Year Plan (1977-1981)
and is expected to result in a relative reduction in the share of light
industries in manufactured exports and output.
Geographic Distribution
1.05      In 1975, (based on the October 1975 census) approximately 27% of the
population of Korea lived in the cities of Seoul and Pusan; the Province of North
Gyeongsang where Taegu, the third major industrial city, is located, accounted
for another 14% of the population. The following table shows that the regional
distribution of industry and industrial employment is also skewed in favor of
Seoul and Pusan.

There was little change in the geographic dispersal of industrial employment
in Korea between 1971 and 1975; Seoul and Pusan remain by far the largest
industrial centers. The Government, however, has become increasingly aware
of the need to achieve, through a wider geographic dispersal of industries, a
better distribution of employment opportunities and a reduction of the
congestion and overcrowding in Seoul and Pusan. The Government has been
promoting the development of industrial centers outside these two areas
principally through the establishment of free trade zones and industrial
estates. Major examples of this policy are the iron and steel plants in
Pohang, the petrochemical complex in Ulsan, the integrated chemical industry
in Yeosu, and the machinery center at Changwon. The Saemaeul Movement,
initiated in 1971, also aims at creating industrial employment opportunities
in rural areas and at reducing the disparities of income between urban and
rural areas.



Financial Structure of Enterprises
1.06      The interest rate structure and slowdown in economic activity
during the period 1970 to mid-1972 had resulted in a deterioration of the
financial position and structure of Korean enterprises. Companies had become
highly dependent on the high cost, short-term "curb-market" for their finan-
cing. To improve their situation, a Presidential Decree of August 1972 froze
all loans from the unorganized money market and new measures were adopted
which lengthened maturities of certain loans, reduced interest rates to 16.8%
p.a. and converted loans from shareholders into equity. These measures as
well as the remarkable performance of the Korean economy in 1973 resulted in a
considerable improvement of the financial position and performance of Korean
enterprises. The aggregate debt/equity ratio of manufacturing enterprises
fell from 3.9:1 to 3.1:1 in 1972 and 2.7:1 in 1973. The average interest
rate on borrowings of manufacturing enterprises concurrently declined from
13.4% to 8.6%. Profitability improved markedly with net profits increasing
from an average of 1% of total assets in 1971 to 7.9% in 1973. However, with
the quadrupling of oil prices at end-1973 and sharp increases in the costs of
raw materials, enterprises were again subject to considerable financial
strains. Capacity utilization declined and costs of production increased
substantially. In an effort to sustain economic activity and employment, the
Government helped finance the buildup of manufacturing inventories. Enter-
prises had to resort to increased borrowings and the aggregate debt/equity
ratio increased to 3.2 in 1974 and 3.6 in 1976. Profitability decreased with
net income declining as a percentage of total assets from 7.9% in 1973 to
5.7%, 3.9% and 4.6% respectively in 1974, 1975 and 1976. There is, however,
some evidence that with the upturn in economic activity from the end of 1975
the financial structure and performance of Korean enterprises have improved.
Trends in Industrial Investment
1.07      Fixed capital formation in the manufacturing sector amounted to
W 805 billion in 1977, (equivalent to 20.1% of gross domestic capital formation in
that year), which represented a 20% increase over the 1976 level of W 667 billion,
which in turn, was 33% over the 1975 level of W 499 billion (all in current
prices). In terms of constant 1970 prices, the real increase in fixed capital
formation was nearly 12% between 1976 and 1977. During the Fourth Five-Year Plan
period the growth rate of GNP is expected to be 9.2% per annum with mining and
manufacturing growing at 14.2% p.a. Total gross fixed investment is projected at
W 18,000 billion /1 for the Plan period with manufacturing accounting for 28.3%
by the end of the Plan period.

Industrial Policies
1.08      Over the past ten years, industrial incentives in Korea have been
highly responsive to particular and changing circumstances, and varied with
Government policies and priorities for industrial development. These policies
aimed, with variable emphasis, at the promotion of export industries, geo-
graphic dispersal of industry, assistance to small and medium industries and,
more recently, investment in heavy industries.
1.09      A comprehensive incentive system was established during the first
half of the 1960s which generally favored the promotion of exports over import
substitution. The main elements of the incentive package included unrestricted
access to, and tariff exemptions on, imports of raw materials and capital goods,
generous waste allowances in determining duty-free raw material imports; direct
and indirect tax reductions; access to subsidized credit for working capital and
fixed investment; and rate subsidies on certain inputs. Key import substi-
tuting industries received protection from imports through tariffs and quanti-
tative import controls. Estimates of effective subsidy rates show, however,
that export activity was generally favored over import substitution. The
international competitiveness of Korean industry had substantially improved
between 1970 and 1973 partly due to successive devaluations of the won, and the
Government consequently decided to reduce export incentives. Preferential rates
of corporate income tax were abolished and interest rate subsidies were also
reduced. In 1975, tariff exemptions on imported inputs were abolished in favor
of a system by which the tariff on imported inputs is paid at the time of impor-
tation and rebated at the time of export. Tariff exemptions on imports of
machinery and equipment by export industries were abolished in 1974;/L payment
of custom duties can, however, be stretched over a three-year period.
1.10      While key import substituting industries have been granted many of
the preferences given to exporters, production for domestic sale has generally
been subject to higher duties, taxes and interest charges compared with rates
charged to exporters but has nevertheless benefited from tariffs and restrictions
on imports. Over the last few years there has been a modest decline in tariff
rates,/2 and an increase in reliance on import restrictions, as a means of
affording protection to domestic producers particularly in the case of capital
goods. However in 1977 the Government relaxed some of these restrictions as part
of an import liberalization program./3 As a counterpart for the protection
afforded to domestic producers through import controls, the Government in 1976
established price controls for major commodities./4
/1  Only in the case of capital goods imported under foreign capital
financing is there still complete and automatic exemption from tariffs.
/2  The average tariff rate which remained roughly stable between 22%
and 24% in 1969 to 1972, rapidly declined to about 12.8% in 1975.
/3  The number of prohibited items has declined from 77 in 1968 to 66 in
1975 and to 60 in 1977 while items subject to import restrictions
increased from 398 to 597 in 1976 but were reduced again to 456 in 1977.
/4  In March 1976, the Government enacted the Price Stabilization and Fair
Trade Law.



-6-
Prospects
1.11      Export orientation has been the dominant feature influencing the
structure and rate of expansion of the manufacturing sector. Export growth
has been accompanied by a policy of selective import-substitution which has
helped the aggregate dependence upon imported intermediate inputs and
capital goods remain at roughly the same level over the last decade. Although
import substitution has played a significant role in some sectors and over
specific time periods, its contribution to the growth of manufacturing output
has been very limited. It is estimated that over the period 1960-68 domestic
demand contributed some 60% to the growth of manufacturing, while export
expansion and import substitution contributed respectively 38% and 2%. The
emphasis given to exports of light manufactures has resulted in a rather high
degree of dependence upon imports as a source of raw materials and inter-
mediate inputs, as is reflected in the fact that the domestic value added
content of Korea's exports is only about 50%. While it is clear that Korea's
poor natural resource endowment limits the scope for backward linkages, there
is a real need for Korea to undertake a deepening of its industrial structure.
Awareness of the desirability of deepening Korea's industrial structure was
present in the formulation of both the Second and Third Five-Year Plans and
lies behind the decision to build the first integrated steel mill and petro-
chemical complex. The long-term plan covering the decade up to 1981 which
was published by the Economic Planning Board (EPB) in 1973 emphasized the
accelerated development of the heavy and chemical industries as a critical
element of Korea's future industrialization. The 1973-74 economic setbacks
have rendered a reexamination of this long-term development plan necessary
and while, in the fourth Five-Year Plan, emphasis remains on developing heavy
industry and on increasing the domestic content of exported manufactures,
some heavy capital and energy-intensive projects have been deferred or
cancelled altogether.
1.12      Along with the general objectives of further strengthening Korea's
balance of payments and maintaining a rapid growth in employment, a major goal
of the Fourth Five-Year Plan's industrial policy is to achieve a structural
shift within the manufacturing sector towards more skill intensive sectors such
as machinery and electronics where Korea enjoys a competitive advantage over
other developing countries.
1.13      Over the five-year period of the Plan (1977-81) the GNP is expected
to grow at a rate of 9.2% p.a. fueled by a 16.5% annual growth in the volume of
manufactured exports. The mining and manufacturing sector which in 1977 accounted
for 30% of GNP (at current market prices) is expected to increase at 14.3% p.a.,
a higher rate of growth than that of GNP, which would bring the contribution of
the mining and manufacturing sector to 41% of GNP by 1981. It is expected that
some 55% of the two million new jobs to be created during the Fourth Five-Year
Plan period will be in the mining and manufacturing sector. As in previous
years, Korea's economic development would essentially be export-led, the ratio of
commodity exports to GNP which reached 27% in 1975 and nearly 32% in 1977, would
rise to 42% by 1981. However, compared to their real growth rate of 32% p.a.



- 7 -
over the period of 1967-75, exports are projected to increase at a more modest
16.8%. p.a.  The Plan is based on the assumption that Korea's exports of textiles,
clothing and other light manufactures have a limited growth potential and are
subject to encroachment by other developing countries. Korea's comparative
advantage will, therefore, increasingly lie in industries which require more
skilled labor and greater industrial sophistication such as machinery, elec-
tronics and shipbuilding. The real growth of exports of these products would be
around 30% p.a. over the 1976-81 period. The share of manufactures is expected
to rise from about 85% of total merchandise exports in 1975 to 92% by 1981. In
order to sustain the projected GNP growth rate of 9.2% p.a., gross fixed invest-
menat would need to rise at 7.8% p.a. In relation to GNP, the projected invest-
ment is slightly lower than in the Third Plan period (26.2% of GNP as against
26.9% during the 1972-76 period). The share of manufacturing investment in total
gross investment is projected to increase by only 2% from its average share of
24.6% during the Third Five-Year Plan to 26.5% during the Fourth Five-Year Plan.
The shift in Korea's export strategy towards more skill-intensive exports is
reflected in both the planned structure of industrial output and in projected
investment allocations. The share of heavy and chemical industries is expected
to rise from 43% of total value added in manufacturing in 1975, to nearly 52% by
1981.  Investment in light industries is expected to decrease from 40% of total
investment outlays in the manufacturing sector over the Third Plan period to 36%
over the next five years; conversely, investment in the heavy and chemical
industries such as basic metals and chemicals would be reduced in relative terms
from approximately 75% of investment outlays in heavy and chemical industries
over the Third Plan period to 61% over the Fourth Five-Year period in favor of
investment in machinery and electronics which would increase from 25% to 39%.
1.14      The Plan's estimate of total investment required for the expansion
and restructuring of Korea's industrial sector has been set at around
$ 10.5 billion over the 1977-81 period. There are grounds for believing,
however that Korea's investment needs for 1977-81 may have been underesti-
mated, while the domestic savings target (which calls for an increase in the
proportion of domestic savings to GNP from 16.3% in 1970 to 27.1% in 1981)
appears somewhat ambitious. The conjunction of these two possibilities would
lead to a continued reliance on substantial inflows of foreign capital. The
Korean Government has in recent years undertaken a major effort to mobilize
domestic resources. Toward that objective, the Government established in
1973 the National Investment Fund (NIF), which is expected to finance a
sizeable portion of the investment needs of Korea's major industries. The
NIF was conceived as an important supplement to various programs of domestic
savings mobilization, and particularly as a source of funds for long-term
investment, primarily for plant and equipment. The NIF derives its funds
from a variety of sources including the national savings associations;
pension funds; postal savings; deposits in banking institutions (20% of which
must be invested in NIF bonds); savings funds; and NIF's bond sales to the
public. The Government has also embarked on a comprehensive capital market
development plan, including the restructuring of the Korean Securities
Financing Corporation and the development of new financial institutions such

the Plan expects domestic funds to provide 63% of the aggregate investment
in manufacturing and foreign capital to provide the remainder. About three
quarters of this foreign investment is expected to be directed to the heavy
and chemical sectors.
1.15      The Bank has worked closely with the Government in the formulation
and implementation of industrial policies and is in basic agreement with the
main thrust and priorities of these policies, including those contained in
the Fourth Plan.
2. THE FINANCIAL SECTOR
Institutional Setup
2.01      The financial sector of Korea consists of the Bank of Korea,
Deposit Money Banks and nonmonetary financial institutions. The Bank of
Korea performs regular central banking functions, including the supervision
of commercial banks.
2.02      Deposit Money Banks include commercial banks and specialized banks.
Commercial banks receive most of their funds through deposits from the
public. They can make all kinds of loans but have traditionally concentrated
on short-term lending although term financing through roll-over of short-term
loans is common. There are 5 nationwide commercial banks, 10 banks with
localized operations and 21 branches of foreign banks which together had 693
branches/offices around the country at end-1976 (all these fall into the
category of "commercial banks"). Four of the five nationwide commercial
banks are fully controlled by the Government which, under Korean law,
automatically receives majority rights if its holding in a nationwide bank is
10% or more. The fifth bank is controlled by the semi-official Korean Traders
Association. All commercial banks are subject to control and supervision by
the Bank of Korea while specialized banks are directly controlled by the
Ministry of Finance. The specialized banks were all established under a
Special Banking Act and are subject to only a few specific Articles of the
Bank of Korea Act and General Banking Act. Specialized banks are government-
controlled and/or owned. As their name implies, they were founded for
particular purposes or sectors (such as small-scale industry financing or
agricultural financing) and government funds constitute a substantial part of
their financial resources in addition to resources raised otherwise, the bulk
of which consists of deposits raised from the public, hence their categor-
ization as Deposit Iloney Banks. Specialized banks include the Korea Exchange
Bank, which was established in 1967 mainly to relieve the Bank of Korea of
commercial foreign exchange business, the Medium Industry Bank which extends
financial and technical assistance to small and medium-scale industries, and



-9-
which has so far received two Bank loans totalling US$85 million,/l the
Citizens National Bank (mainly for mobilizing small savings and financing
household loans and small enterprises), the Korea Housing Bank, the National
Agricultural Cooperative Federation (NACF) and the National Fisheries
Cooperative.
2.03      Besides the above-mentioned banking institutions which, with the
BOK as supervising agency, constitute the "Monetary System," there are several
nonbanking financial institutions, namely: (a) development finance institu-
tions; (b) savings institutions; (c) life insurance companies; (d) investment
companies; and (e) Merchant Banks. The development finance institutions
comprise the Korea Development Bank (KDB) which so far has received three Bank
loans totalling US$252.5 million, the Korea Development Finance Corporation
(KDFC) to which Bank Group assistance, including IFC, amounts to US$240
million to date, the Land Bank and the Export-Import Bank. Savings
institutions comprise some 1,200 authorized credit unions (at end-1976) and
211 mutual savings and finance companies. Five life insurance companies
operate in Korea, in addition to the Postal Life Insurance and the Educational
Insurance Company. Investment companies include the Korea Securities Finance
Corporation which is the principal organization for securities financing in
Korea, ten short-term finance companies /2 and the Korea Investment Trust
Corporation which is specialized in the establishment of investment trust
funds. In addition, three leasing companies have been established over the
last few years as joint ventures between Korean and foreign investors. The
Merchant Banks are the latest arrivals on the Korean financial scene. Five
such banks have so far been established; the Korean Merchant Banking Corpo-
ration (KM4BC); the Korea-Kuwait Banking Corporation; the Saehan Merchant
Banking Corporation; the Korea-French Banking Corporation and the Asian
Banking Corporation.  As of December 31, 1977 these merchant banks had total
assets of W 56.8 billion (US$117 million) and issuance of their own commercial
papers accounted for 70% of their funds raised while discounting of commercial
papers accounted for 75% of their operations.
2.04      As of December 31, 1977, total loans outstanding to the manu-
facturing sector by all banking institutions in Korea including KDB amounted
to W 3,115 billion or US$6.4 billion equivalent. (By May 31, 1978, this had
grown to W 3,548 billion or US$7.3 billion equivalent.) About 73% of December 31,
1977 total of W 3,115 billion was for operating funds, mainly supplied by commer-
cial banks. The largest supplier of equipment loans (i.e. term loans) is KDB
which, as of December 31, 1977 had an outstanding portfolio in the manufacturing
sector of W 452 billion (US$932 million), about 53% of the outstanding medium and
long-term credit by banking institutions to the manufacturing sector as of that
date.

Capital _Market
2.05      The Korean Stock R4arket was moribund for many years but showed
signs of life in 1972. Before then the yields on stocks were considered
unattractive as both savings accounts of commercial banks and the "curb
market" gave higher returns. The market was also thin because closely held
companies were reluctant to go public. With the mid-1972 economic boom and
the adoption of new financial measures by the Government (para. 1.06), the
public showed growing interest in the stock market. The curb market was
severely checked as a result of the August 1972 measures and with decreasing
interest rates offered by commercial banks, yields on stocks became attractive.
In addition, the overall investment climate became more favorable after
August 1972, and the campaign for more stock listings and for companies to go
public was intensified. The result was a large increase in stock exchange
activity in the second half of 1972 and in 1973. In 1974, however, the growth of
trading activities on the exchange slowed down considerably due to the gloomy
business outlook; new stock listings, however, continued to rise reaching
almost W 500 million at the end of 1974.  The following table summarizes the
stock exchange activity over the last six years (figures are shown as of the
end of each period):

With the general improvement of the business climate and improved export
prospects, trading picked up again around mid-1975 and for the year as a
whole the number of stocks listed almost doubled.
2.06      At end-1976, the general stock price index stood at 415.3, an
increase of 8% only during the year, compared with a 44% gain a year
earlier. On the other hand, the issuing market was very active during 1976
as a result of the Government's efforts to promote the "going public" of
privately-held companies.  The number of listed companies increased by 85 to
274 in the year and a total of W 263 billion was mobilized through the capital
market, a 69.5% gain over the previous year. During the year, the number of
shareholders increased substantially. Over the years, the ownership structure
has broadened, though as at December 31, 1976, about 63% of all shareholders
still held less than 100 shares each and accounted for only 0.84% of all shares



- 11 -
outstanding. The importance of the Government as a shareholder of listed
companies also decreased; while the Government (including public bodies) held
about 39% of the total number of listed stocks in 1970, its holdings had
declined to 16% by December 31, 1976. The proportion held by banking institu-
tions also declined from 15% to 8% during the same period.
2.07      During 1977, the capital market exhibited a highly active perfor-
mance in response to the Government's vigorous efforts to promote the going
public of privately held companies. The supply of capital through the stock
market to business firms during the year totalled W 363 billion, which
exceeded the year's target of W 320 billion. Of this, W 44 billion was
through public offering of equity shares, W 142 billion through share capital
increases of listed companies, and the remaining W 177 debentures. The
volume of transactions in the secondary stock market expanded by 119% during
1977, recording the trade volume of W 1,375 billion (1,271 million shares)
and the number of listed companies on the Korea Stock Exchange increased by
49 to 323. The stock price index rose by 21.3% to 504.1 at end 1977, largely
led by the substantial gain in prices of stocks of those companies engaged in
construction services, automobile manufacturing and cement industries.
2.08      The rapid increase in the volume of operations on the Stock Exchange
had rendered certain improvements necessary. Among others the call market
has been replaced by a continuous auction market, investment trust companies
have been established, and the information system greatly improved. Several
weaknesses remain, however. One of the more important problems lies in
existing laws which stipulate that new equity issues have to be at par
irrespective of the market price of stocks. These regulations are currently
under review by the Government. In addition, gradual internationalization of
the domestic stock market is being initiated by the Government.
Interest Rates and Monetary Policy
2.09      The Government through the Monetary Board determines interest rate
ceilings on deposits and loans which apply to all banking institutions.
Although private specialized financial institutions such as KDFC or the
short-term finance companies are not legally bound, in practice, they too
have to follow government policies. The development of Korea's interest rate
structure has, between 1968 and 1973, seen a continuous reduction in both
deposit, and lending rates. The lowering of the rates coincided with the
Government's success in gradually bringing inflation down until late 1973.
With the emergence of the oil crisis and worldwide inflation, Korea' price
structure was particularly hard hit because of its high foreign trade
dependence. Wholesale prices are estimated to have increased by nearly 80%
between the end of 1973 and the end of 1975. While the Government selectively
increased interest rates at the end of 1974,/L a general increase of interest
rates was postponed because enterprises were already facing severe financial
/1 Raising rates on time deposits for over three months and over six months
from respectively 12% and 13.2% to 15%, and preferential rates for loans
from the NIF and IRF from 9% and 8% respectively to 12%.



- 12 -
strains and the Government hoped to succeed in bringing inflation under con-
trol. During the year 1976, wholesale prices are estimated to have increased
only by 12.1% on an annual basis.
2.10      On August 2, 1976, the Covernment made ain extensive upward adjust-
ment in and revision of the interest rate structure in order to contain
excessive loan demand and to better allocate funds. Prior to this date,
Korean commercial banks had already resorted to various practices which
resulted in increased collateral requirements and higher effective lending
rates for their less creditworthy borrowers. Such practices included the
collection of interest in advance, the establishment of compensating balances
on time deposits or even the opening of installment savings accounts which
are used both as collateral and sinking funds. The August 1976 measures
acted to ratify and further rationalize this system of differentiating
between borrowers on the basis of the risks involved. It led to a system
whereby (a) the interest rates on working capital loans vary according to the
credit standing of the borrower and (b) interest rates on equipment loans
vary according to the loan maturity. The Korean financial authorities
established a list of criteria for enterprises to qualify as a prime borrower
which has helped reduce the need for subjective judgments on the credit-
worthiness of borrowers. This introduction of a prime rate system for
working capital loans and of differential rates according to loan maturities
for equipment loans constitutes an important step towards improving the
overall allocation of funds to industry.
2.11      Effective July 1, 1977, the Government replaced the previous excise
business and consumption taxes by the value added tax (VAT) system, all goods
and services being assessed at a flat rate of 10%. There was some apprehen-
sion amongst the general public that the new taxation system might result in
an increased tax burden on industrial enterprises and consequently in sharp
rises in the cost of living. While the Government did not subscribe to this
thinking it decided to introduce various anti-inflation measures to moderate
the possible adverse impact of the new tax system. These measures included:
(a) a lowering of bank lending rates by 1% on July 1 and a further 1% on
October 1; time deposit rates were also lowered by 1.8% as from October 1,
1977; (b) the Government realigned and announced the prices of 851 major
commodity items, pegged the maximum permissible price levels of major daily
necessities and froze public utility rates until further notice; (c) easing
of import restrictions as discussed in para. 1.10; and (d) measures to restrict
growth of money supply including issuance of treasury bills and repayment of some
Government borrowings from the Bank of Korea. During 1978, the Government
continued with its active interest rate policy and in June raised the general
level of the structure of interest rates, chiefly as a countercyclical measure,
deposit rates being raised to 18.5% and onlending rates to 19% or higher.
2.12      The rate of increase of wholesale prices in 1977 was 10.1% and the
growth of domestic money supply 40.7%. The targets set for 1977 as a whole
were a 10% limit to wholesale price increases and about a 25% limit to domestic
money supply growth. The money supply in the foreign sector more than doubled in
1977 and in the last quarter of 1977 the Government introduced various measures
to curb its growth. Foreign banks were instructed in early December to freeze
their won loans at their October 1977 level; reserve requirements for foreign
currency deposits have also been established and enforced. Further measures have
also been taken to curb money supply growth in the domestic sector; however,
price controls were partially eased in two stages on August 1, 1977 and December
1, 1977. Interest rates as of June 30, 1978 are shown in Annex 4, T-1.

3. THE KOREA DEVELOPMENT FINANCE CORPORATION
A. KDFC'S ROLE IN THE ECONOMY
KDFC in Perspective
3.01     KDFC was established in 1967 with the active assistance of the
Bank Group. Its operations, although having grown rapidly, remain small
relative to the economy as a whole. As of end-1977 its outstanding loan
portfolio of W 100.6 billion (US$207 million) represented about 1.6% of the
total outstanding loans - both short- and long-term - extended by all banking
institutions in Korea./I In the particular field of term finance, however,
KDFC's lending is considerably more important, accounting for about 8% of all
medium- and long-term equipment loans outstanding to the manufacturing sector
as of December 31, 1977. KDFC's cumulative disbursements to the manufacturing
sector amounted to W 82 million (US$170 million) over the period 1971-77,
representing about 2.7% of the total fixed investment in that sector (see
Annex 4, Table 2)./2 Considering that KDFC financed an average of 38% of
total project costs over those seven years, KDFC-supported projects have in
aggregate accounted for about 7.0% of total manufacturing fixed investment.
Over the three years 1975-77, KDFC's cumulative disbursements for nonmanufac-
turing activities represented 1.3% of total non-manufacturing fixed invest-
ment. Therefore, with KDFC financing an average of 59% of total project
costs in this sector between 1975 and 1977, KDFC-supported projects have in
aggregate accounted for about 2.2% of total non-manufacturing fixed invest-
ment. Apart from its financing activities, KDFC makes valuable qualitative
contributions to the industrial sector through its high operational standards
(para. 3.37), its efficiency as a resource allocator, and its extensive
promotional activities.
KDFC's Role Within the Financial Sector
3.02     KDFC's Articles of Incorporation stipulate that the purpose of its
establishment is to provide medium- and long-term financial assistance to the
private sector, particularly the foreign exchange requirements of manufactur-
ing and processing industries./3 While there is some degree of overlap
/1  By comparison, KDB accounted for 16% of all outstanding loans.
/2  Subsector figures indicate that KDFC's disbursements as a proportion of
fixed,investment during 1971-77, were as high as 11.6% for metal products
industries, 4.5% for textiles, and 4.2% for the machinery and equipment
industries.
/3  Some nonmanufacturing activities are also included, such as transport,
tourism, services, commerce, fisheries and large-scale commercially-
oriented agriculture. However, trade, real estate and small-scale
agriculture are excluded. The scope of KDFC's activities is further
elaborated in Annex 2.



- 14 -
between the activities and clientele of KDFC and those of the other indus-
trial finance institutions operating in Korea, there is nevertheless a
distinction in lending emphasis, each institution fulfilling somewhat dif-
ferent functions and aiming at different sectors of the economy. The Korea
Development Bank (KDB) is the main source of industrial finance in Korea
for both the public and private sectors,/1 and it is largely used by the
Government as the executing agency of its industrial policies. Consequently,
KDB finances, inter alia, large Government non-manufacturing activities
such as power and transportation projects./2 The Medium Industry Bank (MIB)
confines its financing to small and medium industry,/3 particularly the
modern medium-sized firms, while the Citizens National Bank (CNB) caters
mainly to the unorganized sector of small-scale enterprise, providing
consumer loans and small domestic currency loans to firms of an individual,
household, or cottage type./4 There is no overlap between the activities
of CNB and KDFC. Although KDB and KDFC are similar in some respects, KDB,
unlike KDFC, provides the large majority of its loans for financing domestic
currency requirements. Furthermore, both KDB and MIB, again unlike KDFC,
allocate a much higher proportion of their total lending operations to
working capital financing, a reflection of the fact that they are allowed to
accept domestic currency deposits, which KDFC is not./5 In conclusion, the
scope of KDFC's operations is clearly different from that of MIB, and some-
what more restricted than that of KDB.
/1  KDB's loan portfolio outstanding as of December 31, 1977, was W 1,008 bil-
lion (US$2 billion), of which 10.4% was foreign currency lending, 89%
for equipment financing and 46% for the private sector. By comparison,
KDFC's loan portfolio outstanding as of the same date was W 101 billion
(US$207 million), of which 92% was foreign currency lending, 96% equip-
ment financing and 100% for the private sector.
/2  The non-manufacturing sectors accounted for 55% of KDB's outstanding
portfolio at end-1977.
/3  Defined by the Small Industry Basic Act (amended in 1977) to include
manufacturing enterprises with up to 300 regular employees or total
assets of up to W 500 million (US$1 million). MIB's loan portfolio
outstanding as of end-1977 was W 305.4 billion (US$630 million).
/4  CNB provides only domestic currency financing, up to a maximum of five
years for enterprises employing up to 100 persons. The maximum loan
size is W 30 million (US$62,000).
/5  In addition, KDB is empowered under the General Banking Act to
mobilize domestic currency resources by issuing bonds (Industrial
Finance Debentures) for relending purposes, which KDFC, established
under the Commercial Code, is not.



- 15 -
3.03     Because of its large domestic currency financing and its extensive
involvement in the non-manufacturing sectors, KDB remains by far the largest
source of term finance for industry, the value of its 1977 loan approvals
being 9.8 times larger than KDFC's. However, in the particular field of
foreign exchange financing, KDFC's importance comes close to, and indeed may
exceed, that of KDB. /1
Economic Impact of KDFC's Lending
3.04     Annex 4, Tables 3 and 4, summarize the partial economic indicators
of the 344 subprojects financed by KDFC between the start of its operations
in 1968 and end-1977. The aggregate investment cost of these projects is
estimated at about W 360 billion (US$740 million), of which KDFC financed
W 135 billion, or 38%./2
3.05     Scale of Output and Value-added of KDFC Projects.  In 1976, KDFC
financed 65 projects with a total project cost of W 93 billion (US$193 mil-
lion) which were expected to generate incremental annual sales of W 162 bil-
lion (US$333 million) and incremental annual value-added of W 52 billion
(US$108 million). In 1977, it financed 62 projects with a total project cost
of W 89 billion (US$183 million) which were expected to generate incremental
annual sales of W 127 billion (US$261 million) and incremental annual value-
added of W 49 billion (US$101 million). On an incremental basis, aggregate
value added per employee in the projects financed by KDFC increased between
1976 and 1977 to a level of W 9.34 million per employee. This was associated
with a 4% decline in the capital:labor ratio (approximated by fixed assets
per employee) between these two years, which is a favorable development as on
certain restrictive assumptions such an increase in value added per employee
would be expected to be associated with an increase in the capital:labor
ratio. Similarly, on an incremental basis the aggregate value added:fixed
assets ratio marginally increased between 1976 and 1977, i.e. the aggregate
incremental capital output ratio decreased. The disaggregated data of
Annex 4, Table 4 shows that the projects financed under KDFC's scheme of
cooperation with the Regional Commercial Banks (RCBs, see para. 3.28) per-
formed particularly well, as while total project costs decreased by 17%
to W 4.8 billion between 1976 and 1977, incremental annual value added
increased by 34% which was associated with increases of 180% in value added
per employee /3 and 60% in the value added:fixed assets ratio.
A   KDB's cumulative foreign currency loan commitments from 1975 to 1977 were
US$199 million equivalent, compared with KDFC's US$179 million.
/2 On an approval basis.
/3 Which was associated with only a 76% increase in fixed assets per
employee, therefore implying a relatively greater contribution from labor
inputs to final output.



- 16 -
Via KDFC's subloan to KDLC in 1976 (para. 3.19), 28 leasing subprojects were
financed in 1976 and 1977 generating a further W 37 billion (US$75 million) in
incremental annual sales and W 10 billion (US$21 million) in incremental
annual value-added.
3.06     Employment Creation.  At end-1977, KDFC's 223 clients employed about
240,000 people, or 2.2% of the total employed labor force in Korea. More
significantly, KDFC's manufacturing clients employed nearly 7% of the 3 mil-
lion people employed in the manufacturing sector in 1977. Between 1968
and end-1977, it is estimated that KDFC-supported projects created about
32,000 jobs./l For all KDFC's projects, the average fixed investment cost
per incremental job (excluding permanent working capital costs) was US$21,500
in 1975; US$25,400 in 1976; and US$24,500 in 1977. There are, however, three
significantly different lending activities included in this overall average,
which, when examined separately, indicate that the labor intensity of projects
selected for financing in fact varied substantially. In 1976, KDFC started
lending to smaller projects through its scheme of cooperation with the RCBs
(para. 3.28), and these projects showed a fixed investment cost per incre-
mental job of US$7,200 in 1976 and US$12,800 in 1977. In addition, KDFC's
subloan of US$5 million to KDLC in 1976 indirectly supported 28 leasing
subprojects at an average fixed investment cost per incremental job of
US$10,600. Consequently, the "KDFC-proper" (exclusive of both KDFC-RCB
projects and KDLC projects) fixed investment costs per incremental job were
US$31,200 in 1976 and US$26,200 in 1977./2 On the whole, the KDFC-financed
projects do not appear unduly capital intensive considering that, firstly,
KDFC was set up to operate primarily in the medium to large-scale sectors of
industry and, secondly, KDFC has, in line with Government policy, recently
financed a number of shipping, chemicals, and metals projects which are
relatively capital intensive. However, KDFC acknowledges the importance of,
/1 This excludes an estimated 1,800 jobs created in 1976 and 1977 by KDLC's
leasing subprojects, assisted by KDFC's US$5 million subloan to KDLC.
/2 Despite definition and data problems, tentative estimates of "fixed
asset and permanent working capital" costs were made and the addition of
estimated permanent working capital costs increased the costs per job
created as follows:

and explicitly analyzes, the employment impact of its projects, and it has
initiated the RCB scheme (para. 3.28) in order to reach smaller (more labor-
intensive) borrowers. But even for these KDFC-RCB projects the fixed invest-
ment cost per job created is increasing, which is partly due to the growing
overall scarcity of labor (especially of skilled labor) which has led
some investors to sponsor projects which were more labor-saving and more
capital-intensive than they would otherwise have chosen to undertake. Regarding
income distribution, KDFC has allocated its financial assistance to projects
for which labor's share of value added has been increasing /1 in recent years,
reaching about 30% in 1977.
3.07      Size and Diversity of Operations  KDFC's loans have increasingly
been for amounts above W 1 billion (US$2 million); between 1968 and end-1977,
a cumulative total of about 35% was above this amount. However, 214 of the
total 356 loans made by KIbFC from 1968 to end-1977 were for amounts below
W 300 million (US$600,000). Furthermore, in spite of a strong 'one-bank'
tradition amongst Korean borrowers and bankers alike, only 77 (or 34%) of
KDFC's clients received repeat loans over this period (Annex 4, Table 18),
reflecting KDFC's continued efforts to broaden its clientele, diversify into
new priority sectors and extend its financial assistance into new areas via
initiatives such as the RCB scheme, a strengthened Project Promotion Department,
and, for the future, a branch in the Busan area (see Annex 3).
3.08      Contribution to Exports.  On the whole, KDFC's portfolio reflects
an emphasis on export-oriented projects, with estimated annual export sales of
US$ 650 million representing 44% of incremental annual sales) resulting from
all KDFC-financed projects between 1968 and end-1977. Over the last 5 years,
heavily export-oriented projects (those exporting over 50% of their output)
accounted for 46% of IDFC's loan approvals by amount (Annex 4, Table 5).
However, in 1977 this proportion declined slightly to 40% and export sales as
a proportion of the incremental annual sales generated by KDFC's projects
also declined, to 20%. These reductions are mainly attributable to KDFC's
recently increased support of priority projects in metals, construction,
chemicals, paper and marine transport /2 industries, which are relatively
more domestic market oriented. Furthermore, the level of imports associated
with KDFC's recent projects (both for fixed assets and raw materials) declined
between 1976 and 1977 but by a smaller amount than the above-mentioned
decline in exports. Therefore, the main result of this recent sectoral
re-orientation has been a short-run decline in the net annual balance of
payments effect of KDFC-financed projects which was down to US$40 million in
1977 (from US$160 million in 1976).
/1  The average monthly earnings of incremental jobs arising from KDFC-financed
projects was (all in '00Q); W 150 in 1976 and W 220 in 1977, compared
with sectoral averages of W 50 and W 70 respectively for those years.
/2  Invisible export earninas are not included.

3.09      Sectoral Distribution.  It is noted in para. 3.43 that the sectoral
distribution of KDFC's projects is broadly in line with current Government
priorities. KDFC's allocations have recently increased to metals, chemicals,
transport equipment and consruction industries. While KDFC acknowledges the
importance of the domestic machinery and electronics industries for employ-
ment creation and import substitution, (as stressed by the Government in the
FFYP), its efforts to increase its assistance to these sectors have so far
been only moderately succesful. This is mainly because machinery projects
generally required large financing amounts and consequently were beyond
KDFC's financing capacity, while most electronics projects have been estab-
lished as joint ventures with foreign investors, thus typically leaving
limited scope for KDFC's involvement.
3.10      KDFC's financing share of total project costs was above the 38%
average in metal and nonmetallic mineral products, paper industries, fisheries
and transportation services, while it was well below average in chemicals and
construction /1 (Annex 4, Table 6).
3.11      Regional Distribution.  The geographical distribution of KDFC's
projects (para. 3.46) is broadly in line with the slow evolution of indus-
trial dispersal throughout Korea as a whole. KDFC is contributing to the
decentralization of investment from over-crowded industrial centers by
actively supporting the Government's emphasis on developing planned indus-
trial zones (e.g. Changwon's machinery center, chemicals at Yeosu, elec-
tronics in Kumi, petrochemicals and shipbuilding in Ulsan and iron and steel
at Pohang), as well as by continuing with the RCB scheme, designed to assist
small and medium scale enterprises in the less developed areas of the country.
3.12      Economic Rate of Return Analysis.  Since June 1973, KDFC has
generally carried out an economic analysis of projects which required more
than US$1 million in foreign currency financing. Annex 4, Table 7 summarizes
the ERRs for all the 73 KDFC-financed projects for which these indicators
have hitherto been calculated. All but three of these projects had ERRs in
excess of 15%, the three exceptions being transport equipment projects. The
ERRs were as high as 60-80% for eight projects, three of which were for tex-
tiles. The average ERR was 32.3%. In addition, all but one of the projects
had FRRs above 15%, the one exception being a steel manufacturing and rolling
project which offset its low FRR with an ERR of 47%, attributable to its
import substitution impact. Seven projects had FRRs above 40% with an average
FRR for the whole sample of 27.2%. KDFC has clearly allocated its funds to
projects which are both financially and economically viable. Furthermore, in
the case of more than half (38) of these projects the FRR was in varying
degrees lower than the ERR, which suggests that these projects contributed
more in economic benefits to Korea as a whole than accrued as appropriable
financial benefits to the projects themselves, thereby again illustrating the
generally high degree of export-orientation of KDFC's projects.
/1 Which is to be expected on grounds of high project costs.

Influence on Project Design and Technical Assistance
3.13      KDFC continues to encourage project sponsors to approach it at
an early stage of project formulation so as to enable it to make substantive
contributions to project design. There have to date been numerous instances
where KDFC has been successful in directly or indirectly introducing early
modifications in project design which were subsequently implemented by the
projects' sponsors. In several cases KDFC's recommendations have aimed at
increasing the equity base and generally strengthening the financial struc-
ture of the borrower, which, besides improving the client's debt-servicing
capacity, also represented a useful contribution to domestic resource mobili-
zation. Acting more broadly as a development institution, KDFC has gone
beyond financial matters per se and provided advice and consultancy services
relating to:
(a) technical design, choice of technology and selection of machinery;
which has included such matters as domestic or foreign procurement,
second-hand or new machinery etc;
(b) market analysis and production plans; where KDFC has, in particular,
frequently advised on production capacity and product-mix; and
(c) corporate organization and legal structure; for which KDFC
has often recommended the establishment of subsidiaries to
implement projects.
3.14      KDFC is also sustaining its efforts to introduce new technologies
via its projects so as to expand the range and improve the quality of prod-
ucts made in Korea, and, at the same time, promote the growth of forward
and backward linkages in the industrial structure. In 1977, KDFC financed
seven such projects which introduced technologies (and products) altogether
new in Korea. More than 20 man-years of training abroad was involved (espe-
cially in Japan which supplied six of the new technologies), and in reverse,
nearly 14 man-years of technical assistance in Korea was associated with the
seven projects (Annex 4, Table 8).
Resource Mobilization
3.15      KDFC's resource position is analyzed in para. 3.59.  As of
December 31, 1977, KDFC had W 27.4 billion available for approval, of which
91% (or US$51 million) were foreign exchange funds and 9% (or W 2.4 billion)
were domestic currency resources. In early 1978 the rate of approvals was
extremely rapid, and as of June 30, 1978, KDFC had only W 7.1 billion remaining
available for approval, of which 57% (or US$8.5 million) were foreign exchange
funds and 43%`(or W 3.0 billion) were domestic currency resources.
3.16      Between 1968 and 1977, KDFC had mobilized a cumulative total of
US$331.2 million /1 in foreign currency resources. The breakdown was as
follows (further details in Annex 4, Table 26):

Apart from the relatively small USAID and Caterpillar loans, KDFC relied
exclusively on the Bank for foreign currency borrowings until the first ADB
loan was signed in September 1974. KDFC's efforts to expand its resources
with foreign commercial borrowings suffered from a twofold constraint
particularly during 1974/75; namely the shortage of medium- and long-term
funds in the international capital markets and also Korea's limited ability
to borrow in those markets because of its temporary balance of payments
difficulties. Hence, KDFC was not able to raise its first commercial loan
until 1976, when nearly US$20 million was raised by IFC/DEG /1 on KDFC's
behalf. In 1977 a further US$20 million foreign commercial loan was raised
via APCO./2 KDFC's performance in mobilizing foreign commercial funds is
satisfactory, taking into account the difficulties inherent in this type of
resource mobilization, and the fact that KDFC has had only ten years of
operation. KDFC plans to raise foreign commercial borrowings in increasing
amounts (para. 3.66), but these will continue to be limited because of the
/1 The IFC syndicated loan amounted to US$17.8 million, of which US$8.9 mil-
lion was on IFC's own account, and a further US$8.9 million from eight
international banks and institutions. The DEG loan of US$2 million was
made in parallel with the IFC loan.

- 21 -
difficulties inherent in obtaining them in sufficient amounts at reasonable
cost, and also because of KDFC's need to match the maturities of its borrowings
and its loans, which is only partially possible with commercial borrowings as
they are generally available for a period of 6 to 8 years, while 46% of KDFC's
loans are for terms exceeding 10 years (Annex 4, Table 17). Foreign commercial
borrowings will make up a gradually increasing proportion of KDFC's overall
resources, but they cannot obviate KDFC's need for funds from official sources
such as the Bank in the foreseeable future. Finally, it should be noted that
KDFC has helped mobilize a further US$90 million in foreign currency resources
via its joint financing operations (para. 3.23).
3.17      KDFC does not have access to domestic currency deposits, nor to
the various Government subsidized funds (such as the NIF), nor is it able to
issue bonds for relending purposes. Consequently KDFC's domestic currency
financing has been limited. KDFC's domestic currency resources have, however,
been built up from W 3.35 billion /1 at its establishment to W 15.4 billion
as of end-June 1978, of which W 11.1 billion was equity. KDFC is in the
process of doubling its share capital (para. 3.33) by a further W 5 billion,
which represents a substantial effort at domestic currency resource mobili-
zation. KDFC has broadened its equity base mainly to enlarge its capacity
for raising additional foreign currency loans rather than increasing its
domestic cdurrency operations. Finally, at the project level, KDFC has played
a useful role in mobilizing domestic savings by requiring its borrowers to
increase their equity contributions (para. 3.13).
Promotional Activities
3.18       As a private development finance institution, KDFC has endeavored
to contribute to the realization of the Government's economic plans and
policies. Its financial operations have deliberately encouraged, inter alia:
(a) the promotion of export and import substitution industries; (b) the
diversification of sectoral and geographical distribution of industries;
(c) the creation of additional employment opportunities, where appropriate;
(d) the diversification of clientele through the financing of new ventures
and broadening of share ownership; (e) the provision of managerial and
technical/project-design assistance to clients; and (f) the mobilization of
domestic and foreign currency resources. KDFC's performance in achieving
these objectives via its financial operations has been discussed in
paras. 3.04 to 3.12. As a development institution, KDFC has gone beyond the
provision of financial assistance and increasingly undertaken broader
promotional activities. KDFC's Development Strategy Statements for 1976-77
and 1977-78 have outlined its specific promotional objectives and the insti-
tutions and mechanisms through which they were to be pursued. These objec-
tives - which on the whole focus on the same elements as outlined in a-f
above - can be consolidated as follows:             I

(i) development of the Korean financial system;
(ii) intensification of efforts to mobilize foreiQn currency resources;
(iii) development of industrial linkages; and
(iv) diversification of KDFC's portfolio.
KDFC's record in implementing these developmental objectives via its pro-
motional activities has been remarkable. These activities are discussed
below.
3.19      Korea Development Leasing Corporation (KDLC).  As a contribution to
the development of the Korean financial system [(i) in para. 3.18], and as a
supplement to its own development banking activities, KDFC promoted and
jointly established KDLC with the Orient Leasing Co. Ltd. (OLC) of Japan in
February 1975. KDLC has an authorized share capital of W 3 billion of which
W 1.8 billion (US$3.7 million) was paid-in; domestic shareholders hold 51% of
its shares, foreign shareholders 49%; KDFC is the largest shareholder with a
share of 30.8%, OLC holds 29.0% and IFC 10.0%.
3.20      KDLC writes financial leases for a wide range of industrial,
agricultural, transport, construction, educational and medical equipment (as
well as for the real estate necessary to operate such equipment) and issues
guarantees on international leasing contracts. Its operations since its
establishment have grown rapidly. As of end-March 1978 KDLC had written 186
lease contracts amounting to W 25 billion (US$52 million). This heavy demand
for leasing is partly the result of tax and tariff advantages granted by the
Government to lessee and lessor alike. But, more significantly, the heavy
demand for leasing is mainly attributable to the fact that many small- and
medium-sized firms lack an adequate equity base (high debt:equity ratios)
and the required collateral to obtain medium- and long-term finance, and thus
are unable to purchase equipment outright. In contrast, lease financing is
unrelated to the lessee's capital base as the ownership of the financed
equipment remains with the lessor, and therefore the lease instrument has
enabled small- and medium-sized enterprises to overcome this borrowing
constraint and obtain what in effect amounts to an unsecured loan. Indeed,
in 1977 the major portion of KDLC's business was with these companies, 67% of
KDLC's leases and 52% of its lease amounts being contracted with small and
medium-sized firms. The rapid growth of leasing, besides alleviating this
borrowing constraint, has also contributed to the development of the domestic
capital goods industry [(iii) in para. 3.18] by increasingly leasing equipment
procured in Korea; KDLC increased its domestically procured equipment from
16% of total equipment purchased in 1976 to 24% in 1977.
3.21      On the whole it is evident that the lease instrument is especially
well suited to some of the present needs of Korean industry, and KDLC's per-
formance in the context of this rapidly growing market has been satisfactory
(it attained a leasing market share of 49.2% in early 1978). Its main
constraint has been, not lack of demand, but shortage of funds, and therefore



- 23 -
in 1976 KDFC requested, and the Bank approved, a US$5 million subloan to KDLC
out of the fifth Bank loan (No. 1145-KO) to KDFC. This subloan has now been
fully allocated by KDLC to 28 leasing projects over the period 1976-78; of
which 31% were for textiles and 26% for the food and beverage sector; and
which in aggregate created 1,800 jobs at a fixed investment cost per incre-
mental job of US$10,600./1 KDLC has also secured further foreign currency
resources including an IFC-syndicated loan of US$15 million.
3.22      Korea Investment and Finance Corporation (KIFC).  Under the sponsor-
ship of KDFC and IFC, KIFC was established in 1971 for the purpose of
dealing in all kinds of short-term credit instruments, underwriting and
distribution of corporate securities. Its establishment represented the
first step in displacing the unorganized "curb market." KIFC was the first
institution to operate under the Short-Term Financing Business Law of 1972,
and subsequently 10 other short-term financing companies were established in
1973, 1974 and 1977. The short-term financial needs of Korean industry are
considerable, the level of demand has therefore been high and the growth of
operations rapid, the 11 companies having a combined portfolio of discounted
notes outstanding of W 613 billion (US$1.3 billion) as of end-1977, of which
KIFC accounted for W 58 billion. KIFC's performance has been satisfactory,
net income after tax amounting to W 2.8 billion in 1977, representing 94% of
average equity.
3.23      Joint Financing and Resource Mobilization.  Apart from indirectly
mobilizing domestic currency resources by requiring its borrowers to increase
their equity contributions (para. 3.13), KDFC has arranged joint financing
for 20 projects between 1968 and end June 1978 with the dual objective of
mobilizing foreign currency resources [para. 3.18(ii)] as well as enabling KDFC
to participate in the financing of projects too large for it to finance alone.
KDFC's own foreign currency financing of these 20 projects amounted to
US$34 million while the other financiers contributed US$90 million (Annex 4,
Table 9). Nearly half of these joint financing schemes involved new indus-
trial ventures. IFC participated in the financing of 3 of the 20 projects.
The level of joint financing activity increased markedly in 1977 during which
8 of the 20 projects were financed, involving US$15 million in KDFC financing
and US$19 million from other sources. In addition KDFC assisted Korean enter-
prises to borrow directly from foreign financiers in 1977; the Sam Yang Tire
M4anufacturing Company Ltd. borrowed US$3.7 million from Trident International
Finance Ltd (Hong Kong) via KDFC's intermediation.
3.24      While the level of KDFC's joint financing activity of recent years
represents a substantive contribution to foreign resource mobilization, the
Goverment's recent restrictions on the borrowing of foreign currency by
corporations from abroad will most probably reduce this level in the immediate
future. Therefore KDFC intends to increase its joint financing with domestic
banks and foreign banks operating in Korea, and also to actively support the
recent Government emphasis on the promotion of joint industrial ventures. In
/1 For a more complete analysis of KDLC's subprojects financed via KDFC's
1976 subloan, see Annex 4, Table 4.



- 24 -
this connection, KDFC entered into a Cooperation Agreement with the Belgian
Corporation for International Investment (SBI) in April 1978, designed to
promote joint ventures and long-term financing of manufacturing and agro-
industrial projects.
3.25      Development of Industrial Linkages [para. 3.18 (iii)].  KDFC's
promotional efforts in this field basically involve two activities: the
Korea Technology Advancement Corporation (K-TAC), and KDFC's assistance to
the machinery industries, particularly the encouragement of subcontracting
arrangements within that sector.
3.26      K-TAC was established in 1974 under the joint sponsorship of KDFC
and the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), with the objective
of promoting the commercial exploitation of the patents and technical proc-
esses developed by KIST. In 1976, K-TAC promoted two new projects for bronze
powder and cordierite saggar production, both with KDFC's assistance in the
form of loans and equity participation. Progress has been satisfactory, the
latter project is already profitable in its first operating year, and the
former project will be spun off as a separate legal entity within 1978, as
planned. More recently, FIST has developed a new manufacturing technique for
Vivatax, a raw material for a fungicide, which K-TAC intends to establish as a
project at an estimated cost of US$2.5 million. It is presently being ap-
aised by KDFC. More generally, the scale of future K-TAC activities will be
increased as it intends to become involved in the promotion of direct transfers
of advanced foreign technologies into Korean industry by, inter alia, estab-
lishing new joint-enterprises and seeking KDFC's financial assistance, in
addition to its present promotion of KIST's technical inventions and modifi-
cations.
3.27      In line with recent Government policies, KDFC has given high prior-
ity to the machinery industry, especially to the small- and medium-sized
producers as most of the large scale machinery projects are beyond KDFC's
financial and technical reach. In 1977, 4 machinery projects and 18 mach-
inery-related capital goods projects were approved, involving respectively
US$3 million and a total of US$22 million in foreign currency financing. In
some cases, KDFC has also been assisting the domestic machinery sector
indirectly by financing the foreign currency component of domestically
procured capital goods;/l about US$9 million of Bank Loan No. 1461-KO was
utilized in this manner in 1977, as well as a further US$6 million from the
second ADB loan. Through its financial support of this sector, KDFC has
increasingly noticed instances where the successful development of large-
scale machinery projects is hindered by, inter alia, insufficient subcon-
tracting arrangements. In the future KDFC therefore intends to stress the
promotion of subcontracting, particularly examining the possibility of
manufacturing components and parts for its machinery and automobile clients
on a subcontracting basis, thereby stimulating small and medium scale activity
and strengthening industrial linkages.
/1   A percentage of 60% representing the estimated foreign exchange com-
ponent of domestically manufactured capital goods is eligible for
financing under the (sixth) IBRD Loan No. 1461-K0.

3.28      KDFC-RCB Assistance to Small Industries in Less Developed Areas.
In order to diversify its portfolio [para. 3.18(iv)] in terms of geographical
distribution and a broader clientele, KDFC signed cooperation agreements with
four /L of the ten Regional Commercial Banks (RCBs) between August 1975 and
December 1976. The basic objective of this scheme is to channel foreign
currency funds (provided by KDFC) to projects identified and appraised by the
RCBs along guidelines (which are detailed and appropriate) issued to them by
KDFC. The RCBs finance the domestic currency requirements and assume respon-
sibility for the supervision of projeces.  KDFC has specified US$500,000 as
the normal ceiling on foreign currency loans to any single enterprise under
this scheme.
3.29      In 1976 an amount of US$5 million was allocated by KDFC from the
fifth Bank loan to finance 18 KDFC-RCB projects. In 1977 an amount of
US$4 million from the second ADB loan went to 12 KDFC-RCB projects. A
further US$7 million out of the sixth Bank loan is expected to be fully
committed to KDFC-RCB projects by end-1978. Partial economic indicators for
these projects are summarized in Annex 4, Table 4; 40% of the 1977 loans (by
amount) went to borrowers with total assets of W 500 million (US$1 million)
or less; 83% to borrowers with less than 200 employees; 70% to new projects;
and 24% to the metal products sector, 27% to textiles and 23% to the dairy
products sector (Annex 4, Table 10).
3.30      Via this scheme, the RCBs can participate in different projects
(i.e. those requiring foreign currency financing) and simultaneously broaden
their clientele, and their staff have received training in appraisal tech-
niques at KDFC (eight officers, two from each RCB, attended a course at KDFC
in 1977). For KDFC, this scheme has had an immediate impact on the geograph-
ical and clientele diversification of its portfolio, without the need to
first set up a branch network. It has also increased its interaction with
other financial institutions [para. 3.18(i)], and most importantly, it has
provided a channel through which it can extend foreign currency financing to
small scale borrowers in less developed areas   However, it is not entirely
without problems, for instance, the Chunbuk Bank, being located in a prin-
cipally rural area has not yet been able to identify a suitable project for
financing under this scheme./2
3.31      KDFC has also pursued the diversification of its portfolio by
continuing to support projects in the agro-industrial sector; in 1977
total loans of US$2.1 million were approved for 5 dairy projects, and
a W 200 million convertible debenture subscription was approved for the Dong
Yang Farm Company (for viticulture and hops).
/1   The four Regional Commercial Banks were:  Bank of Busan, Daegu Bank,
Chunbuk Bank and Kwangju Bank.
/2   The Chunbuk Regional Study (see Annex 3) is specifically charged with
identifying suitable projects in this region; it should be completed in
mid-1978.

Development Strategy
3.32      Having made substantial progress in achieving the development
objectives outlined in its previous Development Strategy, KDFC has adopted a
new Development Strategy Statement for 1978/79 (Annex 3) which covers five
main areas: (a) a study to be carried out in close consultation with the Bank
Group to identify the various options for future diversification and expansion
of IDFC's functions and operations, in the context of the rapidly changing and
growing Korean economy (paras. 3.67 to 3.69); (b) project promotion and
resource allocation; specifically continuing to finance small scale and/or
labor intensive projects via the RCB scheme, placing increased emphasis on
subcontracting arrangements especially in machinery and related industries,
and intensifying efforts to establish jointly with DEG an engineering and
consulting firm (as a separate legal entity) to undertake feasibility studies
and provide advisory services for both public and private enterprises;
(c) resource mobilization; KDFC will endeavor to raise US$250 million foreign
commercial funds between 1978-82 so as to gradually reduce its dependence on
official sources, and will mobilize domestic currency resources via its
planned W 5 billion share capital increase; (d) research activities focussing
on the Chunbuk Area Study; and (e) KDFC will strengthen and adapt its organi-
zation by increasing the staff of its Project Promotion Department and consider
establishing a branch in the Busan area in the near future. The precise form,
magnitude and speed of implementing these various development activities will
be closely linked with the ultimate conclusions of the Special Study on KDFC's
future role.
B. INSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS
Functions and Legal Status, Ownership, Organization and Staff
3.33      Functions and Legal Status, Ownership and Share Capital.  KDFC is
a privately owned corporation established under the Korean Commercial Code.
Its main objective is to assist the development of private productive enter-
prises, thereby supporting the development of the Korean economy. Apart
from IFC (holding 10.5%), no single shareholder owns more than 4% of the
share capital. KDFC's ownership is therefore reasonably broad based./l
The 11 foreign shareholders (including IFC) accounted for about 35% of KDFC's
paid-in share capital as of December 31, 1977. Apart from IFC and the German
Development Corporation (DEG) which is a semi-public institution, the foreign
shareholders are commercial banks mostly from the US and Japan (Annex 4,
Table 11). KDFC's present authorized capital is W 10 billion. KDFC's initial
paid-in share capital of W 1.35 billion in 1968 had increased to W 5 billion
by end-1977 through stock dividends and two rights issues in 1973 and 1976.
The Board of Directors decided in February 1978 that KDFC will increase its
share capital by a further W 5 billion (to a total of W 10 billion) in 1978,
in order to strengthen its equity base and correspondingly its borrowing
capacity (further details in Annex 4, Table 12).
/1   Particularly among the 377 domestic shareholders, of whom only 8 hold more
than 1.75% of KDFC's shares.



- 27 -
3.34      Management and Organization.  KDFC has a 13-member Board.  The
Korean directors are all leading members of the financial and business
community. Five directors, including IFC's representative (Mr. N. Nishihara)
represent the foreign shareholders. Mr. C.S. Hong, a prominent industrialist
and former Chairman of FKI,/1 who has been the Chairman of the Board since
KDFC's establishment in 1967, resigned the Chairmanship in May 1978, while
continuing to serve as a Director. He was succeeded as Chairman by Mr. C.H.
Kim (previously the President of KDFC). Mr. B.E. Kim (former President of
the Korea Exchange Bank) was elected as President. KDFC's high managerial
standards are expected to be maintained. Between Board meetings, authority to
conduct KDFC's operations and approve loans and investments under US$5 million
is delegated to an Executive Committee consisting of four board members (with
the Chairman and President as ex officio members). KDFC's President has been
given authority to approve loans and investments up to US$500,000 under KDFC's
scheme of cooperation with the RCBs. KDFC remains one of the best managed
DFCs with which the Bank Group is associated, and it has considerable depth at
the management level. The Board and Executive Committee are listed in Annex 1.
3.35      Staff.  A breakdown of KDFC's staff, which numbered a total of 135
at end-March 1978, is provided in Annex 4, Table 13. The quality of KDFC's
professional staff, both in terms of academic and professional background,
remains excellent at all levels. This is reflected in the consistently high
standard of KDFC's operations. KDFC has endeavoured to maintain its salaries
at roughly comparable levels with equivalent positions in private industry
and at slightly higher levels than other financial institutions in Korea.
Nevertheless, staff turnover accelerated markedly in recent years, with nine
professionals leaving in 1976, another nine in 1977 and a further six leaving
by end-March 1978./2 The main reason for these high rates of turnover seems
to be the attraction of more rapid promotion prospects in fast-expanding
industry (particularly attracting KDFC's junior officers), rather than
comparative salary levels per se. KDFC is not the type of institution which
could or should match such rates of personnel promotion, but in an effort to
meet the competition from industry, KDFC has recently expanded its fringe
benefits package, which now includes staff housing loans /3, family medical
insurance and subsidized recreational opportunities. In addition, staff
training abroad is being considerably expanded, and it is expected that eight
professionals will receive overseas training /4 in 1978. As a result of
_1 Federation of Korean Industries.
/2 Excluding for all three years the professional staff made available to
KDLC and KIFC.
/3 This represents a very strong incentive given the rapid inflation in
house prices and difficulty of obtaining sufficient financing from the
Korea Housing Bank.
/4 Two staff members are going to the Industrial Bank of Japan for one
month, other training arrangements remain to be finalized.



- 28 -
these added incentives, future staff turnover is expected to subside. So
far, staff turnover has had no noticeable adverse effect on the quality of
KDFC's operations, which is due to KDFC's basic staff strength, and also
because the turnover has not involved KDFC's key staff. Moreover, KDFC has
had no difficulty in recruiting new staff /1 of a similarly high quality.
KDFC intends to recruit 13 additional professionals in 1978. KDFC's recruit-
ment plan to 1982, detailed in Annex 4, Table 13 is adequate. Besides
intensified foreign training, KDFC is also stepping up domestic and in-house
training, especially focusing on project appraisal techniques, finance,
management, law, taxation and accounting. These courses have also occasion-
ally involved the RCB's staff.
Operational Policies
3.36      The Statement of Investment and Operational Policies (Annex 2),
adopted in 1967 and subsequently amended on seven occasions, sets out the
guidelines for KDFC's operations. There have been no substantive changes
since the previous Bank appraisal. The Statement outlines the usual finan-
cial prudence limits. Paragraph 10 specifies that KDFC's maximum financial
exposure (including loans, share capital and guarantees or any combination
thereof) in any single enterprise will not normally exceed 25% of KDFC's
paid-in capital, free reserves and the subordinated Government loan. As of
December 31, 1977 KDFC's normal exposure limit defined in this manner stood
at W 2.72 billion, and this limit had been exceeded in only four cases up to
that date. In three cases the excess was small (ranging from W 5.8 mil-
lion to W 119.8 million) and in only one instance was the excess large
(W 1.16 billion). The increase in KDFC's paid-in share capital currently
underway will eliminate these few instances of excess exposure altogether.
In addition to the general Statement of Investment and Operational Policies,
KDFC has outlined its more specific development objectives for the immediate
future in the Development Strategy covering 1978/79 (Annex 3).
Project Appraisal and Supervision
3.37      Project Appraisal.  The procedures, quality and ex-post accuracy
(para. 3.38) of KDFC's appraisal work continue to be of a very high standard.
KDFC's appraisal methods and reports are frequently used as models and
training materials by other Korean institutions as well as some overseas
DFCs. Technical, marketing, management, financial and economic matters
are usually analyzed thoroughly. KDFC's economic analysis is sufficiently
sophisticated, and since June 1973 ERRs have been routinely calculated
for projects seeking foreign exchange financing in excess of US$1 million,
irrespective of the source of financing. The coverage of KDFC's project
appraisal is being further expanded and refined by explicitly focusing on
energy matters, such as total requirements, possible alternative energy
sources, and energy-saving techniques and designs. In addition, the possible
/L   A recent selection in 1977 showed a ratio of three applicants per avail-
able position.



- 29 -
adverse ecological implications, if any, of a proposed project are evaluated
in accordance with the Pollution Prevention Act of 1971, and the Environment
Conservation Act of 1977. Of particular relevance to its appraisal techniques
and standards are the continuing close links which KDFC maintains with the
Korean Institute of Science and Technology. Furthermore, the proposed
establishment of the Engineering Consulting Firm (Annex 3) will provide KDFC
with another source of expertise, particularly in the appraisal of technical
aspects in the preinvestment phase. It is therefore expected that the high
standards of KDFC's appraisal will not only be maintained but actually be
further improved.
3.38      Supervision.  The Operations Department, numbering 21 professionals,
is responsible for project follow-up activities.J/ KDFC's supervision proce-
dures are systematic and thorough. The subborrowers' reporting require-
ments are comprehensive and are used by the Operations Department as a basis
for an annual follow-up report on each project which analyses, inter alia,
sales, market shares, price trends and financial performance, particularly
liquidity and earnings.  In addition, actual project costs /2 and benefits
are collected and used to calculate ex-post FRRs and ERRs, which are compared
to the ex-ante appraisal estimates. A small sample of such comparisons was
as follows:
FRR                      ERR
Projected   Actual       Projected   Actual
1.  Ihn Sung Fisheries                     -          -           24.0      20.2
2.  Dongsue Shipping                    23.9       17.4           23.9      17.4
3.  Dong Yang Tinplate                  50.0       33.5           53.0      39.7

A high degree of predictive accuracy is indicated by these figures, reflect-
ing the high standard of appraisal work. This predictive accuracy is even
more remarkable when it is considered that the ex-ante estimates were made in
a period of sharply fluctuating prices and trade flows.
/1  KDFC intends to reorganize its departmental structure and functional
responsibilities in the second half of 1978 (Annex 5).
/2  A study of a sample of 19 recent subproject for which implementation
was completed in 1976 and 1977 showed 12 cases of cost underrun ranging
from 0.1% to 10%, with an average of 4.5% , and 7 cases of cost overrun
ranging from 0.1% to 19%, averaging 7.3%.



- 30 -
Procurement and Disbursement
3.39      KDFC's procurement and disbursement procedures are designed to
ensure an efficient and appropriate use of funds. KDFC normally requires a
reasonable degree of competition, involving a comparision of at least three
quotations from potential suppliers. In 1977, the equipment requirements under
26 loans, involving about US$26 million in KDFC financing, were procured in this
manner. Occasionally KDFC insists on international competitive bidding, and in
1977 two loans involving US$5.4 million used this method of procurement. More
frequently, and particularly for expansion projects, the specifications and
technology of existing equipment effectively compels the procurement of new
equipment from the same supplier. In 1977 such conitractual procurement was made
for 38 loans involving nearly US$39 million. In all cases of project procurement
the merits of the various alternative methods and offers are evaluated jointly by
the subborrower and the Operations Department. The final procurement contract is
subject to KDFC's approval and disbursements are subsequently authorized against
submission of satisfactory documents and progress reports on project implemen-
tation. KDFC closely monitors the procurement process and also collects exten-
sive data on the actual expenditure of its loans.
C. OPERATIONS
Overall Lending Operations
3.40      The scope of KDFC's operations, particularly its clearly distinct
role vis a vis the functions of other development finance institutions
operating in Korea, has been outlined in para. 3.02. KDFC's financing opera-
tions fall into two broad categories: (a) medium- and long-term capital
(equipment) loans in foreign and domestic currency; and (b) domestic currency
investments in equity shares and convertible debentures. KDFC's guarantee
operations are negligible. KDFC's operations, up to June 1978, are summarized
in Annex 4, Table 14. Cumulative commitments from KDFC's inception to June 30,
1978 stood at W 160.6 billion (US$331 million) of which foreign currency lending
accounted for 89.7%, domestic currency lending 5.8%, equity investments 2.8% and
convertible debentures 1.7%. Cumulative disbursements from 1968 to June 30, 1978
stood at W 168.7 billion/l and the total amount outstanding as of June 30, 1978
amounted to W 123.9 billion.  Equity and debenture investments are discussed in
para. 3.48.
3.41      Foreign Currency Lending Operations.  Cumulative foreign currency
loan approvals over the 1968-June 30, 1978 period amounted to US$324.3 million
representing 348 loans. Again on an approval basis, KDFC's foreign currency
lending in 1977 was US$70.0 million, an increase of 14% over the 1976 level
of US$61.5 million, which itself was 43% greater than the 1975 total of
US$42.9 million. This year-to-year comparison is slightly distorted by the
unusually rapid growth in the 1976 foreign currency loan approvals which was
partly the result of the availability of the US$20 million IFC-syndicated
commercial loan. This particular instance in 1976 underlines the more
/1   For the method of calculating "won equivalent" disbursements, see
Annex 4, Table 14, footnote f.



- 31 -
general point that the year-to-year growth pattern has been irregular through-
out because the level of approvals has typically been a direct function of
resource availability. The delayed effectiveness of the ADB loan in 1974 and
the joint availability of the first ADB loan and fifth Bank loan for part of
1975 are therefore clearly reflected in the sharp fluctuations of KDFC's
approval figures for those years. Similarly, the simultaneous effectiveness
in late 1977 of the sixth Bank loan of US$70 million and the APCO 11 syndi-
cated commercial loan of US$20 million can be expected to increase the growth
rate of foreign currency loan approvals for 1978. (The half year figures to June
30, 1978 confirm this expectation, with approvals of US$44.5 million so far).
3.42      Domestic Currency Lending Operations.  As KDB and MIB are statutorily
authorized - unlike KDFC - to accept domestic currency deposits and issue
domestic currency bonds for resource mobilization purposes, KDFC considers
that these institutions are better equipped to handle domestic currency
lending. In contrast, KDFC concentrates on foreign currency lending and
considers its (limited) domestic currency financing as an ancillary service
to its borrowers of foreign currency. Hence KDFC's domestic currency loans
accounted for only 5.8% of its total financial assistance from 1968 to
June 30, 1978. Over this period, cumulative domestic currency loan approvals
amounted to W 9.5 billion (US$19.6 million) involving 96 loans.
Characteristics of KDFC's Lending Operations
3.43      Sectoral Distribution.  Annex 4, Tables 15-16 summarize the sec-
toral distribution of KDFC's loan approvals for the period 1968 to 1977.
Only one sector exceeds 20% of KDFC's total loan portfolio (metal products,
machinery and equipment, with 21.9%), reflecting KDFC's policy to achieve and
maintain a diversified sectoral distribution of its portfolio.   The three
largest recipients of KDFC loans were metal products, machinery and equipment
(21.9%), textiles, wearing apparel and leather (18.3%) and marine transporta-
tion services (17.8%). In 1977, textiles financing declined abruptly com-
pared with 1976 (from 26% to 5%), while the share of metal products more than
doubled between 1976 and 1977 (from 16% to 36%).
3.44      Annex 4, Table 16 presents the sectoral distribution of KDFC's
approvals at several levels of disaggregation. On a cumulative basis the
manufacturing sector accounted for 66% of KDFC's approved loans up to end-
1977, nonmanufacturing accounting for the remaining 34%. Within manufactur-
ing, the three industry groups had the following shares of KDFC loan approvals
on a cumulative basis to end-1977: capital goods industries 26.4%, consumer
goods industries 22.7% and intermediate goods industries 16.6%. This distri-
bution is essentially the result of events in 1977, when loan approvals to
consumer goods industries (notably textiles) declined to one-fifth of the
1976 level, while the share of both other industry groups in KDFC's loan
portfolio continued to grow rapidly. On a cumulative basis, chemicals and
metal products are the two largest subgroups of heavy industries in KDFC's
manufacturing sector portfolio. Within nonmanufacturing, transportation
(mainly marine shipping) is the largest subgroup, accounting for 19.5% of
KDFC's total financing.

3.45      Size Distribution.  Annex 4, Table 17 (Section C) summarizes the
size distribution of KDFC's lending from 1968 to end-1977. On a value basis,
the shift towards lending to projects requiring large amounts of financial
assistance continued in 1977, when about 75% of KDFC's lending was allocated
to projects of more than WI 500 million (US$1 million), reflecting the growing
size of investment projects in Korea. However, based on the number of loans,
more than 50% of KDFC's loans in 1977 were for W 300 million (US$0.6 million)
or less, a situation basically unchanged from 1976 and not significantly
different from the entire ten years of operations between 1968 and 1977./j 
This shows that KDFC, in accor7dance with the Government (and its own) develop-
ment strategy, is continuing its efforts to at least partially cater for the
needs of small- and medium-scale firms as an addition to its main business
focus of lending to relatively large industrial enterprises.  The average Size
of KDFC's lending /1 (excluding the KDFC-RCB loans) was US$1.14 million per
project in 1976 which increased to US$1.38 million per project in 1977. Under
KDFC's scheme of cooperation with the RCBs, 18 loans were made in 1976 at an
average of US$280,000 per project, and another 12 loans averaging US$320,000
per project in 1977. It is apparent, therefore, that the average magnitude of
all KDFC loans per project (US$0.8 million in 1974, US$1.0 million in 1975,
US$0.9 million in 1976, US$1.1 million in 1977) obscures the diversity
of KDFC's lending operations and more especially the allocation of loans to
small- and medium-scale enterprises through its hitherto limited, but quali-
tatively useful, cooperation effort with the RCBs. /2
3.46      Geographical Distribution (Annex 4, Table 17, Section D).  Exclud-
ing the fishing and marine transport industries, the share of the Seoul area
in KDFC's financing declined from 26% in 1968-72 to 20% in 1968-77. Con-
versely, the Kyung-Gi province surrounding Seoul has increased from 11% to
22%. The Busan area has maintained a fairly constant level of about 7%
throughout, while its surrounding area, South Kyung-Sang Province, marginally
increased its share from about 4% to 6%. The North Kyung-Sang Province,
which includes Taegu, the third major industrial region in Korea, and an
important textile area, has maintained its share of about 10%. The geo-
graphical distribution of KDFC's projects conforms with the general objective
of wider industrial disperal throughout Korea as a whole.
3.47      Repeat Loans.  Annex 4, Table 18 summarizes KDFC's repeat loan
operations since its inception, and indicates that KDFC has been reason-
ably successful in diversifying its clientele. As of end-1977, subborrowers
receiving more than one loan accounted for 34% (by number) of KDFC's 223
clients, while the equivalent end-1976 figure was 37%. Repeat loans (by
amount) represented about 55% of cumulative loan approvals since IKDFC's
inception, which again, is ansimprovement on the end-1976 level of 59%.
/1  Excluding US$5 million subloan made in 1976 to ICDLC, which was on-lent
to a total of 28 projects at an average lease amount of W 87 million
(US$180,000). KDFC's lending to KDLC is also a worthwhile and effective
method of meeting the needs of small- and medium-scale enterprises.
/2  As these calculations are made in current prices, it could be argued that
by number of loans, KDFC has actually increased the proportion of small
loans (W 300 million or less) over time (if expressed in constant prices).



- 33 -
About 24% (by amount) of KDFC's repeat loans have been allocated to textiles,
18% to marine transportation and a further 16% to metal products, machinery
and equipment.
Investment Operations
3.48      A summary of KDFC's investmentl operations is presented in Annex 4,
Table 19. Between 1968 and end-1977 convertible debentures and equity par-
ticipations accounted for only 4.6% of KDFC's total financial assistance,
and 18% and 27% respectively of KDFC's total domestic currency approvals
(W 15.2 billion), the remaining 55% being domestic currency loans. KDFC is
giving increasing priority to these investment activities because it con-
siders them to provide potentially substantial, even disproportionate,
assistance to the establishment and successful development of enterprises.
In accordance with this objective, KDFC had by end-1977, selected 26 compa-
nies for equity investments,/l 17 of which were not listed, 3 were operating
at a loss in- their initial start-up phase, and 5 were in the preoperating
stage. Generally KDFC makes its equity investments (like its domestic
currency loans) as a supplement to foreign currency loans, and at end-1977
the 26 companies in its investment portfolio had received loans totaling W
17.8 billion (US$37 million) from KDFC.
Utilization of Bank Loan No. 1461-KO
3.49      As of June 30, 1978, KDFC had committed US$61.9 million of the
proceeds of the sixth Bank loan (US$70 million) for 38 subprojects. These
Bank resources constituted about 92% of KDFC's total financial assistance
(US$67.6 million) to these sub-projects, which itself financed about 31% of
the US$220.6 million total project costs (of which 52% was foreign exchange).
KDFC's subloans ranged in size from US$92,000 to US$7.6 million (for petro-
chemicals) with an average of US$1.3 million./2 By amount, the chemical/
petrochemical and paper industries accounted for about 36% of KDFC's approvals,
but by project, fisheries (including deep-sea fisheries) and metal projects were
the most numerous. Twenty-one of the subloans were for expansion purposes, nine
were new projects and six were repeat projects (nearly all fisheries). Financial
rates of return are satisfactory, ranging from 15% to 44%, with an average of
about 25%, while the ERRs range from 15% to 68%, averaging nearly 30%. Further
details are summarized in Annex 4, Table 21.
3.50      Preliminary estimates indicate that 2,884 incremental jobs will be
generated by these subprojects at a fixed investment cost per- job ranging
/1  KDFC outstanding equity investment portfolio in these 26 companies at
end-1977 was W 4.2 billion.
/2  Excluding three subprojects (petrochemical, chemical and paper) which
are unusually capital intensive and therefore misleadingly distort the
average subloan size.



- 34 -
from US$3,000 to US$234,000 (marine transportation), with an average of
US$30,300 /1 (see para. 3.06 for a comparison with all KDFC's projects). On the
whole, this level of average fixed cost per incremental job reflects the fact
that KDFC was set up primarily to operate in the medium- to large-scale sectors
of industry and that in recent years it-has, in line with Government policy,
financed a number of projects in priority sectors which are generally capital
intensive (e.g. chemicals, marine transportation and metals). In addition,
this average fails to reveal the successful efforts that KDFC has been making
to meet the financial needs of some smaller, typically more labor intensive,
enterprises via its RCB scheme and leasing projects through KDLC.
D. FINANCIAL POSITION, PERFORMANCE AND RESOURCES
Financial Position
3.51      Assets.  Balance sheets for the years 1974 to 1977 are summarized in
Annex 4, Table 22. As of December 31, 1977, KDFC's total assets stood at W
109.9 billion (US$227 million) following a reasonably steady /2 annual growth
of 35% since 1974 (and reaching W 133.1 billion by June 30, 1978). Current
assets amounted to W 20.2 billion (or 18% of total assets) having increased at
the same annual rate as total assets (and stood at W 22.4 billion on June 30,
1978). The 1977 growth in total assets was almost entirely due to the rapid
increase in the foreign currency loan portfolio from W 71.2 billion (US$147
million) in 1976 to W 93.0 billion (US$ 192 million) in 1977. Consequently
KDFC's foreign currency loan portfolio /3 accounted for 85% of total assets in
1977 compared with 81% in 1976 (and had increased to nearly 87% in the first half
of 1978).
3.52      Liabilities and Equity. Of KDFC's total assets at December 31,
1977, 77.0% were financed by long-term liabilities, 13.1% by current lia-
bilities (84.5% by total foreign currency borrowings), and 9.9% by equity.
The growth in KDFC's foreign currency loan portfolio in 1977 was 30%, almost
entirely financed by foreign currency borrowings in that year. In 1977,
total foreign currency borrowings accounted for 98% of KDFC's total long-term
debt, a marginal increase compared with 1976. KDFC has made satisfactory
progress in diversifying its foreign currency resources; its outstanding
borrowings from the Bank have decreased as a proportion of its total foreign
currency debt from 97% in 1974 to 63% in 1977 (and to 58% at June 30, 1978).
KDFC's domestic currency borrowing consisted of a Government subordinated loan of
W 2,025 million, which KDFC started repaying in 1977.
/1 Again excluding the three large capital intensive subprojects which, if
included, would raise the average fixed investment cost per incremental
job to US$43,500.
/2   The growth in total assets in 1976 was disproportionately large
following a bunching of approvals and disbursements during 1975 and
1976.
/3 Including the portion of loans due within one year.



- 35 -
3.53      KDFC's net worth stood at W 10.9 billion at end-1977, an increase
of 14% over the 1976 level. Paid in share capital amounted to W 5 billion /1
and reserves and retained earnings accounted for the remainder, W 5,886 million
(representing 54%). By June 30, 1978, KDFC's net worth had increased to
W 11.1 billion.
3.54.     Liquidity and Debt:Equity Ratio.  KDFC's current ratio showed a
marginal decrease from 1.5 in 1976 to 1.4 in 1977 (and to 1.2 at Juie 30, 1978),
still leaving KDFC with a comfortable liquidity position. The long-term debt:
equity ratio increased from 7.7:1 in 1976 to 8.7:1 in 1977 because the growth
rate of KDFC's disbursements and foreign currency indebtedness (30% p.a.) exceeded
the growth rate of its net worth (14% p.a.). However, this 8.7:1 ratio is still
well within the contractual limit of 10:1 /2 and, in addition, the future ratio
will be significantly reduced following the completion of the planned W 5 billion
share issue in late 1978. KDFC's debt service coverage remained at 1.3, the same
level as in 1975 and 1976, and is satisfactory.
Financial Performance
3.55      Earnings.  Income and cash flow statements, and indicators of
financial performance are summarized in Annex 4, Tables 23-24. Gross income
for 1977 amounted t6 W 11.4 billion (US$23 million), with net income reaching
W 2.06 billion (US$4.24 million) in 1977. Net income has grown at an average
annual rate of 31%'between 1974 and 1977. Net return on net worth was 20.1%
in 1977 compared with 18.7% in 1976 and 15.8% in 1974. The level and growth
of KDFC's net income continues to be satisfactory. KDFC has also continued to
maintain stringent expenditure controls and has achieved a further relative
reduction in administrative expenses, which represented only 1.1% of average
total assets in 1977 /3 (compared with 1.6% in 1974). This is illustrative of
KDFC's sustained operational and managerial efficiency. Tables 23-24 also
present June 30, 1978 figures which, while half year figures should be
interpreted with caution, provisionally indicate that KDFC's 1978 performance
will show satisfactory growth.
3.56      Share Prices and Dividends.  In February 1977, the shareholders
approved an amendment to KDFC's Articles of Incorporation which increased
the number of authorized shares of common stock from 1 million to 10 million
and split each outstanding share of common stock 5 for 1. The new par value
of KDFC's shares is therefore W 1,000 per share, and at December 31, 1977 the
book value of these shares amounted to 218% of par value. Only 7.1% of the
average number of KDFC's outstanding shares were traded in 1977, and the
quoted price of KDFC shares has fallen from W 2,140 /4 in early 1974 to
W 1,110 in January 1978.
/1  An increase of a further W 5 billion in share capital is in process.
/2  Agreed during the negotiations for the Sixth Bank loan in 1977.  The long-term
debt:equity ratio increased to 10.5:1 by mid-1978 which was strictly temporary
and will fall to approximately 7.5:1 after the completion of the W 5 billion
rights issue of late 1978.
/3   This level compares favorably with the administrative expenses of
deposit money banks in Korea, particularly, of course, those with an
extensive branch network.
/4   Based on the new par value of W 1,000 per share.



- 36 -
3.57      From 1968 to 1975, KDFC declared a dividend of 10% in cash and 10%
in stock (with the exception of 1973, when a 15% cash dividend was declared).
Since the November 1976 rights issue, KDFC has declared a 20% cash dividend
annually. The payout ratio remained at a moderate 48.6% in 1977, virtually
unchanged from 1976.
Quality of Portfolio
3.58      Annex 4, Table 25 summarizes KDFC's collection performance and
arrears situation over the last four years. KDFC's portfolio remains of
exceptionally good quality, and KDFC's performance in collecting loans is
outstanding. KDFC experienced its first arrears problems in 1972 with six
loans in arrears for more than three months at the end of that year. The
financial measures enacted by the Government in August 1972 coupled with
KDFC's intensified collection efforts had by end-1973 reduced the number of
loans in arrears to only two. No loan was in arrears for over three months
at end-1975, end-1976 and end-1977. Collection ratios on principal and
interest over the last four years ranged from 98.0% to 100%, reflecting a
nearly perfect performance. Since its establishment in 1968, KDFC has had to
foreclose mortgages L]  on two loan accounts in 1974 and 1975, incurring a loss
of W 88 million which was written off. No loan reschedulings were made by
KDFC in 1976 and 1977./2 On the whole, therefore, it is very clear that
the quality of KDFC's portfolio and the success of its collection efforts have
been, and continue to be (as indicated by mid-1978 figures), excellent. However,
with W 42 billion (representing 43%) of KDFC's outstanding loan portfolio in 1977
still in the grace period, and with the increasing number of clients and loans,
some arrears are likely to re-emerge in the future. KDFC has made provisions
for doubtful accounts in 1977 of 1.4% /3 of the incremental loan portfolio.
Cumulative provisions for losses amounted to W 1.5 billion as of end-1977,/4
which
/1 In line with a practice followed by Korean commercial banks, the great
bulk (80%) of KDFC's loans (as of end 1977) were secured by payment
guarantees from commercial banks, and only 20% by mortgages on "real"
properties. KDFC requires bank guarantees if: (a) the applicant's assets
have already been pledged to other banks; (b) the applicant has a short
history and appears financially weak; and (c) when KDFC finances vessels
for marine transportation or deep-sea fishing.
/2   In 1975, the repayment schedules of three loans with a total principal
outstanding of W 1 million (US$2,000) were extended by one year.
/3   Based on estimated aggregate portfolio risk.  Provision expenses under
2% of the incremental portfolio benefit from tax exemption.
/4   Insofar as these provisions have historically not been required they
represent "hidden" earnings and if regarded as such would substantially
increase KDFC's net income.



- 37 -
together with free reserves accounted for 7.3% of the total portfolio;
a level which is more than adequate. The exceptional soundness of KDFC's
portfolio is attributable more to the quality of its appraisal and follow-up
work, to its ability to identify and remedy problem projects at an early
stage, and more importantly, to the recent strength of the Korean economy,
than it is to any overly conservative lending policy on KDFC's part.
Resources and Terms and Conditions of Lending
3.59      Resources.  KDFC's resource position as of June 30, 1978 1 is
shown in Annex 4, Table 26. As of that date, KDFC had mobilized total
resources of W 176.0 billion (US$363 million) of which 8.7% were domestic
and the remaining 91.3% foreign currency resources. At the same date, total
domestic currency resources amounted to W 15.4 billion of which W 5 billion
(about 32%) was share capital; reserves and noncash charges accounted for 40%
and 15% respectively; and the Government subordinated loan accounted for the
remaining 13%./2 As of June 30, 1978, KDFC's domestic currency resources
available for commitment amounted to W 3.45 billion. KDFC had mobilized
total foreign currency resources of US$331 million as of June 30, 1978, of
which 66% was from the Bank, 21% from ADB, 12% from commercial sources (a
1976 IFC-syndicated loan of US$17.8 million with a simultaneous US$2.0 mil-
lion loan from DEG, and in 1977 an APCO-syndicated loan of US$20.0 million)
and a further 1% from USAID. KDFC intends to increase its foreign commercial
borrowings in the immediate future starting with a planned US$30 million in
1978 (see Annex 3). In the first six months of 1978 the rate of disburse-
ment and commitment of foreign currency lending has been high so that as of
June 30, 1978, a balance of only US$16 million was available for commitment
and only US$8 million was available for approval.  On current trends,
therefore, KDFC's foreign currency resource position is increasingly tight
and the proposed US$30 million commercial loan will be required by the second
half of 1978 and will need to be supplemented by additional foreign currency
borrowings by end-1978.
3.60      Terms and Conditions of Lending.  The terms attached to KDFC's own
borrowings, and its relending rates are summarized in Annex 4, Table 27.
Although the Government does not formally regulate the level of interest rates
charged by KDFC, these are expected to be in line with those of other financial
and banking institutions in Korea. On the domestic currency side, KDFC's on-
lending rate for medium and long-term loans now stands at 21%, while 20% is
charged for priority projects. This represents slightly hig1er rates than the
domestic currency interest rates of other financial institutions in Korea
(Annex 4, Table 1).  On the foreign currency side, KDFC's standard on-lending
rate is 10.6% at present, with slight differential rate variations being applied
depending on the credit standing of the borrower and KDFC's evaluation of the
project's contribution to the economy. Despite an average rate of inflation of
11% (wholesale prices) over the last three years, the on-lending rate of 10.2-
10.6% p.a. can be considered positive in real terms because the subborrower
/1   For comparative purposes, the December 31, 1977 figures are also shown.
/2 KDFC is not at present authorized to accept domestic currency deposits,
nor to issue bonds for resource mobilization and relending purposes.



- 38 -
bears the full foreign exchange risk./l   This on-lending rate is also in line
with those charged by KDB on comparable foreign currency loans. On the subloans
financed from the proceeds of its foreign commercial loans, KDFC charges a
floating rate with a spread of 1.25 percentage points above its average borrowing
rate. With its increasing foreign currency borrowings from commercial sources,
KDFC's interest spread has been reduced to an aggregate level of 3.0 in 1977 from
3.9 in 1974. For all its foreign currency loans, KDFC passes on the foreign
exchange risk to the subborrowers.
Audit
3.61      KDFC's accounts have been audited in accordance with international
accounting standards by the Samil Accounting Corporation, a member firm of
the Coopers and Lybrand Group. Their reports meet the Bank Group's require-
ments. KDFC's accounts have always been certified without qualification.
E. PROSPECTS AND RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS
Business Prospects
3.62      The outlook for the Korean economy in general and the manufacturing
sector in particular remains favorable;/2 GNP is expected to increase by
9.2% annually, with a growth rate of 14.2% p.a. in the manufacturing sector.
The growth of the economy will continue to be mainly export-led; exports of
goods and services are projected to increase 16.8% annually with manufactured
exports providing 94% of incremental exports over the period 1977-81. An
annual increase in gross fixed investment of 7.8% is required to sustain this
rate of GNP growth, and manufacturing investment is projected to account for
26.7% of total investment expenditures during the Fourth Plan period (an
increase from the manufacturing sector's 24.6% share during 1972-76). Struc-
tural changes within the manufacturing sector will continue with further
increases in the investment share of the heavy and chemical industries, for
which KDFC has already expanded its financial assistance (para. 3.43).
3.63      In this macro-economic context, and within the limits of its
assumed domestic and foreign currency resource availability, KDFC has projected
over the period 1978-82 total commitments of W 342.2 billion (US$705 million)
and total disbursements of W 328.4 billion (US$677 million). KDFC's commit-
ments are expected to increase at an average rate of 20.3% per annum and its
disbursements are expected to increase at an average annual rate of about 22%.
Assuming an average rate of inflation of about 9% per annum for this period,
the real growth rate of KDFC's disbursements would be about 13% per annum.
/1   This cost has been substantial, and consists of the depreciation of the
Won against the U.S. dollar (from W 269 = US$ at end-1967 to W 485 = US$1
since 1974 to 1978), and the depreciation of the Won vis a vis the strong
currencies disbursed under the Bank loans (which account for the larger part
of the more recent Bank loans). Both these items are quantified by the "won
equivalent" total disbursement figures of Annex 4, Table 14, Section F (see
footnote f) with particularly the depreciation of the Won against the strong
currencies increasing the indebtedness, in Won, of the subborrowers to
KDFC.
/2   Fourth Five-Year Plan 1977-81.



- 39 -
As the annual real growth rate of gross fixed manufacturing investment for
the Fourth Plan period is projected to be 8%, the share of KDFC's disburse-
ments in total gross fixed capital formation will therefore be roughly
maintained (or marginally increase) at about 3% (see Annex 4, Table 2).
KDFC's projected approvals, commitments and disbursements for the period
1978-82 are presented in Annex 4, Table 28. The achievement of this target
increase in business volume depends primarily on KDFC's capacity to raise
additional borrowings, which in turn,will depend on KDFC's capacity to
continue to raise additional equity capital.
Financial Forecasts
3.64      KDFC's financial performance and structure are expected to remain
quite satisfactory over the next five years (Annex 4, Tables 29-31), with net
income increasing from W 2.1 billion in 1977 to W 6.8 billion in 1982.
However, net income is expected to marginally decline as a percentage of
average equity owing to equity expansion and a slight reduction in the
interest spread resulting from increased commercial borrowings. KDFC's debt
service coverage is expected to remain satisfactory (at about 1.2 to 1.3) as
is the interest cover ratio (at 1.4). KDFC envisages continuing with its
usual policy of declaring a 20% dividend consisting of 10% cash and 10%
stock, although in 1978 and 1981 a 20% cash dividend will be declared as KDFC
expects to increase its paid-in share capital by W 5 billion and W 5.9
billion respectively in those years.
Won Resource Position and Requirements
3.65      KDFC's resource projections are shown in Annex 4, Table 32.
Cumulative domestic currency commitments for the period 1978-82 are expected
to reach W 41.2 billion thereby increasing as a proportion of KDFC's total
commitments from 7% in 1977 to 14% in 1982 (largely because of the increasing
availability of domestic machinery and equipment). In order to meet this
expected level of commitments KDFC plans to increase its paid-in share
capital by W 5 billion in 1978 and W 5.9 billion in 1981; and KDFC proposes to
issue bonds for W 1 billion in 1980 and W 2 billion in 1982. Cash generated
by operations, net Won loan collections and disposal of equity investments
are expected to provide the remaining domestic currency resource requirements.
KDFC is at present examining various additional methods of mobilizing Won
resources, particularly in connection with the study on its future role
(paras. 3.67-3.68).
Foreign Currency Resource Requirements
3.66      Annex 4, Table 32 shows that KDFC's total cumulative foreign cur-
rency commitments are projected at US$620 million between 1978-82. As of
end-1977 KDFC's uncommitted foreign currency resources stood at US$59.9 mil-
lion (consisting of US$48 million from IBRD, US$7.0 million from ADB, and
US$4.9 million from the second commercial loan) which had declined to
US$16.5 million by end-June 1978 and is expected to be fully committed early
in the second half of 1978./l Over the five-year period 1978-82, KDFC
/1 KDFC's third foreign commercial loan of US$30 million, in process,
is expected to cover KDFC's foreign currency resource requirements until
around end-1978.



- 40 -
envisages mobilizing US$610 million in foreign currency borrowings of which
US$360 million (including the proposed US$100 million Bank loan), represent-
ing 59% of the total, will be from official sources,and US$250 million or
41% of the total from commercial sources. This target level of foreign
commercial resource mobilization (broken down as follows: US$30 million in
1978, US$40 million in 1979, US$50 million in 1980, US$60 million in 1981,
US$70 million in 1982) should be considered satisfactory. Indeed it appears
ambitious but should be attainable given KDFC's financial and institutional
strength, provided that the situation in the international capital markets
does not deteriorate. No other DFC presently borrowing from the Bank has
managed to rely on foreign private resources to an extent approximately
equal to that being envisaged by KDFC.
F. KDFC'S FUTURE DIRECTIONS
3.67      In 1977, KDFC completed its first decade of operations, during
which its overall performance had been, by any standard, highly successful.
Nevertheless, KDFC's management at that time began to think hard about KDFC's
future directions. The general economic environment in which KDFC operates
has changed beyond recognition since KDFC's inception in 1967. The indus-
trial sector has expanded and matured. The financial sector of which KDFC
is a part has become more complex and more competitive. The extraordinary
growth of exports, which has fueled economic growth, has transformed Korea's
economic and financial relationships with the rest of the world. Changed
internal and external circumstances have created challenges for KDFC and,
at the same time, new opportunities for expanding its activities and diver-
sifying its services.
3.68      Accordingly, KDFC commenced in 1977 a re-examination of its role
as a financial institution in Korea's rapidly developing industrial society.
This includes, among others, a review of the legal framework within which
KDFC operates, with a view to proposing such changes as may be appropriate;
of KDFC's corporate objectives, policies and operations, with a view to the
expansion and diversification of KDFC's activities; of its internal organi-
zation and staffing in order to enable KDFC to handle efficiently more and
different types of activity; and of the means of mobilizing domestic finan-
cial resources. Some of these matters will call for action in due course from
the Government, which has already shown its interest in, and support of, KDFC's
purpose in undertaking these studies. KDFC's studies will bear fruit, not
suddenly and quickly, but gradually. Views are still being formulated and
evolving, and various parties will need to be consulted before definitive
decisions are taken. It is likely, however, that the studies will result,
broadly speaking, in the gradual transformation of KDFC from an institution
concentrated largely on relending borrowed foreign exchange into a more diver-
sified, multi-purpose financial institution capable of providing clients with a
full spectrum of financial and advisory services, of promoting enterprises
as well as financing them and of acting flexibly to meet the changing require-
ments of the economy.



- 41 -
3.69      The Bank and IFC are collaborating with KDFC in this on-going consider-
ation of KDFC's future. At KDFC's request, the Bank is making available the
services of a consultant (Mr. William Diamond) to advise KDFC on that matter.
4. THE PROPOSED BANK LOAN
Recommendations and Justification
4.01      KDFC's performance continues to be highly satisfactory from both
the developmental and institutional points of view. The Bank Group's asso-
ciation with KDFC since the latter's inception in 1967 has been productive
and mutually beneficial. With its high operating standards in all stages of
the loan cycle, KDFC has been a remarkably efficient intermediary for allo-
cating funds to Korea's key industrial sector, and has also provided an
effective mechanism for allocating Bank funds to projects smaller than those
the Bank could finance directly. Through KDFC as an intermediary, Bank Group
resources (totaling US$238.2 million as of June 30, 1978, on a commitment
basis and including the IFC-syndicated loan of 1976) have been efficiently
allocated to 248 projects which are economically and financially viable in
the manufacturing, agro-industrial, transportation and construction sectors of
the Korean economy. KDFC has also achieved considerable success with its
innovative and varied promotional activities (paras. 3.19-3.31). It is
expected that over the period of commitment of the proposed loan KDFC will
achieve further progress from both the institutional and developmental points
of view.
4.02      A Bank loan of US$100 million is recommended which is expected to
finance about 44% of KDFC's estimated foreign currency commitments over a
two-year period from January 1, 1979. As KDFC has financed an average of
38% of total project costs (Annex 4, Table 3) between 1968-77, the Bank
loan is expected to assist in the financing of projects with an estimated
total cost of about US$260 million. In the past, KDFC's subprojects have
yielded substantial economic benefits; ERRs on a large sample of KDFC-financed
projects ranged from 11% to 76% (para. 3.12) with an average of 32.3%. In
addition, 46% of KDFC's financing between 1973-77 was allocated to projects
exporting more than half of their total incremental sales (Annex 4, Table 5).
The subprojects to be financed by KDFC under the proposed Bank loan are
expected to yield similar economic benefits. It is also expected that KDFC
will make a subloan of up to US$10 million to KDLC (para. 3.19) which will be
of particular assistance to small- and medium-scale enterprises. Similarly,
as with the two previous Bank loans a proportion of up to 10% of the proposed
loan is expected to be utilized by KDFC for financing small-scale enterprises
in less developed areas under the scheme of cooperation with the RCBs (para.
3.28). Taking into account these varied lending activities (i.e., including
lending through KDLC and the RCBs), the proposed loan will finance projects
creating about 10,000 jobs./I
/1 Based on projections of the fixed investment costs per incremental job
indicated in Annex 4, Table 4.



- 42 -
Main Features of the Loan
4.03      Component for Financing Medium-Sized Labor-Intensive Projects.
While its main business is the provision of finance to relatively large
enterprises, KDFC has in recent years made a deliberate effort to provide
financial assistance to small- and medium-scale (often labor-intensive)
enterprises through its scheme of cooperation with the RCBs (para. 3.28) and
its subloan to KDLC (para. 3.19), as well as, less significantly, through its
own operations. This is consistent with the Government's current emphasis on
assisting small-scale enterprises (in terms of total assets) and the Bank's
objective of contributing to the financing of relatively labor-intensive
investment projects (as measured by the capital:labor ratio). In order to
further these objectives it is recommended that a component of US$20 million
(or 20% of the proposed loan amount) be earmarked for financing specifically:
(a) enterprises with fixed assets not exceeding US$750,000; or (b) projects
generating employment at a fixed investment cost per job not greater than
US$12,500. The proposed US$750,000 fixed assets ceiling is well within
the W 500 million (US$1 million) limit under Korea's official definition of
small and medium industries. The proposed US$12,500 capital:labor limit is
much higher than the Bank's UPP threshold for Korea of US$5,120 (1976 prices)
but is nevertheless considered appropriate because of the increasingly scarce
availability of certain categories of labor (especially skilled) in Korea,
and also because KDFC's commitments under the proposed loan will take
place in 1979/80 so that an inflation factor must be taken into account.
Based on an analysis of the available data on recent subprojects, KDFC is
expected, with a reasonable but not excessive effort on its part, to be able
to fully utilize the special component as described above.
4.04      Financing of KDLC.  Under the fifth Bank loan (No. 1145-KO) of
US$55 million to KDFC, a subloan of US$5 million was made by KDFC to KDLC
the bulk of which was utilized to finance leasing projects for small- and
medium-sized enterprises (para. 3.21). As these leasing subprojects have
generated substantial economic benefits (especially in terms of employment),
it is recommended that KDFC be authorized to make a further subloan of
an amount up to US$10 million to KDLC under the proposed Bank loan in the
form of a subproject loan. (This subproject will exceed the proposed free
limit referred to in para. 4.07 and therefore will require the Bank's review
prior to approval).
4.05      Financing of Foreign Exchange Component of Domestic Equipment.
Apart from direct imports, it is recommended that IDFC be authorized to use
the proceeds of the proposed loan to finance the foreign exchange component
of domestically manufactured or procured capital goods, estimated at 60%. About
US$9 million (or 13%) of the sixth Bank loan (No. 1461-KO) was utilized for this
purpose in 1977, and this proportion is expected to increase slightly under
the proposed loan, thereby further enhancing KDFC's current efforts to inten-
sify its assistance to the Korean machinery industry (para. 3.27).
4.06      Relending Rate.  KDFC expects to onlend the proceeds of the pro-
posed Bank loan at an average interest rate of 9.5% p.a. (assuming a Bank
lending rate of 7.35%). This rate will give KDFC a spread of 2.15% (average)



- 43 -
which would be more than adequate to cover the cost incurred by KDFC in pro-
cessing foreign currency loans. This rate is also in line with those charged by
other development finance institutions in Korea (e.g., KDB, MIB). In prac-
tice, KDFC will apply differential rates of interest according to their judgment
of the subproject's contribution to the economy, credit standing of the borrower,
and KDFC's own developmental objectives. KDFC intends to charge these differential
rates of interest as follows; loans for small and labor-intensive enterprises at
BIR /1 plus 1.75% p.a.; loans secured by a bank payment guarantee and the KDFC-RCB
loans at BIR plus 2% p.a.; loans secured by collateral at BIR plus 2.25% p.a.;
and loans for procurement of locally manufactured equipment at BIR plus 2.5% p.a.
The spread will, therefore, range from 1.75 to 2.5 percentage points. Provided
that the rate of inflation is maintained within 7% p.a. as projected in the
Fourth Plan, KDFC's onlending rates would represent positive real rates of
interest. However, should the inflation rate exceed Fourth Plan projections /2
then adjustments in the won/foreign currency (dollar) rates could be expected to
take place (as occurred in the past; see para. 3.60) which, considering that
subborrowers bear the full foreign exchange risk, would increase the effective
cost of borrowing and maintain the interest rate at a positive level. Over the
period 1960-76, when inflation averaged 15% p.a., the depreciation of the won
vis-a-vis the dollar averaged 7% p.a.
4.07      Free Limit.  In view of KDFC's high appraisal standards and the
proven ability of its management and staff, it is recommended that the free
limit be increased from US$2.5 million (under the previous Bank loan
No. 1461-KO) to US$4.0 million.  It is estimated that under this proposed
free limit about four to six projects accounting for about 25% of the total
loan amount would still require Bank review prior to approval. As with the
previous Bank loans there would be no aggregate free limit, and no ceiling on
the size of individual subloans is necessary as KDFC's Operational Policy
Statement specifies that KDFC's total financial assistance to any single
enterprise will not normally exceed 25% (or US$5.6 million at end-1977) of
KDFC's net worth (para. 3.36).
4.08      Debt:Equity Limit.  It is recommended that the contractual limit
on KDFC's long-term debt, set at ten times its net worth under the previous
Bank loan agreement, be maintained. According to KDFC's projections,
which take into account prospective shale capital increase including the one
for W 5 billion to be implemented in 1978, this limit will be sufficient to
accommodate KDFC's proposed additional borrowings over the next five years.
4.09      Amortization Schedule.  As is usual with Bank loans to DFCs the
proposed loan would have a flexible amortization schedule which would sub-
stantially reflect the aggregate of the repayment schedules of the individual
subloans made by KDFC. The loan is expected to be fully repaid within
17 years including a grace period of 3 years. The estimated disbursement
schedule is presented in Annex 4, Table 33.

/2 Latest estimates do indicate an increase in the expected rate of
inflation (up to about 9% p.a.).

Agreements and Understandings Reached at Negotiations
4.10      During loan negotiations, agreement was reached on:
(a) a component of US$20 million under the proposed loan for
financing enterprises with fixed assets not exceeding US$750,000
or projects that would create additional employment at a fixed
investment cost per job not exceeding US$12,500 (para. 4.03);
(b) the maintenance of the long-term debt:equity limit at 10:1
(para. 4.08);
(c) the financing of 60% of the cost of domestically procured capital
goods representing the estimated foreign exchange component of such
goods (para. 4.05); and
(d) a free limit of US$4.0 million on subprojects (para. 4.07).
4.11      In addition, the following matters were reviewed, and understandings
reached with KDFC (as recorded in the agreed minutes):
(a) KDFC's objectives outlined in its statement of Development Strategy
(para. 3.32); and
(b) KDFC's onlending (by way of subloans) of an amount up to US$10 million
of the proposed loan to KDLC (para. 4.04).

KOREA
KOREA DEVELOPMENT FINANCE CORPORATION
Statement of Investment and Operational Policies
(Approved at the Board of Directors' Meeting on April 25, 1967. Amended at
the Board of Directors' Meetings on February 29, 1968; February 26, 1973;
February 26, 1974; December 17, 1974; June 19, 1975; July 23, 1976; and
June 1, 1977./1)
The Korea Development Finance Corporation, whose main objective is
to promote the expansion of private enterprise in the Republic of Korea, will
be guided by the policies set forth below:
I. The Scope of Investment Activities
(1) KDFC will invest only in productive enterprises. While its primary
activity will be manufacturing and processing industry, it may
invest also in other types of enterprises, including transport,
tourism, and large-scale commercially-oriented agriculture. How-
ever, trade, real estate and small-scale agriculture will be
excluded.
(2) KDFC will finance only private enterprises which are properly
organized and managed. KDFC will not invest in undertakings which
are Government-owned and operated, but a Government holding of not
more than 15% of the voting stock of a private enterprise shall not
make such enterprise ineligible for financial assistance from KDFC.
KDFC will finance both new enterprises and existing ones for expan-
sion or improvement.
(3) In its operations, KDFC will give due regard to the Government's
general economic plans and policies. The following categories of
industries will receive high priority, in accordance with the
government's economic policies and objectives:
(a) export industries;
(b) import-substitute industries;
(c) industries producing raw materials and other intermediate goods
necessary for production of export commodities and import-
substitutes.
(d) indigenous local industries which have special advantage in
comparative costs and potential marketability in foreign
markets; and
/1   KDFC intends to revise (in consultation with the Bank) the Statement
of Investment and Operational Policies to accommodate the conclusions and
recommendations of the Special Study on its future role (paras. 3.67-3.69).



ANNEX 2
Page 2
(e) participation or assistance in the turnover of the government-
owned industries to private ownership.
(4) KDFC will assist private enterprises in the following ways:
C
(a) medium- and long-term loans;
(b) equity participation (through underwriting, conversion
rights, direct participation in share capital or otherwise);
(c) guarantee of payment for machinery and equipment imported
or otherwise;
(d) guarantee and underwriting of corporate securities;
(e) technical and managerial consultant services; and
(f) any other appropriate manner.
(5) KDFC will seek through its operation to broaden the ownership
of private securities in Korea.
(6) KDFC's financial assistance will be primarily for expenditures for
fixed assets. KDFC will, however, consider requests for permanent
working capital in conjunction with its financial assistance for
such capital expenditures.
(7) KDFC will study periodically the trend of overall industrial devel-
opment and investment opportunities in the private sector in
cooperation with research institutes for promotion of new enter-
prises or expansion of the existing ones.
TI. Basis for Investment Decisions
(8) KDFC will make investment decisions only on the basis of sound
investment criteria and standards, and will provide financial
assistance only to those projects which are financially and
economically sound and technically feasible. Special attention
will be given to the ability of management and the profitability
of the enterprise.
III. Diversification of Portfolio
(9) KDFC will diversify its portfolio in order to maintain a reason-
able level of risk.
(10) KDFC will not provide financial assistance of less than the won
equivalent of US$50,000. The maximum financial commitment in
whatever form, including loan, share capital or guarantee or any
combination thereof, that KDFC may make to any single enterprise
will not normally exceed 25% of the total of KDFC's paid-in
capital, free reserves and Government loan of 1968.



ANNEX 2
Page 3
(11)  IKDFC will not commit to any single enterprise in form of share
capital more than 10% of KDFC's paid-in capital and free
reserves. The aggregate equity investment of KDFC at any time
will not exceed the total of its paid-in share capital and free
reserves.
(12) In undertaking large-sized projects, KDFC will seek cooperation
with other financial institutions, both domestic and foreign.
IV. Turn-Over of Portfolio
(13)  In order to recover its resources for new commitments and to
encourage widespread ownership of private securities, KDFC will
revolve its portfolio whenever it can do so on satisfactory
terms. In selling an investment it will pay due regard not only
to its own interests but also the interests of the participants
in such investment, and also to the interest of the concern whose
shares are involved.
V. Relationship with Enterprises Financed
(14)  KDFC will not take a controlling interest in any enterprise in
which is has invested, or any other interest which would give it
primary responsibility for management, except that in the case of
jeopardy, it may take such action as may be necessary to protect
its interest. To this end it will not take up more than 25% of
the share capital of an enterprise, except as the result of an
underwriting commitment undertaken in the expectation that the
investment would in fact be within the limit cited.
(15)  In accordance with normal banking practice, KDFC will require
its borrowers to provide and to maintain adequate security, to
keep records and accounts in accordance with sound accounting
practices, and to furnish whatever information on their opera-
tions and accounts KDFC deems desirable. KDFC will take the
right to inspect the enterprises it finances as well as their
operations and accounts.
(16) Business secrets and other information furnished by applicants
or clients will be treated as confidential.
VI. Financial Guidelines
(17)  KDFC will lend and invest its resources in such a way as to main-
tain the value of its capital. KDFC will pass to its clients any
foreign exchange risk it assumes or find other suitable means to
cover it.
(18) KDFC will not incur any debt in excess of ten times the aggregate
of its paid-in capital and free reserves.



ANNEX 2
Page 4
(19) KDFC will maintain accounting records adequate to reflect its
business operations in accordance with sound and generally
accepted international accounting practices and standards. KDFC
will employ qualified and independent public accountants to
audit its books and certify the accounts annually.
VII. Profits and Their Distribution
(20) KDFC will seek to develop earnings sufficient to cover expenses
and taxes, to provide reserves adequate to the size and risks of
its portfolio and to protect its equity against erosion and to
pay satisfactory dividends. It will seek profits on its equity
investments and will impose interest rates, fees and other
charges for its loans and services which will permit it to
achieve that level of profitability. It will build and maintain
reserves consistent with sound financial management. It will
set aside each year from net income before tax the amount
required by law as the legal reserve. In addition, it will
accumulate other reserves, including reserve for losses, as
considered prudent by the Board of Directors.
VIII. Staff
(21) KDFC will build up a technically qualified staff capable of
carrying the responsibilities which KDFC's objectives create,
and able to provide the services to clients which those objec-
tives call for.
IX. Revision of Policies
(22) Any proposal to revise this Statement of Investment and
Operational Policies shall be considered by the Board of
Directors only after each member has been given an adequate
opportunity to study and comment on the proposal, and it shall
be approved at a meeting of the Board of Directors by two thirds
of all directors.

KOREA
DEVELOPMENT FINANCE CORPORATION
Outline of Development Strategy for 1978/79
Background
1.        In April 1976 KDFC, in consultation with the World Bank, adopted a
Development Strategy Statement for 1977/78 outlining several specific develop-
mental objectives and activities apart from its normal financing operations.
On the whole, these objectives continue to be successfully implemented by KDFC
(see also Chapter 3, Section A), including, inter alia:
(a) continuation and expansion of KDFC's program of cooperation
with the Regional Commercial Banks for financing small scale
enterprises especially in less developed areas;
(b) continuation of assistance to the Korea Technology Advancement
Corporation (K-TAC) for the purpose of commercially exploiting
Korean technological inventions and adaptations;
(c) intensification of KDFC's efforts to improve project design via
its technical assistance services; and
(d)  further progress on the establishment of an engineering and con-
sulting firm in collaboration with DEG (as a separate legal entity,
not a department of KDFC).
New Objectives
2.        KDFC intends to consolidate its previous achievements, including
those noted above, as well as to further enhance its development impact
during 1978/79 by focusing on the objectives outlined below.
(a) Special Study on KDFC's Future Role. KDFC intends to complete a
special study presently being undertaken in close consultation with
the World Bank, which aims to examine in detail the various pos-
sible options open to KDFC regarding its future role as a develop-
ment finance institution. In particular, the possibilities of
diversifying its financial services, of expanding its operational
activities in parallel with the changing needs of the rapidly
growing Korean economy, and of securing a stable basis for the
mobilization of adequate domestic currency resources will be
examined.
(b) Project Promotion - Resource Allocation. (i) KDFC will endeavor to
assist some small scale enterprises (in terms of fixed assets) and
labor-intensive projects (in terms of capital:labor ratio) via its



ANNEX 3
Page 2
own operations as well as continuing to do so in colla-
boration with the RCBs and via subloans to KDLC; (ii) KDFC
will emphasize the active promotion of subcontracting arrange-
ments, thereby enhancing the linkage effects between small and
large scale enterprises, especially in the machinery and
related industries; (iii) KDFC will intensify its efforts to
establish an engineering and consulting firm on a joint
venture basis with foreign institutions (principally DEG) to
provide a variety of engineering and consulting services to
Korean enterprises.
(c) Resource Mobilization. (i) KDFC will attempt to raise additional
private funds, both foreign and domestic, in order to gradually
reduce its dependence on its traditional, official sources of funds
(mainly IBRD and ADB); (ii) KDFC will intensify its efforts to
mobilize foreign commercial funds through the international capital
markets, thereby reducing its dependence on its traditional sources
of funds. Over the period 1978-82 KDFC will endeavor to raise a
total of US$250 million from foreign commerical sources, specifi-
cally US$30 million in 1978, US$40 million in 1979, U$50 million in
1980, US$60 million in 1981 and US$70 million in 1982; (iii) KDFC
will also attempt to raise domestic currency resources through
further share capital increases (the next share issue of W 5 bil-
lion is scheduled for completion in late 1978), and will
examine the possibility of issuing bonds for resource mobilization
purposes in the context of the study presently being undertaken on
KDFC's future role.
(d)  Organization.  (i) KDFC will reinforce and expand the Project
Promotion Department to enhance its effectiveness in contributing
to the future expansion of operations and promotional activities;
(ii) KDFC will consider in depth the merits of setting up a
regional office in the Busan area, particularly to assist in the
diversification of the regional distribution of KDFC's portfolio,
and extend financial support to more small scale enterprises.
(e) Training and Research. (i) KDFC will increase the participation of
its staff in relevant training courses provided by domestic and
foreign institutions; (ii) KDFC will continue with its research
activities, and expects the final report on the Chunbuk province, a
study undertaken jointly with the Asian Research Center of the Korea
University, to be completed in June 1978. The study should, inter
alia, identify suitable projects for that hitherto less developed
area.

/f In any gives year, the won equivalent disbursement figures are caloulated by taking the year-nsd spot exchango rate of the won against all the various
foreign currencies actually disbursed to KDFC's subborrowers in that year, and adding the change in the son value of KDFC'a outstanding foreign currency
loan portfolio which is due to the exchange rate movements in that year.  In a period of dollar (and won) depreciation, the won equivalent disbursement
figures are there-ore much larger than the woe equivalent approvals and commitments, which are calculated via one singie dollar-won .echange rare (soe
le). The won equivalent disbursements figures use specific exchange rates for each foreign currency disbursed and outstanding and espressos disbLrsemests
and the outstanding foreign currency loan portfolio in won equivalents at current rates in any given year thereby providing an indicator of the cost (in
won) of the foreign enchange risk tO KDFC'n subborrowrs.e
