                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is closing on June 15, 2012 and the present ISR is the last one also focusing on the entire project implementation period. The last implementation support mission has
                         been held from March 26 to April 5, 2012.

                         Considering the overall implementation of the project, its most notable achievements are in the areas of access and equity in education . While the gross enrollment rate (GER) rose
                         from 4.5% in 2006/2007 to 11,3% in 2010/11 (the end project target is 10%) in pre-school, it increased from 98.5% to 111.5% (the end project’s target is 112%) in the same period for

                         primary education. Progress for girls' participation were slow since the percentage of female students increased from 45.0 % in 2006/7 and 46.5% in 2010/11 for target of 47.5% in
                         2012. The expansion in preschool and primary education has been supported by a growing number of classrooms and latrines that were built under the project: 1941 additional
                         classrooms and 375 blocks of latrines, above the end- of- project targets of 1,926 classrooms and 324 blocks of latrines. Some school constructions (269 classrooms) are still
                         underway and an agreement has been reached with the Government to complete them through other donors funds.

                         However, improving quality and retention is an issue since primary education completion rate (PCR) and repetition rate are less than expected : (i) PCR decreased from 66.3% in
                         2006/2007 to 64% in 2011/2012 (compared to the revised end-of –project target of 68 percent) although some progress has been recorded with regard to girls for which the PCR
                         gained 1.5 points, passing from 56,0% in 2006/7 to 57.5% in 2010/11; and (ii) repetition rate instead of decreasing, rose from 7.5% in 2006/07 to 16.4% in 2011, above the 10%
                         project target. The reason of the declined of the PCR can be explained in part by the rapid increase in enrollments but also by the persistent high repetition and drops-out rates. In
                         addition the learning assessment carried out in May 2011 shows that learning outcomes remain poor. To counter these trends, the Government implemented the following actions (i)
                         school feeding program for 121 000 (target is 110 000) pre and primary school students in the poorest areas (ii) transfer of subsidy to 8059 schools which acquired learning
                         materials; (iii) in-service training for 52, 255 teachers; (iv) three-year specific in-service training for 9979 community teachers of which 7971 passed successively the written exam of
                         CEAP (the target of additional qualified teachers resulting for project intervention is 8000); (v) recruitment of qualified teachers which enabled not only the almost stability of the
                         students-teachers ratio to 47.9 in spite of the rapid increase in enrollments but also the improvement of the percentage of qualified teachers which rose from 51.3 in 2006/7 to 55.1 in
                         2010/11 and (iv) increase of inspectors and education advisers visits to teachers. However, an agreement has been reached to implement in the coming years some additional
                         integrated measures to improve quality in primary schools : (i) establishing early grade assessment in both reading and numeracy and ensure that teachers understand how to use
                         the information to improve their own teaching; (ii) analyzing effective learning time and teachers attitudes related to reading and numeracy; (iii) experimenting the introduction of
                         national language in the learning process in grade 1 and 2. These measures will be part of the next GPE project.

                         In addition, progress has been achieved in Strengthening the System Management of the sector. Indeed, three out of four intermediate result indicators are already met:(i) the
                         Student Learning Assessment has been carried out; (ii) the proportion of classes visited by inspectorate reached 65.9% in 2010/11 above the project yearly target of 40% and it is
                         expected that this target will be likely outpaced in 2011/12; and (iii) more than the target of 100 central ministry staff have strengthened their capacity through the project intervention.
                         The shortcomings in this component were (i) the poor results-based management systems that has been noticed during the project implementation; and (ii) the delay in the
                         implementation of a computerized framework for the information management system (IMS) because the recruitment of the consultant has just been completed. To date IMS has
                         been limited to the census data for the school-year (SY) 2010/11 with the support of National Institute of Statistics in order to obtain a quality baseline data for the coming years.
