                              RESTRUCTURING PAPER



SUMMARY
1.      The Project Development objectives (PDO) and project components remain
unchanged, but the program implementation has been refocused on the activities which:
(i) directly contribute to the achievement of the PDO; (ii) have begun start-up activities
that make their completion by the new closing date realistic; and (iii) require international
financial support.

PROJECT STATUS
2.      Although the project has been effective for over two years, disbursements are
only at 28 percent of total project funds (US$76.1 million). Reasons for slow
disbursements and project implementation are the following: (i) excessive number of
small activities, rendering project execution overly complex; (ii) procurement-related
difficulties in certain activities (school construction and text books) and (iii) weak
capacity within the ministries in charge of the education sector and institutional
bottlenecks between ministries (in particular the Ministry of Pre-school and Primary
Education, and the Ministry of Finance).

3.     Due to the slow disbursement, the first audit of the project that must cover the
calendar years 2008 and 2009 was planned to be held at the end of the calendar year
2009. This audit is ongoing and the report will be available on June 30, 2010 in
compliance with the grant Agreement. However, an interim audit had been carried out in
December 2009 and some recommendations were made to improve the disbursement rate
and the management of the project.

PROPOSED CHANGES
4.      The Project Development objectives and components of the project remain
unchanged. The program implementation has been refocused on the activities which: (i)
contribute to the achievement of the PDO; (ii) have begun start-up activities that make
their completion by the new closing date realistic; and (iii) require international financial
support.

If, yes, please explain:

5.    In order to simplify the project and focus interventions on key areas, the following
changes to the project description (and thus to the relevant outputs) have been made:

6.     The activities that are newly introduced or modified are the following: (i)
providing direct support to pre-primary and primary public schools for teaching materials
and operating costs; and (ii) supporting a program of daily nutrition assistance in pre-
primary and primary public schools ( 501 school canteens are concerned) instead of
building 180 new canteens as originally planned.

7.      The activities no longer included in the project, but that will receive financing
through the pooled fund (from the other donors :DANIDA, Nederland, AFD and KFW)
or the national budget are the following: (i) a national program for girls education and
children with special needs; (ii) the experimental program for alternative accelerated
education for overage children; (iii) the extension of multi-grade teaching and the use of
sub-cycles; (iv) the introduction on an experimental basis of national languages into the
education system; and (v) the provision of textbooks.

8.     The proposed changes will not trigger any new safeguard policies or change the
safeguard category and the existing safeguard arrangements are adequate and will
continue to apply to the project as restructured.

Project Costs and financing plan (include summary tables) _X_Yes        ___No
If, yes, please explain:

9.      The project financing plan has been modified: (i) to reflect the 18 month
extension; and (ii) to redistribute the resources from the activities which will no longer be
financed by the EFA-FTI. Mainly due to the reallocation from category C1.1 ­
"Improving education-related infrastructure" that experienced some procurement
difficulties, the redistribution of funds intends to increase funding for: (i) C1.5 ­
"Developing school canteens" to finance the daily nutrition assistance in pre-primary and
primary public schools; and (ii) C2.4 ­ "Teaching materials and operating costs " to
provide direct support to pre-primary and primary public schools for operating expenses
at the school level and the acquisition of pedagogic materials.

                             Extension of Closing Date

        BENIN -- EDUCATION FOR ALL-FAST TRACK INITIATIVE PROGRAM
                                  P110576
                                (TF091947)1

                                       Restructuring Paper


1. The closing date for Benin, Education For ALL-FAST TRACK INITIATIVE
   PROGRAM, TF091947, P110576, will be extended from June 20, 2011 until
   December 30, 2011.

2. Although the project has been effective for over two years, disbursements are only at
   28 percent of total project funds (US$76.1 million). Reasons for slow disbursements
   and project implementation are the following: (i) excessive number of small
   activities, rendering project execution overly complex; (ii) procurement-related
   difficulties in certain activities (school construction and text books) and (iii) weak
   capacity within the ministries in charge of the education sector and institutional
   bottlenecks between ministries (in particular the Ministry of Pre-school and Primary
   Education, and the Ministry of Finance). However, the project objectives are still
   achievable especially if granted an 18-month extension.

3. The proposed extension is necessary to support the newly-prepared program
   implementation that has been refocused on the activities which: (i) contribute to the
   achievement of the PDO; (ii) have begun start-up activities that make their
   completion by the new closing date realistic; and (iii) require international financial
   support.

4. This will be the 1st extension of the project.
