                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall, our assessment of Benin Education Sector Development Plan is MS. Available data show that expansion of enrollment remains strong and access is progressing at all level,
                         outpacing the target of the ten-year action plan. While the gross enrollment rate (GER) rose from 4.5% in 2005/6 to 10.3% in 2009/10 (the target is 9.4%) in pre-school, it increased
                         from 93.0% to 110.6% for a target of 110% in the same period for primary education. Girls' participation experienced the same trend (85.9% in 2005/6 and 107% in 2009/10). This
                         expansion in preschool and primary education was supported by a growing number of classrooms and latrines that were built under the project. Similarly, Enrollment growth was
                         strong at the secondary education level, as well as in higher education where enrollment has increased to 84 600 in 2009/10 (45 000 planned by 2015).

                          Despite this growth, primary completion rate (PCR) has not improved, decreasing slightly from 65% in 2005/6 to 64% in 2009/10. The FTI target 69% was in 2010. This is principally

                         due to the high level of repetition and continued high number of drop outs. However, some progress has been recorded with regard to girls for which the PCR gained 3 points,
                         passing from 54,3% in 2005/6 to 57.3% in 2009/10; the boys PCR declined from 75,6% in 2005/6 to 70,3% in 2009/10.

                         Despite the retirement of many experienced teachers, the number of qualified teachers rose from 14,663 in 2005/6 to 15,281 in 2009/10. Student teacher ratio increased from 47.7 in
                         2007 to 50.1 in 2010. In the beginning of academic year 2010/11, 3,350 qualified teachers entered the t teacher corps to reduce the student/teacher ratio, Moreover, textbook/student
                         ratio increased from 1.64 in 2005/6 to 1.82 in 2008/9, thus close to 2 in 2009/10, which is the end of project target. The proportion of teachers visited by inspectors and education
                         advisors increased from 59.1% in 2008/9 to 65.9% in 2009/10 against a target of 40%. In addition, the Government started implementation of the specific program of subsidy to
                         schools for acquisition of teaching equipment. Consequently the improvement of quality in Benin is expected to take off shortly.
