                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Considering the available provisional data in primary education, there is a slight decrease in the key indicators trend during the period under review. However, expansion of
                         enrollment remains strong and access is progressing at post primary and higher education. The gross enrollment rate (GER) in primary education decrease from 109% in 2009 to
                         106% in 2010, below the target of 110%. Girls' participation also decrease since gross enrollment rate lessens from 104% in 2009 to 102% in 2010, against a target of 106%; but
                         there is no change in gender parity since girls representing 46% of total enrollment as in 2009. However, it is important to point out that the decrease of the GER doesn't necessary
                         mean a decline of students' enrollment. The reason of this decrease of the GER will be explained in the next ISR. On the other hand, enrollment growth in secondary education is

                         outpacing the ten-years action plan objectives as well as in higher education where the demand is fueled by the decision of the Government to provide gratuity (60 600 students in
                         2009 against 45 000 planned by 2015). Despite this strong progress in access at all level of the system, important challenges remain which result in poor learning outcomes and low

                         quality of education. The low quality of education is reflected in the decrease of the Primary Completion Rate (PCR) from 65% in 2009 to 63% in 2010, lagging behind the FTI target
                         of 69% in 2010, partly due to the high level of repetition rate and continued high number of children dropping out. The student-teacher ratio (public) deteriorated from 48.3 in 2009 to
                         50.9 in 2010 but teacher qualification improved from 46.6% in 2009 to 50.1% in 2010. However, it is important to note that the government has just recruited and redeployed about
                         3,350 teachers for the school year 2010-2011 and it is expected that this recruitment will improve significantly the student teacher ratio.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         At the end of November 2010 supervision mission, the government and the pool funding donors (including Bank) decided to implement two important decisions:
                         1- Considering the poor learning outcomes and low quality of education it was agreed to provide more resources to the inspectorates in order to reinforce the implementation of
                         continued training for teachers and the number of the classes visited each year by the inspectors and the educational advisers.
                         2- With regard to the delay to reach an agreement with the World Food Program (WFP) and to request a waiver from the Bank to contract directly with WFP for food supply to
                         school canteens, it was agreed to consider a school feeding operation's approach that will be based on the existing informal system of the "mamans" , who prepare and serve
                         meals to school children at lunch time, due to its proved efficiency and cost effectiveness.
