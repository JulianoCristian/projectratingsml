                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The September 2011 implementation mission concluded that progress has been made in the implementation of the most activities. During the period under review, the second phase
                         of the construction program (879 classrooms and 214 blocks of latrines) has been launched and the execution of the work was in average by 35 Teacher training designed to strength
                         teacher qualifications was carried out: (i) approximately 10,000 community teachers benefited from the second year training courses and passed the first part of the CEAP exam; and
                         (ii) approximately 42,800 teachers received training in the framework of the implementation of curricula based on the " competence approach". The school feeding approach, based
                         on the existing informal system of the "mamans" (community mothers) who prepare and serve lunch to school children has been implemented in 501 schools for the school year

                         but this acquisition has not been completed due to a misunderstanding between the local Government and the inspectors. An agreement has been reached to accelerate the process
                         in order to complete it by November 2011.

                         Roughly, apart from the literacy activities and the development of the management information system, most of the bidding processes were launched before June 2011. However,
                         some bidding processes may not be conclusive and will need to be reinitiated and some school construction will not be completed by December 30, 2011, because of the delays
                         already noted in the contractors' work. With regards to the latter, an action plan has been prepared to increase efficiency and its implementation will secure a better result within this
                         year.

                         For the literacy activities which are to be carried out through ''faire-faire" strategy (sub-contracting to local non-state providers), an accelerated implementation action plan has been
                         finalized with the staff of the Ministry of Literacy and the contracts with the NGOs involved have been signed in October 2011. The activity has been launched in October 2011 for a
                         duration of six months. Therefore, this activity cannot be completed by the closing date.

                         Concerning the education management information system (EMIS), the recruitment of the consultant for the preparation of the computerization framework is underway and the
                         Government is conscious that the creation of a master plan for the IT system and the manual and associated tools will not be completed by the closing date. The objective of the
                         EMIS has been limited to the census data for the school-year (SY) 2010/11 with the support of National Institute of Statistics in order to obtain a quality baseline data for the coming
                         years.

                         There is no change in the access and completion indicators listed in the previous ISR since the collection of census data for the SY 2010/11 will start in November 2011.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The following decision has been suggested at September 2011 support mission :

                          The government will request a second extension of less than six (6) months to enable a smooth implementation of remaining activities and contribute to the improvement of the
                         quality for the basic education; the new proposed closing date is June 15, 2012. The project was previously extended once by eighteen (18) months and this second extension will
                         result in a cumulative extension of less than two (2) years.
