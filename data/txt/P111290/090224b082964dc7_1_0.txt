The project is now near to successful closure in December 2014. Good achievements have been made under all components of the project.
Monitoring data from an aerial survey carried out in April 2014 indicates an increase generally in animal numbers in Comoé National Park. The
actual management of the park and investments in park infrastructure have progressed well but OIPR will not be able to use all the funds available
to it, largely because of slow procurement processing. Sub-projects with surrounding communities are apparently being implemented from new
allocations of funding from German and French Cooperation but OIPR has not provided good information on these programs.

The project is considered to have substantially achieved the overall objectives of strengthening the management of Comoé Park.

 Overall Comments
 For the faunal numbers, disaggregated data are reported for the three species, as proposed in the Results Framework. In addition, OIPR
 provided, for information, similar data for an aggregated Bovidae index including those three species as well as two others, and the overall
 increase was 141% versus a target (based on 10% increase/year) of 146%. The number of buffalo actually declined; interpretation of these
 faunal data will need further work during project completion to determine the likely reasons for the changes (real changes in numbers, movements
 of animals to and from the park, differences in animal visibility during the two aerial inventories, etc.).
