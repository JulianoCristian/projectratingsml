                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project implementation continues to proceed well and the project is now moving toward successful closure in December 2014. Good achievements have been made under all
                         components of the project. Anecdotal data from park rangers indicate that numbers of some antelope species are beginning to rebound in the Comoé Park but this will need to be
                         confirmed in the aerial inventory planned for 2014. An inventory carried out through ground-level transects in 2012, data not comparable to the baseline 2010 aerial inventory,
                         indicated a good diversity of species in the park but in low numbers; it also pointed to extremely low numbers or extirpation of elephants and lions. An effort to control poaching has

                         took place during the country's recent crisis when to all intents and purposes there was no poaching control in the park.

                         The likelihood of substantially achieving by project end the overall objectives of strengthening the management of Comoé Park remain strong.
