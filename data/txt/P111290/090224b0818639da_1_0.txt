                         At Mid Term Review (MTR), there has been increased in project activities in particular at the field level at the Comoe National Park (CNP) and its environs. The disbursement rate is
                         54% and there has been increased capacity building at the project and community levels. On the whole, after three years of effective implementation, the project has achieved
