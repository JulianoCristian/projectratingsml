                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project implementation continues to proceed well and the project is now near to successful closure in December 2014. Good achievements have been made under all components of
                         the project. Monitoring data from an aerial survey carried out in April 2014 has not yet been analyzed to determine trends in wildlife numbers. In Component 1, good progress has
                         been made in institutional training and reinforcement. The actual management of the park and investments in park infrastructure have progressed well but the project is lagging in

                         OIPR has been able to confirm new allocations of funding from German and French Cooperation to ensure a continued support, beyond the closure of this project, to the Comoé
                         National Park and its surrounding communities.

                         The likelihood of substantially achieving by project end the overall objectives of strengthening the management of Comoé Park remain strong.
