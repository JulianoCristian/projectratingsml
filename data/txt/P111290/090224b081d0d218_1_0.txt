                         Project implementation is proceeding well with notable achievements in all components and in all aspects of the management of Comoé National Park. A local management
                         committee was established in April 2013, key to stronger engagement and commitment of local communities. In the first quarter of the year, anti-poaching patrols increased by 48%
                         over the comparable period of the previous year. Anecdotal evidence suggests this is being translated into higher numbers and diversity of animals but scientific surveys still remain

                         budgets. The likelihood of substantially achieving by project end the overall objectives of strengthening the management of Comoé Park are strong, for the first time in the period of
