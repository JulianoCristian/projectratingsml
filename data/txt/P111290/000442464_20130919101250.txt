B. Project Status
The project had a difficult period at start-up. Due to the electoral 2010-2011 crisis in Côte d'Ivoire, project
implementation was severely affected with the project completely stopped for a period of 6 months. With
the return of more stable conditions in the country, and particularly in the northern region where the
Comoé Park is located, the implementing agency made good progress in bringing the project back to
speed. In the most recent ISR, it is currently rated "Satisfactory" both for achievement of PDO and for
implementation progress. With the changes proposed in the restructuring, particularly the extension of 13
months, the PDO remains achievable.

Change in Results Framework
Explanation:
As noted during the mid-term review and based on several years of implementation experience, the current
results framework is considered in need of change. Many of the original indicators were poorly formulated
and unmeasurable or otherwise not useful. The results framework has been revised by the implementing
agency, who engaged a specialized consultant to assist them with this task, and through considerable
exchange with the Bank. The revised indicators retain as many as possible of the original indicators, are all
measurable, have baseline values (or these can be calculated), and are effective measures of attaining the
PDO or attaining intermediate outcomes.

Change in Loan Closing Date(s)
Explanation:
The closing date is changed from November 30, 2013 to December 31, 2014 (the first extension of the
closing date). The project lost about an equivalent period of time at start-up due to the electoral crisis of
2010-2011 which brought much of the country to a standstill, in particular the northern region where the
project area is located, which fell out of central government control.

Reallocations
Explanation:
Relatively minor changes to allocations to disbursement categories are proposed. Changes to categories are
less than 10% of the original allocation except for Category 3 which is reduced by 24% from $247,000 to
$187,000. This category (Works for Implementation of the Park Management Plan) as these costs were
less than expected.

Disbursement Estimates
Change in Disbursement Estimates
Explanation:
The proposed changes have two purposes: i) bring estimates into line with the current situation where
cumulative disbursements are about 70% of where they should be at this point in time (mainly due to long
down time at beginning of project); and ii) take into account changes needed due to the extension of the
closing date.

                                           Other Change(s)
Change in Implementation Schedule
Explanation:
With an extension of 13 months to the closing date, the implementation schedule will be necessarily
extended to accommodate this change.




                                               7
A) Project Status

1. The implementation progress in last ISR is rated Satisfactory as is the Progress toward
   Achievement of the Global Environmental Objective.

2. The present restructuring request from the Recipient is primarily motivated by the need to
   extend the closing data by 13 months. The project lost almost a year shortly after start-up
   which unfortunately took place at the same time as the 2010-2011 electoral crisis in the
   country. This project was particularly affected as the Comoé National Park is located in
   the northern region, which was particularly subject to civil strife and instability. Most of
   the project vehicles were stolen in this period and the project came to a complete halt
   with no activity for an entire six months.

3. Good progress has been made by the Ivoirian Office of Parks and Reserves (OIPR) in
    moving the project forward. The Project Development Objective (PDO) remains
    achievable but an additional period of time is needed to allow for full disbursements of
    the project funds and the completion of all project activities.


Proposed Changes

4. The project’s closing date is changed from November 30, 2013 to December 31, 2014.
   This is the first requested extension of the project.

5. The proposed restructuring also reallocates fund between disbursement categories as
   noted above in the data sheet. The changes are relatively minor and reflect the need for
   normal adjustments based on project implementation experience to date.

6. Finally, the Results Framework is updated to modify a small number of indicators with
    the intention of making them more measurable and useful to measure the progress of the
    project.


Appraisal Summary

7. The proposed restructuring does not result in any changes to the Appraisal
   Summary as it now appears in the PAD. There are no changes to procurement,
   financial management, disbursement arrangements, nor with regard to the
   environmental and social safeguards.
