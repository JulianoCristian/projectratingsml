          the power sector (expansion of generation, transmission and\n            distribution facilities) for the period 1976-78 was intended\n            to meet the forecast growth in electricity demand during\n            this period and to maintain reliability of the power system.\n            It also had as its objective the strengthening of the power\n            sector through the establishment and development of\n            Electricidade de Portugal (EDP) as a sound and efficient\n            utility. All the project objectives were fully achieved\n            except for the self-financing objective. The original\n            investment program was altered (for justifiable reasons) and\n            therefore it is difficult to make a meaningful comparison\n            between actual and estimated costs and implementation time.\n            Nevertheless, some components took longer than expected due\n            to several factors, e.g., organizational changes in the\n            utility, delays in procurement which arose partly from the\n            Government's policy of encouraging local manufacture of\n            equipment and the utility's unfamiliarity with Bank\n            procurement procedures, Largely because of adequate tariff\n            increases, the financial results of the utility were\n            satisfactory through 1979. Subsequently, however, the severe\n            drought conditions adversely affected the financial\n            results-the utility's self-financing level in 1980 was\n            only one-half the target of 30 percent and in 1981, its cash\n            flow did not cover its debt service requirements. Collection\n            of accounts receivable, particularly from large industries\n            and other distribution utilities, is also becoming an\n            increasing problem. These issues are addressed in the\n            Seventh Power Project."}, "docdt": "1983-01-04T00:00:00Z"}
