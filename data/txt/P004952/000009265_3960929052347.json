(ii)\n            help improve the efficiency of the petroleum services\n            subsector (particularly drilling operations); (iii) help\n            optimize the production of its oil fields through enhanced\n            oil recovery schemes; and (iv) address environmental\n            problems related to drilling and production operations. A\n            related objective is to help SONATRACH mobilize external\n            funds through co-financing arrangements with Eximbank of\n            Japan, and more generally, to facilitate SONATRACH's\n            efforts at reentering the international capital markets. The\n            project comprises four components: (i) assistance for the\n            promotion of exploration acreage to foreign oil companies,\n            including basin studies, the setting up of a modern\n            exploration data base, promotional and contractual\n            assistance, and the services of full-time foreign experts;\n            (ii) technical assistance and training in drilling\n            supervision; (iii) selected enhanced oil recovery\n            subprojects and related studies; and (iv) training and other\n            technical assistance \"inter-alia\" in the area of\n            organization, financial systems, planning optimization, and\n            environmental protection."}, "docdt": "1991-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
