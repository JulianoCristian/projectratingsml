Some lessons learned included: compared\n            to the ambitious medium term sector objectives, the\n            Bank's leverage to assist in hydrocarbons sector\n            reforms and restructuring has remained limited. The\n            financing package put together was sizable, but has been\n            modest in relation to Sonatrach's large investment\n            program. In order to help implement sector reforms in large\n            oil and gas sectors the Bank needs to enhance its\n            credibility and leverage through its commitment and a string\n            of substantial operations over the medium term. The\n            efficiency of early procurement arrangements and turnkey\n            contracts was demonstrated by the speedy implementation of\n            the main components, i.e. the secondary oil recovery schemes\n            at Mesdar and Amassak the civil works carried out by local\n            contractors were included in the turnkey contracts and\n            coordinated by the foreign contractor who had the overall\n            responsibility. - On the other hand, the Bank's\n            procurement procedures were not always well adapted to the\n            needs of Sonatrach, as in the petroleum industry short-list\n            approaches even for large contracts, and direct contracting\n            being used, because high quality, reliability and time is\n            often considered more essential than least cost. Regarding\n            implementation, the project included a considerable number\n            of small components in various domains, which made\n            contracting and supervision cumbersome."}, "docdt": "1997-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
