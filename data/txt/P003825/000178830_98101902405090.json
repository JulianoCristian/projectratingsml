Power\n            Project are to diversify the sources of electricity\n            production mainly through the use of geothermal energy and\n            coal, improve the operational efficiency of PLN's\n            distribution networks, reduce PLN's system losses, and\n            provide a training and consultancy program for the continued\n            institutional development of PLN. The project will consist\n            of: (a) construction of a 110 (2 x 55) MW extension of the\n            Kamojang geothermal station in West Java and substation\n            equipment to interconnect with the existing transmission\n            system; (b) construction of the third 400 MW, coal-fired,\n            generating unit at the Suralaya thermal station in West\n            Java, and step-up substation extensions to connect it with\n            the 500 kV system under construction including engineering\n            of the third and fourth generating units; (c) distribution\n            system improvements in Java, North Sumatra and South\n            Sulawesi; (d) a mini-hydro development program in North\n            Sumatra; and (e) training facilities and services to assist\n            PLN's manpower development program."}, "docdt": "1982-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
