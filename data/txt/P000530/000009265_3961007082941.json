main development objectives of the\n            Second Transport Sector Project are:  (a) to help stimulate\n            industrial and agricultural development and regional trade\n            through consolidating improvements in transport sector\n            efficiency focussing on continued reductions in vehicle\n            operating costs and improvement in the efficiency of the\n            transport market; (b) to continue to improve public\n            investment efficiency, transparency and budgetary\n            management; (c) to improve internal resource mobilization to\n            fill the long-term need for routine road maintenance; (d) to\n            promote private sector involvement in road maintenance and\n            strengthen the road transport industry; and (e) to\n            streamline and continue to improve public administration of\n            the sector.  To achieve the objectives, the project will\n            implement:  (i) the consolidation agenda to ensure that the\n            positive achievements under the Transport Sector\n            Adjustment/Investment Program (TSAIP) are maintained; (ii)\n            the continuing agenda of sectoral objectives that were only\n            partially met under TSAIP and; (iii) the evolving agenda to\n            address long-term issues of sustainability critical to the\n            transport sector program. The project will support these\n            agendas through a set of policy measures largely met through\n            up-front conditionalities and investment components.  The\n            physical works component consists of:  (1) a program of road\n            routine and periodic maintenance and bridge strengthening on\n            the existing priority network of 4,760 km; and (2) a program\n            of about 300 km of secondary roads crucial for the linkage\n            between regions of agricultural potential and main\n            consumption centers.  The program of institutional\n            strengthening comprises: (a) consulting services for civil\n            works design and supervision, soil research studies and\n            testing, and technical and financial audits; (b) consulting\n            services to promote private entrepreneurship for small and\n            medium construction contractors and small truckers; (c)\n            technical assistance and training for transport sector\n            institutions; (d) support for the implementation of a\n            regional integration action plan aiming at facilitating\n            Chadian international trade for road and air transport; and\n            (e) implementation of a transport sector environmental\n            action plan."}, "docdt": "1994-10-07T00:00:00Z"}
