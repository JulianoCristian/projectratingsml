on balance the\n            project's outcome was satisfactory, and project\n            sustainability was rated as likely. Overall, the World\n            Bank's performance can be considered satisfactory. The\n            main shortcoming was the conflicting signals given to the\n            Borrower by the Bank's transport sector staff in charge\n            of the project, on one side, and the Bank's\n            macroeconomic staff and the IMF on the other. In this sense,\n            the Bank must share responsibility for the unsatisfactory\n            performance of the Government. (Notwithstanding this\n            finding, the report finds on balance that Borrower\n            performance can be considered satisfactory.) On the other\n            hand, high marks are due to the Bank for untiring and\n            patient sector dialogue and intellectual leadership to\n            improve sector performance with Government authorities at\n            the macro and sector levels. Lessons learned include the\n            following: In order to reduce dependence on expatriate\n            technical assistance personnel, the project supported the\n            strengthening of local staff capacity, and the technical\n            assistance provided undet the project was focused\n            accordingly. However, the role of technical assistance and\n            responsibility-taking is changing, and the methods and tools\n            they provide have to be continuously assimilated and applied\n            to achieve performance results. There is a need for\n            continued close coordination and within the Bank and between\n            the Bank and the IMF. Road funds need to be independent and\n            at arms length from the Government."}, "docdt": "2000-12-19T00:00:00Z"}
