MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTAL CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF CHAD
FOR THE SECOND TRANSPORT SECTOR PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed supplemental credit for the Second Transport Project to the Republic of Chad for
SDR 8.8 million (US$12.7 million equivalent) on standard IDA terms with a Standard IDA
terms with the same repayment terms as the original Cr. 2520-CD.  The proposed
supplernental credit would consist of an addition of funds to the civil works component. It
complements the Economic Recovery Credit (Cr. 2589-CD) that was approved by the Board on
March 29, 1994.
2.    The main objective of the original project was to help stimulate industrial and
agricultural developmen. and regional trade through consolidated improvements in the
transport sector's efficiency. The devaluation of the CFA franc resulted in a substantial
increase in the supply response particularly in the agricultural sector, mainly in cotton and
arabic gum. Thus there is an urgent need to do more rehabilitation of rural roads to facilitate
access to foodstuffs for urban consumers. Furthermore the civil works involved in these
rehabilitation works will create additional employment to alleviate the transitional effects of the
devaluation. However Government has been unable to mobilize external fiancing from other
donors in a timely manner. Hence, it was decided to pursue the proposed supplemental credit
as the most appropriate vehicle for the Bank to respond to the Government's request for
assistance.
Background: the Second Transport Sector Project
3.     Project Objectives and Descriptiot.  The Project's objectives are:  (a) to help
stimulate industrial and agricultural development and regional trade through consolidated
improvements in the transport sector's efficiency; (b) to continue to improve public investment
efficiency, transparency and budgetary management; (c) to improve internal resource
mobilization to meet the long-term need for routine road maintenance; (d) to promote private
sector involvement in road maintenance and strengthen the road transport industry; and (e) to
streamline and continue to improve public administrion of the sector. The Project has two
main components: (a) a physical works component consisting of (i) a program of routine and
periodic road maintenance and bridge strengthening on the existing priority network of 4,760
kIn; and (ii) a program of about 300 k:m of secondary roads crucial for the linkage between
regions of agricultural potential and main consumption centers; (b) a program of institutio"al
strengtheningI consisting of: (i) consulting services for civil works design and supervision;
consulting services to promote private entrepreneurship; (iii) technical assistance and training
for transport sector institutions; (iv) support to implement a regional integration action plan;
and (iv) implementation of a transport sector environmental action plan.



-2 -
4.    Implementation Experence. The Government has a strong record of project execution
in the transport sector. The Highway Maintenance (Cr. 1728-CD), the Road Reconstruction
(Cr. 1901-CD) and the first Transport Sector Projects (Cr. 2007-CD) were executed on time.
Under these projects Government improved its implementation capacity tremendously. All
three projects have been extremely successful in meeting their physical targets. Costs were
below appraisal estimates and the economic rates of return were higher than anticipated at
appraisal. As the Second Transport Sector Project became effective only on January 18, 1994,
no audits are due at this time. Audits for the first Transport Sector Project were routinely on
time and unqualified. The Borrower is in full compliance with covenants.
Rationale for IDA Involvement
5.    Ohanging County Economic Rackground/Rionale for Project Expansion. During
most of the 1980s, the Chadian economy faced severe difficulties. These stemmed from a
combination of armed conflict, civil war, drought, political turmoil, and declining
competitiveness. In addition since 1990, the terms of trade seriously worsened, because of the
fall in cotton world prices. Despite these serious problems, economic development efforts
have made promising progress in some areas during periods of stability. In particular,
encouraging steps were taken during the 1987-90 period, when some stability was temporarly
restored.
6.    During 1987-90, there were three annual arrangements with the IMF under the
Structural Adjustment Facility, and IDA approved the Financial Rehabilitation Credit. The
Adjustment program focused on improving public resource management and efficiency in the
Cotton Sector, and also addressed efficiency issues in transport, livestock and trade.
Substantial economic growth was recorded in 1988-89, and this was accompanied by rising
fiscal revenues which permitted investment to double to the still modest level of 10% of GDP.
The structural program generated major cost savings in the cotton sector, restoring the cotton
processing industry to profitability and increasing returns to farmers. Moreover, cotton
exports rose as a result, reducing the external current account deficit by 6% of GDP. The
conibination of liberalization and improved road conditions reduced road transport costs by
about 30%.  More modest, but still significant gains were made through a program to
liberalize livestock exports.
7.    The Government of the Republic of Chad, after close consultation with the member
countries of the CFA zone, decided to change the fixed parity of the CFA francs from 50 to
100 CFAF per French Franc with effect from January 12, 1994. The Government has decided
to use the opporunities created by this change in parity to launch a new economic ard social
program. The aims of this program are to:
(a)   re-establish order in public finances through elimination of payment arrears and
restoration of tax collection systems;
(b)   correct macroeconomic imbalances, notably on the fiscal accounts, through
improved revenue collection and reduced expenditures and through monetary
restraint;



-3-
(c)   improve economic incentives for the key agricultural sector, especially cotton
and livestock;
(d)    restore public investment and create an environment conducive to private
investment, which, together with the agricultural incentives should re-start
growth; and
(e)    accompany these adjustmnent measures with expanded poverty alleviation
measures and human resources development programs.
8.    The recent devaluation of the CFA should facilitate a supply response to the shift of
relative prices and the associated benefits should be seen in the boosting of local agricultural
markets. However, this response will take some time and the associated benefits will be fully
visible only in the medium-term. The major challenge for the Bank is, therefore, to provide
quick and visible support for the response to the devaluation. A careful analysis of IDA's
lending instruments in Chad reveals that the proposed supplemental credit is one of the best
tools to ensure the two objectives of rapidity and visibility through the improvement of
agricultural roads in the Salamat region -known to be the most productive agricultural area of
the country. This specific investment will contribute to poverty alleviation by providing the
basis for durable improvements in standards of living, particularly in rural areas where the
majority of Chad's poor live and in facilitating the marketing of local products thus lowering
transport costs and ultimately consumer prices. Low-income farmers will be encouraged to
increase their agricultural production b, providing improved facilities for transfers to
consumption centers.
9.    County Assustance Strategy. The current CAS statement was reviewed by the Board
in May 1993 and an updated CAS is tentatively scheduled for Board presentation in March
1995. The proposed supplemental credit is fully consistent with IDA's strategy which stresses
the need to focus on assisting the government in four areas:
(a)    adopting sound macroeconomic and sector policies;
(b)   restoring the Government's capacity to govern and administration's capacity to
function;
(c)    maintaining the emphasis on human resources development; and
(d)    encouraging the private sector to respond to the new conditions created by the
devaluation.
Description of the Proposed Supp ental Credit
10.    Description. The supplemental credit will provide financial assistance for:



(a)   the rehabilitation of the Abou Deia - Deresna (60 km), Bitkine - Melfi (118
kin) highways, and Eref - Mangalme (50 Ian); and
(b)   the services of consultants assigned to supervise the execution of the civil
works.
This rehabilitation program has been appraised with the Second Transport Project (TSP
Ii) and presented to the Transport Sector Round Table held in November 1993. Due to limited
contributions from donors, this program was postponed.
11.      The proposed supplemental credit will support GOC's efforts to open up the
agricultural production areas to the consumption centers, hence increasing agricultural
production, creating more incentive for import substitution and creating employment through
efficient and economic rural infrastructure.  The implementing agencies, namely the
Directorate of Roads qrd the Project Coordination Unit set up under the first Transport Sector
Project (Cr. 2007-CD), have proven in the past five years to be an excellent tool for efficiently
managing the Project.
12.    Technical Studies and Construchton. The detailed technical studies of the Abou Deia -
Deresna and Eref-Mangalme are in accordance with standards agreed with the donor
community for agricultural rural roads. The studies for the Bitkine-Melfi road are in progress
and are also in conformity with the standards set. The three road links will be rehabilitated
over the existing alignments, which are satisfactory. They cross country :hat is generally flat
to undulating; there is therefore little in the way of earth moving involved. Fords, culverts and
drainpipes in bad condition will be repaired or replaced. These existing structures will be
reinforced with new elements in order to protect the investment against the erosion and
torrential runoffs occurring in the project areas during the rainy season.
13.    In the context of the TSP II, the Government provided the resources to ensure reliable
financing of road maintenance by means of permanent budget revenues. In view of the
constraints thus imposed on the public sector, coupled with those derived from the recent
monetary realignments, the Government's contribution has been limited to the financing of
recurrent costs for the maintenance of these roads, once rehabilitated subject to their inclusion
of the maintenance program of the Directorate of Roads. Therefore, it is proposed that IDA
finance iOO% of the supplemental credit cost net of taxes. The overall IDA contribution to the
Chad lending program would still remain under the 90% financing limit.
14.    Benefits. The proposed project is fully complementary to the TSP II in that it will
foster accomplishment of the latter's principal objectives: (i) rehabilitation of the priority road
network in order to reduce vehicle operating costs; (ii) reduction of transportation costs by
consolidation of the liberalization and privatization process; (iii) increasing of competition and
encouragement of the private sector to play a larger role in road rehabilitation in order to bring
operating costs down; and (iv) support for the strategy for reducing poverty in Chad by
lowering the cost of stapl foodstuffs and creation of employment in the enterprises involved.



-5-
15.    More specifically, the proposed supplement is justified by the results of the standard
cost-benefit studies for road rehabilitation projects. The analysis made during the nreparation
of the TSP II has been updated to take into consideration the effects of the devaluation of the
CFA franc in January 1994. On the cost side, the most recent rehabilitation and current and
periodic maintenance works have been taken into account. In regards to benefits: the
foreseeable reduction in operating costs for the vehicles presently using the roads, the benefits
deriving from the higher agricultural added value in the case of the regions that normally
produce a ce.reals surplus, and also the benefits from increased traffic, were considered. The
estimates are consistent with those made for the preparation of the TSP n, and are prudent
when compared with the benefits actually observed following completion of the preceding
IDA-financed projects. The economic rate of return for the rehabilitation is 18% for the Abou
Deia-Deresna road; 27% for Eref-Mangalme; and 10% for the Bitkine-Melfi road. These
sections would, in fact, have been included in TSP II had funding been available.
16.    Program Objectves Categories. This Project supports the poverty reduction strategy
for Chad by bringing about reductions in the prices of basic food stuffs by increasing transport
means and reducing transport costs, and by creating employment opportunities through the
greater involvement of small private sector firms.
17.    Environmental Aspeas. The Second Transport Project is rated Category B. The new
activities to be financed under the Supplemental Credit would have no significant impact on the
environment. There are no resettlement issues and there is no risk of deforestation or property
disturbance. However, environmental considerations will be an important component in the
design and execution of a civii works program. Mitigation measures are included in the
detailed engineering and specifications. They take into account the geographic specificities of
the roads with respect to geomorphology, hydrology and climatic conditions, such as
preserving shoulders and providing surface drainage systems; design erosion control measures
for protecting the environment.
18.    Risks. The main risk remains the political instability of the country. It should
nevertheless be noted that this risk did not in fact impact the three preceding projects, which
were executed in accordance with the schedules initially set. This risk would be minimized by
close supervision by Bank Staff and careful attention will be paid during the preparation of the
project to the permanent dialogue with the senior governmental authorities, to ascertain
Govermnent conunitment at all levels to carry out the project in an orderly and transparent
manner.
19.    Lessons Learned from Previous IDA Involvement.  The main lessons critical for
successful project implementation have been learned from the first three operations: (i) policy
reforms and investments must be integrated as a package; (ii) a secure funding mechanism for
road maintenance is essential and (iii) private sector involvement and institutional building are
essential for sustainability. The proposed supplement credit has incorporated these lessons.
Notably, execution of works by private sector will be achieved by directly -ntracting out
rehabilitation, as well as future maintenance works.

Implementation of the SupplementaC Credit
20.    Institutional Arrangements. The bids for civil works could be launched as early as
July 1994, and actual implementation of works could start by November 1994 and completed
by December 1995. The supplemental credit is expected to be fully disbursed by March 1996..
21.    Agreed Actions. As a condition of effectiveness, the Borrower shall have prepared
bidding documents, satisfactory to IDA, for the works to be carried out under the supplementai
credit.
22.    Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed supplemental credit will comply
with the Article of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve it.

Implementation Issues
1.     The political and economic situation is characterized by the transition period to
democratic elections currently scheduled for March 1995. 'he political situation remains
fragile although it was not effecting the Chadian investment portfolio performance (rated
satisfactory) despite the weak institutional capacity and the poor performance of the ongoing
public finance stabilization program. In January 1994, Chad, in conjunction with other
members of the CFA zone decided to devalue the CPA franc from 50 to 100 per French franc;
this has provided an opportumity to restore competitiveness in cotton and livestock sectors
although the macroeconomic environment is not yet improved.
2.     Portfolio performance: the overall implementation of the Chad portfolio improved in
FY94 compared to FY93. During the FY93 review, Chad was singled out for having three
problem projects (30%) out of ten operations. During FY94, vigorous actions were taken to
address this issue. As a result the Chad investment portfolio is currently free from problem
projects. The only problem remains the implementation of the public finance stabilization
program which is slower tha anticipated. Disbursement perfonnance has remained good and
there is no late or unqualified audits in FY94. Good progress has been also made in
procurement processes and capacity.
3.     Weak portfolio management: this is primarily due to weak institutional capacity and
lack of skills for some project directors, particularly in relation with procurement procedures,
accounting systems and auditing. To improve the portfolio in these areas, a supervision unit is
created within the Ministry of Planning to monitor more carefully the timely availability of
counterpart fimds and the standardization of accounting systems and procurement processes.
The Bank's team has played an important role in helping the Government design the needed
correctve measures to improve the implementation capacity.
