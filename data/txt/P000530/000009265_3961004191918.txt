MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF IDA TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF CHAD
FOR A SECOND TRANSPORT SECTOR PROJECT
1.          I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation oqn a
proposed development credit to the Republic of Chad for SDR 2.6 million, on standard IDA
tems with a maturity of 40 years to help finance a second project for the transport sector. Other
external financing will be provided by the European Development Fund (EDF), the French
Cooperation Agency (CFD), the Cen   Africa Development Bank (BDEAC), and the OPEC
Fund. Donors such as Kuwait PFnd, Islamic Development Bank, African Development Bank and
BADEA have expressed their interest in participating in the financing of the project.
2.           Cowry Economic Background. Chad presents a major development challenge. It
juxtaposes a highly uncertain political siuation, extreme poverty, and reasonable growth
prospects. Chad is a vast country, the fifth largest in Africa, and groups together a large number
of extraordinaily diverse ethnic groups. With 5.8 million inhabitants and a per capita GNP
simated at US$210 in 1991, Chad is one of the poorest, least-developed countries in the world.
Economic development efforts have been dchaa zed by successive promising starts stymied by
serious intern  and external blows. Recmring political instability and domestic strife, which
erupted into civil war from 1979 to 1983, have been and remain the most inactable constaints
to development. Since the end of the war, Chad has made substantial progress in rehabilitating
and reformng its economy, embarking on a broad adjusmt effbrt supported by the Bank and
the IMP in 1987. Real GDP growth averaged 4.5% per year during the adjustment period (1987-
1990). Following the abrupt change in political regime in December 1990, Chad's adjustment
program went off-tracl and a serious fiscal crisis developed, with a current deficit of 4.7% of
GDP in 1992 (despite efforts to reduce the wage biUl). Paradoxically, real GDP growth has
average 8% for the last two years due to favorable weather conditions.
3.           Couny Assisance Strategy. The Bank's assistance strategy supports the
objectives of alleviating poverty and improving the prospects for long-term growth by: (i)
increasing the accessibility and quality of basic social services; (i) increasing incomes through
productivity increases and improved services (including transportation) to the agricultural sector
where the majority of the popuation live and work; (iii) improving basic infrastructure which
serves to increase competitiveness and improve welfare; (iv) promoting employment generation
and entrepreneurship by encouraging the provision of services by the private sector; (v)
supporting the reallocation of public expenditures towards development purposes; and (vi)
promoting a coherent strategy for tapping the potentia of the energy sector. The strategy builds
on Chad's positive attributes: a relatively unregulated economy; the modest size of the public
sector; high level officials' openness and eagerness for technical advice; the important role of
private (profit and non-profit) and community organiations in the provision, management and
financing of basic services; the established practice of cost recovery; and the Chadian peoples'
resilience in the face of difficulty. The Country Assistance StrateW statement, discussed by the
Board in May 1993, contains a full discussion of recent economic developments and the Bank's
assistance program.

4.           Secor Background. A land-locked country like Chad has Important rasportion
requiremens and high costs due to factors beyond its control: its vastness, low density of
population and economic activiy in much of the country, and a disance of 1,700 km to the
nearest seaport. Among the major hracteritcs of Chad's transport sector are the predominance
of the highway subsector, which accounts for the bulk of domesdc and ineaonal traffic.
There is no railway nor are there any feasible plans to build one. Seasonal inland water transpo-
is possible on a few river sections and cerWain parts of Labe Chad, thougb navigability of
warway has generally been affected in recent yeas by erratic rainfall patterns. Becase of this,
a meaniul strategy for Chad's tramport sector must be focussed on the bighway network and
the trucking industry. Chad'a highway network consists of about 7,300 km of classified roads,
the bulk of which foil ilto disrepair during the war, and certain parts of the country were virually
inccessible during the rainy season with a deimenal effect on economic development. The
poor conditions of the road network led to acceerated vehicle wear and tear and, hence, high
transport operating costs.
5.           After several years of disruption, the Bank resumed its operations in Chad in 1986
with a Highway Mainteance Project (Cr. 1728-CD), followed by a Road Reconstruction Project
(Cr. 1901-CD). These two projects were very successful in implementing an emergency road
rehabilitation program of about 2,000 km which permitted the reestablishment of communications
between the country's main cities and the resumption of economic activities. Ihese two projects
also made a start at reestablishing the Road Sector A saton and served as a vehicle to
broadening the dialogue between IDA and the Government on the overall tsport sector, leading
to the implemeAion since 1989, of a Transport Sector Adjustment/nvestment Project (TSAIP).
6.           The TSAIP, the flrst hybrid policy and investment program in the region,
supported within the transport sector the objectives of Chad's mac-ecomic adjustment
program. The TSAIP, which Is nearing completion, assisted the Government in: (a) the
rehabilitation and m nce of 3,800 km of prioriy roads drawn from the donor-supported
Transport Sector Investment Plan 1988-1993; (b) improvements in resource mobilization and
allocation in the transport sector in order to secure ade e maintenance of the rebabitated
network; (c) the abolition of the existing monopoly and administered tarifft in order to reduce the
cost of trucking operations, pass vehicle operating cost savings on to shippers and elicit a supply
response from the productive sectors of the economy; (d) promotion of increased competition and
greater role of the private sector in the road consruction industry; and (e) strengthening of the
public administration of the transport sector. The resuls obtained, so far, are very encouraging,
not only for the rehabilitation program which is progressig very well, but also for the policy
actions taken, which led to a complete libertion of the road transport industry and
consequently to a substantial reduction of trspot costs. As a reslt of the on-going project,
there has been a drop of 30% in vehicle operating costs and also a reduction in average freight
rates which were passed on to consumers. In addition, a restructg plw for Air Tca is
underway and must be sustined. Efforts to improve the management of the road sector and to
ensure stable financing for it were less successful and will be pursued under the proposed project.
However, despite the sog perfmace on policy reforms, the mac-economic suation
deteriat  following change of Govement in 1990. SpecIfically, revenue collecion has
proved difficult and overall budgetary management has been weak. Consequentiy, the TSA" was
changed from a sector adJustment proJect to a sector investment project in Sqeember 1992 upon
Board approval and the remaiing quick-disbursing funds under the Credit were reallocated to the
investment componen  They were used to strengthen the road rehabilitation program and the
inst onal development component agreed under the project.

7.           Project Objeatves. 'he main objectives of the proposed project are to: (a)
stimulate industrial nd agricultura development and regional trade through frther Improvements
I transport xector efficiency focussing on condnued reductions in vehicle operating costs and
improvements in the efficiency of the transort market; (b) strengthen public investment
efficiency, tansparency and budgetary management; (c) Improve ir  resource mobilization to
sati*  the long-term need for routine road mainten ; (d) promote private sector involvement in
road mlaitenance and stengthen the road transport industry; and (e) streamline public
adminitation of the sector. To achieve these objectives, the proposed Second Transport Sector
Project (SP U) would implement: (a) the consolidation agenda to ensure that the positive
achievements under TSAIP are malntaijed; (b) the continuing agenda of sectoral objecves that
were only partially met under TSAIP; and (c) the evolving agenda to address newly introduced
long-term issues for the wansport sector program. In summary, the content of the agendas is as
follows:
(a) Lk ConAuoiadon. a:  hivesmeplannlng
road mainenance
resource mobalon and allocaton
lberalzaton and deregulation
(b)t7   Contng Agna         s n  buUdJg

(cJ the Eo]Wng Ago&:      secondary agriuural road rehabUitation
environent
regioa  wegration ad tradefacltadon
8.           Project DescrWon. Ihe proposed project would support these agendas through a
set of policy measures largely met through up-front conditionalities and trough investment
componens. The hyai works gnpnt consists of: (i) a program of road maintenance and
brWge stengthening on the existng priority network of 4,760 kn; (H) a rehabilitation program of
about 300 km of secondary roads crucial for the linkage between a region of agricultural potential
(Salamat) and main consumption centers. The pogrgm of insatbidtJo   strengkhening comprises:
(i) consulting services for civil works design and supervision, soil research studies and testing,
and technical and financi d audits; (i) consulting services, to promote private entrepreneurship
for small and medium ccnstruction conaos and small truckers; Oii) technical aistance and
trning (mainly short-term consultancies) for transport sector insions (Directorate of Roads,
Air Tchd, BNF, Deorates of Civil Aviation and Land Transport, the Project Coordinaon
Uni); (iv) support for the implem tion of a regional igration action plan aiming at
faclitatg Chadian international trade for road and air transport; and (v) implementation of a
tramsport sector eironmental action plan. The cost (broken down by expenditure category and
implementing agency) and fhamncing plan for the Investment Program and the project are given in
Schedule A, the procremat and disbursement arrangements in Schedule B. The timetable of
key processing events is given in Schedule C.
9.           Project hlemention. The project would be implemented by the Ministry of
Public Works and Transports (MTPI) and the autonomous agencies under its tuage, namely the
Socl  Natonale d'Enxreti  Rker (SNER), and the airine company, Air Tad. The role of
MTPI would be rdefined to include only planning, programming, budgetng and supervision;
SNER, opeat"g according tO pivae sector management practices, would be limited to the
eeuton of maintenance works. Also the role of the private sector in works execution would be



4
greatly enhanced, with al but a maximum of 50% of routine maintnace to be executed by
private entrepreneur. The Project Coordination Unit set up under the pviowus project within
MTPT will continue to coordinate the various activities within the Govenment and with donors.
10.          Projea Sustalnabiity. The focus of the policy reforms and institutional
strengthening is to ensure that road rehabilitation Is manaed effectively. The creation of a
Compte Asonome d'EntretJen Rouder (CAER), n autonomous account which wIll receive the
road matennce funds on a monthly basis, will help to ensure the adequate financing of road
maintenmace on a sustnable long-tem basis. In the short-tem, capacity improvements of the
transport parastats would be achieved through restructring leading to broadenig ownership,
which will set the stage for privadzation in the medium mrm. Consolidating the achievements of
the previous projects and adopting new approaches to continig agenda items will also enhance
project sustainability.
11.          Lessons Learned fion Previous IDA  avolmement. Three main lessons critical for
successfil project implementaion have been learno from the first three opations: (i) policy
reforms and investments must be iotegred as a package; (ii) a secure fumding mechanism for
road mainece is essential; and (iii) private sector involvement and instittional building are
essential for sustainability. The proposed project has incorporated these lessons. First, the
proposed project will introduce the CAMR to receive Government's monthly deposits for the road
maintenance funds. Second, involving the prvate sector in road maintenamce could not be
achieved through a public entity because it created a de facto conflict of interest for the public
enty. Execution of works by the private sector will be achieved during the proposed project by
directly contrang out a substantal portion of mainteace works and by strengthening the
capacity of the emerging private constuction industry. Third, attempts to improve public
management of the sector were severely hampered by the need, in the first project, to place
technical assistance in line positions due to the absence of local expertise in the aftermath of the
war. Restructuring MTPT on private sector principles with the emphasis on contract management
rather than works executbn will address this problem. The small core of local technicians will be
suor  not by long-term, but by short-term, targeted technical assistance. This approach
combines the concepts of capacity-building with capacity-tapping, i.e., making use of local
expertise wherever it can be found.
12.         Radonalefor IDA Involwnent. IDA has taken a lead role in the reconstruction of
Chad's transportation instructure and the definition of a coherent policy fiamework and
inestment program. The proposed project continues this frit   part ip witi the
Government and donors. The country assistance strategy was discussed by the Board on May 25,
1993. The project supports the objectives of this assistance strateW by strengthening Chad's
competitiveness through reducing the cost of production inputs and outputs. The project supports
implementation of a set of sector policy measures and a comprehensive infrastucture
rehabilitaton and mainteace program whlrh have already (under TSAIP) greatly improved
inal and external trade, thereby contributing to economic growth.
13.         Agreed Aacons. During negotatons, the Govenment provided assurances that it
will: (a) apply the principles defied in the Letter of Transport Sector Policy related to
deregulation, liberaization of transport, selection of road iehabilitation investments, and
application of standards; (b) not undertake any Investment or acquiton of transport equipment
above an aggregate amount of CFAF 200 million annually tiat are not included In the Investment
Program; (c) deposit the monthly allocations for road mntenance into the CAER; (d) contract
out no less thn 50% of routine maitan  activities to the private sector, the remainder to be



S
executed by SNER (no routie or periodic maintance aivities performed by SNER would be
finnced by the credit); and (e) cowmit itself to appointing and mainaining high level staff with
qualifications and experience acceptable to IDA to head the main Directorates in MTPr and the
entitles under Its tutelage. In addition, the following would be oanditions of effectiveness: (a)
the adoption of a dissolution plan to terinae the operation of OFNAR; (b) the adoption of the
new organizational chart and "cahier des charges' for MTPT; (c) creation of SNER and adoption
of procedures manua for SNER; (d) the appointment of a General Manager, a Technical
Director, a Financial Director and a Management Controller for SNER acceptable to IDA; (e) the
agreement on the perfomce conract for A.ir Tehad restructuring; and (t) the multi-year
appointment of an exten  auditor acceptable to IDA.
14.          Enromwntal Aspects. Tne projet is rated category B. The maintenance ano
rehabilitation components of the proposed project would have no significant impact on the
enviromnent. There are no resettement Issues and there is no risk of deforestation or property
disturbances. Environmeotal consideration wfll be.an important component in the design ama
execution of iraucture operations. Meaures will be included in the terms of reference for
detailed engineering and specifications. They will take intc account the geographic specificities of
the priority network with respect to geomorphology, hydrology, and climatic conditions. For the
existing network, meases will consist of preserving shoulders and providing surfAce drainage
systems, through: (a) protection of the slope of embankment and cuts containing erodible soil,
through grass seeding, sodding or planting small trees and shrubs; and (b) design of main ditches
so that the water will be properly channelled and the ditch section protected against erosion. In
addition to protecing the environment, erosion control measures would have the advantage of
reducing maintenance work, especially on surface drainage systems, small structures, and
surfac. While safety is also improved by suitable shoulder greenery because it improves depth
perception by providing vertical points of reference. Other measures will consist of clearing
ditches to evacuate stagnating water, and removing vegetation to limit bush fires along the roads.
A detailed environmenal plan for the transport sector to be implemented under the proposed
project has been agreed with the Government.
IS.          Program Objecthe Categories. This project supports the poverty reduction
strategy for Chad by bringing about reductions in the prices of basic food stffs through
reductions in transport costs and by creating employment opporunities through the greater
involvement of small private sector frms. In addition, the project aims at increasing the
efficiency of both public and private sector mangment.
16.          Project Benefis. Tbis transport sector project is justified since Chad's landlocked
economy relies entirely on roads for efficient intra- and inter-country trade. It would reduce
transport costs, expand trade within the region, a&ue modemn access for remote agricultural
production cntes  and increase farmers' incomes. This results in rates of return for highway
rehabilitation and maintenance that range from 14% to 42%. For the secondary agricultural road
rehabilitation packlag, the rate of return is 13%. The proposed project will continue to approach
the sector in a comprehensive way, especially taking into account the need for efficient
complementarity of air and road transport. The project will also introduce measures which will
aim at having a positive impact on the environment.
17.          RW*. The principal risk remains the chronic political instability which might
affect political commtment to fulfll or sustain policy reforms and to meet finacial commimen_t.
To minimize this risk, careful attention was given during project preparation to building a broad
consensus at a high Governmt level, with technical staff, and with all donors that are active in



6
the sector on the measures proposed and supported by the project. lhe November 1992 Round
Table on the Transport Sector was evidence of this consensus. In addition, deted procedures,
standardized documentation and the fact that the Government has a good record in project
execution under prevlios projects will minimize the risks of poor project implementation.
18.          Recommendaon. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Artidcles of Agreement of the Associadon and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

ImplemeXion Issues
Of the six credits currently disbursing, three below have significant disbursement lags.
1.    Enic and Financial M gan        Prjc (Cr. 1872-CD). The credit became
effective on September 23, 1988, almost eight months after signing. About US$1.5 million has
been disbursed. the project was originaly designed to improve economic and financial
management in five government agencies. Disbursements have been slow due to poor project
management which caused a serious delay in implementation. The project director has been
replaced, and the project has been streamlined. The national population census, currently
scheduled for April 1993, will result in disbursements of approximately US$1.8 million equivalent
(IDA and Swiss grant funds). Additional disbursements are expected to increase given other new
commitments under the project.
2.    Livestok Pro (Cr. 1912-CD). The credit became effective on January 27, 1989,
almost seven months after signing. About US$10.2 million has been disbursed. Disbursement
has been delayed by the slow start of the sub-components for extension, privatization of veterinary
services, and credit. The extension component is now underway, the veterinary prograa is being
reorganized, and management of the credit program will be conracted to VITA, a suessful
donor-supported NGO.
3.    Soial Dvement Action Project (Cr. 2156-CD). The credit became effective on April
17, 1991, almost ten montfs after signing. About US$5 million has been disbursed. This project
was designed to strengthen the formulation of sectoral strategies for meeting basic needs and to
develop human resources over the long term. Disbursemens have been delayed by a slow start-
up of the health, policy planning and labor sub-components. The Government has agreed to the
reallocation of funds to the successful credit and infrastructure sub-components and to the use of
project funds for the support of new projects in health and in public works and employment.
