INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTIuN AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF ThE PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED PROGRAM LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF ZAMBIA
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
program loan to the Republic of Zambia in an amount in various currencies
equivalent to $30 million. The loan would have a term of 20 years,
including five years of grace, with interest at 7¼ percent per annum.
PART I - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN ZAMBIA
2.        As of April 30, 1973 tne Bank had made thirteen loans to Zambia
totalling $178.6 million, after cancellations of which US$123.9 million
are now held by the Bank/l. IFC made its first investment in Zambia in
February, 1972, providing US$1.1 million for expansion of a shoe manufactur-
ing company. Present and future Bank operations are discussed in detail in
the President's Report on the Ihird Education Project which was circulated
to the Executive Directors on May 16. This information is summarized in
Annex II which also contains a statement of Bank and IFC operations as of.
April 30, 1973 and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
PART II - STRUCTURE OF THE ECONOMY
3.        The Zambian economy has two distinctive features.   First, it
relies heavily on one industry, copper mining, and is therefore affected
by the instability of the price of copper (see Annex I). Second, the
country's geographic position; it is landlocked and borders to the south
on Southern Rhodesia with which political relations have been strained.
As a result, the interpretation of economic developments is particularly
difficult and projections into the future are subject to more than the
normal margins of error.   In the recent past, this has been clearly
demonstrated by the sharp fluctuations on the copper market and the
Southern Rhodesian border emergency. These are discussed in detail in
Part III of this report.
4.        The copper industry is the core of a modern sector which, in
addition, consists of important manufacturing and large-scale agricultaral
activities dominated by expatriates. While the modern sector has developed
fairly rapidly over the past decade, the rural subsistence economy has
stagnated. The economy shows thus a pronounced dualistic structure. The
existence of a strong modern sector nas both advantages and disadvantages

on May 29, and a loan for the Kafue Hydro-electric Project will be
presented for your consideration shortly.



for the development of the economy. Copper has provided the foreign
exenange and the domestic resources to meet the growing investment needs
or the economy. Since independence, Zamoia has been investing over 30 per-
cent of its gross national product and has made a major and successful
effort to develop its industry, education, nealth services, power resources,
transportation and urban infrastructure.  Despite the cost to Zambia of tile
Southern Riodesian Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) its gross
domestic product (ignoring terms of trade effect) grew by 5.5 percent
yearly from 1964 to 1970. In 1970, however, two major events occurred
which have arrested the growth of the economy. In September, 1970, part of
the largest copper mine in the country, Mufulira, flooded causing a severe
loss in production. Up to the end of 1972 this represented losses in
foreign exchange earnings of almost K170 million ($235 million) and in
government revenue of K60 million ($84 million). At about the same time,
the world copper price dropped sharply from K1200 to K780 a ton. The
combined result of both events was a fall in the value of copper output of
40 percent between 1969 and 1971 and a fall in GNP per capDita from $425 to
about $350 over the same period. This not only dramatized the country's
dependence on income from copper but also indicated that the previous boom
in copper price had masked certain weaknesses in development policy. Tne
development of agriculture, while not ignored, never achieved any notable
success because the introduction of institutional and policy changes needed
to develop agriculture, particularly the smallholder ZanDian sector, was
difficult and time-consuming. Prior to independence, much of the marketable
agricultural production came from large foreign-owned farms. The transition
from this to developing the small Zazibian farmer was inherently difficult;
the process has been slow. For the national economy, this was not disastrous
because an easy foreign exchange situation during the period of high copper
price permitted rising food imports. However, as the productivity of small
farmers was not increased, the gap between the modern urban and the
traditional rural sector widened. In 1971, average per capita GNP in the
modern sector was estimated at $600 and in the traditional sector at $100.
5.        Wages in the copper industry have increased rapidly and h-ave
exerted an upward pull on industrial wages as well, thereby giving Zambia
a high-cost industrial str4cture.  The constant attempt of the non-mining
sectors to narrow the gap between their wages and those of the mining
sector have made the pursuit of an effectivTe incomes policy difficult. The
level and rate of growth of wages and salaries have had a pervasive effect
on the structure of the econovy. They have rnot been compensated by an
adjustment in the exchange rate; thus the diversification of exports,
substitution of imports, and expansion-of employment opportunities have
been inhibited. Furtnermore, high wages have adversely affected the
generation of domestic savings in general and of government resources for
development in particular.
6.        The continuing poverty of the small rural farmers has, however,
to be seen in perspective. The number of people who are solely dependent
for their livelihood on small-scale agriculture has decreased from almost
60 percent or the total population in 1964 to about 50 percent now, a low
percentage by African standards. Because of the strong increase in urban



-3-
employment by 7 percent a year since independence, many people who left
rural areas could be absorbed in urban areas, where through active govern-
ment support for self-help "?site and services schemes" the worst excesses
of rapid urbanization could be avoided. Nevertheless, 12 to 15 percent of
the urban labor force remains unemployed.
7.        Some progress has been achieved in improving the quality of life
in rural areas, in particular educational and health services. Primary
school enrollment in rural districts increased from less than 50 percent of
the age group in 1966 to more than 70 percent in 1970, and the number of
rural health centers increased by 50 percent since independence. At the
same time, the vast difference between African and non-African income
levels in the modern sector has narrowed as the average income of African
employees increased faster than that of non-African employees.
o.        Zambia's future development is subject to two major constraints:
shortage of skilled manpower and of investable resources. At independence,
Zambia had 100 local university graduates and 1,200 secondary school
graduates. Since then, it has made remarkable progress in developing
education. At present, there are over 800 Zambian university graduates in
the country and the annual output from secondary schools has risen to over
0,000. While the efforts of the government were initially directed towards
rapidly increasing the output of the educational system, a more selective
approach has recently been adopted. The emphasis is now on providing high-
level manpower and on vocational and technical training.
9.        A severe shortage of educated and skilled Zambian manpower still
persists and constrains the capacity to prepare and implement development
projects. This is illustrated by the large number oI' non-African employees
in all brancrnes of the economy, who total about 6 percent of all wage
employment and still fill most positions requiring a high level of training.
The shortage of educated and skilled manpower remains, therefore, the most
important structural constraint on Zambia's economic development.
10.       The second major constraint, the shortage of investable resources,
is the one with which this loan proposal and other Bank lending is primarily
concerned. This is discussed in Part III below.
11.       Because of limited borrowing in the past, Zambia's debt service
obligations are low. In 1972, service on public debt amounted to no more
than $8U million or 10 percent of exports. Half of this represents service
on government guaranteed bonds to compensate the copper companies ror the
government's equity participation. However, these payments impose no net
charge on the balance of payments; they replace dividends which, in the
absence of government participation, would have been remitted abroad. If
it is assumed that Zambia will require to contract new foreign debt on
conventional terms averaging $175 million a year from 1973 through 1985
to achieve its development objectives (as compared to an average of $85 mil-
lion during the past five years), debt service obligations would still not
amount to more than 10 percent of export earnings by 1985. Therefore,
there appears to be considerable scope for further external borrowing on
conventional terms.



PART III - THE RESOURCE CONSTRAINT
12.        From independence in 196h, until the decline in the copper price in
1970, there was no financial constraint to development in Zambia. During this
period, the gross national savings rate never fell below 30 percent. In several
years it was about 40 percent and in 1969, 5 percent. These are rates of
saving almost unheard of either in other developing countries or in developed
countries and would not have been sustainable even if the price of copper had
not fallen. They permitted a very high level of investment, whilst simultane-
ously net foreign reserves were built up to a level representing more than one
year's merchandise imports.
13.        In the course of 1970, however, the period of rapidly rising incomes,
foreign exchange earnings, savings, and government revenues came to an end as
a result of a combination of unfavorable factors discussed above (para. i).
These events have transformed the financial situation from one in which a large
resource surplus was generated to one generating large deficits in the govern-
ment budget as well as the balance of payments. The recurrent budget has not
been in balance since 1971 and foreign exchange reserves have fallen to a level
of about two months' imports despite two compensatory drawings from the DMF.
The major impact of this strained resource situation has been on the govern-
ment's development program which has been drastically reduced.
14.        The deterioration in the budgetary situation was compounded by two
additional factors. Firstly, recurrent expenditures increased sharply (by
50 percent between 1969 and 197L). Secondly, the reduction in government
revenue from the mining sector was aggravated by a change in copper taxation
introduced under the 1969 Master Agreement governing state participation in
the mining industry. To encourage increased production, this introduced a
full write-off of capital expenditure in the year in which the expenditure
was made and changed the tax system from one partly based on output to one
fully based on profit net of capital expenditure. Since 1970 the copper
industry has been expanding heavily to increase production. Furthermore,
from 1970 until the end of 1972, the co-oper price was depressed. Consequently,
there was a serious narrowing of the tax base and of revenue to the govern-
ment. The decline in incomes in the copper sector has had its impact on the
rest of the economy and, therefore, on the government's ability to tap resources
from it. Up to 1970, when internal resources were abundant, the government had
limited foreign borrowing and in 1971 and 1972 there was insufficient foreign
aid in the pipeline to replace the dwindling budgetary savings for investments.
The government had to resort to substantial deficit financing in those years
and this had its major impact in reducing external reserves rather than on
domestic prices. External reserves declined to the equivalent of two months'
merchandise imports by the end of 1972, a level which must be regarded as a
minimum for meeting trade and payments needs.
15.        The government is now faced with the task of mobilizing additional
donestic and foreign resources to overcome its financial difficulties. To
increase the availability of domestic resources for investment, it has to
reduce its recurrent deficit and increase transfers from the private to the
public sector. To alleviate the external resource constraint it has to mobilize
additional foreign resources both by increasing and diversifying exports and by
greater borrowing from abroad. In the following paragraphs we discuss the
budgetary and balance of payments positions.



Government Revenue
16.        Until 1970, the mtining industry contributed 60 percent of government
recurrent revenues. Given the heavy dependence of the economy on copper, the
price, costs and sales of copper and the structure of copper taxation, are
of dominant importance in determining government revenues. While the govern-
ment is making efforts to tax income.3 and expenditure in the non-copper sectors,
the scope for this is limited and at best the progress in this respect will be
gradual and will depend heavily on the diversification of the economy itself.
17.        We have referred to the changes in the structure of taxation earlier
(para. 14). In effect, this has meant that the government has to bear part
of the burden of financing the increased copper production. In the near future,
therefore, government revenues from copper will depend heavily on copper price.
This has been depressed since the second half of 1970 until earlier this year.
However, the average price during January to April 1973 has been about 20
percent higher than the average 1972 price and for the year as a whole may be
K880 per metric ton c.i.f. London which would be about 17 percent above the
1972 average. In the projections given in Annex I (Tables 1 and 2) this price
of K880 per ton is assumed to remain constant until 1976. However, the fiscal
imolications of variations in the price of copper are so significant that
alternative figures for budgetary deficits based on copper prices of K968 and
K792 after 1973 are also presented (i.e. 10 percent above and below the K880
level). In 1973 the effect of the higher prices has been partly eroded by
higher cost of production and transport of inputs. This is in part a result
of the closure of the border with Southern Rhodesia and as the transportation
situation improves, the costs are likely to return to normal levels by 1976.
The expansion program of the copper industry will increase production from
700,000 tons in 1973 to about 900,000 tons in 1976. This will contribute to
much higher government revenues by the late 1970's. Taxable profits will be
higher because of higher production as well as the system of capital expenditure
allowances, by which the new investments will have been written off for tax
purposes.
18.        To diversify the tax base of the economy away from its dependence
on copper the government has introduced additional tax measures on the rest
of the economy since 1968. Deductible allowances for personal income tax
have been restructured and its rate increased; the main excises have been
raised and new ones have been introduced; and customs duties have been
increased both by generalized surcharges on all dutiable imports and particular
increases for luxury commodities. Measures along these lines have been stepped
up both in the 1972 and 1973 budgets. The additional revenue arising from them
has been estimated at K40 million yearly. The government has taken a number
of measures to improve the assessment and collection of taxes. There is un-
doubtedly further scope for increased direct and indirect taxation, and the
government is actively examining what further action it should take to increase
budgetary resources. Even on the assumption of no change in the tax structure,
we estimate total recurrent revenues to increase by an average of about 9 percent
a year until 1976.



- 6-
Government Recurrent Expenditure
19.        Since independence,government recurrent expenditure has increased
by an annual average of 20 percent and now represents about 30 percent of GNP.
This high growth rate was in part due to the fact that until 1970 the revenue
required to finance it was available to the government. It was also due to
the fact that the government inherited a situation in which the provision of
basic services in education, health, housing, roads, etc., were inadequate.
Furthermore, the government had to face the expenditure burden of subsidies,
defense and internal security resulting from the Rhodesian UDI. Since 1970,
it has been clear to the government that it could not sustain the previous
rate of growth of recurrent expenditure if it were going to pursue its
development objectives. Consequently, significant action to check the growth
in expenditure has been taken as a result of which recurrent expenditure in
1972 decreased by about 1 percent from the previous year's level. However,
further action is needed in respect of fundamental issues which determine
recurrent expenditure growth, such as civil servants' salaries and sub-
sidies.
0.        The most pervasive recurrent expenditure problem is the growth
in the wage bill of the government. It stems from the fact that the govern-
ment does not at present control incomes paid by the copper industry, para-
statal organizations and the private sector. Considerations of equity and
incentives have exerted a strong pressure on the government to keep its wage
levels reasonably in line with those paid elsewhere in Zambia and, for
occupations where expatriates are important, also outside of Zambia. Its attempts
to resist these pressures have so far had little success. The government is
now firmly committed to take action on this matter since otherwise its entire
development policy would be frustrated for lack of domestic financial resources.
It has decreed that no increase in the general structure of government wages
and salaries shall be introduced and it has taken action to limit the level
of salaries of top officials of para-statal organizations. Fhrthermore, the
whole question of the determanation and structure of wages and salaries of
Zambian workers throughout the economy is being re-examined as a matter of
urgency.
21.        The second important element which has contributed to the rapid
growth in recurrent expenditure is subsidy payments. Most of the subsidies
support agricultural inputs or prices of agricultural commodities notably
maize and milk. It is difficult to determine what part of the subsidies acts
as incentive to producers, thus saving on imports and promoting exports, and
what part is a consumer subsidy. The government is now studying how the economic
and social objectives of its subsidy policy can be achieved without distorting
the system of relative prices. Finally, defense has in recent years become
an important and rising item in government expenditure.
Budgetary Position
22.        Table 1, Annex I, summarizes the budgetary position in 1971 and
1972 and projections for 1973-76. The projections are based on the assumption
of no change in measures affecting public revenues and a 6 percent annual
increase in non-emergency-related recurrent expenditure. This moderate rise



in recurrent expenditure differs markedly from past experience and would
therefore, require considerable restrairtby the government. For 1973 these
assumptions result in a financing gap of about K95 million, which in the
absence of further fiscal measures the government would have to fill by
borrowing from the banking system. Part of the expansionary impact of this
borrowing is expected to be neutralized by an increase in financial asset
holding, especially by the copper companies and also by further restrictive
monetary measures. Furthermore, part of the financial expansion will be a
response to rising costs stemming in particular from higher transport costs
and the diversion of trade routes. However, borrowing from the banking
system will have an impact on the price level and the government is taking
measures which it hopes will prevent the prices of certain consumer goods from
rising and also prevent a spillover into imports and drafts upon foreign
exchange reserves occurring. These measures include specific action to
control certain prices. Price controls can, however, only be expected to
have limited success in preventing actual prices from rising given their
restricted commodity coverage, the fragmented nature of the market and the
administrative problems involved. It therefore remains important for the
government to take further measures to contain expenditures and to increase
revenues.  The government has outlined to the Bank the policies which will
be followed to accomplish these ends, and has provided assurances regarding
early concrete action in some of these matters (see paras. 47 and 48 below).
Foreign Exchange Constraint
23.        Zambia's foreign exchange constraint has a short and a long term
dimension. The main short run problem is to mobilize sufficient foreign
exchange to meet the needs of the ongoing development program and the present
emergency. The long run problem is to take measures to reduce the effects
of fluctuations in the copper market on the balance of payments.
24.        Until the events of 1970 markedly reduced Zambia's foreign
exchange earnings from copper, the management of the balance of payments
consistent with the pursuit of an active development-policy raised no major
problems. Zambia's development program could be financed entirely from domestic
savings whilst at the same time reserves were accumulated. Consequently, the
government did not give much consideration to the role which foreign capital
inflow should play in its development. For the 7-year period from independence
until 1970, gross capital inflow on both public and private account was on
average little more than $20 million annually, and the net inflow was negative.
25.        However, even since 1970 the need to increase the capital inflow has
not received sufficient attention in economic planning. In part, this is
because Zambia has managed to support its development program by running down
reserves.  netween August 1970 and June 1972, these fell from K410 to K100
million. This was in large measure due to the deterioration of the trade
surplus which fell from a peak of K527 million in 1969 to K80 million and K1h9
million in 1971 and 1972, respectively. The deteriorating balance of payments
situation was arrested by measures taken late in 1971 and in 1972, which are



now starting to take effect. Until then regulations for import payments
and remittances were quite liberal.  Imports of certain luxury goods and
consumer goods, which are also produced locally, have now been prohibited.
A surcharge of 5 percent on dutiable imports was imposed in the 1972 budget
and this has now been raised to 10 percent. Further measures include
curtailment of travel and emigration allowances and remittances of expatriate
salaries and dividends. Dividend payments abroad Which were previously free
are now limited to 50 percent of profit or 30 percent of paid-up capital,
whichever is lcwer. Foreign companies are no longer allowed to keep working
balances abroad. In addition, Zambia obtained IMF assistance in the form
of two campensatory drawings in 1971 and 1972 of K14 million and K15 million,
respectively. A standby credit of K15 million was approved by the IMF Board
in May this year, and a $50 million Euro-dollar loan is now being negotiated.
The proposed program loan is designed to supplement these resources so that
Zambia's development effort, particularly in respect of ongoing public
sector projects, is not seriously impaired because of the shortage of
financial resources.
26.       The fundamental problem for the government is to ensure that the
development program does not continue to bear the major impact of the short-
age of foreign exchange. This can only be achieved through the adoption of
a combination of measures. These include measures required to reduce the
level of overall expansionary budgetary financing and the specific measures
such as tnose outlined in the previous paragraph designed to reduce expendi-
ture falling on the balance of payments and to increase non-copper earnings.
27.       In the longer run, the diversification of the economny should
stimulate in a rational manner the domestic output of goods at present
imported and diversify exports. In recent years the import of food has
risen particular2y rapidly and this could be reduced. if appropriate pricing
and other policies are pursued to raise agricultural outpalt. Table 2, Annex I,
sumarizes the balance or payments for 1971 and 1972 and projections for 1973-
1976. It indicates that despite the temporary scarcity of external resources.,
to which the proposed loan is addressed, Zambia's balance' of payments deficit
will be within manageable linits in the ceming years.
The 3ergency
28.       A special IBRD. economic mission which was in Lusaka in January,
1973 analyzed the Zambian financial problems and the government's investment
budget for 1973. At. that time ar increase in the political tension between
Southern Rhodesia and Zambia took place, and this subsequently resulted in.
the government's decision to reroute both its exports and imports away from
the transit tnrougn southern Rhodeaia. Subsequently, the UN Security Council
discussed the situation and sent a special UN mission to Zambia to assess
"the needs of Zambia to maintain alternative systems of traffic".  The mission
was assisted by a team of six experts, one of whom was a Bank staff member
fran our Permanent Mission in Nairobi. On the basis of its report and
information which has become available since, we now estimate that the effect
or the emergency on government revenues and the balance ot payments is as
follows:

e9.       Our estimates of the effect of the border crisis on the government's
financial position suggest that the overall budget deficits in 1973 and 1974
will exceed those estimated before the border closure by about K60 to 80 mil-
lion, both as a result of lower revenues (mainly because of the lower import
daties and income tax receipts) and higher expenditure (mainly for additional
manpower, vehicle operating costs and subsidies). Additional capital require-
ments for the purchase of trucks and other equipment are to be met through
supplier credits, and loans and grants from foreign governments -hich have
already been announced by a number of countries (Annex I, Table 4). As
regards its effects upon the balance of payments, we estimate that the
transport problem will cause imports to decline below the 1972 level by
10 percent in 1973. At the same time, it is estimated that the redirection
of trade will cause import prices and freight cost to rise. We expect that
the shortage of imported goods wil1 affect the speed of the copper industry's
expansion program. The reduced export receipts will, however, be more than
compensated by higher copper prices. Taking into account the expected
capital flows and a standby credit of Kl> million approved by the IMF, Zambia's
external reserves are likely to remain unchanged and would represent about two
months' import requirements.
30.       In summary, it is likely tnat the Zambians, by means of export
credits and additional official aid from bilateral sources, will be able to
meet all the costs of the emergency transport investments. It is possible
therefore to maintain for 1973 the government investment program of about
K115 million, as previously discussed with the Bank and outlined in the
budget. In practice, this will depend on Zambia's physical capacity to
import and on its ability to overcome the adninistrative difficulties
connected with the transport emergency program. However, even if imports
in 1973 are maintained at 90 percent of their 1972 level, it is certain
that the level of real resource availability will fall and consequently,
if the investment program is to be maintained, the consumption demands on
this level of real income by both households and government will have to be
reduced.

PART IV - INVESTMENT POLICIES AND PROGRAM
The Second National Development Plan
31.       In 1971 the government formulated its Second National Development
Plan 1972-1976 (SNDP). At the time, however, the developing budgetary and
balance of payments constraints were insufficiently recognized and, in the
light of the resource availability now projected, the investment program
in the SNDP appears to be overly optimistic.  The SNDP called for a total
investment outlay of about K2,000 million over the five-year period, of
which K950 million was an indicative planning figure for public enterprises
and the private sector (including K360 million for the expansion of the
copper industry) and the remainder -- K11,050 million -- represented govern-
ment capital expenditure. Government investment at this level would have
meant an average annual increase of some 5 percent in real terms over the
average level attained in 1969-71.
32.       The main emphasis of the SNDP is on bridging the gap between
urban and rural standards of living and on raising the general level of
education, as well as on developing a wide range of technical, administra-
tive and managerial skills to lessen the Zambian dependence on expatriate
expertise.  To provide employment opportunities for the large number of
people leaving rural areas, the SNDP also stresses the need to develop fur-
ther the modern sector, including mining. Investment in additional mining
capacity is also necessary to expand the future resource base of the country,
both in the form of foreign exchange earnings and government revenue. The
planned investment in the mining industry necessitates substantial further
investments in the power and transport sectors. To accommodate people mi-
grating to the cities in search of urban employment opportunities, the SNDP
envisages substantial investments in low-cost housing, site and services
schemes and upgrading of squatter compounds.
33.       The government's broad development objectives are very well con-
ceived. Because of the severe resource constraints, however, the SNDP can
no longer be used as an operational guide for the formulation of annual in-
vestment programs. Severe cuts were made in the originally intended govern-
ment investment programs for 1972 and 1973. In 1972, the government was
ill-prepared for the need to cut government investment expenditure. Cuts.
were made in an indiscriminate way with the result that there was some
severe disruption in ongoing priority programs. The preparation of the 1973
investment budget has been undertaken in a far more rational and selective
manner. The government, has recently set about reformulating the SNDP for
the remainder of the Plan period in the light of the expected resource
availability. The broad development objectives remain the same, but the
allocation of funds to the various sectors is likely to be affected by the
recent closure of the border between Zambia and Southern Rhodesia which will
necessitate additional investment in transport facilities.



The 1973 GoveDmment Investment Program
34.       The table below compares the government's present investment
program for 1973 with the one originally foreseen in the SNDP. In formu-
lating the revised investment program, the government has given priority
to (a) the completion of ongoing projects, (b) investments supporting the
expansion of the copper industry, and (c) projects for which foreign finan-
cing was available.

Preference for Ongoing Projects
35.       As a general principle it clearly makes sense, in a situation of
unexpected resource scarcity, to give priority to ongoing projects. Not



- 12 -
only would stopping these entail high costs, but in addition it is desir-
able that resources should not be extended so thinly that the benefits
from investment are considerably delayed. The 1973 capital budget con-
sisting of some 750 projects, spending on which is estimated at K114 mil-
lion, contains less than 50 new projects on which only K4 million will be
spent in 1973. This very limited emphasis on new projects in 1973 can be
compared with original plans for 125 new projects with a total project cost
of Ku?17 million on which some K20 million would have been spent in 1973.
In absolute amount, about half of the 75 projects now rejected or indefinite-
ly postponed would have been the responsibility of the Ministry of Power,
Transport, Co0imnications and Works. Large projects in that sector, which
well not be started, are all new roads, the economic viability of most of
which has not yet been established, improvements and extensions of airports,
a thermal power plant of doubtful economic justification and new government
office buildings. The only other major new iten deleted from the 1973 bud-
get is K3 million in loans and grants to local authoritie-s for improvements
in squatter compounds.
36.       Out of the originally envisaged capital budget expenditure in
1973 of K187 million, some K155 million would have represented expenaiture
for ongoing projects.  The fact that the actual capital budget for 1973
contains not more than K110 illion to be spent on ongoing projects indj-,
cates that even these projects had to be rephased to a eonsiderable extent.
Power, Transport, Commnications and Works
37.       Of overwhelming priority in Zambia is government investment to
support income-generating activities in the economy whicn expand the tax
base and generate foreign exchange. This criterion leads to the highest
priority being given to investment in support of copper production.  of
particular importance in this connection is investment in power and in cop-
per-related transport investment. The 1973 government investment program
reflects this need. Cuts in investment have rnot been applied to the com-
pletion of the Kafue I, Victoria Falls and Kariba North Bank power projects.
Likewise, investments related to the Tan-Zam Railway have been maintained.
On the other hand, outlays for municipal electricity schemes have been
drastically rephased, so that by the end of 1973 less than K2 Million will
have teen spent out of an SNDP estimate of K17 million for these projects.
The same is true of the rural electrification program. This program is an
integral part of the Intensive Development Zone (IDZ) program., and since
the latter is experiencing problems, it makes sense to delay proceeding with
the electricity component.
38.       rn "1transport, communications and workst" considerable savings
have been achieved (other than by entirely cutting out new projects) by re-
phasing work on such items as roads, civil aviation (airports, airport
buildings, aircraft), river transport, communications equipment, office
buildings and workshops and meteorological services.



- 13 -
Agriculture and Rural Development
39.       The government's objective in agriculture is to make the country
self-sufficient in basic foodstuffs and to improve the productivity of
traditional agriculture. The government intends to change its strategy of
agricultural development under the SNIDP. In the past, direct investment
by the Ministry of Rural Development, mostly in the form of services and
small production schemes, which in fact were demonstration farms for ex-
tension services, were thinly spread over the country without much impact
anywhere. Two new approaches were envisaged in the SNDP. Firstly, in the
traditional sector an approach of integrated rural development in a number
of areas with sufficient potential (called Intensive Development Zones -
IDV's), and, secondly, rehabilitating the commercial sector by placing
commercially-oriented Zambian farmers on land abandoned by expatriate farm-
ers. Almost K30 million was intended to be spent on these two types of
rural development during the SNDP period, of which R3 million was to be
spent in 1973. In fact, the 1973 budget includes only KO8. million for
both projects, but this is because serious delays had been experienced at
the planning stage. Had the absorptive capacity not been a constraint,
bothl types of development would have received considerably more funds. Di-
rect investment for rural development in the 1973 budget now consists main-
ly of outlays to keep the existing services and production schemes going.
40.       Most of the difference between the originally intended outlays
ror rural development and the actual 1973 budget figure is accounted for
by a smaller amount of government loans to certain public institutions
operating in the agricultural sector (K9 million as compared to K20 million
originally intended). This reflects the government's intention to improve
the financial viability of these para-statals, many of which had operated
at losses in the past. In 1971, the Ford Foundation provided valuable
tecnnical assistance to bring the para-statals on a sounder commercial foot-
ing, and an expert provided by the Ford Foundation is presently working on
the implementation of the recommendations.
The Social Sectors
41.       Education has high priority in Zambia. Though fractionally lower
than the SNDP estimate for 1973 (because of some rephasing), the 1973 bud-
get figure (K26 million) still represents a sizeable increase over the act-
ual outlay in 1972 (K20.2 million). The increase is entirely in technical,
secondary and post-secondary education where the needs are greatest. To
acnieve this increase, nowever, cuts had to be made in the original invest-
ment program for primary schools from K4.2 million to K3.1 million.
42.       Investment in health facilities in the 1973 budget has been kept
at about the same level as in 1972 (K6.7 million), although the SNDP called
for a higher figure (K9.5 million). Health is one of the sectors for which



- 14 -
the original SNDP estimates probably had been too ambitious. Since inde-
pendence, Zambia has made great progress in providing medical facilities
in both urban and rural areas. A consolidation of investment in health
facilities at approximately the present level would make it possible to
maintain the currently reasonable level of medical services.
43.       The sectors that clearly suffered most in trimming the 1973 bud-
get are low-cost housing (including squatter compound improvement)
and municipal water and sewerage scnemes (included in "Local Authorities"
in table on page 11), sectors which already suffered heavily in 1972.  Of
the planned SNDP outlay in 1973 of some K 13 million for site and services,
squatter improvement and self-help loans, only some K4 million is now bud-
geted to be spent in 1973. The cuts are unfortunate as they concern gene-
rally well-prepared programs to provide livable quarters to large numbers
of underprivileged people in the urban areas. Outlays for municipal water
and sewerage schemes will in 1973 be about half of what had been envisaged
under the SNDP though they will not be much lower than actual outlays in
1972.
44.       A general principle adhered to in the 1973 capital budget is to
cut expenditures for housing of civil servants. Expenditure for civil serv-
ants' nousing in Zambia is usually included in the amounts allocated to the
various projects and is, therefore, difficult to identify.  It is roughly
estimated to add up to K4 or K5 million in the 1973 budget, as compared to some
K10 million envisaged in the SNDP estimate. The amounts contained in the
1973 budget represent almost entirely the cost of completion of houses pre-
sently under construction. The decline in outlays for civil servants'
housing is not intended to be a temporary measure. It is part of a general
government policy gradually to end the provision of concessionary housing
to civil servants. If and when this policy is fully implemented, it will
not only free funds for other forms of government investment but also lessen
the burden on the recurrent budget.
Conclusion
45.       In reducing its investment target for 1973, the government has
had before it a set of sound criteria. The strong emphasis on the comple-
tion of ongoing projects, on projects supporting the copper industry's ex-
pansion program and on projects for which foreign financing will be avail-
able has already been mentioned. Furthermore, in rephasing or eliminating
certain sectoral allocations, projects of relatively low priority have
clearly felt the greatest impact. We are satisfied that the government's
present investment program represents the minimum required to meet Zambia's
most urgent development needs. Any further cuts in the investment program
would inevitably affect the country's growth potential and result in con-
siderable costs to the economy.



- 15 -
PART V - THE PROGRAM LOAN
46.       The above analysis suggests that Zambia is facing a difficult and
unique situation.  The decline in foreign exchange and budgetary resources
because of the collapse of the Mufulira mine has been compounded by the low
copper price in the last two years, the need to divert potential government
revenues to the expansion of copper production and, lastly, the extra cost
of diverting a part of the -trade away from the traditional Southern Rhodesian
route. The government has taken measures to generate domestic resources
for development by limiting the growth of its current expenditure, by addi-
tional taxation and by a very severe pruning of its investment program.
Despite this, during 1973 there is a gap of K168 million to be filled from
disbursement of existing and new external loans and additional policy mea-
sures to mobilize domestic resources. The slim pipeline of project loans
and the time it would take for new project loans to be committed and dis-
bursed makes it impossible for external lenders to assist in any immediately
effective manner through more project assistance. Yet, the reduced ongoing
investment program is such that it deserves support, in order to maintain
Zambia's development effort at a reasonable level. Zambia has therefore
requested a program loan of $30 million from the Bank.
47.       A special economic mission which visited Zambia in January examined
the government's program as outlined in Part IV above, and found it feas-
ible and justifiable. Its priorities are such that only the urgent needs
of the economy are attended to. Another mission visited Zambia in April/
May, following agreement between the International Monetary Fund and Zambia
on a standby credit, and held detailed discussions with the government on
major issues of development and finance affecting not only the mobilization
of resources in the near future, but also measures that would help to acce-
lerate Zambia's economic development and diversification in the longer term.
The mission was informed of the broad outlines of the government's policy,
which is expected to have a far-reaching impact on development and resource
mobilization and will be implemented in the near future. The main elements
of this policy are:
1.   Incomes Policy. The government recognizes that an effect-
ive mobilization of resources for development and diversification will re-
quire the institution of an incomes policy to restrain urban wages and re-
duce the great disparity between uroan and rural incomes. Towards this end,
a freeze on the public salary structure has alreacdy been put into effect.
Some of the higher salaries in para-statal organizations have been reduced.
Further consideration is being given to formulating a comprehensive incomes
policy so that incomes in the mining sector can be mobilized increasing-
ly for the development of the rest of the economy.
2.   Subsidies.  The government is undertaking a far-reaching re-
view of the whole structure of government subsidies in order to determine
those which should be eliminated, and expects to take concrete steps by
early 1974.



- 16 -
3.   Prices.  Wages are one aspect of the problem of relative
prices. The government also proposes to review other prices affecting pro-
duction and economic diversification and to take measures in the near fu-
ture to ensure that the structure of prices is consistent not only with its
own aim of diversification, cut also for the mobilization of further re-
sources for development.
4.   External Assistance.  The government increasingly recognizes
the need for long term planning of external borrowing and balance of pay-
ments management, and steps are being taken to institute such a process.
Towards this end, consultations will shortly be undertaken with regard to
the organization of a Consultative Group under the sponsorship of the Bank,
to coordinate and mobilize long term external assistance.
48.       Considering the immediate financing needs of the government's in-
vestment program, the steps that the government has already taken to con-
tain its expenditures and increase its revenues, and the assurances it has
conveyed to me about further specific steps it proposes to take in the near
future, there is a justifiable basis for a program loan of $30 million. I am
satisfied that the loan proposal meets the criteria for program loans spel-
led out in my memorandum to the Executive Directors of December 15, 1970
on the Pearson Commission recommendations concerning program lending, name-
ly:
(a)  Zambia has an ongoing development program and has taken
and intends to take supporting economic and financial
policies which provide a satisfactory basis for external
assistance.
(b)  The needed transfer of resources from external lenders
in support of the ongoing development program cannot
be achieved effectively and expeditiously by the finan-
cing of investment projects, including justifiable
local curr-ency expenditures.
(c) Other external sources are not available to Zambia to
fill the gap on terms appropriate to Zambia's economic
conditions.
49.       The proposed loan was negotiated by the Bank mission which visited
Zambia in April/May, after having had thorough discussions with the govern-
ment regarding its economic programs and policies. Foreign exchange pro-
vided under the loan would be utilized for specified categories of essen-
tial imports of capital and intermediate goods for the private and public
sectors. Zambia would be reimbursed for foreign exchange expenditure on
imports under these categories, on the basis of evidence to be submitted
to the Bank periodically. Appropriate arrangements to this effect have been



- 17 -
agreed upon between the Bank and the borrower. Import of transportation
equipment would not be covered since adequate bilateral sources of finance
for this purpose would be available. The draft loan agreement includes a
provision to the effect that loan proceeds would not be disbursed against
any imports for which other sources of foreign financing would be avail-
able. A part of the loan proceeds would be used for private sector imports
and procurement in respect of these would be subject to normal commercial
practices. In respect of imports by public sector agencies, the government's
tender procedures would apply. Th.ese require advertisement in the Govern-
ment Gazette and at least eight weeks' notice for submission of bids. The
procedures also envisage advertisement in trade papers and periodicals,
where appropriate. Practically all the countries from which purchases are
likely to be made are represented by missions in Zambia; hence, the pro-
cedures ensure full opportunity for participation by foreign suppliers.
The bids are evaluated on the basis of prescribed procedures, and contracts
awarded by the government's Central Tender Board to the lowest evaluated
bidder. Experience with Bank financed projects indicates that the Central
Tender Board's procedures are sound and ensure economic procurement of goods.
50.       The Bank of Zambia would open a special project account in the
name of the government, to which the Kwacha equivalent of the imports fi-
nanced under the project will be credited. The government could withdraw
funds from the project account to cover expenditures for development pur-
poses, commencing June 1973, in amounts up to 50 percent of allocations
in the 1973 government investment program for each of the following catego-
ries: education, health, local authorities, rural development, mining and
natural resources, transport, communications, power and works, and industry.
Withdrawals from the project account would be made by the government pe-
riodically for the aforementioned purposes, after the Bank has had an opport-
unity to review withdrawal proposals. The use of the counterpart funds
in financing investments would again be limited to those expenditures which
are not otherwise financed by external sourc.es. Since the proposed loan is
in support of the ongoing investment program incorporated in the government's
1973 budget, the government has agreed that any modification of the 1973
investment program which would materially and adversely affect the implementation
of the approved program would be a condition of suspension under the loan
(Section 7.02 of the draft loan agreement).
51.       The proposed loan and the counterpart funds are expected to be
disbursed by the end of 1973. The closing date will be June 30, 1974.
PART VI - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
52.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Zambia and the
Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii)
of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of a Resolution approving the
proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.



- 18 -
53.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan will comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOMMENDATION
54.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

A. BANK GROUP OPERATIONS/1
1.        Tnrough April 30, the Bank had made thirteen loans to Zambia and
IFC one investment. Four loans were made for railways and electric power
before Zambia became independent and are guaranteed by the UK as weU as
Zambia. After independence, four loans were made for agricultural develop-
ment, two for education, two for highways, and one for the Kariba North
hydro-electric station.  Total lending to date has been $178.6:millionfafter
cancellations, of which $83.9 million is for electric power, $47.2 million
for transportation, $22.7 million for education and $24.8 million for agri-
culture. Six loans are fully disbursed and the first loan made in 1953
(No. 74-uN) was repaid in full in February, 1972. The IC made its first
investment in Zambia in February, 1972, providing $1.1 million for expansion
of a shoe manufacturing company. Pages 2 through 6 of this Annex cont._in a
summary statement of Bank and IFC operations as of April 30, 1973 and notes
on the execution of ongoing projects.
2.        Progress on Bank operations in Zambia has been adversely affected
by the difficulties Zambia has faced over the past few years.  The Unilateral
Declaration of Independence in Southern Rhodesia in 1965 forced Zambia to
sever her close ties with Southern Rhodesia at a considerable cost and
disruption to the development program. Shortage of educated and skilled
manpower has interfered with progress on some projects while recent cost
escalations have caused difficulties on others, especially the Kariba North
Bank project. Finally the sharp fall in copper prices forced the government
to rephase capital expenditures on the first education project for which it
is providing 52 percent of project cost.  Tne recent border closure, however,
is not expected to cause significant delays on Bank financed projects as the
government is giving transport priority to goods for the mining industry
and for all major development projects financed from foreign sources.
3.        We propose to continue assisting Zambia in achieving its develop-
ment objectives of (a) improving rural conditions and increasing productive
employment in order to gradually correct the rural-urban imbalance; (b)
making Zambia self-sufficient in foodstuffs of all kinds; (c) diversifying
the economy to reduce the country's overwhelming dependence on copper; and
(d) improving levels of skill and training and thus, inter alia, making the
country less dependent on expatriate personnel.
4.        Our staff has recently appraised a mixed farming project, aiming
at increasing maize, sunflower, and be3f production to national self-
sufficiency, and has identified an integrated rural development project in
areas of high agricultural potential. To meet growing mining and other
industrial demand for energy essential in diversifying tne economy, I am
presenting to the Board a loan to help finance the Kafue hydro-electric
project. To cover the full foreign exchange component, as revised, of the
Kariba North Bank power project, I expect to reconmend shortly to the Board
that the Bank's commitment for this project be increased. Furthermore, I
envisage assistance in telecommunications and urban development and further
assistance to education primarily for technical education.
5.        In the near future IFC is planning to invest $1.2 million aa a loan
for the construction and operation of a tannery which would provide a local
shoe factory with leather.  IFC provided $1.1 million to the same company
in 1972 (para. 1).

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTI0N/1
Loan No. 562   Industrial Forestry Project: $5.3 million loan of October 5, 1968;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977
Execution of the project is more rapid than expected at the time
of appraisal. However, there is a lack of accountants and th.e
project management still relies on the services of a member of our
Agriculture Development Service. We have suggested that government
seek technical assistance frcm bilateral sources until qualified
Zambian accoantants beccme available. Project costs have proved to
be higher than expected so that the disbursement percentage applicable
to expenditures other than direct imports will have to be reduced
fraa 44 to 25.
Loan No. 592   First Education Project: $17.4 million loan of April 1I, 1969
Closing Date: September 30, 1974
The project became effective in July, 1969, but was initially delayed
some 12-14 months due to management problems and prolonged
negotiations regarding studies and the consultant's contract which
eventually led to the efficient and economical modular construction
system ultimately adopted for the project schools. Construction is
now proceeding well.  The efficient construction method would have
regained six months of delay but for the government's financial
problems which resulted in a cutback Qf funds early in 1972 and the
extension of the closing date by 2½ years. The Northsrn Technical
College (Nortec) item ($1 million) is behind scheduble because of a
review of the government's technical education policy which has now
been completed. This review has resulted in greater emphasis on
pre-employment training and less on apprenticeship than originally
envisaged; the school is now being redesigned. The entire project
was to cost US$36.2 million; the government now expects a US$3.41
million cost overrun which it will finance.
Loan No. 627   Livestock Development Project: $2.5 million loan of June 30, 1969;
Closing Date: November 30, 1974
The project was expected to be campleted by mid-1974 and development
has begun on all but one of the beef ranches. However, progress is
now at a standstill and serious financial problems have emerged.
Financial viability of the Zambia Cattle Development Limited (ZCDL),

and the action being taken to remedy them. They should be

not pu.-port to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in project execution.

which is responsible for execution, and also of some of the ranches
to be developed under the project, is uncertain. Management problems
and government policy which helct down prices on beef and milk while
costs rose rapidly are the principal causes. At the government's
request the Bank and Barclay's Bank, a co-lender, assisted govern-
ment officials in reappraising the project. We concluded that the
project be reduced to include only those components which offer
promise of becoming viable, that management be given authority to
operate full-y on a commercial basis, that organizational changes be
introduced to that end, and that prices on beef and milk be raised.
The government has subsequently raised these prices and is consider-
ing the other recomnendations.
Loan No. 645   Second Education Project:  $5.3 million loan of November 30, 1969;
Closing Date: August JI, 1l73
This project is alaost complete, but a delay in the initial stages
caused by periodic building material shortages, contractors limited
managerial capacity and insufficient local representation by one
firm requires a nine months' extension of the Closing Date (to
June, 1974) to allow fcr tle construction guarantee peziod and for
the closing of the accounts.
Loan No. 685   Commercial Crops Farling. Project:  $5.5 ianZllion loan of June 5, 1970;
Closing Date: Decemoer 31, 1975
The project is scheduled for completion in mid-1975. Iffter a slow
start, the project is now making satisfactory progress. So far, 66
assisted tenants have been settled, 23 of them since the end of the
last growing season. Daring that season, assisted tenants produced
400,650 kg tobacco, representing 7 percent of the natioral crop;
yields were slightly above the national average of 901 kg/ha.
Loan No. 701   Kariba North Bank HEydro-electric Power Project:  $40.0 million loan
of July 29, 1970; Closing Date: July 1, 1976
The cost of the Kariba North Hydro-electric Project, for which the
Baik nriade a loan of $40 million in July, 1970 to cover the foreign
exchange expenditure, has turned out substantially higher than
estim.ated at the time of appraisal. 'Whc-i bids were opened in
October, 1970 it became clear that the foreign exchange expenditure
alone would be more than $10 mi-lion higher. That increase was
attributable to world wide price increases on heavy electrical
equipument over and above appraisal estimates and high contingency
allowznces included by contractors in their bids for unexpected
expenditures arising from Zambia's position as a land-locked country.
Subsequently, changes in exchange rates in December, 1971, delayed
provision of access roads to the site and staff housing on the site,
and adverse rock conditions have caused Tlrther significant increases
in cost.  In addi-non, the -main civil woz-s contractor experienced



ANNEX II
Page 6
severe financial difficulties and was forced into liquidation in
February, 1973. Negotiations are now under way with a new
contractor; a work schedule and revised cost estimates, including
the effects of the recent currency realignments, are being prepared.
A supplementary loan is contemplated as soon as the cost estimates
have been revised.
Loan No. 882   Integrated Family Farming Project:  $11.5 million loan of February 28.,
1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1979
Conditions of effectiveness are likely to be met shortly, but one
month's extension of the termination date of May 28, 1973 might be
required.



ANNEX III
Page 1
ZAMBIA - PROGRAM LOAN
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:                     Republic of Zambia.
Amount:                       US$30 million equivalent in various
currencies.
Terms:                        Interest Rate: 7V. Amortization: 20 years
including 5 years of grace.
Project Description:          The proposed project would consist of (a) the
provision of foreign exchange for specified
categories of essential imports for the pri-
vate and public sectors and (b) the use of
the counterpart funds of such imports for
expenditure on certain categories of the govern-
ment's 1973 investment program, which are not
otherwise financed from foreign sources or
incurred prior to June 1, 1973.
Disbursement Procedures:
Imports:                   The borrower would be reimbursed for the fo-
reign exchange cost of specified categories
of essential imports of capital and interme-
diate goods for the private and public sectors
on the basis of evidence submitted to the Bank
periodically. The import of transportation
equipnient would not be covered, since adequate
bilateral sources of finance for this purpose
would be available. Loan proceeds would not
be disiursed against any imports for which
other sources of foreign financing would be
available. Imports by the private sector
would be subject to normal commercial practices.
In respect of imports by government agencies,
the government's tender procedures would apply.
These require advertisement in the Government
Gazette and at least eight weeks' notice for
submission of bids. The procedures also en-
visage advertisement in trade papers and pe-
riodicals, where appropriate. Practically all
the countries from which purchases are likely
to be made are represented by missiorain Zambia;



ANNEX III
Page 2
hence, the procedures ensure full opport-
unity for participation by foreign suppliers.
The bids are evaluated on the basis of pre-
scribed procedures, and contracts awarded by
the government's Central Tender Board to the
lowest evaluated bidder. Experience with
Bank financed projects indicates that the
Central Tender Board's procedures are sound
and ensure economic procurement of goods.
Counterpart Funds:       The Bank of Zambia would open a special
project account in the name of the govern-
ment, to which the Kwachia equivalent of imports
financed under the loan would be credited.
The government would withdraw funds from the
project account to cover up to 50 percent of
development expenditures, beginning June 1,
1973, under specified budget headings in its
1973 investment program. The use of the
counterpart funds in financing such expend-
itures would again be limited to those
expenditures which are not otnerwise financed
by external agencies. Withdrawals from the
project account would be made on the basis of
periodic certifications by the government's
chief accountant regarding suen expenditures,
and after the Bank has had an opportunity to
review withdrawal proposals.
