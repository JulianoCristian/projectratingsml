One of\n            the positive lessons to learn from the success of the\n            project is the ability of a relatively small budget support\n            operation to generate significant leverage over policy and\n            legislative reforms. Changes in the key counterparts in\n            United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo\n            (UNMIK), and the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government\n            (PISG) can adversely impact the commitment to the\n            medium-term policy agenda. More generally, a one tranche\n            budget support operation uses all of its leverage up front.\n            The other lesson learned is the importance of linking key\n            conditions in adjustment operations with the technical\n            assistance programs of other donors."}, "docdt": "2004-07-29T00:00:00Z"}
