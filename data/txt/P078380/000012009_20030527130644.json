structural reform agenda, aimed at\n            enhancing medium-term macro-fiscal sustainability,\n            sustaining adequate public service delivery in the face of\n            declining donor support, and, promoting private-sector\n            driven growth. The reform program to be supported by this\n            grant works to achieve these objectives through specific\n            reforms in the areas of budget management, and the business\n            environment. In the area of budget management, the grant\n            would support concrete measures towards improving the\n            transparency, and accountability of public spending, as well\n            as in the allocation of resources, in line with medium-term\n            priorities. In the area o f private sector development, the\n            grant would help to improve the business environment, by\n            making further progress on the design, and implementation of\n            the private sector regulatory framework, and taking steps to\n            improve the efficiency of publicly-owned enterprises.\n            Project benefits include, a stable economy, through the\n            promotion of reforms which will enhance medium-term fiscal\n            sustainability, and adequate service delivery. Second, the\n            assistance to authorities will benefit an articulated, and\n            mutually reinforced sectoral reform agenda, backed by a\n            consistent macroeconomic framework. Policy measures to\n            promote private sector development, and growth will be a key\n            component o f the overall reform package. Nonetheless, there\n            is considerable uncertainty about growth prospects, and, the\n            macroeconomic scenario is associated with substantial risks.\n            The basis macroeconomic scenario for a sustained rebound in\n            growth, and living standards assumes implementation of a\n            coherent medium-term program of institutional strengthening\n            and reform; continued, well-targeted donor support for\n            Kosovo; and, a relatively favorable external environment."}, "docdt": "2003-05-19T00:00:00Z"}
