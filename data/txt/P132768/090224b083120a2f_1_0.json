were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, risk to\n            development outcome was negligible, Bank performance was\n            highly satisfactory, and Borrower performance was highly\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: government\n            commitment is a pre-requisite to the outcome of any project\n            or program, but for a program that supports a fundamental\n            reorientation of the administrative processes towards\n            specified goals the continuity of that commitment is\n            fundamental. World Bank support gives a strong, central\n            executing agency clout to both request monitoring reports\n            and demand results, while at the same time playing a\n            catalytic role in improving its relations with other\n            executing agencies. Operations that address activities and\n            programs implemented by municipalities, for example, primary\n            health care, face particular challenges in terms of defining\n            targets and results, and monitoring in Brazil\u2019s federal\n            environment. When an operation supports the rollout of\n            systems to several municipalities, it is generally\n            considered that the greatest risk is in the implementation\n            by the municipalities with least institutional capacity, but\n            this is not always the case. It makes sense to include\n            gender as a separate component (or sub-component),\n            especially if the government counts on a separate agency to\n            implement the planned activities. Aligning a development\n            policy loan (DPL) fully with the government\u2019s priorities,\n            including its results framework and indicators, ensures\n            commitment, facilitates monitoring, and helps build the\n            results culture needed for sustainability. Sustained\n            commitment to a reorientation in public sector management\n            practices after time results in a fundamental cultural\n            change in institutions that is very difficult to measure or quantify."}, "docdt": "2015-09-17T23:45:03Z"}
