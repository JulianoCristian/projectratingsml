1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
Socio-Economic Developments

1.      At the time of appraisal in 2013, Brazil was showing signs of an improving economy
and important advances in terms of economic and public sector management, poverty
reduction and social indicators. Between 2011 and 2012, the Brazilian economy had slowed
significantly, growing only 0.9 percent in 2012 compared to 2.7 percent in 2011, driven largely by
tighter monetary and fiscal policies. With some signs of recovery in 2012, monetary policy was
eased aggressively and fiscal policy became more expansionary. All of these actions caused Brazil
to take a closer look at its medium term macroeconomic framework, which in 2013 was deemed
adequate to ensure that sub-national fiscal performance and policies were well managed. As a
result of consistent growth in employment and labor incomes, as well as the implementation of
targeted social assistance programs, such as Bolsa Família, the share of Brazilians living below
the extreme poverty line of R$70 a month dropped from 10.5 percent in the early 2000s to 4.7
percent in 2011. Inequality was also reduced, as reflected in the Gini coefficient that went from
0.59 to 0.53 during the same time period.

2.      Similar to Brazil, the State of Pernambuco was also experiencing positive economic
growth and improvements. In 2010, Pernambuco’s economy was the second largest in northeast
Brazil (and the tenth largest in the country) with a national GDP at 2.5 percent, largely attributed
to sustained investment demand through increased capacity to invest in physical and social
infrastructure, selective fiscal incentives and improvements in the overall business environment.
Much of the development and economic growth between 2005 and 2011 was concentrated in the
Port of Suape, located in the Metropolitan area of Recife. Additionally, Pernambuco’s strong fiscal
adjustment measures over the past decade -- namely improvements in tax collection efficacy and
the reduction of debt levels -- combined with robust economic growth, were evident in the increase
in revenue growth at the time of appraisal. These positive economic and fiscal factors had
contributed to some reductions in poverty over the previous years; however, 2010 census data
showed that improvements had been largely concentrated in the Metropolitan Area of Recife
(MAR).

3.      Notwithstanding these advances, Pernambuco faced significant economic and social
challenges that threatened potential gains in equity and inclusive growth. In 2010, gross
domestic product (GDP) per capita was R$10,822, about half the national average (R$19,766), and
the share of the population living in extreme poverty in 2011 was just over 10 percent, nearly
double the national average. Poverty rates and social inequalities were also more acute in the
interior of the State, with household income registering at nearly half of that of the population
living in the MAR, and poverty incidence among afro-descendent and indigenous groups in the
interior of the state was four times that of the white population in the MAR.

4.     Weak skills foundations and high levels of unemployment and informality were also
threatening equity and growth. The 2010 Census showed that nearly 11.1 percent of the
economically active population was out of work due to poor skills sets, lack of new investment,


                                                 1
and limited private sector opportunities. Additionally, among those 10 years or older, 57.8 percent
had a schooling level below the primary level and only 5.7 percent of the population had completed
a college education. Citizen security continued to pose a risk to sustainable growth, and drug crime
(namely related to crack cocaine) and gender-based violence remained high. The Government of
Pernambuco (GOP) estimated that about 40 percent of intentional lethal crimes in the State were
related to conflict over debts with drug traffickers, dispute over territories for trafficking, or violent
drug users. Finally, rising mortality rates from non-communicable diseases, namely diabetes and
hypertension, accounted for the single largest share of deaths in the State, putting strains on the
health system.

Political Developments

5.      In the midst of these growing challenges, the State of Pernambuco was going through
an important political process. In 2010, the Governor of the State was re-elected for a four-year
term with 82 percent of the popular vote. Running on the success of his previous term, particularly
his work in active results management and service delivery improvement, the Governor and his
team set out in 2010 to develop, in a highly consultative process, an implementation strategy for
the Todos por Pernambuco Program (2012-2015) that was aimed at meeting the needs of the state’s
most vulnerable population by introducing improvements in and an expansion of social programs,
consolidating progress through promoting inclusive growth, and developing the interior of the
State through targeted investment. The aim was to foster a dialogue between the general population
and key sectoral secretariats including Health, Education, Economic Development, Social
Development, Infrastructure and Security.

6.      The GOP responded proactively to the challenges with the development of a Strategy
Map for the Todos por Pernambuco Program, which was comprised of three broad
components: (i) New Economy- Opportunities for All Pernambucans. Promoting sustainable and
inclusive growth through a dynamic private sector, creation of employment opportunities and
investment in infrastructure; (ii) Action-Driven State- Capacity to Generate Results. Establishing
conditions for improving public administration, service delivery and public investment through
the establishment of processes and routines focused on results and problem solving; and (iii)
Quality of Life- A Better Life for All Pernambucans. Improving the quality of life of the citizens
of Pernambuco by improving public services, namely, education, health and citizen security, with
a secondary focus on water, sanitation, sports and leisure and urban mobility.

7.      The GOP had achieved success in some areas of its strategy, though it lacked
financing and technical support for the institutionalization and expansion of its key policies
and programs. Since 2008, the GOP had made important advances in implementing key areas of
the strategy including the expansion of full-day schools in the state, institutional reforms to
strengthen water management and disaster risk management, the expansion of technical and
vocational schools, the establishment of a permanent Women’s Secretariat, and improvements in
tax and budget management procedures, among others. While many of these changes led to critical
improvements in the state, the GOP was determined to consolidate the progress it had made and
ensure that some of the medium- to longer-term goals of its strategy were achieved. Within this
context, it solicited the World Bank Group’s financial and technical support.

Equity and Inclusive Growth Development Policy Operation

8.      At the time of appraisal, the World Bank had already approved a US$500 million
single-tranche Development Policy Loan (DPL), Expanding Opportunities, Enhancing
Equity in the State of Pernambuco DPL (Report No. 62869-BR) which became effective in
April 2012 and disbursed in full on May 4, 2012. This DPL aimed to strengthen public policies
that expanded economic opportunities and enhanced equity of access to quality services for the
citizens of Pernambuco. The operation focused specifically on promoting a more equitable,
sustainable and competitive Pernambuco by supporting the State’s implementation of the Todos
por Pernambuco program’s integration of the interior of the State and ensuring that its
development was more in line with the development already achieved in the MAR. More
specifically, the Program supported the establishment of a policy and regulatory framework in the
State to comprehensively address issues of social inequity and gender inclusion, with emphasis on
non-metropolitan areas.

9.      With poverty and inequality challenges remaining, though, the Government
requested a second stand-alone operation, the Equity and Inclusive Growth Development
Policy Loan (EIG DPL) for US$550 million, and the subject of this ICR. The EIG DPL was
designed to serve as a bridge between the previous DPL and ongoing Bank operations in the State
of Pernambuco as many of the policies and programs the previous DPL was supporting were still
a priority for the Government. Some of these programs were being supported through ongoing
World Bank-financed operations, including the Pernambuco Sustainable Water Project (P108654),
the Pernambuco Education Results and Accountability SWAp (Sector Wide Approach)
(P106208), and the Pernambuco Rural Economic Inclusion Project (P120139). Nevertheless the
EIG DPL was considered important for sustaining and further developing policies in the
Government’s program that were being supported under the previous DPL, while both expanding
and better monitoring and evaluating the State’s programs, including those that were being
financed under existing World Bank-financed operations. The deep and wide WB engagement in
Pernambuco has greatly facilitates the dialogue and the contributions to results.

10.     The EIG DPL built on the success of the earlier DPL through supporting continued
policy actions and developments in key strategic areas in the State’s program, including
economic development, technical and vocational education and training, gender, and public
sector management, and synergies across components were achieved through a common
theme: Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E). The specific components of the DPL were selected
as they were the key strategic areas in the State’s program to deal with the challenge of inclusive
growth and better employment outcomes. While these components involved a diverse set of
sectors, they were linked by a common theme: M&E. The EIG DPL also extended policy dialogue
into new areas that the State had indicated as priority, including health and citizen security. In each
of these areas, the DPL aimed to institutionalize and expand key Government policies and
programs, or establish monitoring and evaluation systems to strengthen evidence-based and
performance-oriented policy-making.

11.    The EIG DPL was in line with the overarching goal of the Brazil Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS) 2012-2015 (November 1, 2011, Report No. 63731-BR). The primary goal of the
2012-2015 CPS is to contribute to faster, more inclusive, and more environmentally sustainable



                                                  3
growth, with macroeconomic stability. The EIG DPL shared many of its guiding principles
including: (i) increasing the efficiency of public and private investments; (ii) improving the quality
and expanding the provision of public services for low-income households; and (iii) promoting
regional economic development through improved policies, strategic infrastructure investments,
and support for the private sector in frontier areas.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

12.    The Program Development Objective (PDO) was to support the Government of
Pernambuco to strengthen the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies and
programs aimed at promoting sustained growth and improved economic opportunities for the poor,
consolidating public sector management innovations, preventing crime and violence, and reducing
the burden associated with chronic disease. The key outcome indicators are listed in Table 2 under
Program Performance.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
Reasons/Justification
13.     Neither the PDO nor the core indicators were changed, but the baselines and target values
for the two health indicators (Indicators 8 and 9) were revised to reflect the federal Ministry of
Health’s transition to two information systems and consequently changes in the calculation of the
indicator by the State (see Basic Data Sheet, Section F).

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)
14.    Policy Areas supported by the Program (Table 1) to achieve the DPL’s objectives were
grouped into three components, aligned with the three main components of the GOP’s Strategy
Todos por Pernambuco, and under each component supported key policy areas, as described in
Table 1 below.

                            functioning of the state
                            referral system.



2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

19.      Government Ownership, Commitment and Stability. The EIG DPL supported
improvements and expansion of key elements of the State Government’s Todos por Pernambuco
program, a program that had thus far produced promising results, and to which the Government
was fully committed. This commitment was unwavering throughout implementation, and
continues to this day (despite a change in administration in early 2015), resulting in a virtuous
cycle of results, popular support, stability, continuity and a constant push to improve, expand and
perfect. The EIG DPL was aligned fully with the Government’s priorities, and its Results
Framework was developed, in the words of one official, “based on priorities for both the
Government and the World Bank, with indicators that were not superimposed, but rather selected
from among those of the Government.” This positive policy environment led to a remarkable
stability in the staffing of the State’s secretariats (despite changes in staffing in some of the
autonomous implementing agencies, e.g., Junta Comercial do Estado de Pernambuco) and
especially in the staffing of the Secretaria de Planejamento e Gestão (SEPLAG) that was
responsible for overall coordination of the EIG DPL’s implementation. The staff of SEPLAG that
participated in implementation of the EIG DPL was largely the same that had participated in its
preparation, and also in the preparation and implementation of the earlier DPL and several other
ongoing World Bank-financed operations, and are still mostly in their positions to this day.
Moreover, a large part of the Government’s ownership is due to the institutionalization of the
public sector in the reform agenda, creating structures and processes to ensure the functionality
and sustainability of robust, integrated M&E systems. Also critical for the effectiveness of the
policy reforms was the inter-institutional coordination with groups, like the technical chamber of
women demonstrating ability to bring together different stakeholders to advance common goals.

20.    Analytical Underpinnings. An extensive portfolio of the World Bank’s analytical work in
the Brazil country program, regional and global World Bank studies, as well as broader research,
underpinned the policy areas of the EIG DPL. Additionally, the sustained dialogue with the GOP


                                                            11
through the first DPL and the ongoing process of the second DPL provided the basis for the
preparation of a State Economic Memorandum (P132324), which has served to deepen the
partnership with the GOP on key strategic issues. The soundness of the background analysis
contributed to a strong technical design of the operation. The primary reports prepared by the
World Bank that influenced the design included: (i) the Independent Evaluation Group’s 2010
review of World Bank engagement at the State level in Brazil; (ii) “The World Bank’s Approach
to Public Sector Management 2011-2012”; (iii) “Better Results from Public Sector Institutions”
(World Bank 2012); (iv) “Minas-Gerais-World Bank Partnership: Building on a Strong
Foundation and Leading to Next Steps”, Report No. 40036-BR; (v) Making Brazilians Safer:
Analyzing the Dynamics of Violent Crime” (World Bank, 2011); (vi) World Development Report
on Gender Equality (World Bank, 2012); and (vii) “Brazil’s Sistema Único de Saúde After 20
Years: Achievements, Challenges and Unresolved Issues (Gragnolati et al, Forthcoming). The
design of the EIG DPL also counted on experience under various ongoing World Bank-financed
operations in Pernambuco, as well as experience in the design and implementation of similar
programs in other Brazilian states.

21.     Appropriateness of Risks and Mitigation Measures. The operation identified three
moderate risks: (i) economic and fiscal: macroeconomic fluctuations in Brazil and partner
countries causing changes in tax revenues and the demand in Pernambuco’s economy; (ii) social:
possible ineffectiveness of horizontal and vertical coordination within and between the
Government Secretariats and agencies leading to delays in the implementation of key policies and
programs; (iii) institutional and implementation: limited technical capacity to develop and
implement new M&E systems and other reforms, challenges in inter-sectoral coordination and
lack of shared responsibility between state and municipal governments causing the implementation
of the policies and programs to not have the desired impact. The first of these materialized during
implementation, but not in sufficient magnitude to have an impact on the Program’s outcome. To
mitigate the third risk, the World Bank’s implementation support team developed a strong
partnership with the State’s team in SEPLAG and each implementing agency, and worked side-
by-side until the definition of the various systems designs were perfected. The team also promoted
a number of knowledge exchanges with other states in Brazil and countries (on M&E systems)
through non-lending technical assistance.

22.    Implementation in a Federal Structure of Government. Implementation of the Program
in Brazil’s federal environment, with often shared responsibilities, different information systems
and reporting requirements, and multiple layers of legislation among the federal, state and
municipal levels of government (in addition to legislation of autonomous agencies such as the
Corpo de Bombeiros Militar de Pernambuco,- CBM- among others) presented a challenge,
although not an obstacle.

23.     Economic Downturn. In part as the result of prudent policies, including innovative
programs aimed at attracting private investment, Pernambuco’s economy has grown at consistently
higher rates than the national one since 2008. From 2007 through 2013, Pernambuco’s GDP grew
39.4 percent, whereas the country grew only 27.2 percent. Nevertheless, a declining trend in
growth, both at the national and state levels, began in 2011. This downturn mainly impacted Sub-
component 1.1 in that only three new, albeit large, investments benefitted from the incentives
offered through the state’s Industrial Infrastructure Development Program (PROINFRA). In



                                                12
addition, expectations of a more restrictive fiscal scenario, lower growth in general, higher interest
rates, and projections of consequent reductions in the State’s income, led the new Administration
in February 2015 to issue a decree, Plano de Contingenciamento de Gastos (PCG, an expenditure
allocation plan), that constrains public expenses by R$320 million in 2015 and rationalizes the
State’s administration (for example, the staff responsible for the program’s coordination in
SEPLAG was transferred to the resource mobilization unit in the Finance Secretariat).

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

24.     Developing new systems for Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) was very much at the
center of the State’s Program and the EIG DPL’s objectives. Progress in these areas is described
in Section 3.2, while this section addresses M&E for the EIG DPL’s implementation.

25.     Design. Progress towards the achievement of the EIG DPL’s expected outcomes was to be
monitored according to the results matrix presented in the Program Document. An outcome
indicator, baseline values, and a target were assigned to each of the policy areas defined under the
Policy Matrix. The outcome indicators were selected from among the Government’s outcome
indicators for its program, and monitoring was to be carried out as per SEPLAG’s established
procedures that involved assessing progress, analyzing advances towards outcomes, and
identifying obstacles and budgetary implications.

26.     Implementation and Utilization. SEPLAG routinely collected data from the Program’s
executing agencies, 1 and submitted quarterly reports on progress towards outcome indicator
targets to the World Bank. SEPLAG collected the data more frequently than required, and used
the information to focus on the identification of possible risks and issues that could affect the
executing agencies’ ability to achieve expected outcomes.

27.       Issues surfaced with respect to monitoring the following two indicators: a) percentage of
hypertensive patients that are under active management in primary care, and b) percentage of
diabetes patients that are under active management in primary care. First, the baseline and
consequently the targets for both indicators were adjusted due to changes in the methodology for
calculating the relevant indices. Then, collection of data for these two indicators was affected by
the federal Ministry of Health’s transition from the Sistema de Informação da Atenção Básica
(SIAB) to a new Sistema de Informação em Saúde da Atenção Básica (SISAB) that includes new
data collection and entry methodologies, and new hardware as well (as primary health is a
municipal responsibility, financed by the federal, state and local governments, the Federal
Government requires reporting according to its mandated systems.) Installation of the new system
is still ongoing. As a result, data reported for both indicators is as of June 2014.




1
 The executing agencies, in addition to SEPLAG, included: Junta Comercial do Estado de Pernambuco (JUCEPE),
Secretaria de Desenvolvimento Econômico, Secretaria de Trabalho, Qualificação e Emprego, Secretaria de
Educação, Secretaria de Desenvolvimento Social, Criança e Juventude (formally, Secretaria de Desenvolvimento
Social e Direitos Humanos), Secretaria da Mulher, Secretaria Estadual de Saúde.



                                                    13
28.     A word of caution is in order with respect to the outcome indicators. Several of these refer
to the putting in place of systems, e.g., the implementation of an M&E system to register the
occurrence cases of gender-based violence in Pernambuco, as opposed to final outcomes, e.g.,
reduction of gender-based violence. There are other such examples in the Results Framework. This
was reasonable for a DPL operation with a naturally short duration. However, it begs, the question
of whether the EIG DPL had a measurable impact on final outcomes. In some cases, these are
difficult to measure, as further time is needed to assess the final impact of the programs on the
State’s progress and resource allocation policies. Nevertheless, measureable outcomes have been
recorded in certain policy areas, as discussed in Section 3.2, as the respective programs have been
in place for some time already, and the DPL only supported their institutionalization, through
formal, established systems that allow better monitoring and evaluation (but also making
attribution difficult.) More importantly, the State has in place a formal process through which
programs, their financing, progress and issues are monitored routinely, often in committees chaired
by the State Governor. The outcomes supported under the EIG DPL, as measured through progress
towards indicator targets in the Results Framework, will allow for a more quantifiable,
measureable and definitive evaluation of the Programs’ effectiveness and efficiency in the future.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

29.     The State’s Todos por Pernambuco Program was initiated in 2007 through a highly
consultative process, and institutionalizing a dynamic results- based management model
integrating planning, budgeting, and implementation. This Program was carried out in two stages
(2007-2010 and 2011-2014), each supported by a World Bank financed DPL in a ‘quasi-
programmatic’ logic. In June 2013, the State Government initiated another highly consultative
process, aimed at defining a long-term strategy for Pernambuco (until 2035). The Pernambuco
2035 plan – Strategic Plan for Long-Term Development was finalized in April 2015, and counted
on the inputs of almost 18,000 residents throughout the State. Pernambuco 2035 is structured along
five priority pillars (Education and Knowledge, Quality Institutions, Prosperity, Social Cohesion,
and Quality of Life), with 15 concrete objectives and 35 quantified and ambitious targets aimed at
improving the quality of life through the promotion of economic development. It builds on the
achievements of the Todos por Pernambuco Program, including those policies and programs
supported by the EIG DPL. The State Government demonstrated interest in continuing its
partnership with the World Bank, in support of the Pernambuco 2035 goals.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

30.      The EIG DPL’s objectives, policy areas and design were relevant when it was prepared since
they were selected from among priority strategies, policies and programs within the State’s Todos
por Pernambuco program. They maintained their relevance during implementation given the continuity
in the State Government’s commitment to its program. More importantly, the objectives and design remain
extremely relevant to the State’s priorities today as the new Pernambuco 2035 Program is a natural
continuation of the Pernambuco for All, with a very ingrained results focus. The institutionalization of
policies, targeted programs and, especially, monitoring and evaluation systems put in place formally under
the EIG DPL will be of utmost relevance to the State in the implementation of the next phase of its strategic
vision. These will also be of great value in view of the expected fiscally constrained environment, especially


                                                     14
at the federal level, over the next couple of years. The EIG DPL’s objectives and design continue to be
extremely relevant to the implementation of the Brazil Country Partnership Strategy 2012-2015, especially
to three of its strategic objectives that are to: (i) increase the efficiency of public and private investments,
thus boosting growth capacity with job and income generation, (especially in Brazil‘s poorer regions, with
a special emphasis in the Northeast); (ii) improve the quality of public services for low income
households, and expand their provision through public and private channels, and (iii) promote
regional economic development through improved policies, strategic infrastructure investments,
and support for private sector actors in frontier regions (with a renewed emphasis in supporting the
Northeastern region).

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

31.      Since the Todos por Pernambuco Program was introduced in 2007, Pernambuco has
achieved notable progress and outcomes. In education, Pernambuco’s ranking among Brazilian
states jumped from sixteenth place in 2011 to fourth place by 2013 (behind only Santa Catarina,
Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro), according to the Indice de Desenvolvimento da Educação
Básica (IDEB).2 At the secondary level (secondary schooling is a state level responsibility), this
indicator grew by slightly over 16 percent from 2011 to 2013, exceeding the target established by
the federal Ministry of Education and Culture. In eight years, since the Pacto pela Vida was
launched, the rate of violent, lethal and intentional crimes dropped by 32 percent, resulting in
almost 10,000 lives saved. In health, the infant mortality rate dropped dramatically by 47.5 percent
from 2006 to 2011 (IBGE). Pernambuco achieved similar impressive results in terms of economic
growth, both in absolute and comparative terms with the national results in part through tax
incentive and other programs aimed at attracting investments to the State. These are but a few of
the extraordinary results that the State has achieved in slightly over seven years. Realistically,
however, these results cannot be attributed to the EIG DPL alone, although the operation, together
with the earlier DPL and ongoing World Bank-financed sectoral investment projects, and technical
assistance (both formal and hands-one support), as well as others at the federal level, invariably
has made a contribution. What the EIG DPL did accomplish was a fundamental change in the
institutional culture in Pernambuco’s public administration to one based on results that was central
to the achievement of its PDO: to support the Government of Pernambuco to strengthen the design,
implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies and programs aimed at promoting sustained
growth and improved economic opportunities for the poor, consolidating public sector
management innovations, preventing crime and violence, and reducing the burden associated with
chronic disease. Progress and outcomes towards each of these areas, corresponding to each of the
EIG DPL’s three components, is described below.




2
 The Indice de Desenvolvimento da Educação Básica (IDEB) is a national indicator of educational quality that
combines information on performance on standardized tests (Prova Brasil and Sistema de Avaliação da Educação
Básica) by students in the final stages of schooling (4th and 8th grades of fundamental school and 3rd grade of
secondary), with information on students’ grades.

Component 1: NEW ECONOMY – OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL PERNAMBUCANS

Promoting Sustained Growth and Improved Economic Opportunities for the Poor

Policy Area 1.1 Regional economic development: To strengthen the state’s Industrial
Infrastructure Development Program (PROINFRA) through the development of a monitoring and
evaluation system that will provide information for evidence-based policy making.

32.     The objective of this policy area was to improve the State’s capacity to evaluate the impact
of regional development programs that work by providing incentives for private investment and
the ability to adjust strategy accordingly. Specifically, the State, through Policy Actions, created
the legal basis for the establishment of a monitoring and evaluation system for the PROINFRA
Program that would provide information for evidence-based policy making.

33.     This monitoring and evaluation system was developed and is operational, and the first
annual report is available on the website. According to the summary report (Annex 6), the State
has so far attracted three investments (in three separate municipalities) under the PROINFRA3
Program totaling R$567 million, and provided fiscal incentives of almost R$17.5 million. The
three investments are expected to create about 1,060 jobs. An additional four investments totaling
approximately R$957 million are expected in 2015, and should result in the creation of about 1,400
additional jobs.

34.     It is still too early to permit an evaluation of the economic and social benefits of the
investments made thus far for two reasons. First, some of these investments have only recently
been completed and become operational (it takes on average between two and three years for
industrial plants to become operational after approval, and fiscal benefits only accrue when the
company begins production). Second, some of the information required for an evaluation is still
being compiled (e.g., GDP, employment, illiteracy, infant mortality) as there is a lag in obtaining
the official data for these indicators. For example, the state level GDP is measured with the same
annual periodicity as the Instituto Brasileiro de Geografía e Estatistica (IBGE) measures Brazil’s
GDP, but municipal GDP is only measured every other year. Nevertheless, once a more complete
data series becomes available, the Government intends to use the information provided by this
system to conduct an evaluation of the indicators over time before and after the operation comes
on stream, and on this basis make decisions as to whether to continue the PROINFRA program
(which runs through 2018), adjust the incentives provided, or otherwise amend it so that more
municipalities can benefit.

Policy Area 1.2 Private sector development: To reduce administrative barriers to firm entry and
ensure that firms can complete the state registration process within 72 hours.



3
  The PROINFRA Program, backed by the Federal Government, partially or fully subsidizes the cost of small
infrastructure projects (either by financing the works directly or providing future tax credits) as a means of attracting
investments by private firms.




                                                           16
35.     The objective of this Policy Area was to reduce administrative barriers to firm registration
to increase the speed and agility with which potential firms could complete the state registration
process by implementing REDESIM, an information system that collects data from state
commercial registries (in Pernambuco, the Junta Comercial de Pernambuco, JUCEPE),
aggregates them and issues State, Municipal and Federal registrations and tax ID numbers.4 As
Policy Actions, JUCEPE had signed agreements with the Secretariat of Finance, the Secretaria da
Receita Federal do Brasil (RFB, the Federal Tax Authority), the Corpo de Bombeiros Militar de
Pernambuco (CBM, the state level fire department), the Agência Estadual do Meio Ambiente
(CPRH, the state level environmental agency), the Agência de Vigilância Sanitária (APEVISA,
the state sanitary surveillance agency) and with 24 municipalities in the State of Pernambuco.5 The
Municipality of Olinda has not yet signed the REDESIM Agreement (but is considered a
participating municipality).

36.     REDESIM is currently in full operation in 21 municipalities, in full coordination with the
Secretariat of Finance, the RFB and with APEVISA. Three additional municipalities have signed
agreements and are in the process of implementing the system. Staff of all municipalities has been
trained, including the Municipality of Olinda. More than 71 percent of the firms in Pernambuco
are registered in the municipalities that have adhered to REDESIM. In 2014 alone, approximately
12,000 new companies were registered in the 25 participating municipalities (including Olinda),
out of a total of about 16,000 in the entire state. At the same time, almost 55 percent of companies
registered in the State’s 25 municipalities (including the municipality of Olinda) have used or are
using REDESIM to obtain licenses and/or permits, or modify their registrations. Over 90 percent
of the 12,000 companies in participating municipalities were registered by JUCEPE in less than
72 hours.6

Policy Area 1.3 Technical Vocational Education and Training. To strengthen Technical
Vocational Education and Training (TVET) programs through the development of a monitoring
and evaluation system (M&E) that will support policy development and program management and,
over time, enhance employment outcomes for the target populations of the programs.

37.    The objective of this Policy Area was to support the development of an integrated
monitoring and evaluation system for Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET)
programs implemented in the State, adopted by the Secretaria de Educação (SEE) and the
Secretaria de Trabalho, Qualificação e Emprego (STQE), and make key indicators on inputs,


4
 REDESIM also alters firms’ registrations and registers closures.
5
 These municipalities include: Abreu e Lima, Araripina, Arcoverde, Cabo de Santo Agostinho, Camaragibe, Carpina,
Caruaru, Garanhuns, Goiana, Igarassu, Ipojuca, Itamaracá, Gravatá, Jaboatão dos Guararapes, Moreno, Palmares,
Paulista, Petrolândia, Petrolina, Recife, Salgueiro, Santa Cruz do Capibaribe, São Lourenço da Mata, and Serra
Talhada. The Municipality of Olinda has not yet signed the REDESIM Agreement.

6
 The 72 hours is calculated on the basis of working days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. Of the 12,030
companies established in participating municipalities (including Olinda) in 2014, 1,841 were registered in 0 days,
4,128 were registered in 1 day, 3,810 were registered in 2 days, and 1,209 were registered in 3 days. These calculations
are based on the number of days required for state level licensing and registration by JUCEPE as the State does not
have authority to modify any specific requirements in the legislation of its municipalities.



                                                          17
efficiency and results available for decision making. In compliance of the Policy Action, the State
had created the legal basis for the establishment of this system, which included not only the SEE
in the scope of TVET programs, but also defined the guidelines for use of the system and
monitoring and evaluation of relevant data.

38.     STQE, in partnership with SEE, developed the Sistema Informatizado de Monitoramento
e Avaliação (SIMA) for all TVET programs in the State – a first in Brazil and an example from an
international perspective -, with relevant manuals and staff training, and has piloted the system in
use for the students enrolled in the Program Novos Talentos in 2014 to test the system’s
functionality. Following this pilot, STQE has utilized SIMA to register all students enrolled in this
Program in March 2015 with information on the number of places for each course, the number of
students actually enrolled, and students’ progress, for all schools in all municipalities. SIMA can
provide data aggregated or disaggregated by municipality, program, student, region, institution,
and identify actions for follow up. The system also monitors inputs by course, school, etc. (lunches,
materials, transport) to allow for an evaluation of efficiency and outcomes in the future. Historic
data on STQE’s programs has also been included for the Cahpeu de Palha and Mãe Coruja
programs. The system is also systematically tracing results in terms of earnings increases and
employability. STQE has developed surveys that have been automatically sent and results
automatically computed to Novos Talentos’ students by electronic mail in the form of simple
questionnaires using numerical or yes/no responses, to monitor students’ opinions, and provide
follow up information regarding employability, employment, relevance of the training they
received for employment and income after completion.

39.    Next steps include inputting data for all of the State’s remaining TVET programs, notably
those delivered by SEE. Once data for all of the programs is entered and tracked in SIMA, the
State will have the tool to monitor the quality and efficiency of TVET programs in terms of their
pedagogical focus and in terms of labor market insertion.

Policy Area 1.4 Productive inclusion. To strengthen and expand the state’s productive inclusion
program, Pernambuco no Batente, that promotes employability and/or income earning
opportunities for the poorest segments of the population.

40.     This Policy Area aimed to put in place a financing mechanism for the municipal
implementation of its productive inclusion program, Pernambuco no Batente, which offers training
and technical assistance for business development to poor and vulnerable families registered as
extremely poor in the national targeting registry, the Cadastro Único. The financing mechanism
would be linked to Results Based Agreements that established results monitoring arrangements
and annual targets on service. The decrees, resolutions and other legislative and administrative
regulations needed to create and operate the financing mechanism were fulfilled as Policy Actions.

41.    By July 2014, 51 municipalities in all of Pernambuco’s 12 regions had signed the Termo
de Aceite (Terms of Acceptance) formally adhering to the Pernambuco no Batente program
thereby becoming eligible to receive funding from SEDSDH through a formally established
automatic transfer system in exchange for offering quality social and productive inclusion
program, Pernambuco no Batente, and to establish and maintain a Centro de Inclusão Produtiva
(Productive Inclusion Center, CIP, the facility where training is delivered) for this purpose.



                                                 18
Funding is now transferred automatically from the Fundo Estadual de Assistência Social to each
participating municipality’s Fundo Municipal de Assistência Social to implement the Pernambuco
no Batente program according to its policies, and with specific results targets. Participating
municipalities have some flexibility and autonomy in developing the Program tailored to their
constituents’ needs, but have certain constraints. First, they need to follow the Program’s basic
design of three modules of 60 hours instruction each: Social Qualification, Professional
Qualification and Productive Qualification.7 Second, the municipalities need to co-finance the
Program, by offering space for construction of their CIPs. In 2014, ten additional CIPs were
established (either rehabilitated spaces or new construction, per the criteria of each municipality),
in addition to the 41 that had been functioning. The Program caters to on average 100 individuals
per training session of three modules. The State provided funding for equipping the CIPs with
materials needed to conduct training, as well as periodic visits to supervise progress, provide
technical assistance, collect information to monitor results and promote an exchange of experience
and information among different municipalities. Once the Program is established and operational,
municipalities receive R$6,000 per month to operate and maintain the CIP, and conduct additional
training. As of 2014, 1,147 of Pernambuco no Batente’s beneficiaries have engaged in productive
employment, mostly in the textile industry and agroindustry. Municipalities have considerable
flexibility in running the Program, and several have adopted innovative practices to help
beneficiaries apply their new skills, by, for example, assisting them in establishing cooperatives.

42.     Now that this successful Program has been established formally, the challenge is to ensure
continued operation in the 51 municipalities that have signed Termos de Aceite, while expanding
the Program to other disadvantaged municipalities in the State. The Government plans to extend
the Program to another 43 municipalities in 2015 (although this may be ambitious), and the budget
has been secured. In addition, it plans to strengthen linkages with the STQE, the Serviço Nacioanl
de Aprendizagem Industrial (SENAI, the federal Agency for Industrial Learning), the Serviço
Nacioanl de Aprendizagem Comercial (SENAC, the federal Agency for Commercial Learning),
the Agência de Fomento de PE (AGEFEPE, the Pernambuco Development Agency), and private
sector enterprises.

Component 2: ACTION DRIVEN STATE – CAPACITY TO GENERATE RESULTS

Consolidating Public Sector Management Innovations

Policy Area 2.1 Public sector management: To strengthen and extend the Results Based
Management model of the state by adopting the approaches used in the Pacto pela Vida in the
Secretariats of Health and Education and progressively in other Secretariats.




7
 The Program can follow any of eight productive areas: (a) textile; (b) industrial embroidery; (c) agroindustry for the
primary processing of fruit; (d) family agriculture; (e) recycling of solid wastes (for production of brooms, recycling
plastic containers; (f) plaster; (g) fishing and aquiculture, and (h) dairy production.




                                                         19
43.     This Policy Area aimed to institutionalize the State Government’s Results Based
Management, and to expand it to other secretariats. As Policy Actions, the State had put in place
the legal basis to make this possible.

44.      The Results Based Management Model was introduced in the Pacto pela Educação and
the Pacto pela Saúde in 2014.8 For each of these sectors and as part of the DPL action, a team of
planning, budgeting and implementation analysts in SEPLAG were responsible for: (a) preparing
results reports; (b) organizing meetings to define and agree upon targets; (c) conducting monitoring
meetings at three levels, and (d) developing a new automated information system for reporting
results.

45.      For education, the Pacto pela Educação focuses on improving the quality of education
with equity by improving the quality of teaching, learning and the school environment. As part of
the DPL, the SEPLAG team helped define the criteria to establish targets for each school based on
the Indice de Desenvolvimento da Educação Básica de Pernambuco,9 and participates with SEE
staff in meetings to agree upon targets with all state schools, represented by their directors, in each
of the SEE’s regional education offices (12). The school directors commit to targets and, if at least
50 percent of the targets are achieved, those schools become eligible for the (Bonus for Education
Performance). Periodic monitoring meetings are held at three levels: strategic, tactical and
operational. Strategic meetings are held quarterly, chaired by the State Governor, to review results,
address pending issues in other areas of government that may be affecting results, redefine and
establish revised targets if needed, and motivate staff. Meetings at the tactical level are conducted
by the regional education offices, Strategic meetings are held quarterly, chaired by the State
Governor, to review results, address pending issues in other areas of government that may be
affecting results, redefine and establish revised targets if needed, and motivate staff. Meetings at
the tactical level are conducted by the regional education offices, with the participation of
SEPLAG analysts and directors of priority schools to monitor progress more closely, propose
remedial actions needed and issues that can be addressed at the regional level. Finally, at the
operational level, meetings take place in schools, with school directors, administrative staff and
teachers to review results and agree upon follow-up actions that may be needed. In 2014, meetings
were held at 93 priority schools identified as requiring intensive support based on performance. 10

  The IDEPE is the State’s indicator of the quality of its public state education that permits it to monitor and evaluate
the progress of each school annually. Like the IDEB, the IDEPE considers two criteria: student progress and
performance in the 4th and 8th grades, and in the final year of secondary through standardized testing in Portuguese
language and Mathematics.

10
   The Pacto pela Educação, contains three sets of indicators, Final Indicators, Results Indicators and Process
Indicators. Final Indicators include school scores on the IDEPE and the IDEB. Results indicators include: an External
Grade based on standardized testing in Portuguese language and Mathematics and an Internal Grade based on students’
grades, considering only the internal school testing. Process Indicators include: (a) student attendance; (b) teacher
attendance; (c) the ration of classes scheduled to classes held; (d) compliance with school curricula; (e) percentage of
students that received less than a 6 (on a 10 point scale) grade point average; (f) percentage of students’ families that

46.     For health, Pacto pela Saúde focused on improving the population’s health status, with a
special focus on reducing mortality from non-communicable diseases, and improving the
efficiency of the State’s health system. As part of the DPL, the overall framework (with three
levels of meetings) and process followed by SEPLAG’s team was similar to that followed for
education, except that the Director of the State’s 33 public hospitals (including specialized and
regional hospitals) participating in strategic meetings and tactical meetings also addressed issues
for discussion with municipalities in each of the regions, since in Brazil delivery of primary health
is a municipal responsibility. Meetings at the operational level will begin in 2015, with
participation of relevant municipalities in an effort to monitor and support more closely their
implementation and issues.11 Some results have been impressive: in 2014, 66.7 percent of the
GERES achieved their targets for Mortality Rate due to Avoidable Causes, up from 50 percent in
2013, and also, there was a 7 percent increase in coverage of the Family Health Program in the
State from 2013 to 2014. At the hospital level, the situation is more challenging: of the State’s 30
hospitals, only one met the targets for four hospital indicators (indicators: (a), (b), (c), and (d)
above, while four met the targets for at least two of these indicators.

47.    The State adopted its Political Estadual de Fortalecimento de Atenção Primaria that
provides for transfer of state resources to the municipalities based on population and performance.
The agreements have been between the Secretaria da Saúde (SS, state Health Secretariat) and the
GERES, and the municipalities have incentives in terms of ICMS receipts if they meet targets. The
Government also plans to bring the UPAEs under the Results Based Management model to avoid
unnecessary hospitalizations. More importantly, the Government has plans to expand the Results
Based Management model to other secretariats. Although signature of a decree providing the legal
basis for adopting this model in all secretariats has been delayed due to the change in
administration and the restructuring of state secretariats, progress has been sustained by
contracting about 100 analysts to staff planning, budgeting and implementation teams in SEPLAG,
and by working with remaining sectoral secretariats to train them, prepare diagnostics, obtain data
and help define results indicators for which they will be held accountable.




participate in school meetings; (g) percentage of students that participate in external evaluations; and (h) percentage
of students that participate in internal evaluations. In 2014, 30 percent of all state schools exceeded their targets; 23
percent achieved between 50 and 99 percent of their targets and 48 percent achieved up to 49 percent of their targets.

11
  The Pacto pela Saúde contains three sets of indicators: a Results Indicator (Mortality Rate due to Avoidable Causes),
Indicators for the Gerência Regional de Saúde (GERES, the regional health offices) and Indicators for Hospitals. The
indicators for GERES include: (a) coverage of the federal Family Health Program; (b) hospitalizations for primary
care-sensitive conditions; (c) percentage of pregnant women with 7 or more pre-natal consultations; (d) perinatal death
rate; (e) coverage of cervical cancer screening; (f) coverage of mammography; (g) percentage of hypertensive patients
that are under active management in primary care; (h) percentage of diabetes patients that are under active management
in primary care; (i) mortality rate from traffic accidents; and (j) percentage of municipalities that are current in
submitting information on mortality. The indicators for Hospitals include: (a) mortality rate; (b) percentage of
surgeries performed that were approved for payment; (c) average hospital stay; (d) hospital occupancy rate; (e) births;
and (f) patients discharged.

Component 3: QUALITY OF LIFE – A BETTER LIFE FOR ALL PERNAMBUCANS

Preventing Crime and Violence

Policy Area 3.1 Crime and violence prevention: To strengthen violence prevention programs in
the state with a focus on rehabilitation of crack users, gender-based violence and monitoring
capacity.

48.     The Programa Atitude was expanded from 2,000 beneficiaries in 2012 to 6,842 in 2014.
The Program that started in 2011 with positive results has been formally established by decree
under the Pacto pela Vida, institutionalized and expanded. The Program offers services to drug
users and their families in Recife and in the interior of Pernambuco through several modalities: (a)
Street Outreach, through 15 itinerate teams that bring services to the street in an attempt to build
relationships with drug users at the risk of violence; (b) Support Centers (5), where users are
provided access to health care, shelter and counseling; (c) Intensive Treatment Centers (7), that
provide 24-hour inpatient service where users can stay for 2 to 6 months and are offered
counseling, meals, job search assistance, access to education, etc., in an attempt to build a new life
by putting an end to life-threatening situations; and (d) Special Rent Dorms (40), a more
independent living arrangement that targets beneficiaries who cannot return to their communities
either because of death threats or because their ties have been severed, and that aims to encourage
users’ autonomy by conditioning their stay on continued education, health and work. Programa
Atitude’s monitoring follows a Results Based Management model, where performance indicators
and targets are reviewed weekly in the framework of the Pacto pela Vida with the participation of
the program’s team, the Police Department, and other government officials. By December 2014,
the Program Atitude had benefitted 6,842 users, of which 2,252 were women. The rate of violent,
lethal and intentional crimes in territories where the Programa Atitude was operating dropped 8.05
percent from 2011 to 2014.

49.     The Sistema Estadual de Informações sobre as Mulheres (SeiMulheres) monitoring and
evaluation system on gender based violence was developed – a first in Brazil (particularly at the
state level), that lays the foundation of a larger evidence based agenda on gender. Since February
2015 this system has been providing information as input to the deliberations of the Technical
Chamber on Violence against Women, which counts on representation of the police and judicial
authorities, in addition to the Secretaria da Mulher. SeiMulheres compiles data, by municipality
three indicators for women in the State: (a) homicides; (b) rapes; and (c) specialized assistance to
women suffering from situations of domestic and family violence. A sample of these reports is
provided in Annex 6. Reports are produced weekly with detailed information on the location of
crimes, weapons used, time of day, day of the week, etc. SeiMulheres also compiles data on
different centers offering services in support of women that were victims of abuse, as well as a
cadaster of beneficiaries. Reports are used by the Technical Chamber to evaluate results of actions
taken to combat violence against women, and provide insights with respect to possible additional
new actions that may be needed or to possible modifications of existing programs such as the
Patrulha Maria da Penha (a program that provides protection to women in order to avoid repeat
aggressions) and others such as electronic monitoring of aggressors. Municipal administrations
have access to information for their jurisdiction, and there are plans to make the database available
to students, researchers and citizens in general. The rate of violent, lethal and intentional crimes
against women declined by 25.6 percent, from 6.69 per 100,000 women in 2007 to 4.98 in 2014,


                                                 22
mostly through the implementation of specific programs targeted to protect women from becoming
victims of violence. SeiMulheres provides input to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of
several existing programs and intensify efforts to reduce these crimes further. The SeiMulheres
experience in Pernambuco has generated interest from other states (Bahia, Rio de Janeiro)
interested in developing system enabling them to monitor and evaluate gender-based violence,
particularly in relation with the Maria da Penha law.

Reducing the Burden Associated with Chronic Disease

Policy Area 3.2 Health: To strengthen policies, programs and approaches in the state aimed at
attending to the needs of patients with chronic conditions, with an emphasis on diabetes and
hypertension.

50.    This Policy Area aimed to strengthening the State’s capacity to address effectively the growing
burden of chronic disease. Policy Actions relating to the adoption and implementation of a State Plan to
Tackle Non-Communicable Diseases and of clinical protocols and simplified clinical pathways that were
expected to contribute to improve the organization and coordination of health services in the State, and
enhance quality.

51.      The State adopted its Plano Estadual de Doenças Crônicas Não-Transmissíveis. As part
of this policy, the State has compiled and disseminated information and analyses on mortality from
non-communicable diseases disaggregated among different populations groups (gender, race,
education), provided technical assistance to municipalities, provided continuing education in
collaboration with universities and research institutions on surveillance and prevention, invested
in diagnostic equipment, and carried out information campaigns on risk factors to its citizens.
Further, the State’s Political Estadual de Fortalecimento de Atenção Primaria includes monitoring
hypertension and diabetes among its indicators. The State is now planning to implement the third
component of its primary care policy by increasing the amount of resources distributed in the form
through Results Based Management, specifically providing greater incentives for activities
focusing on chronic diseases.

52.     The adoption of clinical pathways and protocols, and their systemic use in the primary care
system through the State’s web-based central ambulatory referral system, together with the
establishment of the first UPA-E in July 2013 (and subsequently eight additional ones)
significantly improved the coordination of health services in the State, providing for an
optimization in the use of resources and for better planning of health service delivery. The UPA-
Es have capability for conducting diagnostic testing and exams (x-rays, MRIs, ultrasound,
electrocardiograms, etc.), and offer specialized medical assistance in ophthalmology,
otorhinolaryngology, neurology, orthopedics and cardiology, among other specializations. A total
of 69 percent of specialist consultations in cardiology and endocrinology were referred through
the state referral system in 2014. Indicators on patient referrals and others are monitored monthly,
and disseminated to technical and primary care specialists with the aim of working with municipal
primary care providers to adjust practices as needed. The State plans to establish an additional six
UPA-Es in 2015, so that all of the Pernambuco’s twelve regions will have access to the services
provided.




                                                  23
3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

53.      The EIG DPL, implemented over slightly more than one year, met substantially all of its
expected outcome targets and even exceeded some of them. It is difficult, in such a short period of
time, to obtain quantifiable, directly attributable final outcomes associated to its implementation.
In some of the Policy Areas supported, they do exist, e.g., beneficiaries of the model Pernambuco
no Batente that secured employment, direct beneficiaries from the similarly model Programa
Atitude, and others. Nevertheless, the outcome of the EIG DPL should be evaluated based on its
high relevance (all the more so in a now constrained fiscal environment), and on the fact that by
design and through its successful implementation it succeeded in accomplishing its defined
objectives. It succeeded in helping cement successful previously used but not formally established
processes (e.g., Results Based Management), expand and cement these exemplary programs (e.g.,
Pernambuco no Batente, Programa Atitude and others), define future priorities that the State
Government will no doubt pursue, and, more importantly, within a culture of results, provide some
key systems and processes needed to monitor and evaluate the impacts of these (and other)
programs to ensure their continued effectiveness, efficiency and relevance to the State’s needs and
priorities in the future. It resulted in a fundamental culture change in the State Government’s
secretariats and agencies towards one of working together towards common objectives, with strong
focus on results and monitoring that is difficult to quantify. Many of these systems are “a first” in
Brazil (particularly at the state level) and an example from an international perspective. All the TA
provided (that went much beyond typical preparation/supervision) and all efforts of the
Government’s coordination unit (SEPLAG) were key in making sure that all the targets were met
and that the data provided is systematically used to improve programs’ results. The EIG DPL’s Overall
Outcome is rated Satisfactory.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

54.     It is difficult to measure the specific identifiable impact on growth, poverty, gender or
social development of a single-tranche DPL implemented in a short time frame. This is all the
more so since the policy actions in several cases supported not specifically the implementation of
policies and programs, but rather, the strengthening of monitoring and other systems that will allow
the Government to better evaluate the effectiveness of those policies and programs to improve
their results. However, given the direct interventions targeting the poor and vulnerable populations, the
medium to longer turn impact of the overall Program is expected to be positive. Several policy actions
and programs supported either have produced tangible pro-poor results or are expected to do so
over the near future. These include policy reforms related to strengthening technical and vocational
education and training, expanding the Pernambuco no Batente Program, the Programa Atitude,
and the creation of the Technical Chamber on Violence against Women together with
strengthening the monitoring of gender-based violence, which disproportionately affects poorer
segments of the population. Actions to improve the delivery and quality of primary health care
and expand access to urgent and specialized care are also expected to benefit the poor
disproportionately, since it is those in the lower quintiles of the income distribution that rely
exclusively or primarily on the national health system. Over the longer term, the institutional



                                                   24
structures and systems put in place through policy actions should allow the Government to analyze
in-depth the impact of its programs on these groups, and introduce adjustments where warranted.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

55.    The policy actions supported by the EIG DPL were mostly institutional in nature, either in
terms of establishing, expanding or supporting systemic improvements, especially in terms of
monitoring capacities and capabilities. These are described in detail in Section 3.2.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)

3.5 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops.

Not applicable.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
   Rating: Negligible

56.      The Risk to Development Outcome is considered Negligible. The main risk, which is not
specific to the evaluation of this operation, is that the State could become financially constrained
in continuing to expand this positive experience to other areas. The economic downturn in Brazil,
especially fiscal constraints, could come to affect the State, but Pernambuco’s economy continues
to grow at faster than the national average, and State revenues in the form of the ICMS continue
increasing. Moreover, the State is in compliance with Brazil’s Lei de Responsabilidade Fiscal
(Fiscal Responsibility Law) and in line with its prudent management and policies, the State
Government has ex-ante adopted an expenditure allocation plan that restricts non-priority
expenditures while protecting those priority ones required to achieve its goals. Further, the
monitoring and evaluation systems, results based management focus and other systems put in place
with support of this EIG DPL will become even more relevant tools for evidence-based resource
allocation in a more constrained environment. The State’s Todos por Pernambuco program has
already produced tangible positive outcomes, and as a result, enjoys strong political and especially
popular support, as witnessed by the results of recent gubernatorial elections. There is political
continuity, at least for the foreseeable future, and the policies supported and legislation and
institutional and systemic improvements put in place in the context of the EIG DPL cement critical
underpinnings of this Program, that are now being taken to the next level through the
Government’s strategy, Pernambuco 2035. Institutional capacity is strong, most notably at the
level of State Government. The next challenge will be to work more closely in supporting the
State’s municipalities since many goals and targets depend critically on their performance.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
   Rating: Highly Satisfactory




                                                25
57.     The World Bank’s Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry is rated Highly Satisfactory.
The EIG DPL was grounded in analytical work, built upon the experience of the previous DPL,
consolidated and gave continuity to the process supported by the latter, and responded directly to
those areas within the State’s program where technical and financial support was requested. A
representative from the Secretaria da Mulher mentioned specifically that, at the Government’s
request, the World Bank included a specific sub-component focused on priority gender issues.
Importantly, the component on gender had an innovative design with the development of an M&E
system on GBV -- a first in Brazil (particularly at the state level). The design and implementation
of the M&E system for TVET programs was also a first in Brazil and has been used as a model
for other states, including Rio de Janeiro and Ceara. It laid the foundation of a larger evidence-
based agenda on these topics. Similarly, the setting up of M&E systems was a common theme
across components and this created important cross-sectorial synergies. The operation was
ambitious, especially with regard to its institutional complexity with a number of executing
agencies, with responsibilities and requirements shared across levels of government, and a
dispersion of components addressing a wide array of programs, but it was responsive to the State’s
request for assistance, and, in the preparation team’s view, the operation did not push beyond the
State’s capacity to deliver.

(b) Quality of Supervision
    Rating: Highly Satisfactory

58.     The World Bank’s Quality of Supervision is rated Highly Satisfactory. As a stand-alone,
single-tranche DPL, supervision would not ordinarily be expected to constitute a significant input.
However, in this case, the World Bank’s implementation support team went beyond the call of
duty, providing/organizing extensive TA and developing a strong and respected partnership with
not only the State’s team in SEPLAG, but with staff in other implementing agencies as well. State
representatives consulted during the ICR mission were emphatic in praising the quality of the
team’s implementation support, the perseverance in working side-by-side until the definition of
the various systems designs were perfected, of working jointly to disseminate the DPL’s very
positive accomplishments through videos documenting the results of the Pernambuco no Batente
Program and exchanges with staff from the Ministry for Social Development to facilitate access
data and better coordinate information systems (linked with the WB projects Bolsa Família 2APL)
and exchanges with other states in Brazil and countries (on M&E systems) through non-lending
technical assistance. The Bank team sought, and obtained, financing through trust funds, to help
provide a vehicle for complementary technical inputs in specific areas through hands on support
through the Federal level analytical work Brazil Skills and Jobs (P133162) (including workshops
and video conferences with other countries, and help in the design and implementation of the
system) and mobilization of TF money to evaluate one TVET program, by piloting the first
implementation of the SIMA system tools to a class of vocational training students (TF014662).
Finally, the team through the end has emphasized a focus on results, on questioning how results
obtained through the monitoring systems and policies supported by the DPL are being internalized
and used, and in helping an enthusiastic partner focus on the next steps.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
    Rating: Highly Satisfactory




                                                26
59.     Overall Bank Performance is rated Highly Satisfactory. The EIG DPL was complex,
involving three very different components and the institutionalization of numerous policies,
programs and systems implemented by eight different executing agencies. Its design, specifically
its quality at entry, was responsive, yet innovative and ambitious. The quality of supervision,
through both missions and regular videoconferences, helped overcome any potential setbacks that
might have surfaced through tremendously supportive and proactive implementation support,
contributing strongly to the EIG DPL’s highly desired outcomes.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
    Rating: Highly Satisfactory

60.     The Government performance is rated Highly Satisfactory. The State Government
provided throughout the strategic, institutional, financial and results-oriented environment, and a
remarkable degree of stability and consistency in staffing, policies and financial flows needed for
the EIG DPL to achieve its PDO. The State Government’s continued ownership of and
commitment to its Todos por Pernambuco were unwavering throughout implementation. The EIG
DPL supported carefully selected priorities in the Government’s program, which was built around
a process of intensive monitoring through monthly, at times weekly, progress meetings, often
chaired by the Governor. As a DPL, resources were not specifically earmarked to specific
components or programs, yet in all cases executing agencies received the allocations they needed
to achieve their respective targets.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
    Rating: Highly Satisfactory

61.     The Implementing Agencies Performance is rated Highly Satisfactory. The Secretariat of
Planning and Management (SEPLAG) was the primary implementing agency, but several other
agencies were also involved in the implementation of the various components and sub-
components. SEPLAG provided competent and efficient coordination between the various
agencies and showed consistent ownership and commitment to the Program. During preparation,
SEPLAG and the other agencies participated actively in defining the priority policy areas included
to ensure that the EIG DPL’s objectives were aligned closely with the Government’s goals as set
out in the Todos por Pernambuco Strategy Map, the prior actions (and later ensuring their timely
fulfillment), and outcome indicators that would reasonably reflect the operation’s achievements.
During implementation, SEPLAG met and worked regularly with staff of the other seven
implementing agencies, and received at least monthly updates from each of them on progress under
their respective policy areas, as well as of risks, impediments and other factors that could come to
delay or otherwise impact outcomes. As expected, the performance of the other implementing
agencies varied, with some stronger than others. Nevertheless, their commitment to their individual
goals, their enthusiasm in getting things done, the pride with which they describe (and share) their
respective accomplishments, and, more importantly, their shared vision in working as part of a
team, led by SEPLAG, towards a common goal, is remarkable.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
    Rating: Highly Satisfactory



                                                27
62.      Overall Borrower performance is rated Highly Satisfactory given the extraordinarily
positive enabling environment that the State Government provided for the implementation of its
Todos por Pernambuco program, in general, and the EIG DPL, in particular. The strength of its
commitment and its continuity throughout, and its consistency in monitoring and rewarding
results, translated into similar levels of enthusiasm and drive among the staff in SEPLAG and other
executing agencies, all of which was paramount to the operation’s highly satisfactory outcome.

6. Lessons Learned

63.     A DPL operation that supported institutionalization of several successful programs and
processes, across a diverse spectrum of areas, offers many lessons, not only in terms of its design,
scope, and implementation, but also in the design, structure and implementation of the programs
themselves. The lessons below focus only on the DPL’s design and implementation that is relevant
to similar operations.

     Government commitment is a pre-requisite to the outcome of any project or program, but
      for a program that supports a fundamental reorientation of the administrative processes
      towards specified goals the continuity of that commitment is fundamental. What stands out
      in the case of Pernambuco’s Todos por Pernambuco Program is the overall continuity, stability
      and overall processes for striving for results, monitoring results (with attention from
      leadership), and constant fine-tuning to address challenges. Initial strong results lead to popular
      support, which leads to political continuity, which leads to continued priority, which leads to
      more impressive results—a virtuous cycle.

     World Bank support gives a strong, central executing agency clout to both request
      monitoring reports and demand results, while at the same time playing a catalytic role in
      improving its relations with other executing agencies. The EIG DPL facilitated the
      establishment of what were considered true partnerships, working together towards a common
      goal, between SEPLAG and the other executing agencies. Implementation support teams
      should identify opportunities for such type of partnerships, which are facilitated by synergies
      across DPL components in terms of themes (such as M&E in this DPL case) and long-term
      engagements with the client through different, but consolidated, operations. They should also
      support each’s agency’s programs as well as empowering a central agency in the coordination
      across components.

     Operations that address activities and programs implemented by municipalities, e.g. primary
      health care, face particular challenges in terms of defining targets and results, and
      monitoring in Brazil’s federal environment. Specifically, primary health care is a municipal
      responsibility, with financing provided at the federal, state and municipal levels. This financing
      comes with requirements that municipalities must follow, especially in terms of monitoring
      and reporting, which can affect implementation. For example, during implementation, Brazil’s
      Ministry of Health introduced and began to roll out a new primary health information system,
      e-SUS, that replaced the SIAB system that municipalities were utilizing. With staged
      introduction, differences in municipal capabilities to administer the new system, as well as
      other typical disruptions that occur when new systems are introduced, led to delays in obtaining


                                                    28
    updated data on two indicators. There is little that can be done to address the otherwise
    welcome improvements in systems, as this is a reality in Brazil’s federal environment, but
    implementation support teams should be aware that the monitoring of any indicator that
    requires the use of systems at the federal level may be affected by issues exogenous to the
    project or program in question, and be ready to revise the indicator or relevant data
    expeditiously.

   Similarly, process improvements that involve actions by several agencies can be complex, so
    it is important to consider carefully the legislative framework that established those agencies,
    and the steps required in their approval process. Specifically, efforts to reduce the time
    required for business registration contemplated the streamlining of the approval process in
    several very diverse agencies (although the indicator specifically referred to the time required
    for JUCEPE’s approval). The EIG DPL helped the State identify the various issues that each
    of these agencies, CBM, APEVISA, CPRH, face in streamlining their processes, as well as
    changes that will be required to their legislation to allow for streamlining. Further, and building
    on the lesson above, municipalities are free to establish their own legislation on matters such
    as environmental protection, only complicating the process.

   When an operation supports the rollout of systems to several municipalities, it is generally
    considered that the greatest risk is in the implementation by the municipalities with least
    institutional capacity, but this is not always the case. Preparation teams may want to want to
    identify the status of systems in participating municipalities to include up-front measures
    designed to facilitate implementation in any municipalities that might resist adopting new,
    centralized systems. Implementation of REDESIM was most difficult in the larger
    municipalities, with stronger institutional, financial and information systems capacity, as they
    already had in place systems of their own. Instead of adapting to the centralized REDESIM
    system, these municipalities wanted to adapt REDESIM to their systems. However, detailed
    explanation of the rational for the system by SEPLAG and capacity building helped solve this
    issue. These elements were key for success.

   It makes sense to include gender as a separate component (or sub-component), especially if
    the Government counts on a separate agency to implement the planned activities. Activities
    focused on gender are often subsumed under other components and subordinated to other
    implementing agencies. Experience under the EIG-DPL confirms that very positive outcomes
    can result from providing a separate component or subcomponent, with a direct link to the
    coordinating agency (in this case, SEPLAG) as opposed to being subordinated to another
    agency. It is important for such stand-alone components to nonetheless directly foster cross-
    sectoral collaboration and coordination as gender is a transversal issue which impact can also
    be greatly increased by leveraging existing programs and policies – an area where the support
    of the World Bank can make a particular impact.

   Aligning a DPL fully with the Government’s priorities, including its Results Framework and
    indicators, ensures commitment, facilitates monitoring, and helps build the results culture
    needed for sustainability. The EIG DPL was aligned fully with the Government’s priorities,
    and its Results Framework was developed, in the words of one official, “based on priorities for



                                                  29
    both the Government and the World Bank, with indicators that were not superimposed, but
    rather selected from among those of the Government.”

   It is difficult to measure final outcomes for a DPL operation with a naturally short duration,
    and the Results Framework was well designed to track intermediate outcomes that could be
    measured during program implementation. Several of the EIG DPL’s indicators referred to
    the putting in place of systems, e.g., the implementation of an M&E system to register the
    occurrence cases of gender-based violence in Pernambuco, as opposed to final outcomes, e.g.,
    reduction of gender-based violence. There are other such examples in the Results Framework.
    In some cases, final outcomes are difficult to measure, as further time is needed to assess the
    impact of the programs on the State’s progress and resource allocation policies. Nevertheless,
    measureable outcomes have been recorded in certain policy areas, as discussed in Section 3.2,
    as the respective programs have been in place for some time already, and the DPL only
    supported their institutionalization, through formal, established systems that allow better
    monitoring and evaluation (but also making attribution difficult.)

   Sustained commitment to a reorientation in public sector management practices after time
    results in a fundamental cultural change in institutions that is very difficult to measure or
    quantify. The EIG-DPL resulted in a fundamental culture change in the State Government’s
    secretariats and agencies towards one of working together towards common objectives, with
    strong focus on results and monitoring. This culture change is noticeable, is showing promising
    results, but is difficult to measure and quantify.

* According to SAP, in FYs 2015 and 2016, there are lending costs, which correspond to when the DPL was already
effective and disbursed. This is likely because charges were misposted to the lending code instead of supervision.
There is typically no formal supervision for such a rapidly disbursing operation.

INTRODUCTION

Signed on July 18, 2013, the DPL II – Development Policy Loan (Pernambuco: Equity and
Inclusive Growth), an agreement between the State of Pernambuco and the World Bank, had as its
objective to support the State of Pernambuco develop its Priority Policies, by providing resources
to the State Treasury. Specifically, the DPL II supports a set of policies agreed during earlier
negotiations that correspond to the Government’s initiatives in the search to expand opportunities
in a more equitable manner.

OBJECTIVES OF THE OPERATION

The objectives of DPL II, Pernambuco: Equity and Inclusive Growth, were to strengthen public
policies in the areas of economic development, improve the quality of the state health system,
improve the fight against violence, offer more professional training opportunities, and
consequently, improve the quality of life of the state’s residents. The areas supported by the
programs coincide with the Plano de Governo adopted by the current administration.

A Policy Matrix using the strategy already adopted by the Government was divided in three
components: New Economy – Opportunities for all Pernambucans, Action Driven State –
Capacity to Generate Results, and Quality of Life – A Better Life for all Pernambucans, The three
components mirror the logic used by the Government in structuring the areas supported by public
policies.

EVALUATION OF THE OPERATION’S RESULTS IN RELATION TO PROPOSED
OBJECTIVES

Component 1: New Economy – Opportunities for all Pernambucans

1.     Regional Economic Development

A Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) System was developed for PROINFRA to measure the
results and benefits from the fiscal incentive policy. The Secretariat of Economic Development
dedicated strong efforts to create the systems and make it operational in due time, as this successful
program provides infrastructure needed for Pernambuco’s economic development in a timely and
efficient manner, especially in the state’s interior.

The target was 100%, which was achieved as the monitoring system was developed completely
and the results disseminated on the Secretaria de Desenvolvimento Econômico’s site. Nevertheless,
the data to be collected for the monitoring system are incomplete, since these are economic and
social indicators (GDP, jobs, literacy rates, infant mortality, etc.) that are published with large time
lags, and therefore the necessary data to complete an analysis of the Program’s effectiveness in
not yet available.

2.     Private Sector Development

In view of the state’s new economic realities, the Junta Comercial do Estado do Pernambuco
(JUCEPE) had as a target under the DPL II to increase the number of companies established within
72 hours in 25 participating municipalities, with backing by legislation, on the basis of the
approvals required by the state government. Although the REDESIM (Rede Nacional para a
Simplificação do Registro e da Legalização de Empresas e Negócios) is still being finalized, at
present more than 90% of companies in Pernambuco are being established in up to 72 hours, when
considering the working days in participating municipalities. We highlight that this timeframe
considers the step dependent on approval by the state government, which demonstrated that the
target agreed and supported by the World Bank was met with success.

As the REDESIM is in an advance stage, it has already brought a large reduction in the time
necessary to legally establish companies in Pernambuco. As mentioned above, the system is in the
final phase of implementation, counting on agreements signed with 24 municipalities, of which 21
have the system in operation and 3 are now introducing the system. To highlight the relevance of
this policy, JUCEPE calculated that more than 71% of companies in the state are located in the
municipalities participating in REDESIM.

3.     Technical Vocational Education and Training

 Together with the World Bank, the Secretariat of Labor, Training and Employment (STQE) and
the Secretariat of Education contributed to the implementation and operationalization of the
Monitoring and Evaluation System – SIMA for the Education and Training Programs, which are
being utilized fully by STQE’s teams.




                                                  37
In this manner the operationalization of SIMA has contributed to optimizing the process of
managing information on basic and technical professional training, allowing total integration
between the areas of qualification and employment for the workers and students that have
completed their training, in a timely, efficient and transparent manner, through new courses and
insertion of youth in the labor market in the state.

As described, the Government met the target in the Policy Matrix, by operationalizing the
Monitoring and Evaluation system, demonstrating the importance of this sector to the
Pernambucan society.

4.     Productive Inclusion

With the objective of promoting Socio productive Inclusion of vulnerable populations, through
work or income-generating activities, the State of Pernambuco, under the framework of DPL II,
committed to strengthen and expand the Program PE no Batente. This policy aims to offer
promotion of social and productive inclusion to families in extreme poverty, registered in the
Cadastro Único, with the establishment or reactivation and maintenance of the Centro de Inclusão
Produtiva PE no Batente.

At present, the Program is operating in 51 municipalities, which adhered to the Program by signing
agreements accepting to participate and agreeing to the fund-to-fund transfer arrangements of
SEDSCJ. With this, the Secretariat of Social Development and Human Rights, now called the
Secretariat of Social Development, Children and Youth, achieved the target agreed in the Policy
Matrix of the operation.

The Program PE no Batente covers municipalities in the 12 Development Regions – DRs of the
State of Pernambuco, distributed in 9 Local Productive Activities: Textiles, Industrial Embroidery,
Agroindustry for the primary processing of fruit, Family Agriculture, Recycling of Solid Waste
for the production of brooms, utilizing plastic PET bottles, Plaster, Ocean Fishing, Aquaculture
and Fishing, and Production of Milk and Dairy Products.

Component 2: Action Driven State – Capacity to Generate Results

Public Administration
The Pacto pela Vida (Pact for Life, PPV) is the first line of public security in Pernambuco that
has as its fundamental objective the reduction of violent intentional deaths in the state of
Pernambuco since May 2007. At present, the PPV is under implementation and full operation,
with periodic monitoring meetings, that count on the presence of the governor, and that use
results and analyses for the definition of public policies.

With relation to education, the Pacto pela Educação (Pact for Education) was developed as a
policy focused on the quality of education for all with equity, concentrated on improvements in
the quality of teaching, of learning by students and the educational environment and facilities,
expanding access to education and contributing to improvements in education in the state of
Pernambuco. In the operational context, the Pacto pela Educação was implemented in 2014 with
a Nucleus of Planning, Budgeting and Implementation Analysts. The main activities of the



                                                38
Nucleus for Results Based Management in Education in 2014 were related to: i) preparation of
results reports; ii) definition of targets and meeting to review results; iii) monitoring meetings at
three levels, and iv) development of a new automated reporting system.

The Pacto pela Saúde (Pact for Health) is a government strategy focused on improving the
population’s health status, concentrated on reducing the mortality from avoidable causes and in
improving health indicators related to the functioning of the State’s health system, including
Primary Health, Specialized Health both ambulatory and hospital-based.

The Pacto pela Saúde incorporates the Government’s strategic objectives and, in the operational
context, the Pacto pela Saúde was implemented in 2014 with a Nucleus of Planning, Budgeting
and Implementation Analysts. The main activities of the Nucleus for Results Based Management
in Health in 2014 were related to: i) preparation of results reports; ii) monitoring meetings at
three levels, and iii) development of a new automated reporting system.

As highlighted above, the Results Based Management Model is being utilized entirely in the
areas of public security, health and education, ensuring that what was agreed with the World
Bank under DPL II was achieved.

In relation to the expansion of this model of results based management, in 2014, the Executive
Secretariat of Results Based Management in SEPLAG began visiting other units to disseminate
the methodology of results based management, in accordance with Decree No. 39.336/2013. At
the moment, six additional units (Secretariats) are contemplated:

Secretariat of Social Development and Human Rights
Secretariat of Children and Youth
Secretariat of Economic Development
Secretariat of Cities (with focus on the State Department of Transit-DETRAN)
Secretariat of Labor, Qualification and Employment
Secretariat of Micro and Small Enterprises

During this period, a team of 7 (seven) analysts visited these units to carry out a diagnostic of
procedures developed, identify sources of data and develop a matrix of indicators. The analysts
also worked on the development of a decree to define the system for monitoring the indicators of
these Secretariats and a program that promotes meritocracy through the development of
incentives.

With this, the Executive Secretariat of Results Based Management in SEPLAG prepared a draft
of the decree with the objective of publishing the mandatory norms to apply the methodology in
new secretariats, but the decree has not been published given the impending change in the
administration of State Government’s executive branch. There would be changes in the state
secretariats, some will cease to exist and new ones created, and it is not beneficial to publish a
decree referring to secretariats that no longer exist.




                                                 39
Even though the decree was not published, it is being adapted to the new government structure
and will be adopted soon. In the interim, the dissemination and expansion of the Results Based
Management Model is progressing with the new secretariats.

Component 3: Quality of Life – A Better Life for all Pernambucans

Prevention of Violence – Rehabiliation of Crack Users

It was agreed, in the context of DPL II, to increase the number of persons benefiting from the
Program Atitude, increasing from 2,000 (of which 500 women) in 2012 to 6,000 (of which 2,000
women) in 2014. The table below presents the number of persons benefiting from the Program,
receiving services of Atitude nas Ruas, Centros de Acolhimento e Apoio, Centros de Acolhimento
Intensiva and the Aluguel Social.

                                                Guararapes, and 10 in Caruaru
                    Total                                           67

         Total Women Benefitting                                    2,252

As shown above, the specified target was achieved, and even exceeded. We highlight that, beside
the Programa Atitude, the Government of Pernambuco inaugurated in 2014 the Centro de
Acolhimento Intensivo Mulher (Intensive Accommodation Center for Women), focused on
providing shelter to pregnant and nursing women, and their children. The Center has the capacity
to provide service to up to 30 women and the service counts on furniture for infants and the areas
are accessible and adapted to caring for pregnant women and newborns.

Prevention of Violence Against Women

To contribute to prevent gender violence in the State of Pernambuco, with the help of partner units,
the Secretariat of Women had as a target under DPL II to implement a Monitoring and Evaluation
(M&E) System. Through routine monitoring, the cases of violence against women in the PPV’s


                                                40
geographic areas were registered, evaluating the results of actions taken to combat violence against
women, an providing inputs for decision making regarding new interventions and the adjustment
of existing policies and programs as part of the PPV, under the auspices of the Câmara Têcnica
para o Enfrentamento da Violência de Gênero contra as Mulheres.

The development of the M&E System made available on-line reports, with data on cases of
violence against women in the State of Pernambuco and data on the quality, efficiency and results
of actions taken in combatting gender violence.

The system is operational and resides on the servers of the Agência Estadual de Tecnologia da
Informacção. The restricted access page can be found under the following electronic address:
https://www.seimulheres.pe.gov.br/seimulheres/public/pages/login.jsf. In view of the above, the
Government achieved the objective included in the operation.

Health

Under the Operation DPL II, health problems that needed to be addressed urgently and creatively
by the States were identified to contribute to an improvement in the population’s health status. In
this sense, the Bank and the Government developed the following indicators to incorporate in the
Policy Matrix of DPL II: Percentage of hypertensive patients monitored by primary health care;
percentage of diabetics monitored by primary health care; and Percentage of specialized
consultation (cardio and endocrinology) referred through the state referral system.

Regarding the Percentage of hypertensive patients monitored by primary health care and the
percentage of diabetics monitored by primary health care, and to address non-transmissible chronic
illnesses, a Plano Estadual was developed, that has already carried out several actions aimed at
promoting the population’s health, like providing technical assistance to municipalities and public
state institutions, preparing and disseminating analyzed information on morbidity and mortality of
the non-transmissible chronic illnesses, incorporating guidance on healthy lifestyles in
communication media, etc.

For these indicators, it was agreed that the target would be to increase monitoring of hypertensive
persons from 39.45% (2012) to 44% in 2014; with respect to diabetics, the target agreed was to
increase from 47.67% (2012) to 52% in 2014. In June of 2014, the Government presented
monitoring data of 42.61% for the first indicator and 53.60% for the second, confirming that the
targets agreed with the Bank were achieved.

The third indicator of the Operation had as an objective to monitor the effectiveness of the Sistema
de Regulação de Consultas Especializada em Pernambuco, as follows: Percentage of specialized
consultation (cardio and endocrinology) referred through the state referral system, reflecting
improvements in the state’s referral system. For this indicator, the agreed target was 70%, and the
State reached 69% in December/14.

GOVERNMENT PERFORMANCE DURING PREPARATION AND
MPLEMENTATION OF THE OPERATION

SEPLAG was, during implementation of the operation, the coordinator of the Multisectoral Project.
The DPL involved the following secretariats and a commercial junta: Secretaria de Planejamento
e Gestão (Secretariat of Planning and Administration), Secretaria de Educação (Secretariat of
Education), Secretaria do Trabalho, Qualificação e Emprego (Secretariat of Labor, Qualification

secretariats involved in the operation. Periodic monitoring of the indicators in the Policy Matrix
were carried out, in addition to meetings to address issues and difficulties that could have
compromised the performance of the DPL.

During the implementation of DPL II, there were no mishaps or great difficulties, the Government
was able to develop satisfactorily the three components covered by the Project, which are, New
Economy – Opportunities for all Pernambucanos, Action Driven State – Capacity to Generate
Results, and Quality of Life – A Better Life for all Pernambucans.

     O PROINFRA – Programa de Desenvolvimento da Infraestrutura Industrial é um importante programa de incentivos fiscais realizado pelo Estado de Pernambuco e também presente em
     diversos outros estados brasileiros. É devidamente ratifcado pelos Estados no âmbito do CONFAZ. Especialmente em momentos de crise, como o que se encontra instalado no mundo e
     no Brasil, a sua utilização ganha ainda maior importância na atração e implantação de empresas que geram renda e empregos para a população. Assim, continuará a ser utilizado pelo
07   Estado de Pernambuco. Como há um determinado período até que os dados estatísticos sobre os Municípios sejam disponibilizados, sugere-se que, no futuro, novos levantamentos e
     pesquisas sejam realizados para acessar os benefícios do incentivo junto à população e quais os seus desafios.
