support the Government of Pernambuco to strengthen the\n            design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of\n            policies and programs aimed at promoting sustained growth\n            and improved economic opportunities for the poor,\n            consolidating public sector management innovations,\n            preventing crime and violence, and reducing the burden\n            associated with chronic disease. The main policy areas the\n            Bank will be focusing on are: regional economic development,\n            private sector development, technical and vocational\n            education and training, productive inclusion, public sector\n            management, crime and violence prevention, health. In each\n            of these areas the operation supports critical actions\n            towards the institutionalization and expansion of key\n            government policies and programs, or the establishment of\n            monitoring and evaluation systems that will provide the\n            basis for evidence-based and performance oriented policy\n            making in the future. Taken together, the policy actions are\n            expected to help promote sustained growth and improved\n            economic opportunities for the poor, consolidation of public\n            sector management innovations, prevention crime and\n            violence, and a reduction of the burden associated with\n            chronic disease."}, "docdt": "2013-05-23T00:00:00Z"}
