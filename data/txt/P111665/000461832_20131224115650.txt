1. PROGRAM CONTEXT, DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES, AND DESIGN
 
    1.1 Context at appraisal

Brazil is an upper middle income country with a population of 199 million and a per capita
income of $11,630. Since the Plano Real brought inflation under control in the mid-1990s, the
macro economy has stabilized and growth has accelerated. Rio de Janeiro with a population of
6.3 million is the second largest city and the capital of Rio de Janeiro State. As macroeconomic
performance improved at a national level, Rio suffered a lengthy decline. Its economy contracted
at an average annual rate of 1.1 percent from 1985-2003, and subsequently growth continued to
lag other major capital cities. Rio is affected by social and economic inequalities, which were
exacerbated by slow growth. At the time of appraisal, the poor comprised about 13 percent of the
population and nearly 19 percent were living in neighborhoods often characterized as slums
called favelas with inadequate infrastructure, schools and health facilities.

After a fiscal crisis in the early 1990s Rio, along with many other municipalities, renegotiated its
debts with the National Treasury. Since 2000, strict controls have been imposed under Brazil’s
Fiscal Responsibility Law (LRF). The LRF limits personnel spending to 60 percent of total
expenditure, and puts a ceiling on public debt of 120 percent of current revenue. A golden rule
limits net borrowing to the capital budget and outlaws lending and borrowing between state and
municipal governments.

Through adherence to the LRF, Rio’s fiscal situation improved and was in compliance with the
LRF’s prudential limits. In 2009, personnel expenditures were below 50 percent of net current
revenue, while net consolidated debt was 25.4 percent of net current revenue, down from 79
percent in 2004. Nevertheless, the capital budget contributed disproportionately to the
adjustment, as investment fell from 11 percent of expenditure in 2004 to 9 percent in 2008.
Moreover, fiscal constraints contributed to a deterioration in the quality of municipal service
delivery and limited provision of services to poor and underserved areas. Meanwhile, the private
sector continued to underperform.

A new Government was elected in 2008 on a reformist platform and after taking office in
January 2009 put forward a multiyear plan focused on laying the foundations for faster growth
and improved public service delivery. The global financial crisis added further to the impetus for
reform. The Municipal Government sought support from the Bank and the National Treasury for
a debt restructuring operation that would decrease interest costs and create fiscal space for
investment as well as support key reforms to strengthen fiscal management and government
efficiency, and improve service delivery in poor and high-conflict areas.

Among the main elements of the Government’s program were:

         Fiscal adjustment: Creating fiscal space for investment through debt restructuring,
          improved revenue collection and expenditure management, and pension reform.

                                                 1
 
             Service delivery innovations: Increasing access to public services and improving their
              quality and efficiency by simplifying business registration and licensing; expanding and
              restructuring health care delivery; and strengthening education through curriculum
              reform, remedial learning programs, and better performance monitoring.
             Public sector management: Raising public sector efficiency by implementing MTEF and
              Results Based Management, reforming procurement and promoting PPPs.

1.2 Rationale for Bank involvement

The Bank has been a long standing partner in Brazil’s development, valued for its technical
assistance and knowledge services. However, Brazil is a large and sophisticated borrower and
the Bank’s lending envelope is small in relation to the federal budget. Thus, with the
encouragement of the Federal Government, the Bank has increasingly sought to maximize its
value added and developmental impact by engaging with subnational jurisdictions where its
technical and financial support and knowledge services are more valuable. The Bank especially
tries to engage in innovative operations which have demonstration effects and can be replicated
elsewhere. The Rio Municipal DPL exemplified this approach.

Though the Bank has worked with states such as Minas Gerais, Ceará and Rio de Janeiro, the
Rio Municipal DPL represented the first development policy operation with a city government
and extended the Bank’s reach to a new level. Under Brazil’s 1988 constitution, municipalities
are substantially independent entities, similar to states, and are the main providers of many
essential public services. This makes them natural partners for the Bank in pursuing Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) objectives of strengthening growth, reducing poverty, and improving
social outcomes.

The Rio Municipal DPL was seen as an innovation (requiring a waiver of OP/BP 8.60) that could
be replicated in other municipalities. Rio’s institutional strength and technical capacity made it a
good choice to pilot such an operation. The Federal Government was supportive because the
Bank’s engagement would further implementation of the LRF. Beyond that, states and
municipalities have overlapping jurisdictions in sectors such as health and education, requiring
policy coordination.1 The Rio Municipal DPL was prepared in conjunction with a Rio State DPL
which covered similar areas, presenting a unique opportunity to support policy coordination to
generate efficiency gains at both levels.

Finally, the Bank’s lending solved a difficult problem in that a number of jurisdictions that had
renegotiated their debts with the Federal Government following the mid-1990s fiscal crisis, had
found their (renegotiated) debts rising uncontrollably. Restructuring Rio’s debt by using the

 Indeed, Rio’s situation is even more complicated as it was the national capital until 1960 when it became a state
and then later the capital of a larger state with its own government. In areas such as health and education, it retains
unique institutional arrangements reflecting this legacy.

                                                               2
 
proceeds to prepay the Federal loan and reduce debt servicing costs was expected to enable the
loans to be paid off more quickly.

1.3 Original Program Development Objective and Key Indicators

The objective of the operation was: “to assist the municipality of Rio de Janeiro in creating fiscal
space which will be used for investments to improve the quality and efficiency of public service
delivery, especially in poor areas, through innovative programs in health, education and private
sector development. Other investments will strengthen the institutional framework for efficient
service delivery through the implementation of a medium term expenditures framework, results-
based management with the public sector, and PPPs with the private sector.”

Outcome Indicators for tracking progress towards these objectives were the following:

    1. Reduced NPV of the pension system’s actuarial deficit over the next 50 years by 17
        percent or R$6.3 billion of which R$3.1 billion from parametric reforms (first tranche)
        and R$3.2 billion from the recapitalization measures (second tranche)
    2. Improved revenue collection, evidenced by a 4 percent increase in ISS tax collections
        through the introduction of electronic fiscal invoice system (Nota Fiscal Electrônica)
    3. Reduction in the number of days required to obtain a municipal business license in Rio
        from 20 days in 2009 to 12.5 days in 2010
    4. Doubling of family health care coverage from a January 2009 baseline of 6 percent to a
        projected 12 percent in December 2011
    5. Annual reductions in student within-year and between-year dropout rates and annual
        improvement in the national and municipal education indices IDEB and IDE Rio for
        Escolas do Amanhã from the 2009 baseline and annual expansion in enrollments in ECD
        centers and preschools targeted to low income communities from 29,921 (crèches) and
        77,845 (preschools) in 2009 baseline by 3000 new openings a year
    6. Implementation of the initial year of a 3-5 years MTEF strategy with associated
        expenditures plan and financing plan
    7. Implementation of Results Based Management, evidenced by annual evaluation of
        performance contracts signed by the mayor with line secretariats
    8. Improved efficiency in stock management reduces losses in the stock of goods in the
        health sector from 20 percent to 10 percent
    9. Establishment of a framework to enable PPPs to invest in infrastructure and service
        delivery projects, evidenced by at least one project prepared by the PPP Unit
    10. Rationalized current expenditures as evidenced by a reduction in the growth of personnel
        expenses.
    11. The share of municipal Grade 2 students meeting national reading proficiency standards
        on Provinha Brasil rises by at least 1 percentage point annually from 73 percent in 2009.

        goods and services.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program

The operation comprised 3 pillars, each with specific objectives.

Pillar 1: Creating Fiscal Space. Specific objective: Creating fiscal space to expand public
investment and lay the foundation for municipal growth.

Policy measures focused on tax administration and management of the municipal pension plan.
However, the PD also discussed personnel costs and included milestones (i.e. not required for
disbursement) on Human Resource management in the results matrix, bringing the expenditure
side into the fiscal space equation. Debt restructuring, implicitly an element of the program,
rounded out the program.

       Revenue collection: One of Rio’s main revenue sources is the Imposto Sobre Serviços
        (ISS), a tax on services. DPL policy measures sought to increase its yield by: (a)
        implementing a system of electronic transactions recording, the Nota Fiscal Electrônica
        (NFE) and creation of a database (Sistema de Inteligencia Fiscal) to facilitate the
        identification of ISS tax evasion; and (b) submitting to the legislative assembly a draft
        law expediting recourse to judicial measures to recover tax arrears. An additional
        milestone called for approval by the legislative assembly of a user fee for public lighting.
        Outcome indicator: increased ISS tax revenue collection due to the NFE, with a target of
        4 percent.
       Pension reform: The operation supported two types of reforms: (a) "Parametric reforms"
        entailing: (1) Calculation of pension benefits based on average rather than last wage; (2)
        Indexation of benefits on inflation rather than wage growth; and (3) Reducing the
        replacement rate of survivors benefits from 100 percent to 70 percent for pension benefits
        above the plan ceiling. In addition to the financial savings, the measures were intended to
        bring Rio’s municipal pension plan closer in line with Constitutional Amendment 41. (b)
        Recapitalization of the pension fund, FUNPREVI, by dedicating various municipal
        revenue streams, including future oil and gas royalties and earnings on the municipal real
        estate portfolio (or equivalent sources). Outcome indicator: reduction of NPV of the
        pension system’s actuarial deficit over the next fifty years by R$3.1 billion (8.5 percent)
        from the parametric reforms, and R$3.2 billion (8.8 percent) from the recapitalization.
       Human resource management: After taking office, the Government had initiated steps to
        bring operating costs and personnel expenditures under control. Amongst the various
        measures were reducing political appointments and limiting credit from prior
        employment toward pension benefits, which were included as first tranche milestones. A
        second tranche milestone called for undertaking a payroll audit, including active
        employees, pensioners and survivors, in order to identify fraud or clerical errors and

                                                 4
 
        improve workforce planning. Outcome indicator: reduction in the growth of personnel
        expenses (no target specified).
       Debt restructuring: Proceeds of the DPL were used to pay down the municipality’s debt
        to the National Treasury – indeed the money was disbursed directly to the Treasury –
        resulting in significant interest savings. Under the terms of the Treasury debt, a 20
        percent prepayment would reduce the interest rate on the remaining balance by 3 percent.
        Twenty percent of Rio’s debt of R$7.25 billion in 2009 represented around 80 percent of
        the amount of the DPL. As explained in the Letter of Development Policy (LDP), the
        Municipality planned to use the money for this purpose. Outcome indicator: not
        specified. However, a reduction in debt service costs of around 2 percent of net current
        revenue (NCR) in 2010-14 was anticipated (see Annex A5 of the PD).

Pillar 2: Innovations in public services delivery. Specific objective: Reforming public service
delivery with (a) improved government processes for registering businesses; (b) increased
access to quality family health care and emergency care services through a new model for
subcontracting social organizations to manage health facilities; and (c) improved early
development of poor children, better quality of primary schools in high-conflict slum areas and
system wide improvements in student learning outcomes.

       Business registration: The Government had initiated a project called Alvará Já, to
        improve the business environment by simplifying registration and issuance of business
        licenses for activities with low sanitary and environmental risk and providing for online
        application. The Government further planned to merge its business registration system
        with those at the state and national levels by joining the Integrated Registration System
        (REGIN). A DPL prior action required approval of Alvará Já’s enabling legislation.
        Outcome indicator: Reduction in the average time to start a business from 20 days to 12.5
        days.
       Health: Reforms in the health sector aimed at expanding access to primary care in
        underserved neighborhoods; improving the management and efficiency of hospitals and
        health facilities; and rationalizing provision of emergency services. The approach,
        adapted from other jurisdictions, was to establish a network of Family Health Clinics
        managed by Social Organizations – private nonprofit entities having managerial and
        financial autonomy. Prior actions included approval of the legislation to transfer public
        services management to social organizations, and signing of management contracts for 20
        family health clinics and 7 emergency care clinics. Outcome indicator: Doubling family
        health care coverage from 6 percent of the population in 2009 to 12 percent in 2011.
       Education: The Government’s education reforms addressed core challenges related to (a)
        poor learning outcomes, (b) difficulties faced by schools in high-crime neighborhoods,
        and (c) large, unmet demands for preschool and day care services. The DPL supported
        specific reforms in all three areas. Prior actions included issuing decrees establishing
        innovative schools, Escolas do Amanhã, in 150 high-conflict slum neighborhoods; and

                                                5
 
        expanding provision of early childhood care and preschool services, with establishment
        of 10 integrated facilities in targeted low-income areas. Additional milestones called for
        provision of remedial literacy classes; upgrading teachers skills in literacy training; and
        setting up a system of bonus pay for schools attaining annual performance targets.
        Outcome indicators: annual improvement in test scores and reductions in dropout rates
        (no targets specified); annual expansion of 3,000 new openings in early childhood
        development centers and preschools targeted to low income communities; annual
        increase in the share of students meeting national reading proficiency standards by at
        least 1 percent.

Pillar 3: Public Sector Management. Specific Objective: developing a framework to improve the
efficiency of service delivery (a) in the public sector through introduction of results-based
management (RBM) tools and the implementation of the first steps of a Medium Term
Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and (b) in the private sector through public-private
partnerships (PPP) in priority areas.

       Results Based Management and Medium Term Expenditure Framework: The
        Government sought to modernize planning and budgeting techniques in order to sharpen
        the focus on strategic priorities, increase efficiency and accountability, and improve the
        effectiveness of public service delivery. DPL supported measures included developing a
        Public Investment Framework and incorporating medium term projections into the budget
        process; and establishing a results-based monitoring and evaluation system and utilizing
        it for results agreements signed with city agencies. Outcome indicator: Implementation of
        initial year of a 3-5 year investment strategy with associated expenditure and financing
        plans incorporated into the 2012 budget; signing of 16 results agreements and publication
        of annual evaluations on the web.
       Public Private Partnerships (PPP): PPPs, if well managed, are a means of increasing both
        efficiency and the availability of resources for public investment. DPL prior actions
        entailed establishing a framework for PPPs and approval of the enabling legislation by
        the Legislative Assembly, and issuance of a decree establishing the by-laws of the
        Municipal Guarantee Fund for PPPs. Outcome indicator: preparation of at least one
        project by the PPP Unit.
       Procurement: Fragmented and inefficient procurement was seen as a further impediment
        to public sector efficiency. DPL prior actions required issuance of a decree
        institutionalizing yearly planning and centralized procurement of common goods and
        services; and piloting a stock management system for the health sector together with
        approval of a schedule for a municipality-wide roll-out. Outcome indicator: Average 20
        percent saving on the cost of general consumption goods and services through centralized
        procurement; reduction in stock losses of goods in the health sector to 10 percent from a
        baseline of 20 percent.

1.5 Revised policy areas

There were no revisions or modifications during implementation.

2. KEY FACTORS AFFECTING IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOMES
 
2.1 Program performance

All required policy actions were satisfied in a timely manner, with no delays in effectiveness or
disbursement. Table 1 above lists prior actions for the first tranche (first column) and second
tranche release conditions (second column), together with milestones (not bolded).

2.2 Key factors affecting implementation

Adequacy of the government’s commitment:

The DPL’s policy areas were drawn from an integrated and mutually reinforcing package of
reforms supported by all levels of government.

A new Municipal Government under Mayor Eduardo Paes was elected in 2008 on a reformist
platform and subsequently demonstrated a strong commitment to the overarching objectives,
supported by the DPL, of private sector development; improving public services, especially to
the poor; and strengthening public sector performance. In addition, the Municipal Government is
politically aligned with the Rio State and Federal governments and DPL supported policies were
reinforced by federal and state initiatives including Fiscal Responsibility Law and pension
reforms mandated by constitutional amendments and federal law.

Specific policy actions in the DPL were drawn from the Municipal Government’s Multiyear
Plan, which in turn was developed through a consultative process and enjoyed widespread
popular support. Interest in RBM and MTEF, and better management of the capital budget
reflected a general recognition of the need to improve public sector efficiency, especially in
preparation for the World Cup and Olympics. Finally, the Bank was at the same time supporting
complementary reforms at the State level, and the municipal DPL was coordinated with the State
of Rio de Janeiro Fiscal Sustainability, Human Development and Competitiveness DPL.

Soundness of background analysis

The DPL built on strong analytical foundations, with contributions from the Municipal
Government, World Bank and other sources, including:

       Studies undertaken specifically for the DPL on fiscal sustainability, public sector
        management and procurement, debt restructuring, social security, and a Poverty and
        Social Impact Analysis.



                                               9
 
             Technical studies on taxation and revenue collection, and fiscal projections prepared by
              the Municipal Finance Secretariat (SMF).
             Experience of other states on Results Based Management and partnerships with
              nongovernmental organizations to manage provision of public services.
             Doing Business indicators and studies from the SMF, McKinsey and Company, and
              various national organizations on the business environment, infrastructure, the regulatory
              environment and PPPs.
             Analysis by the municipal education secretariat (SME) in partnership with the Ayrton
              Senna foundation on remedial literacy training, and the Escolas do Amanhã and
              integrated early childhood development programs.

Assessment of the operation’s design

The operation was jointly requested by the Municipal and Federal Governments and was
complemented by other initiatives, especially a Rio de Janeiro State DPL. Thus, it enjoyed strong
support from all levels of government. Policy areas were central to the Municipal Government’s
strategic vision and budget law that in turn had been prepared through a participatory and
consultative process. In addition to a solid political commitment, the design incorporated lessons
from extensive experience of lending at the State and Federal levels and took advantage of the
Municipality’s strong institutional and technical capacity. The two tranche structure allowed a
more sustained commitment by the Bank while clarifying expectations about required policy
actions and the timing of disbursements. The alternative of a programmatic series was deemed
unsuitable because of higher transactions costs and uncertainty stemming from both the
Government’s and the Bank’s complicated fiduciary requirements for subnational loans.2

The DPL was designed as the focal point of an integrated program of support. It was packaged
together with two additional Technical Assistance (TA) operations3 to reinforce the objectives of
improving service delivery in health and education, strengthening public sector management, and
establishing an institutional framework for PPPs. These operations facilitated an extensive and
ongoing dialogue which formed part of the DPL’s supervision.

Relevance of the risks identified

Various plausible risks were identified and the overall level of risk was assessed as moderate to
substantial. Potential problems were anticipated from:



                                                            
2
  Under the Fiscal Responsibility Law, the Government required a rigorous process of reviews and approvals at the
Federal level, while the Bank needed to grant an OP/BP 8.60 waiver in addition to the normal process of preparation
and Board approval.

  Rio de Janeiro Strengthening Public Sector Management Technical Assistance Project (P127245) and Rio de
Janeiro Fee-based Analytical and Advisory Services (P126815).


                                                               10
 
         Institutional constraints on a new and inexperienced government’s ability to implement
          and manage change.
         Capacity limitations in coping with the complexities of PPPs, or designing and
          overseeing reforms at the same time as preparing for the Olympics.
         Political risks, including those stemming from State and Federal elections which might
          change the political environment.

In fact, none of these risks materialized. However, one area where problems occurred was in
pension reform. It was thought that resistance to the parametric reforms would be contained
because they applied only to new hires and therefore would not be opposed by an organized
constituency. Nevertheless, though the legislation was presented to the Municipal Chamber it has
not yet been passed and remains the subject of a legal challenge (see fn. 9).

2.3 M&E Design, Implementation and Utilization

Design: The results framework comprised 13 indicators which were generally well selected and
provided adequate coverage. However, including an indicator pertaining to investment spending
would have been useful in tracking progress toward the program objectives, as would have been
indicators to capture the quality and efficiency of health service provision. The health sector
indicator in the results framework – percentage of the population covered by family health care –
is a measure of access to family health care, which is only one aspect of the objective.

In addition, baseline data were incorrect for two indicators. The 2009 pension plan deficit was
R$22 billion rather than R$36 billion as given in the PD; and the initial rate of stock losses in the
health service was 4.9 percent rather than 20 percent.

Implementation: The Secretary of Finance had overall responsibility for M&E, with support
from the office of the chief of staff (Casa Civil) and a Project Implementation Committee
comprising officials from agencies directly involved with DPL-supported reforms. M&E was
carried out in a satisfactory and timely manner, and results were shared with the Bank.

Utilization: The M&E framework was used directly to provide evidence on satisfaction of the
second tranche release conditions. Beyond that, attention to measuring outcomes stimulated
further awareness and appreciation of the importance of M&E for the Government’s reform
strategy more generally, especially with regard to implementing Results Based Management and
monitoring public service delivery in health and education. Support for development of M&E
capacity and managing for results at a subnational level are elements of the Country Partnership
Strategy.

    2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation

A follow-up operation, the Rio de Janeiro Strengthening Public Sector Management Technical
Assistance Project (P127245), was prepared in 2011-12, during the DPL’s active phase. The

                                                 11
 
PDO is: “to support institutional capacity strengthening in the Municipality of Rio de Janeiro to
enhance public service delivery, including in health, education and environmental management.”
Following recent Board approval, the project is expected to become effective in early 2014 and
run until 2018.

Policy areas substantially overlap with the DPL though coverage is not identical. 4 Specific
elements of the project pertinent to the DPL include: (a) Improving revenue forecasting and
analysis of fiscal risks, and institutionalizing MTEF; (b) Building project selection and appraisal
capacity to strengthen public investment management; (c) Enhancing the collection and use of
electronic medical records and patient referral data to improve system-wide resource allocation
and cost effectiveness in the health service; (d) Strengthening testing and monitoring, and
evidence based policy making in education, especially for early childhood development
programs. In addition to such specific components, the TA focuses on cross-cutting themes of
M&E, results based management, and IT investment, all of which will increase the efficacy of
the DPL reforms.

3. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES
 
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Relevance of objectives: The objectives and program areas remain central to the Bank’s current
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS, FY 2012-15) whose objectives include strengthening fiscal
management, improving the efficiency of public investment, and pursuing innovative approaches
to Government programs and service delivery, especially in health and education. Creation of
fiscal space in itself is less prominent, reflecting the extent of success already achieved.
However, other program areas from the DPL by and large retain their importance. Some of the
more relevant entries in the CPS results matrix include:

              Fiscal space: Strengthening tax administration and compliance, fiscal control systems,
               and debt management.
              Public sector efficiency: Improving budget management, through MTEF and RBM,
               better HR management, and PPPs.
              Innovative service delivery: Raising the quality and coverage of early childhood
               development, especially for low income households; improving learning outcomes and
               completion rates in primary and secondary education; expanding access to quality
               primary health care

In terms of overall strategy, the CPS continues to emphasize engagement with sub-national
Governments to facilitate learning and policy coordination, especially to develop innovative
approaches that can be replicated. Thus, it is notable that various initiatives from the Rio
Municipal DPL in areas such as early childhood development programs and teacher evaluation
                                                            
4
    The TA includes components on social governance, security and environmental management.

                                                               12
 
appear in operations planned for other states and municipalities. The reverse was also true as the
Rio Municipal DPL was being prepared.

Relevance of objectives: High
Relevance of design: The policy measures were central to the Government’s reform priorities
and were in areas where the Bank was well positioned to contribute expertise and knowledge
services. Prior actions and tranche release conditions were clearly delineated with an evident
rationale. In terms of overall structure, the operation featured a compact and elegant synergy
between the creation and use of fiscal space.

Relevance of design: High

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

The PDO refers to the creation of fiscal space, promotion of investment, and improvement of
public sector performance. To assess the achievement of objectives, it is useful to break the
statement into four components5:

The objective of the proposed operation is to…

      i.       …assist the municipality of Rio de Janeiro in creating fiscal space…
     ii.       …which will be used for investments…
    iii.       …to improve the quality and efficiency of public service delivery, especially in poor
               areas, through innovative programs in health, education, and private sector development.
    iv.        Other investments will strengthen the institutional framework for efficient service
               delivery through the implementation of a medium term expenditure framework, results-
               based management with the public sector, and PPPs with the private sector.


Measured in terms of the results, the operation was very successful. Of the 13 results indicators,
12 fully succeeded in achieving their targets, most by wide margins, and one partially succeeded.
A few aspects of the PDO were not adequately captured by the indicators, but results there also
appear to have been highly satisfactory.

       (i) Assist the municipality of Rio de Janeiro in creating fiscal space: Four subcomponents
       were designed to contribute to fiscal space: a) Improvements in tax administration; b) Better

                                                            
5
  This breakdown of the PDO splits the first pillar into twin objectives of creating fiscal space and increasing
investment. Since this was a DPL, resources did not directly finance investment expenditure. Resources supported
the development of policy reforms which would create an enabling environment to provide a much needed boost to
investment. The PD and the Government’s Letter of Development Policy (LDP) stressed that investment had
contributed disproportionately to fiscal consolidation since the Fiscal Responsibility Law. As a result, they saw an
imperative need to increase spending on physical and human capital in order to close the infrastructure deficit and
lay the foundations for faster growth

                                                               13
 
       control of personnel expenses; c) Reduction in the pension plan deficit; d) Debt restructuring
       utilizing proceeds of the DPL.
        
           a) Tax administration: The Nota Fiscal Electrônica was implemented (a first tranche prior
              action) and factored into buoyant ISS tax collections in 2011-12, with real growth
              averaging 10 percent. The authorities estimate the NFE contributed 6 percent of the
              increase or R$ 686 million, exceeding the DPL target of 4 percent.6 Measures to increase
              recovery of tax arrears (the PPI - Incentive Payment Program) were passed in 2012,
              mainly comprising amnesty against fines and penalties, and yielded a one-time inflow of
              R$972 million in 2013. Finally, user charges for public lighting, established by Law No.
              5132 of December 21, 2009, have been collected by the electric utility and transferred to
              the municipality, raising R$580 million to date. Fully achieved.

           b) Reduction in the pension plan deficit: Law 5.300, passed in 2011, incorporated a number
              of recapitalization measures to eliminate the actuarial deficit on the pension plan, which
              the authorities estimated at R$22 billion.7 First, the Municipality committed to pay a 35
              percent supplementary contribution on the wages of current employees for a period of
              35 years, with a NPV of R$18 billion.

                Second, various assets were transferred to the pension plan: (1) Oil and gas royalties
                accruing to the municipality over the period 2015-59, with an expected NPV of R$2.5
                billion. (2) Real estate valued at R$1.2 billion, which had previously been managed
                jointly with, but not owned by, the pension plan.8 (3) Amortization on mortgage loans
                offered as part of the benefit plans for current employees of the municipality with a NPV
                of R$0.5 billion.

                In addition to recapitalization, parametric reforms were proposed to reduce benefits to
                new hires, which would also bring Rio into compliance with Federal laws. A draft law
                on parametric reforms (41.2010) was submitted to the Municipal Chamber in 2010. So
                far, however, it has not been passed and its prospects are uncertain. As a result, no
                savings from parametric reforms have been realized.9
                                                            
6
   ISS revenue collection was modeled statistically and the impact of the NFE inferred from the difference between
predicted and actual outcomes. See SMF technical note, Nota Carioca: Impactos Financeiros Diretos Após 3 anos
de Implantação. http://www.rio.rj.gov.br/documents/91253/fd448404-6250-41ec-9fc3-f98480e17cb1
7
   The PD gives the shortfall as R$36 billion. Different actuarial assumptions likely explain the discrepancy between
the two estimates. 
8
   Technically, these assets belonged to a municipal corporation in which current employees were the beneficial
owners, and were managed by PREVIRIO, which also manages the pension plan. Thus, in effect, this measure
increases employee contributions.
9
   The Municipal Government has not fully implemented, the federally mandated pension reforms laid out in
Constitutional Amendment 41 of 2003, arguing that it has funded its pension plan with its own revenues, a position
upheld by the Brazilian courts. While the Government remains committed to the parametric reforms, it prefers a
consensual approach and has sought the acquiescence of civil servants to the changes. An attempt to “fast track” the

                                                               14
 
                Despite some risks – primarily concerning oil and gas prices and changes to revenue
                sharing arrangements which could affect revenue from royalties – these actions have put
                the pension plan on a sound basis. However, two facts should be noted. First, the
                parametric reforms have not been completed. Second, the net impact on fiscal space is
                relatively small because most of the resolution transfers assets already on the
                Municipality’s books and therefore has no net impact on the consolidated accounts.
                Partially achieved.

         c) Personnel expenses. The Government decreed a 30 percent reduction in commissioned
            employment and cuts to benefits in early 2009 (a first tranche milestone), sharply
            slowing wage growth that year. Subsequently an external audit of the payroll was carried
            out (a second tranche milestone), though relatively few problems were found which may
            not be surprising as similar audits had been done in the recent past. As a result, growth
            in personnel costs slowed in both real and nominal terms (Table 2). The average 2.8
            percent slowdown in nominal growth translates into a cumulative saving of R$0.7
            billion on the municipal wage bill over the DPL period. Fully achieved.

                                                          Table 2 – Municipal wage bill growth
                                                                          Annual average, percent
                                                                                        2005-08                    2009-12

                                                       Source: SMF

         d) Debt restructuring: Debt restructuring – meaning paying down Rio’s debt to the National
            Treasury with proceeds of the DPL10 – had a twofold impact on the municipal finances.
            (1) On the first US$1.045 billion, the saving was equal to the difference between terms
            on the debt to the Treasury and the Bank; (2) prepayment of over 20 percent of the
            outstanding debt reduced the interest charges on the remaining balance by 3 percentage
            points. The combined effect has been almost a halving of debt service costs and a saving
            of R$951 million to date.11 Fully achieved.

         To summarize, from 2010 through the first half of 2013 measures under this pillar created
         R$3.9 billion of fiscal space – around 7.7 percent of Net Current Revenue or 43.6 percent of
         investment spending over the period (see Table 3). Around a quarter of the total came from
         using the proceeds of the DPL to prepay Rio’s loan to the National Treasury, the rest from

                                                                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                               
reforms through the legislative process raised suspicions and may be partly responsible for the subsequent delay as
the Government has tried to improve communication with stakeholders.
10
   The DPL money was disbursed directly to the National Treasury and used in its entirety to pay down Rio’s debt.
11
   As a percentage of net current revenues, debt service costs have been reduced from 10.5 percent in 2008 to 5.4
percent in 2012, exceeding the 2 percentage point increase that was anticipated.

                                                                                            15
 
         tax measures and slower growth of personnel costs. Three results indicators were associated
         with this pillar, two of which were fully achieved (increase in ISS tax collections and
         slowing the growth of the wage bill), and one was partially achieved (reduction in the
         pension plan deficit through recapitalization and parametric reforms). Considering the
         overall outcome, a satisfactory rating is justified.

 …which will be used for investments…

       There are no indicators in the results framework pertaining to investment. However,
       Government data show that municipal public sector investment surged in 2009-12, rising
       from R$400 million to R$3.3 billion, or from 3.7 percent to 15.9 percent of total expenditure
       (see Table 4). Education and health accounted for R$341 million of the increase, which
       included investment geared toward improving public service delivery and supported by the
       DPL through policy measures (day care facilities, schools and family health clinics). The
       bulk of the investment has been on transportation systems, mainly four Bus Rapid Transit
       routes, which will enhance Rio’s long run growth potential, as well as some upgrading of
       infrastructure (wastewater, roads) in the favelas. The investment is expected to benefit low
       income, more remote neighborhoods by improving labor market access, though the entire
       population of the city will benefit from reduced road congestion.

       Meanwhile, PPPs added a further R$1.1 billion to public investment. The investment cycle is
       expected to continue for several more years before tapering off. It is important to note that
       virtually none of the increase in investment is related to preparation for the World Cup or
       Olympics, though some demands on the city’s capital budget are anticipated over the next
       two years.

 (iii) …to improve the quality and efficiency of public service delivery, especially in poor
  areas, through innovative programs in health, education, and private sector
  development.

       Health: Since 2009, the government has carried out a major restructuring and expansion of
       health care provision based on integrated networks of family and urgent care clinics. Group
       practice Family Health Centers (FHCs) have been established to serve mainly low income
       populations without access to private health insurance. Each center houses a number of
       Family Health Teams and provides access to a comprehensive range of primary care services,
       including prenatal and pediatric, dental, and radiology (X-rays and ultrasound) services along
       with exercise facilities and a pharmacy dispensing commonly prescribed drugs. Community
       outreach and educational programs focus on preventive care. Patients with more advanced
       needs may be referred to other centers for specialty care. Urgent care centers operating 24/7
       provide emergency services. The networks are financed jointly by the Federal and Municipal
       Governments and all services are provided free of charge. A rapid buildup since 2009 has
       established 71 FHCs with 825 Family Health Teams, all managed by private, non-profit
       Social Organizations which are subject to close monitoring by the Municipal Health
       Secretariat.

       Implementation is not yet complete – some neighborhoods have not yet been reached and
       there are long waits for some specialty treatments, but access to health care services has
       expanded impressively from 6 percent of the population in 2009 to 40 percent currently,

       almost entirely low income populations.14 This greatly exceeds the DPL target of 12 percent
       and the plan is to reach 70 percent in the next year or two. Meanwhile, service quality
       indicators such as immunization rates, availability of physicians, community outreach and
       emergency wait times have also registered gains, while the percentage of unnecessary
       hospital admissions has fallen, pointing to greater efficiency. Health service efficiency and
       effectiveness is one of the areas to be addressed in the follow up TA Project (see Section
       2.4)15. In a recent survey, a remarkable 92 percent of patients expressed satisfaction with the
       service (Table 5). Fully achieved

       Education: Wide-ranging reforms have been implemented to improve overall educational
       effectiveness and learning outcomes, which include increasing classroom time, strengthening
       monitoring and evaluation of student performance, expanding programs for teacher training
       and mentoring, and promoting community engagement, especially in the 152 innovative,
       Escolas do Amanhã (Schools of Tomorrow). DPL policy actions aimed at specific factors
       affecting learning outcomes, especially in low-income, dangerous neighborhoods, and
       remedial efforts to reduce the backlog of older students performing below grade level in
       reading and math. Four results indicators focused on keeping students in school and
       improving their performance. Despite some technical difficulties, the indicators point to
       highly successful outcomes:

   Coverage is defined in terms of access to a primary care provider. Family Health Teams serve an average of 3,450
people, hence 2.8 million persons are covered by the 825 FHTs.
15
   The TAL (P127245) will also support evaluations of primary health care reforms, with a view to further improve
their design. The findings of the evaluation will be used to support decisions in respect to the continued roll-out and
adjustments of the primary health care delivery model

   The ICSAB (Indice de condições sensíveis à atenção básica) is a key indicator used by the Municipal Secretariat
of Health to evaluate the quality of the primary care system. The indicator measures the proportion of hospital
admissions for conditions that should be effectively managed/ treated at the primary care level.

                                                                            18
 
             Annual reduction in student within year and between-year dropout rates and annual
              improvement in IDEB/IDE-Rio 20 for Escolas do Amanhã from 2009 baseline. Student
              dropout rates were reduced from 3.6 percent in 2009 to 2.1 percent in 2012, while
              Escolas do Amanhã improved their reading performance scores on IDEB/IDE-Rio
              between 2009 and 2012 for all grades (see Table 6). Fully achieved.
             Annual expansion in enrollments in ECD centers and preschools targeted to low income
              communities from 29,921 (crèches) and 77,845 (pré-escolas) in 2009 baseline by 3,000
              new openings a year. In 2012, 47,906 children were attending public crèches representing
              an annual increase of nearly 6,000 places, while an additional 16,430 children were
              attending semi-public crèches (conveniadas). Space in these facilities is limited and
              children are selected through a lottery which takes socio-economic status into
              consideration. Most or all of the new places have been allocated to children from low
              income families (mostly Bolsa Familia recipients). Measuring the increase in preschool
              attendance is problematic because of a change in the eligible age range. In 2009, pre-
              school programs covered children aged 4-6, but since 2010, 6 year olds have enrolled in
              first grade. Dropping the second indicator and evaluating the outcome based on ECD
              enrollment alone, the outcome is assessed as fully achieved.
             The share of municipal Grade 2 students meeting national reading proficiency standards
              on Provinha Brasil rises by at least 1 percentage point annually from 73 percent in 2009.
              Due to issues with the Provinha Brasil, Rio has substituted its own reading proficiency
              indicator, the Alfabetiza Rio, which has been developed rigorously and is thought to be
              more suitable. The Provinha Brasil implicitly reflects a standard that children should
              achieve literacy by the end of second grade, while Rio Municipality's own standard is that
              children should achieve literacy by the end of first grade. In addition, a change in the test
              design between 2010 and 2011 makes it difficult to compare results over the DPL
              implementation period. Assessing the outcome using the Alfabetiza Rio shows that there
              has been annual progress since the baseline year, 2010. The percentage of children tested
              with an adequate level of reading skills at the end of grade 1 improved from 80 percent in
              2010 to 82 percent in 2011 and 90 percent in 2012 (Table 6). Fully achieved.
             The share of children more than two years behind grade level at grade 8 or 9 (atrasados)
              decreases by at least 1 percentage point annually from 14.3 percent in 2009. Two data
              series are available for this indicator. Neither one reproduces the 14.3 percent baseline
              figure in the results framework. 21 Table 6 shows a somewhat irregular pattern of
              decreasing shares due to termination of the automatic promotion system (Progressão
              Continuada) in 2009, which impacted repetition rates and consequently the number of

   IDEB (Índice de Desenvolvimento da Educação Básica) and IDE-Rio (Indice de Desenvolvimento da Educação –
Rio) are respectively national and municipal indices of education outcomes.
21
    At the time of appraisal, the SME's initial data from school census reports in late 2009 was that the share of
"atrasados" was 14.3%. Over the past two years, the SME has worked with the Federal Ministry of Education to
review and refine its data on age-grade distortion. As a result, the SME has now published the time series in table 6.

                                                               19

               each year from 2010 as the result of the set of DPL supported policies introduced by the
               SME to reduce age-grade distortion. 23 Fully achieved.

              Business licensing and registration: The burden of starting a business has been eased by
               allowing online license applications and simplifying bureaucratic requirements, including
               through Rio’s Alvará Já program specially tailored to businesses with low environmental
               and sanitation impacts. Participation in the state-run REGIN system has integrated
               business registration procedures at the municipal, state and federal levels. As a result, in
               September 2013 98.2 percent of licenses for firms with low environmental and sanitation
               impacts were made within 3 days. The municipality receives around 525 queries per day
               on the web, a 310 percent increase from 2010 and grants an average of 105 licenses, a
               500 percent increase. Fully achieved.

 In summary, the Government implemented extensive reforms in all three program areas and fully
 achieved all results targets, most by a wide margin.

 Outcome rating: Highly satisfactory

  (iv) Other investments will strengthen the institutional framework for efficient service
  delivery through the implementation of a medium term expenditure framework, results-
  based management with the public sector, and PPPs with the private sector.

    Progressão Continuada is a program in Brazil’s public education system that allows for automatic promotion
 between school years irrespective of performance to reduce discouragement from repetition and prevent high
 dropout rates.
 23
    Those policies include: i) beginning of the school year reinforcement classes for students not quite on grade level;
 ii) after school tutoring for students falling behind during the year, so as to avoid repetition at the end of the year; iii)
 accelerated learning classes to help "atrasados" catch up with their peers; and iv) a school bonus program which
 incentivizes schools to lower repetition at the same time as they seek to increase student learning.

    Unlike IDE Rio, IDEB is computed only in odd years. Both indices range on a scale from 0 to 10.

                                                                          20
  
             Results Based Management: RBM was launched with a small pilot involving a few
              schools in 2009. In 2010 the first Results Agreements were signed, providing significant
              incentives – up to four times (monthly) base salary – for managers achieving exceptional
              performance. Since then the program has been extended to all but one city agency and
              covers over 80 percent of the Municipality’s 110,000 workers.25 Targets are set in an
              open and consultative fashion and managers who feel they have not been given budgetary
              and other resources needed to achieve the results can request a review by the mayor’s
              office. Both targets and results are published on the web and are externally audited to
              ensure transparency, for instance, to discourage setting targets at too easy a level in order
              to ensure a bonus will be paid. After some initial suspicion and skepticism the program
              has gained acceptance and anecdotal evidence suggests possible early signs of a change
              in the culture of the civil service. The DPL’s target of 16 Results Agreements signed in
              2010 has been substantially exceeded. Fully achieved.

             Medium Term Expenditure Framework: Since 2011, draft MTEF budget documents
              covering 80-90 percent of expenditure have been prepared in parallel to the traditional
              budget process and published on the Municipality’s web site. They describe policies and
              programs, indicate planned investments and recurrent expenditures, and estimate fiscal
              risks for a rolling four year period. Traditionally, forecasts of current revenue have been
              quite accurate. However, forecasting expenditure and capital revenue, mainly comprising
              transfers from the Federal Government, has been more difficult. The TA Loan will
              support efforts to strengthen performance in these areas. While the MTEF is not fully
              operational, the steps that have been taken represent important progress and a move up
              the learning curve, hence are considered as meeting the target of implementing the first
              steps of a 3-5 year MTEF. Fully achieved.

             Public Private Partnerships: Using existing federal law for PPPs, the city has created a
              PPP Council, defined project criteria and created a guarantee fund for PPPs,
              strengthening the institutional capacity to design and manage PPP projects. The
              Municipal Guarantee Fund was set up in accord with the DPL’s prior action for the first
              tranche, though the municipality has adopted a different approach of providing private
              partners with additional real estate assets sufficient to guarantee an adequate return. As of
              June 2013, five projects at a total value of R$15 billion were under implementation, four
              of them prepared by the PPP Unit, in sanitation, transport (light rail and road), and
              Olympic park facilities. Fully achieved.

             Procurement reform: In 2009 a centralized, electronic auction system was introduced for
              standardized purchases utilizing the Federal Government portal and subsequently 716
                                                            
25
   The exception is COMLURB, which provides sanitation services and collects garbage, because of special
circumstances, but is expected to be brought in to the scheme shortly.

                                                               21
 
              auctions have been held. Small and medium enterprises are eligible to bid on contracts up
              to R$80,000, and the more open bidding process also potentially spreads benefits to local
              economies and entrepreneurs across the country. The Municipal Secretariat of
              Administration estimates average savings of 39 percent in the first half of 2013.
              Complementing the procurement reforms, new stock management procedures piloted in
              the health system have reduced losses from 4.9 percent in 2006-09 to 0.01 percent in
              2012.26 Fully achieved.

Outcome rating: Highly Satisfactory

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

The operation was highly relevant to the Municipal Government’s reform program and
simultaneously supported the Federal Government’s objectives of fiscal consolidation and policy
coordination. From the Bank’s standpoint, it was aligned with the Country Partnership Strategy
objectives of poverty reduction, private sector development and fiscal consolidation, and it was
consistent with the Country Partnership Strategy’s approach of working with subnational
governments. The design was highly relevant, with program areas and policy actions supportive
of the program development objectives. Implementation was satisfactory with no delays in
completing prior actions and tranche release conditions.

The achievement of objectives in three of the four components of the PDO was highly
satisfactory, while the remaining one, creation of fiscal space, was satisfactory. Even there, the
bottom line fully met expectations in terms of fiscal space created, since the shortcoming –
parametric pension reform – had only a limited impact on the accomplishment of the program
objectives, in the short term.27 The operation contributed to many aspects of the Government’s
program – institutional, technical, financial and social – and has had some broader impact within
Brazil and across the region.28 Overall, the outcome is rated as highly satisfactory.

Overall outcome rating: Highly Satisfactory

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty impacts, gender impacts and social development

A preliminary Poverty and Social Impact Assessment (PSIA) during preparation anticipated that
DPL supported elements of the Government’s program would have significant beneficial
                                                            
26
   The baseline of 4.9 percent is far below the 20 percent figure in the PD. Authorities could not explain the
discrepancy, but thought the 20 percent figure was implausibly large.
27
   Parametric reforms supported applied only to new public servants.
28
   Rio’s Escolas do Amanhã, the first program of its kind in Brazil, has inspired the development of similar
programs. One such example is the Escuela amiga program in Lima’s high conflict areas, which directly adapted
elements of the Escolas do Amanhã. Specific structural aspects of Rio’s health care delivery model (the inbuilt
incentive mechanism and the technical monitoring system) have also inspired other sub-national governments within
Brazil.

                                                               22
 
impacts. Building on the PSIA’s analysis, a more precise look at how the policies were actually
implemented suggests strongly that the overall impacts were pro-poor.

       Education: Poverty is closely correlated with poor educational outcomes which limit
        economic mobility and perpetuate low socio-economic achievement. Education measures
        supported by the DPL aimed specifically at breaking this cycle. Early childhood
        development is a robust predictor of later academic success and the 18,000 additional
        places in crèches were almost entirely reserved for low income families. The Escolas do
        Amanhã program focusing on the 150 worst performing schools in dangerous and violent
        neighborhoods, and remedial programs for older children performing behind grade level
        also specifically targeted low income populations. Measured improvements in learning
        outcomes and declining attrition rates almost certainly predominantly reflect gains in
        these communities. It takes a generation for education to impact on socio-economic
        outcomes, but maintaining these initiatives, as the Government appears committed to
        doing, should contribute to narrowing the gap in socio-economic outcomes.

       Health: As with education, health outcomes too are strongly correlated with poverty. The
        city’s wealthier residents typically purchase private health insurance and are well served
        by private health providers, while in poorer areas access to primary care had been limited
        or non-existent. Family Health Centers are located in previously underserved, low
        income areas and exclusively serve their immediate neighborhoods. Pre-natal, infant and
        youth programs ensure attention to women’s and children’s health needs, while
        community outreach encourages wider use of the services. Penetration remains low in
        some of the more remote areas in the Western Zone of the city, but for the 40 percent of
        the population now covered, acceptance of the new management model and a patient
        satisfaction rating of 92 percent in an early 2012 survey (see Table 5, above) attests to the
        program’s success.

       Private Sector Development: Poverty and social impacts of easier business licensing and
        registration are less clear cut, but DPL supported reforms have likely been a factor in the
        three-fold rise in the rate of business registration. Shifting activity out of the informal
        sector and creating formal sector employment with better wages and working conditions
        should benefit low income households, especially in conjunction with investments in
        public transport to increase access to those better jobs. More generally, improving the
        business climate, where Rio has lagged other regions, leads to faster private sector
        growth, stronger labor markets and declining poverty.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

Institutional development explicitly or implicitly underpinned reforms in many of the DPL’s
program areas. With regard to the third pillar on public sector management, the PDO refers

                                                 23
 
directly to strengthening the institutional framework. For PPPs, the DPL together with associated
TA sponsored an intensive workshop, prepared manuals and provided a resident advisor leading
to development of an institutional framework and establishment of a functioning, operational
PPP Unit. Institutional development is inherent in moving to MTEF, which comprises a
framework for aligning resource allocation to policy priorities, and incorporating future
implications of current spending into the budget process. Results Based Management may be the
most far reaching institutional reform of all and, anecdotally, has begun to impact on the culture
of the civil service.

Under the service delivery pillar, a massive expansion of health service provision entailed the
development of an extensive network of clinics under the management of Social Organizations,
as well as setting up IT systems for electronic medical record keeping and online referrals. In
education, reforms included major attention to M&E, teacher training and incentives, and
community engagement in low performing, dangerous schools. All three service delivery
components featured IT investment, and the forthcoming TA project intends to develop further
data management and analytical capacities for evidence based policymaking.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

The operation was the first ever DPL to a municipality and required a waiver of OP/BP 8.60.
The operation triggered a substantive revision of Bank-wide DPL policy and in 2011, the Board
agreed to amend OP/BP 8.60 and allow DPOs with any political subdivisions having the
budgetary and legislative authority to enter into an agreement with the Bank. Waivers are
therefore no longer needed. Subsequently, one more Brazilian municipal DPL has been approved
– the Belo Horizonte Municipal DPL (P126749) – and one more is under preparation. The
instrument is particularly suited to Brazil because the Federal Government is interested in having
the Bank engage directly with cities and the constitutional and legislative framework grants them
substantial autonomy. However, there is considerable potential elsewhere as well.

4. ASSESSMENT OF RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

While there are risks to the development outcome, overall they appear to be low.

   Brazil’s current slowdown implies macroeconomic and fiscal risks that might lead the
    Government to relax its fiscal controls. Current indicators are well within FRL limits and
    there is space to ease back on fiscal consolidation, for instance in areas such as HR
    management. Nevertheless, preparations for the World Cup and Olympics are likely to
    insulate Rio de Janeiro from national trends until 2016. At least in the medium term this risk
    appears low.
   Recent unrest indicates possible policy risks. Public opinion in Brazil has been volatile and
    resistance to the reforms could build rapidly, causing implementation to slow. So far protests
    have not been directed against DPL supported reforms. The Government remains popular

                                               24
 
    and a moderate level of resistance might even serve as an incentive to accelerate the pace.
    The risk here is low to moderate.
   The PD anticipated operational risks for a relatively new and inexperienced city
    administration in managing its reform program and eliciting cooperation from civil servants
    and political risks due to opposition from entrenched political interests. However, successful
    implementation of the program and strong support from the electorate for a second mandate
    in the 2012 municipal election suggests such risks are negligible.
   Institutional capacity may be lacking in some areas, though so far the municipality appears to
    have coped well with the complex challenges of preparing for the Olympics, managing PPPs
    and introducing large scale reforms in health and education. The recently launched Rio TA
    project further mitigates this risk.

Rating: Low

5. ASSESSMENT OF BANK AND BORROWER PERFORMANCE
 
5.1 Bank performance

Quality at entry:

There is no doubt that this was a well-conceived and designed operation, that responded
effectively to a joint request from the Municipal and Federal authorities. Both the objectives and
policy areas were clear and highly relevant to the Government’s reform strategy and the Bank’s
CPS and built on substantial analytical foundations. Although this was the first municipal DPO
in Brazil (and indeed in the world), it incorporated ideas and lessons from previous operations
with various State Governments. Concurrent preparation and implementation of Rio Municipal
and State DPLs facilitated policy coordination at the two levels and avoided duplication in areas
where there were overlapping jurisdictions.

At the same time, a few aspects of the operation might have been strengthened. First, a more
thorough due diligence could have ascertained whether there was an adequate consensus for
parametric pension reforms. Elsewhere, the results framework should have been broadened to
include indicators in a few areas that were relevant to the project objectives. Specifically, there
were no indicators to cover the important aspects of public sector service quality and efficiency,
and investment. In addition, there were a few discrepancies in baseline figures, though most of
these can be explained.

Rating: Satisfactory

Quality of supervision:

Supervision was given close attention because of both the size of the loan and the innovative
aspect of municipal lending. Careful monitoring of results indicators contributed to assessing

                                                25
 
fulfillment of second tranche release conditions and ISRs were regularly prepared and filed. No
problems were encountered that required management attention, though in the case of pension
reform where implementation slipped, the Bank responded proactively by arranging a mission
for a pension specialist to intensify the dialogue about the Government’s approach to
recapitalization and parametric reforms.

In addition, two Technical Assistance projects coordinated closely with the DPL and contributed
to supervision. The first, a Reimbursable Advisory Service (RAS) project on PPPs enabled the
Bank to collaborate closely with the authorities on all aspects of PPP management from setting
up the institutional framework to building operational capacity for project preparation, bidding
and oversight, and contingent liability management. The second, a TA Loan on Strengthening
Public Sector Performance, contributed to supervision of most of the remaining elements of the
DPL while it was under preparation in 2011-13, including health, education, public investment
management, MTEF and RBM, and procurement. A series of preparation and appraisal missions
maintained a close policy dialogue with the authorities about progress on the DPL program and
the need for additional follow up.

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

Bank performance rating: Satisfactory

5.2 Borrower Performance

The Government’s performance was Satisfactory, exhibiting strong political leadership and a
high level of commitment during preparation and implementation. Without this leadership the
operation could not have succeeded to the extent it did, especially in the more innovative and
challenging components such as Results Based Management and the rollout of the new health
care model. Required actions were satisfied in a timely and exemplary manner, and the loan
disbursed fully without any delays. Apart from parametric pension reform, expected outcomes
were achieved in all policy areas and results indicators met or exceeded their targets. Without the
pension setback, the Government’s performance would easily have been rated Highly
Satisfactory.

Implementing Agency performance was Highly Satisfactory. The Secretariat of Finance had
overall responsibility with support from the office of the chief of staff. A Project Implementation
Committee comprised of officials from agencies directly affected by the reforms was in charge
of program surveillance and M&E. Officials and agencies overseeing the implementation
demonstrated commitment, as well as the technical and institutional capacity to manage the
complex and demanding program. Communication with Bank staff was excellent.

Borrower performance rating: Satisfactory



                                                26
 
6. LESSONS LEARNED
 
The operation reinforces a number of well-known lessons:

       Strong and effective political leadership is essential: The Government’s ownership and
        commitment, backed up by institutional capacity, were critical factors in the DPL’s
        success. In no small measure, the DPL achieved its objectives because it was aligned to
        the priorities of the Government’s reform strategy.
       Political economy matters: The experience with pension reform is a reminder of the need
        for realistic expectations where policymakers may not be able to control the political
        economy. Stiff resistance from civil servants who represent a powerful political bloc
        made it difficult to reconcile the Government’s consensual approach with pushing
        through controversial reforms in the DPL’s time frame. The Bank should be cautious
        about backing reforms where the consensus is inadequate.
       Flexibility opens up new possibilities: The Bank is at its best when it is flexible and
        responsive and willing to adapt to clients’ needs, especially with middle income
        countries. What began as an experiment with municipal lending that required a waiver
        quickly led to a change in policy and may in time develop into an important new line in
        the Bank’s portfolio.

In addition, there are some less familiar lessons concerning subnational lending, where there is
substantial growth potential:

       Political alignment lowers risk and improves effectiveness: Along with the Municipal
        Government’s commitment, political alignment and shared vision at all levels of
        government – Federal, State, and Municipal – reduced risks and contributed to the
        successful outcome. The operation garnered political support by addressing issues of
        mutual interest in such areas as fiscal consolidation, health, education and public sector
        management.
       Interventions targeted at the right level can be highly effective: Direct collaboration at
        the municipal level was a fruitful strategy for both the Bank and the Brazilian authorities.
        Local governments in Brazil are responsible for managing education, health and other
        social services, and the Bank’s resources and technical know-how were especially
        valuable at the Municipal level. Smaller scale projects can generate useful demonstration
        effects and attribution may be easier than at a national level, enhancing the credibility of
        the Bank’s policy advice.
       Projects should seek to exploit externalities from knowledge sharing: As a long-time
        partner, the Bank has become an important repository of Brazil’s development
        experience and many of the DPL’s policy areas made use of prior or concurrent work in
        other Brazilian jurisdictions. Knowledge sharing was a major element of the DPL’s value
        added in such areas as Results Based Management which borrowed from Minas Gerais


                                                27
 
    State, and the use of Social Organizations to manage health service delivery which had
    been pioneered in Sao Paulo. In health and education, where jurisdictions overlap at the
    State and Municipal levels, the Bank’s concurrent engagement in a State DPL was also
    helpful. The Bank even acted as a knowledge broker more generally for South-South
    exchanges, as it put the Government of Peru – itself dealing with the problem of schools
    in violent and troubled neighborhoods – in touch with Rio about the Escolas do Amanhã
    program.

Annex 2. Summary of Borrower's ICR
 

The Development Policy Loan for the Municipality of Rio de Janeiro (MRJ) was the basis of a
successful program which, with financial and technical support from the World Bank, achieved
various public policy objectives including reforms in the municipal public administration. These
goals rested on three pillars: (1) creating fiscal space for investment; (2) improving the quality of
public service delivery, especially for the poorer population of the city, through the
implementation of innovative programs in the areas of health and education and assisting new
entrepreneurs located in the city; and (3) municipal public management. The following are the
main results achieved.

Pillar 1: Creating Fiscal Space for Investments

The implementation of the Electronic Tax Invoices System (Nota Carioca) played a key role in
creating fiscal space for municipal investment. A report by the Municipal Finance Secretariat,
published on its official website, indicates that the financial yield arising from the introduction of
the Nota Carioca was substantial - R$686 million - representing an increase of 6% of the total
collection of the Tax on Services (ISS) between July 2010 and June 2013, and exceeding the end
target of 4% set in the Loan Agreement. Note that these gains represent a permanent change in
the level of ISS collection.

As for the pensions system, we achieved a reduction in the actuarial deficit of the municipal
pension fund (FUNRPEVI) from R$22 billion (at current values) recorded in 2009 to R$650
million in December 2012, due to the implementation of the FUNPREVI capitalization plan
approved by the Municipal Chamber (Law 5.300/2011).

Regarding expenditures reduction, Net Personnel Expenditure (referring only to the Executive)
represented 40.69 % of Net Current Revenue in 2012, well below the limit set by Brazil´s Fiscal
Responsibility Law (54%) and the percentage of NCR recorded in December 2008 (48.69%).

Pillar 2: Innovation in Public Services Delivery

In the health care area, family health care coverage expanded from 6% of the total population
served to 34.63% at the end of 2011, nearly three times higher than the target established in the
Loan Agreement (12% in December 2011). By August 2013, family health coverage had reached
39.14% of the city´s population. All the results indicators for the education sector were also
achieved or exceeded, such as that which provided for an annual increase of 3,000 enrollments in
public crèches and pre-schools, from the 2009 baseline. Between 2009 and 2013 an average of




                                                 31
 
4,000 new places per year were created in the crèches and pre-schools. Also worth noting is the
reduced dropout rate in the Escolas do Amanhã scheme29, from 5.1% in 2009 to 3.75% in 2012.

With regard to improving the environment for opening new business ventures in Rio de Janeiro,
the average time taken in 2009 to obtain a municipal operating license for business activities
with low environmental impact was 20 days. Currently, 95.2% of these applications are dealt
with in up to 3 working days.

Pillar 3: Municipal Public Management

Given the great challenges facing Rio de Janeiro in 2009, we envisaged attracting private
partners. This has since become a strategic goal, especially with regard to expanding the delivery
of public services and revitalizing specific urban areas of the city. The establishment of the
institutional framework for the creation of public-private partnerships began with the approval by
the City Chamber, in December 2009, of the law setting up the Municipal Program for Public-
Private Partnerships (PROPAR–RIO), and its Management Council. Subsequently, in April
2011, a PPP Unit was created in the city, now called the Sub-Secretariat for Strategic Projects
and Public Services Concessions and Public-Private Partnerships (CVL/SUBPPP).

The basic sanitation concession in the west of the city, signed in January 2012, is the largest of
its kind in Brazil. A number of other PPPs and concessions are also important: (i) the concession
to build the Ligação Transolímpica, an express transit corridor that will connect Barra da Tijuca
to Diodorus, two of the main centers for the 2016 Olympics; (ii) the PPP signed in 2012 for the
construction of the Olympic Park over an area of 1.2 million m2, where 14 Olympic and 9
Paralympic events will take place; and (iii) the concession signed in 2013 for the construction of
the Light Rail System (Veículo Leve sobre Trilhos) which will run 28 km from the downtown
and port areas of the city.

With technical assistance support from the World Bank (Fee Based Service), the City
Government has prepared manuals aimed at standardizing procedures and working methods with
a view to facilitating liaison between the various agencies and entities involved in the
concessions and PPP processes, as well as for strengthening the relationship between the MRJ
authorities and the private sector. These manuals are now being used in new projects being
developed by CVL/SUBPPP.

In 2009, the 2009-2012 Strategic Plan of the Municipality of Rio de Janeiro was launched. To
ensure good monitoring of this Plan, performance contracts were negotiated across municipal
                                                            
29
    Created in 2009, the Escolas do Amanhã program aims to reduce absenteeism in the schools and improve the
performance of students living in problematic areas of the city. It aims to attract 105,000 students in 151 school
facilities in 10 “pacified” communities. The Program provides full-time education, learning support, sporting
activities, science laboratories, and classes in healthcare, reading and computer technology.

agencies and entities. These are a management tool now employed by the public administration
to: (i) ensure greater commitment from all municipal agencies to achieving the outcomes desired
by the City Government; (ii) institutionalize a new culture that prioritizes planning with clear
goals; (iii) foster participation by public employees with the use of a meritocratic model for
appraising and rewarding high achievers; and (iv) anticipate problems and find solutions through
formal results monitoring. For 2013, 43 official municipal agencies and entities have signed
contracts with the Mayor of Rio de Janeiro, embracing 196 goals and involving around 83% of
all municipal employees. The Strategic Plan was revised in 2012, setting targets for the period
2013-2016.

Finally, we should mention the benefits accruing to the management of municipal finances
generated by the transfer of US$1.045 billion of funds from the World Bank to the MRJ.

The funds were released in two tranches. The first tranche (US$545 million), released in August
2010, allowed the reduction of the interest rate charged by the Federal Treasury on the 1999
municipal debt refinancing agreement from 9% to 7.5% above the IGP-DI. The second release of
funds (US$500 million), in November 2011, led to a second reduction in the costs of the
refinanced debt, down to IGP-DI (General Price Index –Domestic Availability) inflation rate
plus 6%.

The following graph illustrates the improvement of the MRJ´s debt profile, to which the loan
agreement signed with the World Bank made an outstanding contribution. It can be seen that in
the years leading up to 2010, the city expended around 13% of its Net Real Revenue (NRR) and
10% of its Net Current Revenue (NCR) on servicing its financial debt burden. The two
descending curves of the graph reflect the sharp fall in 2011 of NRR and NCR to 8% and 6%
respectively, stabilizing at under 10% of NRR and 8% of NCR in the following years up to 2029,
by when the debt swap with the Federal Treasury will have completely matured, thereby leading
to a further major reduction in the city´s annual debt repayments.

The Municipal Finance Secretariat estimates savings of up to US$2 billion in debt expenses, due
both to the fall in interest rates charged by Federal Government (from 9% to 6% above IGP-DI),
and to the longer maturity period (from 2029 to 2040) of the portion of the debt with the Federal
Treasury which was amortized thanks to World Bank funding. By September 2013 we had
already recorded a reduction of debt expenses amounting to R$ 1.013 billion.

It is clear that there was a healthy trade off in the allocation of municipal resources between the
beginning and end of the period of government analyzed, given that in 2009 approximately 68%
of expenditures were related to disbursements committed to personnel, social charges and debt
service, leaving 31.6% to be used for spending (priority) and investment (residual). In 2012, the
reductions in personnel expenditures and municipal debt largely allowed an expansion of public
investment, accounting for the significant 15.9% share of total spending, and leading to the
aggregated "investments plus expenses" element to emerge as representing the largest share of
the MRJ´s spending allocation. Since 2011, the MRJ has enjoyed the highest investment rate of
all the main (State and Municipal) governments, as shown in the tables below.

This prudent fiscal management by the Municipality of Rio de Janeiro has been acknowledged
with the award of "investment grade" to the MRJ by the world´s three major risk rating agencies
(Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings). Note that the City of Rio de Janeiro is the only
entity of the Brazilian Federation to be honored with the same rating as the Federal Government
by all the major agencies.

In short, we consider that the DPL has achieved enormous success in the Municipality of
Rio de Janeiro, based on the fact that the current Administration has greatly expanded its
fiscal space for investments, directed resources to the most deprived areas of the city and
successfully implemented modern public management tools.
