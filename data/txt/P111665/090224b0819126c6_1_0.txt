                         The objective of the operation is to assist the municipality of Rio de Janeiro in creating fiscal space which will be used for investments to improve the quality and
                         efficiency of public service delivery, especially in poor areas, through innovative programs in health, education and private sector development. Other investments will
                         strengthen the institutional framework for efficient service delivery through the implementation of a medium term expenditures framework, results-based management
                         with the public sector, and PPPs with the private sector.
