                         Program Development Objective (from Program Document)

                         The objective of the operation is to assist the municipality of Rio de Janeiro in creating fiscal space which will be used for investments to improve the quality and
                         efficiency of public service delivery, especially in poor areas, through innovative programs in health, education and private sector development. Other investments will
                         strengthen the institutional framework for efficient service delivery through the implementation of a medium term expenditures framework, results-based management
                         with the public sector, and PPPs with the private sector.

                         The DPL is fully disbursed and is scheduled to close end June 2013. Implementation of the reforms supported by the DPL has progressed satisfactorily and most indicators have not
                         only been met but have exceeded the end target goals. The DPL has been successful in achieving its objective of creating fiscal space to expand public investment through the
                         implementation of fiscal adjustment measures: improvements in revenue collection, rationalization of personnel expenditures and debt restructuring. Going forward, maintaining
                         momentum with the reforms will be important to ensure sustainability of the results. For example, advancing the pension reform agenda through parametric reforms will be important
                         to consolidate the gains made in creating fiscal space. The Technical Assistance Loan approved by the Board on 14 June 2013 will help strengthen innovations adopted and support
                         their medium term implementation.
