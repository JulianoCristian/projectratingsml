                         The objective of the operation is to assist the municipality of Rio de Janeiro in creating fiscal space which will be used for investments to improve the quality
                         and efficiency of public service delivery, especially in poor areas, through innovative programs in health, education and private sector development. Other
                         investments will strengthen the institutional framework for efficient service delivery through the implementation of a medium term expenditures framework,
                         results-based management with the public sector, and PPPs with the private sector.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The team was pleased to note that the implementation of the reforms supported in the DPL is progressing in many areas. Indeed, the second tranche conditions have already been
                         fulfilled in areas such as education, health, fiscal and debt management (Nota Fiscal Eletrônica, Sistema de Inteligência Fiscal and cash management), and results agreements.
                         Thus, for the above policy measures, the only action needed from the Municipality is to send to the Bank the respective documentary evidence.

                         However, the pace of implementation has been slower for the second tranche disbursement actions in other areas and will require close monitoring.
