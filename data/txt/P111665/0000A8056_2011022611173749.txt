                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Municipality of Rio de Janeiro has made significant progress in the implementation of reforms supported by the DPL. In particular, the municipality has made significant
                         progress in the implementation of health and education reforms, as well as in public sector management in result based management where all the outcome indicators were very
                         satisfactory. The pension legislation has been submitted to the assembly but later withdrawn and is waiting to be resubmitted. A mid-term evaluation was conducted and published in
                         August 2010. The annual evaluation regarding 2010 targets has not yet been concluded.The municipality has also made some progress in the implementation of its PPP program and
                         already has some formal elements of a Medium Term Expenditure Framework present in its budget process. Those represent the main elements of the conditions to be supported
                         under the second tranche of the loan. The team is working with the municipality to make these initial steps more effective, as well as to institutionalize a clear decision process at both
                         the technical and political levels and be consistent with the second tranche disbursement conditions.
