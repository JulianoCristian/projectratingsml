To\n            achieve these objectives, the project will finance\n            investments for: (a) population to: (i) strengthen the\n            national family planning program, (ii) promote the status of\n            women; (iii) sensitize youth on family welfare issues; and\n            (iv) strengthen institutional capacity to promote the\n            national population program; and (b) health to: (i) develop\n            the district health system, including the promotion of\n            community health organizations; (ii) promote the use and\n            availability of essential drugs; and (iii) strengthen\n            institutional capacity in the health sector, with emphasis\n            on manpower development, and budgeting and financial\n            planning. The project will involve the adoption and\n            implementation of key policy measures in both the population\n            and health sectors including: (i) liberalization of\n            regulations on contraceptive distribution and use; (ii)\n            adoption of organizational norms for the district health\n            system; and (iii) promotion of essential drugs."}, "docdt": "1991-03-12T00:00:00Z"}
