Some lessons learned included: the\n            project indicates that reforms can be started and\n            generalized under an investment operation without\n            conditionality's and budget support, given government\n            commitment and good project design. Significant lessons for\n            future project work and policy reform can be learned from\n            studies and surveys funded under an investment operation.\n            This speeds up preparation and appraisal of the next sector\n            credit and enhances the policy dialogue during the\n            implementation of that investment operation. Weakness in\n            project design, with no conditions of effectiveness\n            requiring early arrangements for procurement plans and\n            implementation procedures make subsequent implementation\n            difficult despite earlier appearances of consensus on key\n            collaborative elements. A well-tailored role for\n            Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) under government\n            contract can prove very effective and may be both less\n            expensive and more participatory than direct government implantation."}, "docdt": "1997-09-30T09:51:04Z"}
