The project will support: (a) the strengthening\n            of the Integrated Textbook Project to operate as a permanent\n            organization to plan and manage textbook development\n            activities; (b) the strengthening of the Center for\n            Curriculum Development to develop improved curricula for\n            primary and secondary schools; and (c) the improvement of a\n            national distribution system for all textbooks for primary\n            and secondary schools. Specifically the project will develop\n            or revise about 110 book titles, and deliver a total of 82\n            million textbooks in mathematics, science and the English\n            language. Over 30 million primary and secondary level pupils\n            will benefit from the improved textbooks."}, "docdt": "1982-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
