1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Steady growth and development characterized the Indonesian economy
during the past decade, with GNP increasing at an annual rate of almost 8%.
Contributing factors were the emphasis on basic infrastructure investment
during Repelita I (1969-73), the easing of the foreign exchange constraint
through Repelita II (1974-78) with the quadrupling of oil prices, and, to a
smaller extent, the growing contribution of industry to GDP. The Govern-
ment's concern with social goals and satisfying basic needs is reflected
irn a quadrupling of the numbers of health centers and construction of more
than 30,000 schools.
1.02      Indonesia, with a GNP per capita of only US$430 in 1980, remains a
poor country, characterized by underinvestment in human capital. This
uniderinvestment is reflected in almost 30 million illiterates aged 15 and
over who comprise a large portion of the unemployed and underemployed.
Simultaneously, there are acute shortages of middle- and high-level skilled
manpower, particularly in the scientific, technical and managerial fields,
which constrain the country's development. The shortages are due to two major
weaknesses of the educational system: (a) low internal efficiency; and
(b) low scholastic achievements. Within the system there is a need for
greater planning, implementation and supervision capabilities, together with
increased focus on curriculum development, production of learning materials
and teacher training.
1.03      Availability of better textbooks is recognized as one of the most
important preconditions for raising scholastic achievements and efficiency
in education: "... the availability of books appears to be the single most
consistently positive school factor in predicting academic achievement."/l
Current textbook projects in Indonesia, one of which is financed under Credit
387-IND, have been successful in engendering an impressive book production
program. During the last decade, over 300 million books were printed. Des-
pite these achievements, the quantity of textbooks delivered has been insuffi-
cient. Further, poor design has prevented books from being as effective as
they should be in raising learning achievements. These shortcomings are
attributable to inadequate institutional structures for the development and
provision of textbooks. Quality books can only be produced when there is an
institutional structure comprising professional publishing skills; such a
capability ensures adherence to production cycles and continuity in textbook
programs. The short physical life of books, even under ideal conditions, and
a curriculum that should respond to shifts in technology and culture,
necessitate continuing development activities.

1.04      This project seeks to:  (a) establish and develop a permanent
institution, to be designated the Integrated Textbook Project (ITP), staffed
with technical and managerial personnel capable of carrying out the integra-
ted activities of textbook development, production and distribution; and (b)
produce and distribute about 82 million textbooks and teachers' guides in
mathematics, science and English for primary and secondary schools. Fur-
ther, to improve the linkage between curriculum and manuscript development,
the existing Center for Curriculum Development (CCD) would be strength-
ened. The Center is part of the Office of Educational and Cultural Research
and Development (BP3K) in the Ministry of Education and Culture. The pro-
ject would represent a fundamental contribution towards improving teaching-
learning methods and raising learning achievements in Indonesian primary and
secondary education. In conjunction with efforts underway to improve
teacher training, it reflects a consistent and integrated sector strategy
for addressing the structural weaknesses of basic education in Indonesia.
The proposed loan would include Bank financing of US$25 million, chiefly for
printing procurement, a building for the ITP/CCD, the central paper ware-
house, professional architectural services for all project buildings includ-
ing distribution facilities, and technical assistance. The proposed loan is
an important link in the Government's long-term strategy for raising educa-
tional achievements and improving equity in access to basic education.
2. TEXTBOOK DEVELOPMENT
Overview
2.01      By the beginning of the Third Five-Year Development Plan, 1980/81,
Indonesia had achieved an impressive enrollment ratio of 92% at the primary
school level, and ratios of 25% and 12% at the lower and upper secondary
school levels, respectively. Further, it had established the national
language, Bahasa Indonesia, as the medium of instruction at all levels.
During the 1970s, more than 300 million textbooks, teachers- manuals and
library books were provided for primary schools, and 65 million textbooks
were provided for secondary schools. These are considerable achievements.
Given the magnitude of the task involved in providing access to education to
about 25 million pupils, it is not surprising that inefficiencies remain in
the quality and effectiveness of schooling. Dropout and repeater rates are
high, and learning achievements in basic skills are low, particularly in
mathematics, science and English language. Textbooks, particularly in these
subjects, are inadequate in terms of quality of content, physical standards
and availability.  Insufficient professional staff, systems and procedures
for curriculum and manuscript development and textbook distribution
contribute to these deficiencies.

Pupil Achievements and Textbooks
2.02       Assessments of scholastic achievements for grades six and nine
were undertaken in 1975 and 1976 by BP3K. Achievements of grade six stu-
dents were lowest in science. For grade nine, scores were low in all of the
three subjects, science, mathematics and English. Achievements varied
widely between regions. Low achievement scores can be traced to a set of
interrelated factors, but are strongly related to schools located in iso-
lated areas, where instructional facilities, educational planning and
supervision, and inputs such as textbooks, are less common.  The assessments
suggest that use of prescribed textbooks in grades six and nine, at least in
the mid-1970s, was not effective in raising student achievements. These
results reflect an inappropriate book content. There is evidence that use
of books with appropriate content contributes significantly to higher learn-
ing achievements (para. 1.03). The assessment of grade nine achievements
also indicated that an adequate library with a supply of books for borrowing
by teachers and pupils, is strongly associated with achievements and stands
out as the most significant of examined school quality variables. This
"library services" variable is independent of home background factors, both
in rural and urban areas. This latter finding confirms that provision of
supplementary readers should be an integral component of an education
strategy to improve equity in the access to educational opportunity.
The Government"s Textbook Program
2.03      During the 1970s, the Government made remarkable progress in
printing and delivering textbooks. In the late 1960s, pupils largely relied
on copied notes. To avoid this situation, during Repelita I, (1969/70-
1973/74), 63 million books were delivered to primary schools, and 3 million
to secondary schools. During Repelita II (1974/75-1978/79) two large pro-
jects, the First Textbook Project (Credit 387-IND) and the INPRES Library
Project, developed and distributed 262 million primary level textbooks and
teachers' manuals (Table 2.1). However, the Government has concluded that
the critical error in the past has been to underestimate the complexity,
i.e., the skills and amount of time needed for curriculum development,
textbook writing, manufacturing, and distribution. Implementation of the
First Textbook Project suffered because of understaffing and lack of
managerial and technical know-how. Institutional weaknesses in curriculum
and manuscript development, and in procurement and distribution resulted in
deficiencies in content, physical standards and availability of books.

Curriculum and Manuscript Development
2.04      The Government has concluded that the content of books can be
improved through strengthened professional skills and procedures in the
development of curriculum and manuscripts. Presently, books give exclusive
priority to cognitive learning outcomes and little attention to affective
achievements, i.e., to stimulating motivation and attitudes towards learning,
which would improve cognitive achievements also. The texts do not take into
account the vocabulary progression of pupils. Layout and illustrations
could be more attractive and the latter could be better integrated with the
text. Finally, teacher manuals fail to give adequate support to teachers,
and teachers are confused by inconsistencies between text and curriculum.
2.05      Curriculum Development.  The CCD is charged with responsibilities
for curriculum development, but with only 15 professionals and inadequate
resource materials, it has not been able to provide the expertise and
continuity needed to carry out systematic curriculum development and to
ensure consistency between curriculum and textbooks. Under the project, the
strengthened Center will conduct intensive studies, make necessary
adjustments in the primary and secondary schools curricula, and develop
better teaching methods for different subject areas, to support textbook
development. Among the three subjects, science education would receive
special attention.
2.06      Manuscript Development.  In the textbook projects during the 1970s,
including the Bank-assisted First Textbook Project (Credit 387-IND), books
were produced by inexperienced staff who were unable to handle all the tasks



- 5 -
involved in textbook publishing. Managers and editors with experience in
publishing were not employed. Writers were employed on an ad hoc basis and
received inadequate supervision. Staff without specialized training had to
learn on the job, and assignments were temporary, thus preventing any buildup
of professionalism or institutional memory. Finally, the Ministry of
Education staff involved had little incentive since their tasks did not carry
any ministry career advancement.
2.07      Related to manuscript development were deficiencies of the past
system for testing textbooks. In particular: (a) sufficient priority was not
accorded to obtain a full involvement of teachers, writers and supervisors in
the revision process, hence writers visited distant teaching sites for
first-hand feedback only infrequently; (b) the objective of improving
prototype manuscripts became secondary to gathering data on how much pupils
learned from various units; and (c) in the instances where interviews with
teachers and pupils in classroom situations generated useful insights, book
production schedules were too tight to permit required revisions. In short,
while revisions improved manuscripts, the field testing contributed little to
improve quality of content. To improve the process of tryout, testing and
evaluation of manuscripts, it is necessary that: (a) writers visit teaching
sites and be properly compensated for necessary manuscript revisions; (b)
editors be professionals, hired full-time, and be charged with developing
manageable field-testing schemes; and (c) there be close coordination between
editors, manuscript writers, and curriculum specialists in developing and
revising manuscripts.
Procurement
2.08      The Government is concerned that inadequate quality control in the
procurement of paper and printing services has led to poor physical standards
of books. Paper quality has often been deficient in specifications,
including inadequate weight, strength, opacity and brightness. As a
consequence, paper has not always been suitable for textbooks and has been
unable to withstand handling by children over the planned physical life of
the books. Teachers, who are responsible for books, often refuse to give
them to pupils because they fear the books will disintegrate. While the
quality of body printing generally has been adequate, book covers at times
have been less well printed. Book edges are not always trimmed and pages are
out of line. At times, books (using 70 g paper) exceeded 96 pages and were
then too voluminous for the saddle wire stapling used. Perfect binding with
the pages cut into single sheets and glued together at the spine would have
been preferable. Further, despite printing contracts that specify rustless
staples, those used have often rusted.
2.09      Staff involved in the procurement of paper has not been suffi-
ciently trained and equipped to supervise bulk procurement and large con-
signments. Minimal control has been exercised beyond the public bidding
event. Paper was tested at Pusat Grafika Indonesia (PGI), but rarely before
as well as after shipments had arrived. Inventory control has been rudimen-
tary, relative to the volume and value of paper purchased. With improper



- 6 -
storage facilities, paper has been damaged. Lax enforcement of printing
contracts has permitted printers to subcontract to nonqualified firms.
Unauthorized printing or overprinting has also occurred. Inferior quality
of printing is often the result. Moreover, quality control from film
processing for offset printing through binding has been minimal.
Distribution System
2.10      Weaknesses in the distribution system have led to deficient and
delayed availability of books. Despite impressive quantitative performance
in textbook production in the mid-1970s, BP3K concluded in its national
assessment of learning achievements that books remain scarce in both
primary and secondary schools. In grade six, the proportion of pupils
without all the prescribed books in science, mathematics, social studies and
Bahasa Indonesia, ranged from 40% to more than 60%. Many pupils possessed
no books at all; for instance, the assessment suggests that 15% of the
students possessed no books in mathematics and 17% possessed no books in
Bahasa Indonesia. In grade nine, mathematics textbooks in particular were
in short supply. The assessment revealed that deficiencies in availability
were particularly common in rural schools. The Ministry of Education is
concerned that books often fail to arrive on time.
2.11      The distribution system for textbooks is not effective.  There is
a lack of storage facilities in the provinces and books are often damaged
and lost. The system for monitoring book distribution is also inadequate,
and record keeping needs to be improved and computerized. At present books
often arrive late and do nn^ always match local enrollments. Provincial
authorities are uncertain a-out which books are sent from Jakarta and their
arrival schedules. Finally, the promotion and information system is not
adequate. There is no programmed feedback from the field to ensure improved
availability of books. Teachers, parents and pupils are not fully informed
about the Government's free textbook program, and do not know what books to
expect or their time of arrival.
Government Strategy
2.12      Having resolved many of the problems in providing adequate numbers
of books to the school system, the Ministry of Education is now turning its
attention to resolving the deficiencies in the book content, physical
standards and availability to pupils.  To overcome these deficiencies, its
strategy emphasizes improvements in curriculum and manuscript development,
in procurement of paper and printing services, and in the distribution of
textbooks.  These improvements in turn are expected to help raise scholastic
achievements and the internal efficiency of primary and secondary schools.
The Ministry recognizes that this aim can only be accomplished through
continued investments over the longer term which would ensure the viability
of the institutions associated with textbook production.
2.13      To help upgrade the quality of textbooks the Ministry proposes to
strengthen the BP3K Center for Curriculum Development and link it more



-7-
closely to textbook development. The Ministry has established a textbook
development institution (ITP) to undertake all aspects of textbook produc-
tion, from writing through editing, design, testing and promotion to
delivery. To ensure an improved distribution system, the Ministry has
completed an extensive survey of the existing textbook distribution system.
2.14      The Ministry's textbook production program is impressive not merely
in terms of the quantity of books it intends to produce but also in terms of
the comprehensive efforts to upgrade the quality of books, to improve their
distribution to the schools and to strengthen the institutions associated
with textbook production. On the basis of school enrollment projections
(Table 2.2) during the five-year period, 1982/83 through 1986/87, the
Ministry plans to produce and deliver 470 million textbooks and teacher
guides for primary and secondary schools (Table 2.3). About 250 million, or
slightly more than 50% of these books, would be for the primary level. The
Government's program implies that Ministry of Education spending on textbooks
for primary and secondary education would increase from Rp 21 billion in
1979/80 (13% of the Ministry's development expenditure) to about Rp 80 billion
in 1984/85 (16% of the Ministry's development expenditure).
2.15      The Government's short-term aim is to provide prescribed textbooks
through Ministry of Education programs and to purchase a limited number of
supplementary readers and library books from private publishers. Over the
longer term, it intends to remove the constraints limiting the capacity of
the publishing industry to provide supplementary readers (para. 2.02). In
the early 1980s, although private publishers will still play a limited and
subordinate roLe in textbook publishing, they will continue to supply
library books or supplementary readers (Annex 2, para. 5). To support book
publishing, the Government intends to promulgate a domestic copyright law to
ensure that publishers and writers receive proper and fair compensation.
The Government also intends to reduce the differential between local and
world market price of book paper. For this reason, the Government is
supporting capacity expansion in selected paper mills and an improved
vertical integration to ensure lower production costs through increased use
of bleached pulp from local forest resources (Annex 2, para. 12). The
Government is also examining the feasibility of raising the industry's
competitiveness through other means (Annex 2, para. 15).
World Bank Assistance and Strategy
2.16      The Bank Group since 1970 has extended nine loans/credits totaling
nearly US$230 million to the education sector in Indonesia. The Bank Group's
investment program in education has pursued three main objectives: meeting
manpower requirements, improving quality and, more recently, increasing
equity. The First Textbook Project (Credit 387-IND of 1973), assisted by a
credit of US$13.5 million, was directed towards improving primary and
secondary education through provision of textbooks and in-service training.
The project was completed on schedule on December 31, 1981. The strengths
and weaknesses of this project have been discussed above (paras. 2.03 -
2.11). The proposed (tenth) project is a follow-up of the First

Textbook Project and aims at building up a permanent capacity for textbook
development. Together with the proposed second teacher training project,
it seeks to remedy the present weaknesses in school efficiency and raise
learning achievements in primary and secondary education. It would also
contribute towards greater equity in educational opportunity as textbooks
with an improved content will be distributed free to all pupils.
2.17      To date, two OED Project Performance Audit Reports have been pre-
pared on education projects in Indonesia. One (No. 2998, dated June 2, 1980,
SecM80-440), reviews performance on the First Education Project (Cr. 219-IND).
This audit stresses the importance of including fellowships to train teachers
and school administrators, and the timely appointment of key staff to project
implementation units to ensure the success of the project. To address these
findings, the proposed project provides for study tours and the early
appointment of key personnel. The second Project Performance Audit Report
(No. 3058, dated June 30, 1980, SecM80-527), reviews performance on the
Second Education Project (Cr. 288-IND), and describes the project as being
successfully implemented. The major audit finding of relevance is the need
for more advanced project preparation. The current project addresses this
issue, since it is based on extensive Ministry of Education studies in the
subsector and on the experience of Credit 387-IND.

3. THE PROJECT
General Description
3.01      The project would support the long-term aim of raising learning
achievements in primary and secondary education by assisting the Govern-
ment's textbook development program. It would build on the quantitative
achievements of the First Textbook Project and address the main issues
of deficiencies in content, physical standards and availability of textbooks
that have arisen. The project would assist in institution building in text-
book publishing, distribution, and curriculum development by: (a) strengthen-
ing the Integrated Textbook Project (ITP), so that it can operate as a
permanent organization with appropriate staff to plan and manage textbook
development activities; (b) introducing an improved national distribution
system for textbooks; (c) strengthening the Center for Curriculum Development
(CCD) to enable it to make necessary adjustments and improve teaching
methods in the primary and secondary schools curricula; (d) developing about
110 revised or new book manuscripts in mathematics, science and English for
primary and secondary schools; (e) printing and distributing 82 million
textbooks based on the manuscripts developed; (f) constructing and equipping
one office building, one central warehouse for paper storage, 37 warehouses
and 250 depots for the book distribution system; and (g) training staff and
providing consultant services.
3.02      The project would be implemented over a five and-a half-year
period, 1982-1987 (Annex 3). Physical facilities would be completed in four-
and-a-half years. Final payments on the last building work involved would
be made half a year later to cover the liability period for defects.
Initial paper procurement would be scheduled in 1982. Printing would begin
in 1982/83, and distribution in 1983/84. The closing date of the proposed
loan would be June 30, 1987.
Integrated Textbook Project (ITP) (US$4.0 million)
3.03      The ITP, as an entity under the Ministry of Education, has been
formally set up as of April 1, 1981. Its Director and Deputy Director have
been appointed, as well as some ten management staff, and ITP presently
occupies a leased building in Jakarta. The project would strengthen the ITP
so that it can operate as a permanent textbook publishing organization to
ensure improved content, physical standards and availability of textbooks.
The ITP would be responsible for management and quality control of all
textbook development activities, from initial planning of manuscript develop-
ment through writing, testing, revisions, printing and binding, to distri-
bution of books to schools. The project would finance the construction of
an office building, including furniture and equipment, staff training and
three man-yearsof consultant services for the ITP.  The ITP office building
would be shared with the strengthened Center for Curriculum Development.
The joint building, which would measure about 7,000 sq m, would be
constructed on the present site of Balai Pustaka, the publishing/printing
arm of the Ministry of Education.

Manuscript Development (US$4.3 million)
3.04      For new book titles, the normal development cycle would comprise
four years, the first year for planning and writing, the second year (one
school year) for testing and revisions, the third year for printing and
binding, and the fourth year for distribution. For revised titles, the
planning and writing year would be eliminated and the cycle would be reduced
to three years. Of the 112 book titles to be developed under the project,
34 would be new and 78 would be revisions (Table 3.1). A program of revis-
ing, testing and rewriting has already been initiated through contracts with
staff in teacher training colleges in Bandung and Yogyakarta, specializing
in science and mathematics education. Printing of revised titles would
begin in 1982/83; new titles initiated in 1981/82 would be printed in
1983/84.

3.05      The project would finance all costs related to manuscript writing
and preparation, including fees of writers, consultants and school supervi-
sors, travel, research and tryout (Annex 4). Tryout involves limited test-
ing, teaching a newly written unit or units in one or two classrooms,
whereas testing (para. 4.05) involves trying a prototype for a full school
year in a sample of schools. Agreement was reached with the Government
at negotiations that the loan would not be used to reproduce any textbook or
any part of any textbook without first obtaining the copyright.
Manufacturing (US$38.3 million)
3.06      Under the project, 82 million books in mathematics, science and
English language would be printed over the four-year period 1982/83-1985/86
(Table 3.2). In the first three years of the project, 76 million books
would be printed, representing 21% of the Ministry of Education's total
textbook production program in these years (Table 2.3). Over the project
period, the number of books printed would decline. This phasing is in line
with the Government's manuscript development program (Table 3.1) and with

3.07      Paper.  Book production under the project would require about
20,000 tons of paper. Paper for the project would meet specifications,
including the opacity and brightness requirements (94% and 73%, respectively,
at 62-70 grams); and cover material would be sufficient for books to endure
for at least three years. Paper would be tested at the Government's graphic
arts training center, Pusat Grafika Indonesia (PGI) both at the stage of
prequalification of supplying mills, and later as paper shipments are
received, and as books are distributed, stored and delivered. The ITP would
contract paper testing services from PGI, the equipment for which is financed
under the project. The paper would be purchased from local paper mills.
During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government that paper
specifications would be satisfactory to the Bank. It is understood that
representative samples of paper for textbook production under the project
would be tested and the results communicated to the Bank not later than June
30, 1982.
3.08      Printing.  Private printers and Balai Pustaka, the Ministry of
Education publisher/printer, would share in printing the project books. ITP
staff would manage the procurement of printing services. The MEC would not
permit overprinting of project books within one year after the completion of
the first printing of these books. Subcontracting of printing services
would require the explicit approval of the ITP. The annual prequalification
of all printers conducted by the Ministry of Education Secretary General's
Office, would be supplemented by periodic assessments by the ITP printing
procurement unit of printers eligible to participate in local competitive
bidding. Assessments would reflect printers' capacities and their perform-
mance related to staff skills. Printers who fail to meet required deadlines
and standards would be removed from the list of prequalified printers for
one year. The Government has indicated that procurement initially would be
limited to printers in the Greater Jakarta area so as to facilitate control
and supervision. The MEC intends to rely on printing by private firms to
the maximum extent practicable in procurement of printing services, with a
goal of about 40% of the total books to be printed by private firms over the
life of the project. About one-third of the total number of commercial
printers, with about 50% of total available capacity, is located in Jakarta.
Hence, a sufficient number of printers are available to ensure efficient
procurement and reasonable prices. It is expected that with the increased
capacity of the ITP procurement staff for control and supervision,
prequalification would be extended outside Jakarta.
3.09      In the first year of printing under the project, Balai Pustaka
would print about 5 million copies. In subsequent years, the number
of copies would increase in line with Balai Pustaka's printing capacity.
Balai Pustaka would also service the typesetting reprographic needs of the
ITP on a contract basis. During negotiations, agreement was reached with
the Government that it would carry out an evaluation, under terms of
reference satisfactory to the Bank, assessing how the quality and cost of
printing and paper procured for the project affect the longevity of book
use, and that a copy of this evaluation would be submitted to the Bank for
review and comment by December 31, 1984.



- 14 -
Distribution (US$27.5 million)
3.10      The project would strengthen the existing textbook distribution
system to ensure that schools receive sufficient books to match enrollments.
The distribution system would: (a) create a unified storage and distribution
system for all textbooks for the primary and secondary education levels
respectively; (b) increase the control and participation of provincial
education authorities in the planning and implementation of book deliveries;
and (c) include central storage of paper. There would be 37 warehouses
ranging in size from 60 to 1,500 sq m built in the provincial capitals, or,
if more appropriate, at the port nearest to the provincial capitals. About
250 book depots ranging in size from 50 to 250 sq m would be constructed.
Funding under the project would be provided to construct/improve the
warehouses and for adequate compensation for warehouse staff. Timely
delivery would be ensured through strengthened control in the procurement of
paper and printing services, and in the distribution of books.
3.11      Printers would be required to collect paper from these warehouses.
Bids for printing services under the project would exclude the cost of paper.
Construction in Jakarta of the central paper warehouse, measuring about
10,000 sq m, would be completed by mid-1984. Until then, paper would be
stored in existing government warehouses in Jakarta; when necessary,
additional storage space would be leased.
Monitoring and Evaluation (US$2.7 million)
3.12      Monitoring.  An improved monitoring system is required to ensure
realistic production and distribution schedules. Availability of books and
their use in schools would be monitored through sample surveys. Sample
data would include frequency of, and methods of, textbook use, and attitudes
of teachers, students and parents towards textbook use. Preparations for the
monitoring system would be initiated before June 1982 with the development
of survey instruments, and baseline data would be collected in the school
year 1983/84. The data base would include actual enrollments, numbers of
teachers by subdistrict and actual number and titles of textbooks and
teachers manuals printed and delivered to schools and teacher training
institutions. Information campaigns would encourage village community
groups to monitor availability and use of books in local schools. The
project would finance monitoring and information activities, including
honoraria, data collection and processing, transportation, and other related
costs.
3.13      Evaluation.  The evaluation would assess the project's impact on
improving the provision of books, and on teaching-learning processes which
would influence the quality of learning achievement. The evaluation would
consider several major aspects: (a) the quantity of manuscripts developed in
each year; (b) the relevance of the content of the manuscripts to the
curriculum; (c) the quality of the materials used including suitability and
cost effectiveness of various design approaches and the use of illustrations



- 15 -
and color; (d) the appropriate size of books; (e) the availability of the
books in schools; and (f) the quality of teaching-learning processes taking
place in the classrooms. Teachers- manuals would be evaluated for their
assistance to teachers in using the textbooks and for their relevance to
pre- and in-service teacher training programs. The evaluation of textbooks
would be closely integrated with the planned improved evaluation of teacher
training in the proposed second teacher training project. A preliminary
report would be submitted one school year after textbook distribution. All
evaluation activities, staff honoraria, transportation, sampling and data
analysis, etc., would be funded by the ITP. Teachers manuals would be
evaluated for their assistance to teachers in using the textbooks and for
their relevance to pre- and in-service teacher training programs. The
evaluation of textbooks would be closely integrated with the planned
improved evaluation of teacher training in the proposed second teacher
training project. A preliminary report would be submitted one school year
after textbook distribution. All evaluation activities, staff honoraria,
transportation, sampling and data analysis, etc., would be funded by the
ITP. (Evaluation of the project's managerial aspects is covered in para.
4.09.)
Center for Curriculum Development (CCD) (US$2.5 million)
3.14      Since an appropriate curriculum is a precondition for the devel-
opment of improved manuscripts with relevant content, the project would
strengthen the BP3K Center for Curriculum Development (CCD). The Center-s
program of activities supporting textbook development (i.e. part of the
Center) would become a subproject of the Second Textbook Project (ITP). The
Center, through the subproject, would have the following tasks: (a) conduct
evaluation of, and make necessary adjustments in, the curricula; (b) provide
support for establishing better linkages between curriculum and textbook
development; (c) conduct studies needed for the improvement of design, con-
tent, language, physical standards, and use of the textbooks. To support
the strengthened Center, the project would finance: (i) the construction of
the Center's new building shared with ITP; (ii) provision of office furni-
ture and equipment; and (iii) provision of training, consultant services,
studies and recruitment incentives. The 1975 curriculum, particularly in
science, would be examined for its relevance to present requirements in
Indonesia.
3.15      Studies.  To support the textbook development program, the
strengthened Center, through the subproject, would be responsible for the
following: (a) evaluation and adjustment of the existing curricula;
(b) basic studies on language abilities, cognitive development and book
design; (c) studies on teaching methods and equipment suitable for each
subject area; (d) studies on the use and appropriateness of existing
textbooks and the need for supplementary materials.

3.17      Textbook Unit Costs.  Primary level textbooks produced under the
project (typical book with 168 pages) on average would cost US$0.38 in
December 1981 prices for paper and printing, and US$0.58 when costs of
manuscript development, and distribution are included. For the secondary
level (modal book with 264 pages), the corresponding costs would be US$0.59
and US$0.80, respectively. These costs are based on recent experience with
manuscript development, paper costs, printing contract awards and internal
transportation rates. For comparison, the corresponding costs (December
1981 prices) of primary level textbooks developed by the First Textbook
Project averaged US$0.36 and US$0.39, respectively. The cost of a typical
secondary textbook produced by the Ministry and currently in use would
average about US$0.60. The difference in unit costs of books between the
first and the proposed second textbook projects reflects the emphasis in the
new project on improving the content and design of books, through improved
writing, supervised tryouts, field testing of manuscripts, printing in more
than one color and improved delivery.
3.18      Sites.  The joint ITP/CCD building would be located on a portion
of the old Balai Pustaka site, officially reserved for the purpose. No legal
itransfer of title is required. The site of the central paper warehouse has
also been obtained. A feasibility study has been conducted to provide the
data required on location, size, number and cost of warehouses and depots.
Local Public Works Departments and/or local technical teaching staff would
survey warehouse and depot sites at locations determined on the basis of the
feasibility study, and supervise warehouse and depot construction. During
negotiations, agreement was reached on a schedule of acquisition of sites
for provincial warehouses/depots.
3.19      Construction and Equipment.  The total base cost of hardware is
estimated at US$13.5 million and is distributed as follows: buildings,
including site development, US$11.3 million; furniture, US$0.9 million; and
equipment, US$1.4 million (Table 3.4). Construction cost estimates for the
proposed project draw on experience with previous Bank/IDA-financed education
projects in Indonesia, and reflect December 1981 unit building costs. Costs
per square meter of gross construction area are estimated to average about
US$330 for the joint ITP/CCD office building in Jakarta and range between
US$195 and US$250 for the warehouses and depots of the book distribution
system (dependent on locality). These costs are reasonable and in line with
Bappenas standards. The need for higher floor bearing capacities in storage
facilities and for the structures to withstand earth tremors has been taken
into account in the cost estimates. The estimated costs of equipment and
furniture needs are based on approximate quantities for program requirements
and December 1981 prices. Detailed lists of equipment and furniture needs
would be prepared simultaneously with building designs and major components.

3.20      Technical Assistance and Training Unit Costs and Contingencies.
Project cost estimates include contingency allowances for: (a) unforeseen
factors (physical contingencies) equivalent to 10% of the base cost; and
(b) price increases totaling US$24 million equivalent or 30% of the base
cost. Local price increases forecast are 14% and 12% for 1982 and 1983,
respectively, and 10% for subsequent years. Foreign price increases
forecast are 8.5% for 1982, 7.5% for 1983-85, and 6% for subsequent years.
Specialist services represents US$1.7 million and foreign fellowships
US$0.14 million (base cost). Foreign consultants unit costs, including
allowance for overhead, housing and travel averages US$9,400 per man-month
and the unit cost for a three-month foreign study tour averages US$5,800.
Man-month costs of local experts, including salaries and allowances, would
average US$1,300.
3.21      Project Financing.  The proposed Bank loan of US$25 million would
represent the foreign exchange component of the project cost, net of paper,
or 22% of total project cost (net of taxes).  The Government would provide
the remaining US$87 million (78% of total project cost).
Procurement
3.22      Of the total project cost of US$112 million equivalent, paper for
printing is estimated to account for about US$40 million equivalent (with
a base cost of US$28 million equivalent). This paper would be procured by
the Government under reserved procurement arrangements and would not, there-
fore, be eligible for financing under the Bank loan. Project viability
would not be impaired by the estimated US$12 million equivalent additional
cost of obtaining the paper by means of such reserved procurement arrange-
ments - (about 11% of the total estimated project cost).
3.23      Contracts for: (a) the construction of:  (i) the joint ITP/CCD
office building (base cost US$2.5 million equivalent); and (ii) the central
paper warehouse (US$2.4 million equivalent); and (b) the procurement of
(i) the ITP computer; (ii) CCD equipment (mainly for laboratories); (iii)
forklifts for the central paper warehouse; and (iv) paper testing equipment
(total base cost US$0.7 million), would be awarded on the basis of interna-
tional competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank Group guidelines.
In the comparison of bids for equipment, local manufacturers would be
allowed a preferential margin of 15% over the c.i.f. cost of equipment, or
the existing customs duty, whichever is lower. Prior Bank review of pro-
curement documentation and contract award recommendations would be required
for all construction and equipment packages presented for ICB.
3.24      Contracts for: (a) the construction of all other building works,
i.e. 287 regional textbook warehouses and depots; (b) all other equipment,
with the exception of library books; and (c) all furniture needs - would



- 20 -
be awarded on the basis of local competitive bidding under government
procedures acceptable to the Bank. Such bid packages would be too small to
attract foreign bidders. Library books would be purchased on the basis of
negotiated prices.
3.25      Textbook printing would be awarded on the basis of contracts with:
(a) private sector printers (for between 20% and 60% of total annual book
requirements) on the basis of local competitive bidding in accordance with
government procedures acceptable to the Bank; and (b) Balai Pustaka (for the
balance of annual book needs).  (The Government aims at awarding contracts
to private firms for about 40% of the total books to be printed over the
life of the project.) Contracts between MEC and Balai Pustaka would be
based on unit costs per book equivalent to the lowest competitive bid
received from a private printing firm during that fiscal year. Distribution
contracts with private firms would be awarded on the basis of local compe-
titive bidding in accordance with government procedures acceptable to the
Bank. Tender and contract documents in standard formats are being prepared
for printing and distribution procurement.
Disbursement
3.26      The proposed loan of US$25 million equivalent would be disbursed
over a period of five-and-a-half years, as shown in Table 3.5, to finance

22% of the estimated project cost and 100% of the estimated foreign exchange
component (net of paper cost; para. 3.23). The disbursement profile is more
compressed than the standard profiles for education projects in Indonesia,
for which lending was made earlier in the development cycle. In addition,
major disbursements against printing will occur within the first three years
of implementation.
3.27       Disbursements would be made as shown in the table below:

3.28      Project Accounts.  The Government would establish and maintain
project accounts for the ITP, and the Center for Curriculum Development.
These accounts will be audited by independent auditors, not later than six
months after the end of each fiscal year, until one year after the closing



- 22 -
date. The Government's accounting and auditing system will be analyzed in a
study to be undertaken by the State Financial Council. The study will be
financed under Credit 869-IND. The ITP would submit to the Bank quarterly
progress reports on project implementation and biannual reports on financial
status. The quarterly reports would specifically include detailed accounts
of completed and ongoing activities under manuscript development.
3.29      State of Project Preparation at Board Presentation.  The Director
and key staff of the ITP have been appointed, as has the Director of the
CCD. Staff for the CCD and additional professionals for the ITP are being
recruited. Development and testing of manuscripts is underway. The
feasibility study for textbook distribution was completed in May, 1981 and
schedules for manuscript development, book printing, book distribution and
foreign training have, subsequently, also been completed. A local
architectural firm has been selected to design: (a) the integrated ITP/CCD
building; (b) the central warehouse; and (c) standard modules for regional
warehouses and book depots in the distribution system. Sketch plans which
have been prepared for the ITP/CCD building are being revised in accordance
with MEC's needs and the revisions should be completed shortly after loan
approval. Sketch plans for the central warehouse and standard modules for
the regional warehouses and depots would be in an advanced stage of
preparation by loan approval. Lists of equipment needs would be completed
by the end of March 1982.
4. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
ITP
4.01      The ITP, under the MEC, would be responsible for project manage-
ment and implementation, and for liaison with the Bank. The ITP would
consult the Director of the Center for Curriculum Development on such
matters as building design and equipment lists for the Center. During the
first two or three years of project implementation, while construction is
ongoing, a project architect would be assigned to the ITP to assist with
civil works.
4.02      The ITP began operations in August 1981, with the appointment
of the first 25 full-time staff; it would become fully operational with a
staff of 150 professionals, to be appointed in accordance with an agreed
schedule (Annex 6). There would be three administrative units, and four
operational units under the Technical Director. The latter units represent
manuscript development, (writing, editing and try-outs), production (design,
typsetting, illustration and film making), procurement (paper, printing and
binding) and distribution (Organization Chart). The success of the ITP
would largely depend on its ability to attract and retain good staff. Dur-
ing negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government that: (a) ITP
professional staff would be appointed in accordance with an agreed schedule
and with functions and responsibilities of key staff acceptable to the Bank;
and (b) sufficient remuneration and/or incentives would be provided to hire

and retain qualified ITP professional staff. There are eight key staff: the
Director, the Technical Director, the Deputy Technical Director, the Assist-
ant Directors for Manuscript Development, Production, Procurement and Dis-
tribution, and the Chief Editor. During negotiations, agreement was reached
with the Government that a study would be completed by June 30, 1984: (a)
presenting an action plan satisfactory to the Bank, which plan the Government
would thereafter implement, to integrate ITP with Balai Pustaka, or to estab-
lish it as an independent entity under the Ministry of Education; and (b)
establishing the structural and functional relationship between ITP and CCD.
4.03      Manuscript Development.  The ITP would be responsible for manu-
script writing. Professional editorial advice and services in areas such as
textbook planning (viz. development of scope and sequence charts) writing,
testing, design, etc., would be provided to authors and writers by the ITP.
A professional content editor on the staff of the ITP would be assigned to
manage the development of each set of textbooks. The editor would select
writers and monitor the authors activities through the various control
points, reflecting the scope and sequence chart and the publication plan.
Author teams would generally consist of a curriculum expert, an experienced
teacher and a writer. Authors would generally not be staff of the ITP or
the Center for Curriculum Development. A book designer and a graphic artist
would cooperate closely with the editor and the author team.
4.04      Under the project, teacher guides would be written so as to pro-
vide teachers with sufficient instruction in the use of new books. The
guides would emphasize basic concepts and instruct teachers to avoid frag-
mentation of subject matter while providing sufficient flexibility to
present syllabi in line with student abilities. Writers, teacher trainers
and other specialists would be briefed by ITP manuscript development staff
on the effective use of the new textbooks in regular preservice and inser-
vice courses run by the Directorate for Primary and Secondary Education.
4.05      Testing and Revision.  In the second year of the textbook develop-
ment cycle, prototype books would be tested for one school year in a repre-
sentative sample of classrooms. The testing would be conducted in a sample
of nine schools in Jakarta and vicinity, designed to combine reasonable
accessibility with a representative range of schools in terms of quality and
pupils- socioeconomic, cultural and linguistic background. The testing
system would be improved through direct observation of the classroom learn-
ing situation which would permit immediate feedback from pupils and teachers
to editors and writers. The main instrument in testing would be the recor-
ded observations of teachers after each lesson unit as to the suitability of
prototype manuscripts. Visits would be required of authors and editors to
the test schools. Curricular validity, attractiveness of presentation,
adequacy of content for about 200 school days of the year, readability and
relevance to political, cultural and economic conditions would be ensured.
The testing would pay particular attention to teacher guides to ensure they
are effective in helping teachers use the books. Revision and continued
editing would start once significant field feedback from the testing is
available. Results of a readability study presently conducted by BP3K would
be utilized during the tryouts.



- 25 -
4.06      The field testing would be under the administration of the
Assistant Director for Manuscript Development of the ITP. A research
specialist, seconded from BP3K, would assist with sampling and assuring the
reliability of the testing. No other staff training would be required
except for guidance by the Center for Curriculum Development and BP3K staff;
the cost of testing is included under manuscript development. During
negotiations agreement was reached with the Government that testing of new
titles would be carried out during a full school year in a representative
sample of nine schools.
4.07      Distribution.  The focal point of control for the distribution of
both primary and secondary books, would be at the provincial (kanwil) level.
Staff in the warehouses/depots would be managed by the provincial education
authorities. Primary school books would be distributed through warehouses
and book depots at the provincial, kabupaten and kecamatan levels. Second-
ary school books would be shipped directly from provincial level warehouses
to schools. The warehouses and depots would have two functions. First, to
receive, store and dispatch books; and second, to provide a reserve stock to
cover unexpected wastage, and to offset shortfalls and transportation
damages. To facilitate handling, distribution and control, where feasible
printing contracts would be packaged by province. Under the supervision of
the ITP, private expeditors would pick up books from printers and deliver
them to designated warehouses and depots.
4.08      Monitoring.  The Deputy Technical Director would be in charge of
monitoring (Organization Chart). The ITP departments in charge of manuscript
development, production, procurement and distribution would be responsible
for the day-to-day progress of their various programs. The monitoring system
would cover the performance of writers and private contractors, especially
printers. Reasons for delays in book production and distribution and for
differences in actual against budgeted expenditure would be analyzed. Book
distribution would be monitored by education officers trained in distribution
at the kanwil and the kabupaten levels with the help of school supervisors.
The Deputy Technical Director, in cooperation with the Directorate for
Primary and Secondary Education, would establish methods and procedures to
improve reporting by education officers and supervisors throughout the
system. The Manuscript Development Department would also be responsible for
monitoring the use of books in schools.
4.09      Evaluation.  The Deputy Technical Director would be in charge of
evaluation. The process evaluation would include the ITP-s institutional
development, particularly staff training, local and overseas, in relation to
defined managerial and technical needs. This evaluation would assist the
ITP Director in project implementation. It would focus on decision-making
procedures, and ITP's relationship with Balai Pustaka and the Directorate
for Primary and Secondary Education (PDM), and the process leading to a
merger or integration with Balai Pustaka. Surveys would be used to
determine the capacity of provincial education officers and supervisors to
participate in evaluations of book availability and use. The Manuscript



- 26 -
Development Department will be in charge of the evaluation of new manu-
scripts under its regular tryout and testing activities.
Center for Curriculum Development
4.10      The Center for Curriculum Development would be expanded from 5
divisions to 11 divisions (Organization Chart). It would begin operations
in April 1982 with 35 full-time professional staff consisting of 20 existing
staff plus 15 new staff. By September 1983 it would have 65 professional
staff; by September 1984 it would have 105 professional staff. Towards the
end of the project period, 1986, it would have 140 professional staff, 55 of
whom would be directly involved in manuscript development. During negotia-
tions, agreement was reached with the Government that professional staff of
the Center would be appointed in accordance with an agreed schedule.
Coordinating Committee on Textbooks
4.11      The Coordinating Committee on Textbooks (CCT) would establish
long-term manuscript development priorities, review program implementation
and ensure synchronization between curriculum and textbook development for
ITP. Its Chairman would be the Minister of Education or his designate. Its
members would be, inter alia, representatives at the Directorate General
level (or their designates in the appropriate functional field) from the
BP3K, the Directorates of Primary and Secondary Education, Higher Education,
the Secretary General's Office, and the Directors of ITP.
Technical Assistance
4.12      The project would implement a program of training and consultant
services for staff of the ITP, the Center for Curriculum Development and
PGI. For ITP staff, foreign study tours and short- to medium-term on-the-job
training in appropriate institutions abroad would be complemented by in-
country training to be conducted largely at the PGI (Table 4.1). The project
includes: (a) 48 man-months of foreign study tours for ITP staff in publish-
ing; and (b) 6 man-months of foreign study tours for staff of the Center for
Curriculum Development in curriculum development and research. It is planned
that foreign consultant services would be used, according to availability
and type of expertise required, as follows: (a) ITP - 3 man-years in manu-
script development and information management (Table 4.2); (b) PGI - 3 man-
years in reprography, quality control and book production; and (c) CCD - 3.5
man-years for job specific studies and technical support for ongoing activi-
ties of curriculum development. The Government retains the option of using
local consultants according to availability of local expertise. Required
job descriptions and terms of reference for the consultants have been
prepared.

5. BENEFITS AND RISKS
5.01      The proposed project is an integral component of the government
education strategy which is supported also by the Bank's teacher training
projects. Over the longer term, it would raise learning achievements and
ensure more equitable distribution of educational opportunity through the
delivery of improved textbooks throughout Indonesia. It would build up the
institutions, professional skills and management capacity required to ensure
the availability of improved textbooks in priority subjects to primary and
secondary schools. Through its output of textbooks, it would meet about 22%
of total textbook needs in all subjects at the primary and secondary levels.
The project would prepare the base for further textbook improvements under
Repelita IV (1985-89).
Benefits
5.02      Institutional Development.  The central objective of the project
and essential justification for Bank financing, is to assist the Government
in institution building. This entails strengthening a Ministry of Education
capability for continuous textbook development, closely linked to a
strengthened curriculum development capability. By strengthening the BP3K
Center for Curriculum Development, the project textbooks would reflect the
adjusted content and sequence of the curriculum taking into account the
outcome of the various studies conducted by the Center. With more staff and
skills in curriculum development, continuity in development and testing
would be ensured. Curriculum would be better attuned to the progression of
child development, which would permit the writing of more relevant textbooks
in terms of content and volume. Teacher guides, reflecting the adjusted
curricula/syllabi and better textbooks, would assist in improving teaching-
learning practices.
5.03      Under the project, the ITP would be strengthened through the
appointment and training of key staff to initiate, coordinate, execute and
supervise the full complement of textbook publishing functions. Its
permanent staff would be responsible for realistic, coordinated planning and
implementation of the various activities: manuscript preparation, testing,
revision, production, manufacture, distribution and monitoring. Local staff
training in publishing and printing would be carried out by Pusat Grafika
Indonesia.
5.04      Improved Quality.  The project would improve the content and
relevance of textbooks in mathematics, science and English and raise
learning achievements of students over the longer term. Mathematics and
science subjects account for about 20% in the primary timetable and with a
primary school enrollment of 25 million, the benefits of improved textbooks
in these key subjects are substantial in terms of raised learning potential
and more effective use of pupil time. In the absence of a broadened
knowledge base in both primary and secondary education, institutions of
higher learning will be unable to produce the technical manpower necessary
tor economic development.



- 31 -
5.05      Equity.  The project would help improve equity in access to
education. By establishing strengthened regional distribution and monitoring
systems, it would ensure a timely and adequate supply of uniform textbooks
throughout the country. Achievements of pupils from lower income brackets
would improve because research indicates that textbooks have the greatest
impact on achievement levels of these pupils./l Moreover, with improved
delivery capacity and better physical design of books, pupils would not have
to buy alternative books, thus reducing the cost of access to education for
pupils from low income households. It is likely that school attendance would
be raised and there would be fewer dropouts.
Risks
5.06      The content of books would not improve if qualified professional
staff could not be hired by the ITP. Recognized risks are: (a) the diffi-
culty in attracting, motivating and training a sufficient number of qualified
persons to carry out the task of textbook development; and (b) ensuring the
establishment of an institutional framework which would permit the Government
to retain qualified staff into its textbook publishing program. These risks
are reduced since the ITP has already been established and management staff
appointed. Moreover, the Government is reviewing remuneration and incentives
required to hire and retain qualified staff. The project also includes a
program of training for ITP staff.
6. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During negotiations, agreements were reached with the Government
that:
(a)  the copyright would be obtained before reproduction of any
textbook (para. 3.05);
(b)  paper specifications would be satisfactory to the Bank
(para. 3.07);
(c)  an evaluation would be carried out to assess how the quality
and cost of printing and paper affect the longevity of book use,
and the results submitted to the Bank by December 31, 1984
(para. 3.09);
(d) professional staff of the ITP and the Center for Curriculum
Development would be appointed in accordance with accepted
/1 Schiefelbein and Farrell study of Chile quoted in Heyneman et al.
"Textbooks and Achievement:  What We Know."  Bank Staff Working Paper
No. 298.



- 32 -
schedules; functions and responsibilities of key ITP staff would
be acceptable to the Bank; and sufficient remuneration and/or
incentives would be provided to hire and retain qualified ITP
professional staff (paras. 4.02 and 4.10);
(e)  a study would be completed by June 30, 1984:  (i) presenting an
action plan satisfactory to the Bank, which plan the Government
would thereafter implement, to integrate ITP with Balai Pustaka,
or to establish it as an independent entity under the Ministry of
Education; and (ii) establishing the structural and functional
relationship between ITP and CCD (para. 4.02); and
(f)  testing and revision of new titles would be carried out during a
full school year in a representative sample of nine schools
(para. 4.06).
6.03      Subject to the above conditions, the proposed project constitutes a
suitable basis for a loan of US$25 million equivalent to the Republic of
Indonesia for a term of 20 years, including five years of grace.

INDONESIA
SECOND TEXTBOOK PROJECT
Development and Communications
Overview
1.        Indonesia's population is scattered unevenly over some 13,000
islands in a territory 3,200 miles long. Official statistics and projections
showed a population of 145 million in 1979, rising to an estimated 160 million
in 1986, and 176 million in 1991. Population density ranges from as few as 2
persons per sq km in Irian to as many as 625 persons per sq km in Java, Madura
and Bali. The literacy rate varies between urban and rural areas and between
males and females; the overall rate has, however, risen dramatically, from 10%
before independence, to 39% in 1965 and an estimated 62% at present. The
uneven distribution and the ethnic and socioeconomic diversity of the
population throughout the 27 provinces make it difficult to administer public
services, including education. Around 200 languages are spoken, although
Bahasa Indonesia, the national language, is increasingly understood throughout
the country. Local languages are the medium of instruction up to the third
grade. After third grade, the medium of instruction is Bahasa Indonesia.
Bahasa Indonesia is used for all school textbooks.
Communications
2.        In Indonesia, as in other developing countries, modern mass media
and traditional communication systems co-exist. The vast majority of the
population rely on traditional communication channels, where information is
gathered through village and community meetings. The use of modern mass
media, newspapers, radio and television, as well as books, is still limited
to the small urban elite. While newspaper consumption rose from 0.8 million
copies per day in 1971 to 2.0 million in 1977, in the latter year there was
still only one newspaper circulated for every 67 persons. This compares with
one newspaper for every 11 persons in Malaysia and for every 56 persons in the
Philippines. The low usage of written material reflects a cultural pattern
which emphasizes the spoken word as the medium of communication. Radio is the
preferred modern medium. In 1974/75, 2.1 million radio receivers were
registered. This represents one radio for every 60 persons; however, the
registration figures severely underreport radio ownership. Television as a
medium is not yet well extended due to the high cost of facilities and sets.
Over a four-year period, 1973 to 1977, registered television sets rose from
250,000 to 860,000.
3.        Wider use of modern and adapted technology to raise productivity
in agriculture and industry requires an improved knowledge base and
acceptance of scientific and technical concepts that may be alien to



-36-
ANNEX 2
Page 2
traditional cultural and societal values. The application of modern
science, in turn, presupposes basic literate and numerate skills among the
general public, and also an inquiring and critical approach to the learning
process. To be effective, these skills must reach beyond the small modern
and high salaried subsectors of the economy. In this context, mass media
and general reading matter play an important role in the dissemination
of knowledge and acceptance of modern ideas. School textbooks represent
one of the most pervasive components of the communication network, for they
enter almost every household. When well written, and designed to relate to
the local environment and living conditions, they have an impact on parents
as well as on scholastic achievements of pupils.
Publishing, Printing, Copyright and Paper
4.        Publishers and printers fulfill useful functions to both the
general reading public and schools and should be encouraged. Two major
constraints have been identified to the expansion of publishing and
printing: the lack of an effective copyright law and the cost differential
between locally produced and imported printing and writing paper.
Publishing
5.        Recent evaluations by BP3K in Indonesia have indicated that there
is a positive correlation between educational achievements of pupils and the
number of books at home. A greater availability of books and printed matter
will therefore not only encourage literacy among the general public, it will
also contribute to higher scholastic achievements. In Indonesia, publishing
has largely been an activity of the private sector, although the Ministry of
Education and Culture (MEC) under its various book projects during the
1970s, has become the major publisher of textbooks for the primary and
secondary levels. In addition, the Ministry publishes cultural books and
supplementary readers and library books through Balai Pustaka, its printer/
publisher. Private publishers are also important in supplying the school
population with supplementary readers and library books. From 1974 to 1979
they produced the INPRES school library books with some 400 titles per year
currently in editions of 25,000 per title, and since 1979 they have produced
up to 100 titles per year in editions of about 125,000 per title. About 3,000
new titles are published in the private sector each year. Most of these are
published by the 112 publishers organized under IKAPI (Ikatan Penerbit
Indonesia), the Indonesian Publishers' Association, but a few are published by
the 80-90 occasional printer-publishers. Forty-one of IKAPI's members are
headquartered in Jakarta, twenty in Bandung, twelve in Surabaya, eight in
Medan, and two in Yogyakarta, with the remainder scattered throughout
Indonesia's provinces. In general, publishers do not specialize but issue
titles in many subject areas and at many levels.
6.        Organized private publishers are divided into large-, medium- and
small-size operations. The largest five or ten houses have their own printing
plants and issue about 100 new titles each year. They usually have their own



-37-
ANNEX 2
Page 3
(20 or more) sales representatives and retail outlets throughout the country.
There are about 50 medium-size publishers who issue from 20 to 80 new titles
and reprints annually. Few of these publishers own printing plants, but they
possess retail outlets, and also sell through other bookstores. They handle
their own marketing. Finally, there are about 50 small publishers or
"seasonal" houses that publish only on occasion, principally when they obtain
a government contract for textbooks or for INPRES school library books. They
possess no retail outlets and conduct little or no promotion.
7.        The publishing industry is developing despite constraints.  Books
are better designed and printed than they were a decade ago and are more
widely distributed. An annual book fair, comprising a national exhibit of
publishers' lists, is popular, particularly among younger people, and an
annual catalog of publishers' announcements of important new books and
perennial good sellers is also issued. Finally, the INPRES program permits
profitable long-run editions of 400 children's titles each year. Yet the
publishing industry needs to be further developed if it is to make its full
contribution to Indonesia's development.
Printing
8.        Within the printing industry, there is ample additional capacity and
costs are reasonable.  In total, there are about 2,000 printing houses of
which about 85% are privately owned. A few modern, large-scale printing firms
use webfed presses, while smaller printers, one-third of whom are located in
Jakarta, use the labor-intensive sheetfed presses. Webfed printing as a whole
is about eight times faster than sheetfed printing, but equipment is more
costly and employment generation is limited. In recent years, textbook print-
ing for primary and secondary schools has averaged about 25-30 million copies
per year and the Ministry of Education publisher/printer, Balai Pustaka,
has supplied about one-third of this amount. Balai Pustaka's two-unit web
offset equipment and four book-size sheetfed presses have the capacity to
print about 15 million books annually. Its printing capacity will be expanded
within the next two years to match its binding capacity of 25 million books.
In addition, at least six two-unit webfed book presses will soon be in
operation in the country. The combined capacity of these six presses will be
about 60 million books per year.
9.        The duties and sales taxes on imported books reflect the Govern-
ment's concern with developing its medium- and small-scale indigenous printing
and paper industry and protecting it against foreign competition (Table 1).
To protect local printers, importation of books printed in Bahasa Indonesia is
prohibited and only books printed in foreign languages may be imported. The
standard import duty is 40% and the sales tax is 10%, but books classified as
educational and scientific in nature may, upon application to the Ministry of
Education, enter duty free. With regard to other materials used in book pro-
duction, ink and glue are found locally. The standard 60% duty for imported
wire is reduced to 30% when the wire is used in book binding.

Copyright Law
10.       In recognition that Indonesia's copyright law needs to be
strengthened, the Government has proposed a new copyright law to Parliament.
The present law is an adaptation of the 1912 copyright law introduced by the
Dutch, and covers only domestic copyright. The country is not a signatory to
any international copyright agreement and no government agency is responsible
for enforcing the copyright law. Despite Indonesia's nonparticipation in
either the Berne International Copyright Convention or the Universal Copyright
Convention, there is wide compliance with the terms of those treaties in
respect to translation and reprint rights for books of foreign origin. With
regard to domestic copyright protection, owners are responsible for detection
and proof of infringement. They may file suit in court, but penalties for
proven violations of the copyright law are modest and constitute no deterrent
to piracy (Rp 300 or one week in jail). While subsequent legal action by
injured parties is feasible, legitimate publishers normally do not have the
staff resources to search for pirated editions of their publications or to
pursue those who print them. Presently, banks are reluctant to make loans for
book publishing; writers generally do not view authorship of books as a means
of livelihood; and without the security of copyright protection, publishers
are not encouraged to order large prints runs, which could reduce costs and
increase markets. A strengthened copyright law would provide better financial
security to writers and publishers and generally encourage the publishing
industry. The Ministry of Education, which is concerned with increasing the
supply of supplementary educational materials, would also benefit from the
enactment of this law.
Paper Industry
.1.       Cost Structure.  The price of printing and writing paper is about
:30% above world market prices, which constrains the expansion of the
publishing and printing industry, and the availability of reading matter.
The high cost of written materials reflects small, nonintegrated mills and
high tariffs and taxes on paper. Printing and writing paper consumption per
1,000 inhabitants in Indonesia is low, at 825 kg in 1977, compared to
2,260 kg for China, and 1,100 kg for the Philippines.  The industry is
composed of many small, uneconomic mills with high unit costs of production
and a heavy dependence on imported pulp. In 1980, of the 13 mills producing
printing and writing grades, only 4 had a capacity exceeding 15,000 tons.
Imported materials, pulp and chemicals represent about half of the
production cost. Typically, for small nonintegrated mills, direct operating
costs exceed thea cost of imported printing and writing paper, net of duty.
The price of imported paper suitable for textbooks is presently about US$900
per ton (net of duties, ex-warehouse in Jakarta, including handling
charges), while that of locally produced paper is US$1,200 per ton./l
./ Quotations obtained May/June 1980 from registered paper merchants in
Jakarta.



-40-
ANNEX 2
Page 6
12.       The tariff structure protects domestic mills.  However, it also
acts as a disincentive against vertical integration, i.e. producing locally
bleached pulp by exploiting domestic forestry resources and establishing
integrated pulp and paper mills. While the combined duty and sales tax on
imported printing and writing paper is 70%, imported pulp is presently not
subject to duty or sales tax. In 1978, 110,000 tons of pulp were imported,
about 70% of which represented bleached short-fiber pulp suitable for the
manufacture of woodfree printing and writing paper. Presently, most paper
mills rely on imported pulp though some mix it with locally produced pulp,
made from rice straw or bagasse. Bleached chemical short-fiber pulp imports
are expected to grow from 80,000 tons in 1978, to 100,000 tons by 1985 and
to reach not less than 170,000 tons by the end of the 1980s. These imports
suggest an inefficient use of domestic forestry resources, and do not seem to
be in line with Indonesia's comparative advantage in production and trade.
13.       Demand for and Supply of Printing and Writing Paper.  Present
estimates indicate that local production of printing and writing paper does
not fully match domestic consumption. In 1978, consumption of woodfree grades
reached 115,000 tons, of which about 15,000 tons were imported. Continued net
imports of the same volume are foreseen through 1985, increasing to 40,000
tons by 1996 (Table 2). The paper requirements for the proposed textbook
project are relatively small; during the period of the project (1982/83
through 1984/85), an average of 7,000 tons or about 5% of annual production
would be needed for the project books.

14.       Future Policy.  Industry transformation towards larger mill
capacities, fully integrated mills and the use of hardwoods for local pulp
production, are central issues the Government must face if it is to make the
pulp and paper industry more competitive. Capacity expansion is already
underway, and if sufficient measures are taken to replace imported by local



-41-
ANNEX 2
Page 7
pulp, local printing and writing paper can be expected to become more compe-
titive with imported paper towards the mid- or late-1980s. The Government has
designated the Leces paper mill located in East Java to become the main
supplier of paper to the Ministry of Education. This mill mixes imported
chemical pulp with locally produced pulp made of rice straw.  Its production
would increase from about 25,000 tons per year presently to 85,000 tons by
1984/85. Its expansion is likely to reduce overhead costs (net of deprecia-
tion) by about US$100 per ton towards the mid-1980s. If the 45,000 tons of
imported bleached short-fiber pulp could be replaced by locally produced
short-fiber pulp, production costs would probably fall by another US$50 to
US$100 per ton.
15.       A desirable strategy to raise the industry's competitiveness would:
(a) reduce the dependence on imported bleached pulp; (b) expand the capacity
of the mills to more economic levels; and (c) gradually reduce the 70%
combined duty and sales tax on printing and writing paper. The objective
would be to make the industry more competitive with imported paper by the
mid-1980s. The Bank is discussing this strategy in the framework of its work
on a pulp and paper project in Central Java.
