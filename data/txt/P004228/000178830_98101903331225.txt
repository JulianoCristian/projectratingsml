NATIONAL ELECTRIGITY BOARD
OF THE STATES OF IALAYA
FIFTH POWER PROJECT
SUNMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        At the request of the National Electricity Board of the States of
Malaya (NEB) an electric power project, known as the Fifth Power Project,
has been appraised. It consists of: (a) the third stage of the Port
Dickson Thermal Station where three 120 MW units are to be added to the two
60 Nrv units in service and the two 60 MW units now under construction to bring
the station to its ultimate capacity of 600 IiW; and (b) transmission lines
and associated substations to deliver the power to the load centers. The
NEB has received an aggregate of US$122.7 million in four Bank loans since
1958 which have financed about 700 MW of generating plant additions to the
system. The proposed loan would help bring the total system capacity to
L,204 1A in 1976 from about 124 MW at the beginning of 1963; a growth of
almost ten times in size. The projects under previous loans have all been
satisfactorily completed or are now under construction. No significant
problems have arisen during this period.
ii.       The total cost of the Project is estimated at about US$59 million
equivalent of which about US$47 million is the foreign exchange component.
The project would be financed from: (a) about US$27 million of bilateral
or supplier credits for the boilers and turbo alternators for the Port
Dickson Station, (b) US$20 million from the proposed Bank loan for the
foreign exchange cost of civil works and other items of equipment for the
Port Dickson Station and for the imported material and equipment for the
transmission and substation extensions and for engineering consulting Services;
and (c) US$12 million from NEBts internal cash generation for local
currency costs. The orders to be financed from bilateral or supplier credits
would be awarded after tenders had been invited internationlally. All
orders financed from the Bank loan would be awarded after international
competitive bidding according to the Bank's procurement procedures.
iii.      The civil disturbances whichoccurred in Malaysia in 1969 have
slowed the growth in power demand from the past average annual rate of about
16% to a rate of 9.6%. However, tne Government is offering tax advantages
to new industry to stimulate the economy, and power demand could resume
the relatively high growth rate experienced during recent years. In order
to deal with the uncertainty surrounding future power demand the construction
schedule contemplates the completion of the civil works for 3 x 120 Ifg
machines and the immediate installation of two units to meet known new loads
that are expected on schedule by 197L; the installation of the third unit
would be timed to meet system requirements as they develop.



- ii -
iv.       ISEDB is organized as a modern public utility corporation and has
considerable autonomy. Its stock is owned almost entirely by the Malaysian
Government and its directors are appointed by the Minister of Commerce and
Industry.  The financial record of iwEB is good and its present financial
position is sound. The financing plan for the period of the proposed Project
is satisfactory. NEB expects to finance about 55% of its capi-al requirements
from internal cash generation for the next nine years during which time the
Project and the major step of power expansion which follows ib will have been
completed.  (See vii below.)  It expects to earn a satisfactory rate of return
of about 8% on net fixed assets in operation during the period under considera-
tion without any tariff increases.
v.        Through recent legislation the Government has revoked iAEB's former
tax exempt status and AEB will have to start paying income and other taxes.
The financial forecast shows that XEB will be able to meet the tax burden
and still maintain the favorable financial posituion referred to in iv. above.
vi.       For more than a decade since independence lIalaysians have been taking
over senior s-taff positions and today NEB is entirely staffed by Ilalaysians
who have continued the satisfactory level of performance previously established,
However, since the 1969 disturbances government policies have placed emphasis
on finding new jobs for the unskilled segment of the population, with resultant
pressures on NEB to increase its number of employees. During negotiations
understanding was reached that NEB would take steps to improve the ratio of
consumers per employee by keeping staff increases to a minimum. The under-
taking obtained under the previous loans which gives the Bank the right of
consulta-tion before changes are made to the position of General Manager,
Deputy General Manager and Chief Financial Officer was also repeated in the
proposed loan because some changes to these positions may occur during the
life of the loan.
vii.      The proposed Project would have an incremental rate of return of
about 12% and a unit cost of US$145 per kJ of generating plant installed,
which is about the average for similar installations in the region. It is the
least cost next step of power system developnent and forms part of NEB's long
range planning to meet future power demands.  The step to follow the proposed
project would be the Temengor Hydroelectric station (260 ISW); it has been
exanined by the Bank and its formal appraisal is proposed later in 1970.
viii.     The Project is a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$20 million
for a period of 20 years with a grace period of L4½ years.

FIFTH PaWER PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report covers the appraisal of the Fifth Power Project of the
National Electricity Board of the States of Malaya (EB), consisting of the
addition of three 120 MW generating units to the Tuanku Ja'afar (Port Dickson)
thermal station to bring it to its ultimate capacity of 600 MW and the con-
struction of transmission lines and associated substations to deliver the power
to the load centers.
1.02      The estimated total cost of the project is about M$177 million
(US$59 million) of which the foreign exchange cost is I$140 million (US$47
million),  The Bank has been requested to finance J$6o million (US$20 million)
of the foreign exchange cost. The remainder of the total project cost is to
be financed by about M$80O1 million (US$27 million) from bilateral credit
sources and M$37 million (US$12 million) from NEB's internal cash generation.
1.03      The Borrower would be the NEB to which the Bank has made four loans
aggregating US$122.7 million. The first loan (210-NA) of US$28.6 million
was made in 1958 for the first stage of the Cameron Highlands hydroelectric
scheme. A second loan (350-HA) of US$51.1 million was made in 1963 for the
second stage of the Cameron Highlands Scheme, the first stage of the Prai
Thermal Station, and the expansion of transmission facilities. In 1966 a
third loan (458-MA) of US$31.5 million was made for the first stage of the
Port Dickson Thermal Station, the installation of additional generating units
at the Cameron Highlands Scheme, the second stage of the Johore Bahru thermal
station and the expansion of transmission facilities. A fourth loan (579-MA)
of US411.5 million was made in January 1969 for the second stage of the Port
Dickson and Prai thermal stations and for expansion of transmission facilities.
1.04      Projects covered by the first two loans have been completed and are
operating satisfactorily. Under the third loan, the first stage of the Port
Dickson station and the units at Cameron Highlands have been completed; the
second stage of Johore Bahru is expected to be in service by early 1971.
Under the fourth loan construction is proceeding normally and the second
stage of the Prai Station is expected to be in operation early in 1971 and
Port Dickson Station stage two by mid-1972.
1.05      The project now proposed is the next logical step in the expansion
of the NEB facilities. It was first discussed in August 1969 during a
project supervision inspection in connection with previous Bank loans. A
loan application was received in early 1970 and Messrs. R.V. Sear and R. Knothe
visited Malaysia in February 1970 to appraise the Project.

2. THE ELECTRIC POCER SECTCR
2.01      Malaysia consists of the peninsula of Malaya (TWest Malaysia) which
lies between Thailand and the equator, and the States of Sarawak and Sabah on
the island of Borneo (East Malaysia). The aggregate area of Malaysia is about
1145,000 square miles and it has a population of about 11 million which is
growing at a rate of 331$ p.a. and has a per capita annual income of US$326.
2.02      The econcmy of Malaysia depends principally on tin and rubber
exports which together account for about 45% of the GNP. Due to the high
prices enjoyed recently by these exports, the total GNP rose at a rate of
9% in 1969.
2.03      In the past, tin mining has been one of the principal power users
but its share of total power usage has declined from about 30% to 19% since
1963 while that of industry has increased from about 22% to 26%. (See Annex 7.)
The Government has had a program of fostering industrial development by organiz-
ing industrial parks and by offering tax incentives. This program has been
given further importance as a result of the civil disorders in May 1969 and
the consequent need to provide more employment for semi skilled and unskilled
labor.
2.04      To date no significant deposits of fossil fuels have been found but
offshore prospecting for oil or gas is now being actively undertaken. There
is abundant rainfall and several hydroelectric sites have been studied. The
Cameron Highlands site. (265 MW) on the western slopes of the mountains has
been built with Bank assistance. The Temengor site (260 Mi) further to the
north on the Perak River has been studied by consultants and is under consid-
eration by the Bank for appraisal later in 1970. Two other smaller sites on
the eastern side of the country are being studied and may be suitable for
development some time in the future.
2.05      Electric power in Malaysia is supplied principally by autonomous,
government owned entities. The largest of these is the NEB which serves the
whole peninsula of Malaya with the exception of Penang Island which is supplied
by a municipally-owned plant, and part of the State of Perak which is supplied
by the privately owned Perak River Hydroelectric Power Company (PRHE). The
two states on the island of Borneo are supplied by government-owned statutory
authorities - the Sabah Electricity Board and the Sarawak Electricity Supply
Corporation. The installed generating capacity of these entities is shown
below:-
Entity                             Installed Capacity (N4)
NEB                                               66h
PREE                                              145
Penang City Council                                43
Sabah Electricity Board                            30
Sarawak Electricity Supply Corporation              30
Total            912



- 3 -
In addition to the above there is a total of 35 MW in about 200 small
privately owned diesel plants which supply power for private use.
Facilities of the NEB
2.06      NEB's total present generating capacity of 664 MW is made up of 265 Mi
of hydroelectric plant, 360 MW of steam plant and 39 W of diesel plant. About
one half of the capacity was installed during the last four years. Details of
the plant are given in Annex 1. An additional 180 MW of steam plant is under
construction under Loans 458-MN  and 579-MA and is scheduled to go into service
between 1970 and 1972 to bring the total installed capacity to 844 MW. The
proposed project would add a further 360 W between 1973 and 1976 to give a
total installed capacity of 1,204 M by 1976 which would represent a ten fold
growth in the size of the system since the beginning of 1963.
2.07      Nearly all of NEBts generating capacity supplies the Interconnected
System, which covers most of the western side of the Malay Peninsula and
extends from Alor Star in the North to the Southern System around Johore Bahru
(see Map). About 90 small isolated localities in other parts of the country
are supplied by diesel generating plants with an aggregate capacity of about
39 MW. There are no power shortages in the areas served at present.
2.08      NEB's main transmission system is operated at 132 kV.  Its length
totals some 556 route miles of which 45 miles between Port Dickson and Kuala
Lumpur South have been constructed for later operation at 275 kV. NEB has
also about 306 miles of 66 kV and 542 miles of 33 kV transmission lines.
Distribution is carried out at 22 kV and 11 kV by same 1,850 miles of overhead
lines and underground cables as well as by some 216 miles of lines and cables
at 6.6 kV, 3.3 kV and 2.2 kV.  Substation capacity is in excess of 2.5 million
kVA.
2.09      NEB's Interconnected System is connected to the PRBE and Penang
City Council systems, which are commented upon in detail below.
NED s Power Expansion Program
2.10      In order to continue meeting the growing demand for power - see
chapter 5 - NEB has developed a power expansion program for the period 1970-19V3,
which in addition to the proposed project includes the completion of the next
major step of generating plant expansion and consists of the following:-
(a) The completion of the works now under construction under Loans
458-MA and 579-MA (paragraph 1.04).
(b) The construction of the 260 FW Temengor hydroelectric station
(paragraph 2.11).
(c)  Distribution system expansion and the installation of small isolated
diesel stations to serve rural areas.
2.11      Shawinigan Engineering Company Ltd. of Canada, in cooperation with
Preece, Cardew and Rider, have made a study of the NEB system in which an all-
thermal generating plant expansion program through 1985 was compared with a



- 4 -
mixed thePrmal End hydro program. In order to determine the best sequence
of plant installatlons, 22 separate sequences were compared.  The results of
this study show that the proposed project for the installation of 3 x 120 MI
units at Port Dickson station is the least cost next step, followed by the
Temengor hydroelectric project (260 MW) to be commissioned about 1977-78.
2.12      The hydrological and geological aspects of the Temengor site have
'been invest...gated to the point where sufficient data are available to do the
engineering design of the project, Also, a special on-site investigiation was
made by consultants to determine whether mineral resources of consequence
exist in the area to be flooded by the reservoir. The results were negative.
Concessions have already been granted for the extraction of timber, and
negotiations are now taking place for the resettlement of the small village
population which would be affected.
2.13      The Temengor project would involve the construction of a dam, tunnels,
the generating Ltation and associated trunk transmission lines. The estimated
construction period would be 6 years and estimated cost about VS$75 million
with a foreign exchange component of about US$45 million for which NEB would
seek external financing from the Bank and other lenders. If the project proves
feasible, negotiations to arrange financing which would probably involve other
lenders, as well as the Bank, should take place in 1971 so that the project
could be started in time to meet its in-service date (1977-78). The discounted
cash flow comparisons between alternative programs and sequences of power
development show that for discount rates of up to 9% the Temengor project is
competitive, If flood benefits are taken into account, the discount rate goes
up to about 10%e It is therefore proposed that the Temengor project be appraised
later in 1970.
The Per   Rt                   P      oR
2.14      The company and its distribution subsidiary generate and distribute
electricity within the concession area in the State of Perak to some 53,50O
Customers; the bulk of the output is sold to the tin mining industry. PRHE
is incorporated in the United Kingdom and operates under a concession granted
by the State of Perak in 1926 for a term of 80 years. The Government has the
right to terminate the concession by acquiring the whole of the undertaking
on the terms stipulated in the concession agreement at any time between
November 1976 and Nay 1978 and thereafter it has the same option at ten-yearly
intervals upon dLe notice "teing given. The Government has not yet declared
whether or not it will acquire PRHE in 1976 but the matter is receiving active
consideration.
2.15      PRHE has a total of 145 M  of generating plant of which 30 kw is
hydroelectric and 115 W is steam.  During the next 2 or 3 years 37 IW of
the older thermal plant is to be phased out so that the Company's available
generating plant capacity by 1973 will be reduced to 108 MW.



2.16      A 20 year contract to purchase power in bulk from NEB was signed
in i967 under which PRHE was guaranteed 50 SW of maximum demand at a
minimum load factor of 60% by 1969. The company has negotiated a revision
of this contract with NEB to increase the supply to 60 MW in 1970; 100 MW
and 110 hW respectively when the Port Dickson units 3 and 4 come into
service in 1972; and annual increases of 10 MW thereafter. This increase
in bulk power purchases from NEB results from the company's decision to
phase out sorae of its older generating plants and not to construct any
new pJ.ants but instead to meet its future power requirements by bulk
power purchases.  This would increase PRHE's purchases from the NEB from
255 million kWh in 1968/69 to about 875 million kWh in 1972/73 which would
be about 25% of NEB's total sales. The sale price for the revised
contract will be slightly higher than that of the original contract. It is
in line with NEB's industrial tariff which was recommended by the consultants
in 1967 and which is satisfactory.
Penang City Council
2.17      Special provisions were made in the Electricity Ordinance of
1949 for the Penang City Council to continue operating its own electricity
system to sp,p.,'y the island of Penang. It has a 40 14C thermal generating
station consL:-cted in 1967 and 3 SW of old diesel plant.  The Penang City
Council's system is interconnected to the NEB system by 33 kV and 11 kV
submarine cables. The Penang City Council is understood to have decided
not to add further generating units to its plant but to take bulk supply
from the NEB from 1972 onwards. Preliminary discussions are taking
place on the terms and conditions of a bulk supply contract. This
additional load is not expected to affect NEB's position materially as
it will probably only amount to an increase of about 1 MW a year because
Penang Island serves essentially as a residential area for the industrial
area on the mainland across the straits which already receives its power
from NEB.

3. TU1 BORRCUER
3.01      The Borrower would be the NEB, which was established in 1949 by
the Government under the provisions of the Electricity Ordinance enacted
that year and has developed into a financially sound and a well organized
and operated utility.
3.02      The NEB is organized and functions as a modern public utility
corporation and has a considerable degree of autonomy. It is both a
regulatory and operating agency. It is charged with the operation of the
electric installations under its jurisdiction and the establishment of such
new facilities as may be required. It regulates the production and use of
electric energy in Malaya and grants licenses for the installation and
operation of independent electricity works to be used for public or private
purposes. The NEB has the power to set electricity tariffs. (See 3.10).
3.03      The Board of Directors of the NEB consists of a Chairman, Deputy
Chairman and not more than 10 or less than 5 other members. At the present
time there are nine members all of whom, with the exception of the Deputy
Chairman who is also the General Manager, serve in a part-time capacity.
Tembers are appointed by the Yinister of Commerce and Industry for terms,
and subject to conditions, as he may determine. The present members are
prominent in the political, labor and business communities and except for
one newly-appointed member have been associated with the NEB for over five
years.
Management and Staff
3.04      Over the course of time the NEB has developed into a well organized
and operated utility. In the past, most key positions were occupied by
foreigners, chiefly of British nationality. Following independence in 1957,
the Government established the principle of lIalayanization and by the end of
1967 all key positions were held by Malaysians who have continued to operate
the entity at the satisfactory level of performance previously attained.
3.05      In May 1969 civil disorders broke out, principally in Kuala Lumpur,
which resulted in a severe disruption of the economy for several months.
Curfew had to be imposed and civil liberties were curtailed. This situation
has improved considerably since then but the community has not yet returned
completely to normal. In an attempt to cure the underlying causes, the
Government has started a number of programs to stimulate industry and
commerce and increase employment opportunities. In line with this effort
the Government has directed all state owned or controlled entities to give
employment to as many unskilled and semi-skilled workers as possible even
at the sacrifice of mechanization and efficiency. As a consequence, NEEB
has had to increase its semi and unskilled workers by 200 when it would
normally not have added any staff. In the past the Bank has pointed out
that NEB's ratio of consumers per employee was low in comparison with other
similar utility companies. This has been due principally to the number of
isolated localities served by the system and to the amount of distribution
construction work done by NEB's own work force. In 1969 the ratio was 45:1
while a satisfactory ratio would be about 60:1 for the conditions in Malaysia.
NEB's management realizes that, if it continues to be forced to increase its
staff in tnis manner the efficiency and economy of its operations could
deteriorate,



- 7 -
3.o6      During negotiations an informal understanding was reached that NEB
would take steps to improve the ratio of customers per employee by keeping
the number of new posts approved to a minimum. In addition, the organization
study mentioned in 3.09 should contribute towards improving this ratio.
3.07      Previous loan agreements have contained an undertaking giving the
3ank the right to be consulted before any appointments are made to the
positions of General Manager, Deputy General Manager (Engineering) axnd Chief
Financial Officer. Since some of the incumbents of these posts may retire
during the next two years, it was agreed during negotiations to repeat the
undertaking in the proposed loan.
Consultants
3.08      On the basis of its past performance, the NEB with the assistance
of its Consultants, Preece, Cardew and Atider of London, is capable of carrying
out and supervising the construction of the Project. NEB is also fully capable
of operating the l roject efficiently after its completion.
3.09      NEB is engaging management consultants to review
its organization and make recommendations to improve efficiency. This is
a necessary step in view of the rapid growth of the entity during the past
few years as evidenced by the system capacity which will have grown almost
ten times in size from 125 MW in the beginning of 1963 to 1,204 MW in 1976
when the proposed project is completed. During negotiations agreement was
reached with NEB to consult the Bank on the consultant's recommendations and
their implementation.
Tariffs
3.10      Under the Electricity Ordinance the NEB has power to fix tariffs
without reference to any other authority. In practice the Minister of
Commerce and Industry is consulted and he has the right to give the NEB
direct_ons of a general character not inconsistent with the provisions of
the Ordinance. These provisions require that total revenues must be
sufficient to meet total outgoings properly chargeable to revenue, including
depreciation and interest on capital. This provision is regarded as determin-
ing the minirmum level of tariffs. The NEB's stated policy is to produce a
return on its average net fixed assets in operation of at least 8% per annum
and to endeavor to finance about 40% of capital requirements out of internal
resources   This has been sufficient along with the Bank loans and some bi-
lateral credits and some stock purchases by the Government (see 3.22) to
finance N1EB's expansion program and to satisfy all power demands.



- 8 -
3.11      Under previous loans the NEB is required to maintain tariffs
sufficient to yield an annual return of not less than 8% on its average net
fixed assets in operation. The return is calculated by relating net income
from operations to average net fixed assets in operation after deducting
Government contributions for rural electrification and consumers' contribu-
tions towards construction. During negotiations agreement was reached
to continue this requirement under the proposed loan.
3.12      Only two minor tariff reductions have been made since 1960 and no
tariff changes are contemplated or considered necessary during the period
under consideration, with the exception of a slight increase in the bulk
tariff to PREE (paragraph 2.16).
Taxation
3.13      Since its inception, NEB has been exempt from taxes on or related
to income.  The exemption did not, however, extend to the payment of import
duties, the 50% fuel  tax, and the surtax of 2% on imports introduced in 1967.
3.14      A June 1969 amendment to the Income Tax Act of 1967 removed NEB
from the schedule of tax exempt statutory bodies and it is now liable to pay
income, development, and payroll taxes the same as any private company. The
income tax is levied at a rate of 40% of taxable income, the development
tax at 5% of gross income, and the payroll tax at 2do
3.15      As the Malaysian tax laws grant substantial capital allowances to
taxpayers with heavy capital expenditures and on the assumption that the
dividend paid to the Government would be a tax deductible expenditure, NTEB
had assumed that it would not have to pay income taxes for several years to
come. A recent ruling of the internal revenue service, however, disallows
the divide: d payments as a deductible item; consequently NEB will be liable
to substai;,ial tax payments from 1969/70 onwards.  This has been taken into
account in the financial projections which shtow that NEB will still be able
to fulfill its stated policy as given in paragraph 3.10.
Accounting and Audit
3.16      The NEB has a reasonably efficient accounting organization but faces
a shortage of qualified staff and as stated in paragraph 3.07 is finding some
difficulty in recruiting new staff. Starting about two years ago, the
accounting system has gradually been transferred to a computer. It will
take about two more years to complete this work.
3.17      NEB's auditors since its inception in 1949 have been Price Water-
house & Co. Besides carrying out the annual audit, the firm has from time
to time been engaged to advise on accounting methods and procedures. In
1966, the Board appointed a Malaysian firm of auditors, Messrs. Hanafiah,
Raslan, Ong and Nahomad, to carry out the audit of NEB's isolated stations.
The audit as a whole continues to be done by Price Waterhouse & Co. who
have been reappointed for the 1969 audits. During negotiations assur-
ances mere obtained that the NEB will continue to employ independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank.

Capital Structure and Financial Position
3.18      Summaries of I]EB's audited balance sheets as of the end of the
fiscal years August 1963 through 1969 are given in Annex 2A and financial
statistics in Annex 3A.
3.19      NEB's capital structure and financial position are sound.  The
current ratio, less than unity for many years, has shown a marked improve-
ment in 1969 (paragraph 3.25).
3.20      At August 31, 1969 total net assets amounted to M$743 million
(US$247 .7 million) including net fixed assets in operation of M$671 million
(US$223.5 million).  NEB's fixed assets are recorded at cost.  Since the
major part of NEB's plant has been installed during the 1960's and almost
half of the cost has been incurred during the last 4 years, the book value
is acceptable to the Bank for the purpose of calculating the rate of return
(paragraph 3.11).
3.21     HNEB's capitalization consisted at August 31, 1969 of:
US$
(millions)
Ordinary stock                        167.7           55.9
Reserves                              151.8           50.6
Total equity                     319.5          106.5
Long-term debt
IBRD                            278.9            93.0
Other                            144.6           48.2
Total long-term debt             423.5          141.2
Total capitalization          743.0          247.7
3.22      With the exception of H$3 million held by the Pahang State Govern-
ment, the ordinary stock of NEB is owned by the Halaysian Government. In
1969, the Malaysian Government subscribed to another M$4.4 million of stock
for the financing of the South l-alaya PowJer 7evelopraent (Loan 458-hA). WIo
further Government stock subscriptions are envisaged.  Under NEB's ordinance
the dividend cannot exceed 6% per annum.  It has been set at 5p since 1962/63
and no change is contemplated.



- 10 -
3.23       Reserves comprise the General Reserve and Capital Development
Account which represent the earned sur.plus to date.  In the seven year
period 1963/69 NEB distributed about one quarter of its profits as dividends
and retained three quarters for the financing of its expansion programs.
NEB's debt/equity ratio has shown a constant improvement during recent years,
from 70/30 at the end of fiscal year 1963 to 57/43 at the end of August 1969,
reflecting NEB's substantial contribution toward financing its construction
outlays from retained earnings.
3.24      Details of NEB's long-term  debt are given in Annex 4. All debts
have an original term of more than 20 years; of the total, 63% is owed to
the Bank under the four loans made to date. NEB pays interest ranging from
5% to 6.75% on its debt, the weighted average being 5.8%.
3.25      NEB's current ratio improved in fiscal year 1969 from 0.8:1 to
1.1:1 due to a slow down in NEB's construction program. The bank overdraft
which had reached a peak of I113 million in 1965 had been completely repaid
at the end of August 1969 and NEB had accumulated M$16.8 million in cash,
part of which is temporarily invested in time deposits until required to
help finance the substantial program now under consideration.
3.26      NEB's overdraft facilities consist of M$9 million from the Chartered
Bank and M$6 million from the Chase Manhattan Bank, both secured by a Govern-
ment guarantee. In order to prevent a recurrence of the excessive use of
those facilities the NEB undertook in connection with Loan 579-MA to limit
its short term debt to iO10 million (US$3.3 million). Although NEB's present
and forecast financial position indicates that overdrafts would not be re-
quired, NEB wishes to continue the existing arrangements and it was agreed
during negotiations to repeat the covenant under the proposed loan.
Earnings Record
3.27      Income statements for the fiscal years 1962/63 through 1968/69
are shown in Annex 5A and financial ratios are given in Annex 3A.
3.28      The operating ratio has shown a steady improvement from 78.0%
in 1962/63 to 66.8% in 1968/69 although fuel prices were increased in early
1969. During this period the cost per kWh sold has dropped 27% to M05.3
(US01.77). To a large extent this is due to the Cameron Highlands hydro
plants coming into operation in 1963 and 1967. The operating costs are
reasonable; they have now been reduced to a level where substantial further
improvements can only be expected when the 120 1W units in Port Dickson comle
into operation.
3.29      The average return on net fixed assets in operation for the seven
year period was 9.4%, well above the agreed minimum rate of 8%
(paragraph 3.11). Interest and debt service have been satisfactory for
the past several years.

4. THE PROJECT
4.01      The project proposed for Bank financing forms part of the NEB's
1970-1978 expansion program, see paragraph 2.10. It consists of the con-
struction of:-
(a)  The third stage of the Tuanku Ja'afar (Port Dickson) steam station
by adding three 120 MW units, two of which are scheduled for
service in 1974 and the third would be installed within 2 years
thereafter.
(b)  Transmission lines and associated substations to deliver the
additional power generated to the load centers.
Tuanku Ja'afar (Port Dickson) Steam Station
4.02      The first stage of the Port Dickson station (2 x 60 MW) was com-
pleted in 1969 under Loan 458-I4A.  The second stage (2 x 60 MW) is now under
const-uction under Loan 579-MA and is expected to be completed on schedule
in 1972.
4.03      The Pert Dickson station was originally designed to accommodate
eight 60 mW units. With the completion of stage two, four of these units
will be in service.  In view of the continued growth of the power demand at
a relatively high rate, it is now considered appropriate to complete the
Port Dickson station by installing three 120 M4W units instead of the four
60 MW units previously envisaged. The larger sets will operate at more
efficient adv-nced steam conditions and give substantial savings in fuel
costs. The NEB system will have an installed capacity of 964 MW when the
first 120 MW set is put into service so that it will only represent about
12% of total system capacity which would keep the required reserve capacity
within acceptable limits.
4.04      Each of the 120 NW units will consist of one reheat type boiler
and turbo-alternator and auxiliary plant.
Transmission Lines and Substations
4.05      In order to transmit the power generated by the additional plant
at the Port Dickson station to the ultimate consumer, it will be necessary to
extend or modify existing transmission lines and substations.
4.06      This work will consist essentially of:
(i) The installation of bus-tie transformers to interconnect the
132 kV section of Port Dickson station supplied by the 60 NIW
units with the 275 kV section which will be supplied by the
proposed 120 1E4 units.
(ii)  The construction of the 275 kV transmission line extension
from Kua: a Lum-ur South substation to Rawang substation.
(iii)  The const luctiona of an additional 132 kV transmission line
between Woih and Papan.

(iv) Substation and transmission line extensions,
Cost Estimates
4.07      The cost estimate is based upon known costs of similar work just
completed under the previous Bank loan. The estimate is considered reliable
and contains adequate contingency amounts to cover increases in prices and
quantities. A summary of the cost estimate is as follows:-

Bilateral Financing and Bank Loan
4.08      Under Loan 579-MA the NEB agreed to apply for bilateral and supplier
credits to finance part of the project. It was able to obtain satisfactory
financing from these sources and it is proposed to use the same procedure for
the proposed Project.
4.p9      It has been agreed with NEB and the consultants that the boilers
and turbo-alternators would be suitable for bilateral or supplier financing,
as was the case in the previous loan.
4h10      The proposed Bank loan would finance the foreign exchange cost of
theequipment for Transmission Lines and Substations; civil works and
auxiliary equipment for the Port Dickson station and engineering consulting
services. All local costs would be financed from NE9B's own resources.  A
9umn&y is given below of the assumed breakdown of foreign exchange and
local cost financing from the various scurces.

4Jo1,L<22d Ocnstw on
4.ll      The MEB has retained its principal consultants Preece, Cardew,
and Rider of London (PCR) to carry out engineering, bid evaluation and
construction supervision for the project under arrangements previously
found satisfactory, Shawinigan Engineering Co. of Canada in association
with Ganendra, Ahmad Associates of Malaysia have been selected as the civil
engineering consultants and will be under contract and responsible to the
principal consultants. This arrangement is satisfactory to the Bank. During
negotiations, assurances were obtained that NEB will continue to use consult-
ants satisfactory to the Bank,
4.12      Construction will be carried out by contractors and the suppliers
of equipment. Transmission line construction will be done by NEB crews
which are capable of undertaking this work. These arrangements have worked
well in the past and would be satisfactory for the project.
4,13      In view of the uncertainty in predicting the growth in sales
and demand (see Chapter 5) NEB has decided to construct the civil works
for three 120 H4 units at Port Dickson and the associated transmission
lines. The orders for the three boilers and turbo-alternators would
be placed so that delivery dates would permit the first two units to go
into service in 1973 - 1974 in time to meet known new system loads and
the increase in demand by PRHE through 1974, since these have been
identified and can be expected on schedule. The third unit would be
scheduled for service in 1976 but NEB would have the option of cancelling
this unit should load growth not require its installation by the scheduled
date. The disbursements of the proposed loan will not be affected by
delays in the installation of the third unit since this equipment would
be financed from bilateral or supplier credits,
Procurement and Disbursement
4.14      All orders for equipment financed from the Bank loan would be
awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding under the Bank's
Procurement Guidelines. Orders for the boilers and turbo-alternators for
Port Dickson would be financed through bilateral or supplier credits and
would be procured by bids being invited by NEB on an international basis
following the usual practice in Malaysia. In order to insure the complete
financing of the Port Dickson station extensiorB agreement was reached
during negotiations that the Bank would not make disbursement for Port
Dicksoh from the proposed loan until financing had been arranged by N7B for
the boilers and turbo-alternators.
4.15      No contracts are expected to be awarded before the loan is signed.
Disbursements from the proposed Bazi loan would be made against thle presenta-
tion of the usual documents evidencing the expenditure of foreign exchange
for equipment, materials and services.  If savings are made any excess loan
funds iviould be cancelled.

5. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
Estimate of Sales and System Demand
5.01      The power market served by NEB has had a long history of steady
and substantial growth with a 15.8% average annual increase in total
sales since 1963. As already referred to in paragraph 3.05, the economy
was disrupted by the civil disorders in May 1969 and a forecast of future
sales growth is consequently more than usually difficult to make because
the country has not yet returned to normal. On the basis of the review
made during the appraisal of this loan, the forecast made for the previous
loan was modified downward to take account of the growth rate of 9.6%
experienced in 1969.
5.02      In the light of experience since May 1969, it was decided that
the projected general system sales (excluding the PRHE sales and sales
to large new consumers) would be lowered to an average of about 11% per
annum compared to the historic average of 13.5%. Next, known new in-
dustries now under construction were listed and the estimated sales to
these customers for the next two years were taken into account. When
the PRHE's bulk power purchases are added to the forecast general system
sales, NEB's total sales would increase by 15.1% in 1970, 10.9% in
1971; 16% in 1972 and 20.6% in 1973. (See paragraph 2.16). Thereafter
the growth rate is forecast at about 10% per annum. This sales forecast
is considered realistic. It could be exceeded but it is unlikely that
it will not be attained unless some major set back were to occur again.
5.03      Annexes 6 and 8 give a tabulation and chart of system generating
capacities and actual and forecast system demands from 1967 to 1979. A
sensitivity test was made by using a so called "normal" forecast, derived
as described in 5.02 above, and "low" forecast, which assumed that the
system would not grow at all and that growth in demand would be confined
to increases in consumption by existing customers only. The result shows
that even under the extremely pessimistic assumptions of the "low" fore-
cast the project would still be required to meet system demand during
the period under review. The financing plan would remain viable even
with the lower sales and revenues of the "low" forecast (see paragraph
6.04).
5.04      As already explained in paragraph 2.11, NEB's consultants have
made extensive studies of the power expansion Drogram and have shown that
the proposed project is the least cost next step. The cost of the project
is about US$145 per kW installed, which is about the average for similar
installations in the region. The incremental rate of return of the project,
tho discount rate at which the present worth of the capital cost of the
project ecuals the present worth of the net revenues derived frcm it over
its life, is l2%.

6.  FIiAiNCING PLaN AND FUTURE FINANCIAL POSITION
Financing Plan
6.01      During the construction period of the project (1970-76) a sub-
stantial part of the Temengor hydro project is to be constructed as well.
In view of this, the financing plan covers the nine year period ending
August 31, 1978 in wlhich all payments for both projects will be made.
During this period, net internal cash generation is expected to finance
55% of the financial requirements. With the inclusion of items such as
contributions and drawdown of cash and bank balances, internal sources
are expected to finance 60% of the requirements. Borrowings will therefore
have to cover only 40%. The following table gives a summary of the
financing plan:

6.o2      The borrowings of US$117.8 million equivalent would consist
of (aN tim or;d½b"rsed balances as of August 31, 1969, totaling US$21.0
iaillion of BRdJ loans 458-MA and 579-1I; (b) bila-teral credits arranged
in connection with MED's fourth power project totaling US-$7.4 million;
(c) the proposed Bank loan of US$20 million for 20 years with a grace period
of h½ years which would finance 34% of the total cost of the project; (d)
bilateral financing estimated at US$26.7 million for the proposed project,
as discussed in paragraphs 4.09 and 4.10; and (e) future loans which have
not yet been arranged for Temengor and other future projects.
6.03      A sensitivity analysis was made on the basis of the lower forecast
for energy sales discussed in paragrach 5.03. It was found that even under
the worst possible circiwrstances there woul.d only be a gap of 5% in the
financing plan and that th-is gap could easily be bridged by appropriate
adjustments in the plan.
Future Earnings and Financial Position
6.o4      The income statement- projections (Annex 5B) and the table on
financial staUistics (Annex 3B) show a satisfactory level of earnings during
the nine years to August 31, 1978.  Tne projections are based on the assump-
tions mentioned in paragraphs 9 and 10 of Annex 11. Because of sizable addi-
tions to plant in some years and an irregular pattern of annual tax payments,
the rate of return, which is calculated after taxes, is expected to fluctuate
during the period between lows of 7.5 - 8.0% and peaks of 8.5 - 10.4%. Since
the growth of sales is based on a conservative estimate which is in fact ex-
pected to be exceeded, there is no need to consider a change in the tariffs.
If temporary shortfalls in the rate of return do occur, waivers of the rate of
return obligation might be granted, provided that the level of internal cash
generation remains satisfactory.
6.05      With the coming into operation of more efficient generating units,
cost per kVh sold (excluding taxes) are expected to gradually decline from
14 cents 5.2 in 1969/70 to IM cents 4.6 in 1977/78. The operating ratio would
remain at about the present satisfactory level of 68%.
6.06      Interest coverage by income before interest would range from 1.9
to 3.0 times and debt service coverage by internal cash generation from 1.9
to 2.2 times.  These are satisfactory ratios.  The Debt/EIuity ratio would
remain a-> about 55/45 for about four years and would then gradually improve
to 44/56 at the end of 1977/78, which is a reflection of the fact that NEB
retains most of its earnings and that dividend payments, which are limited
by ordinance to 6% on the face value of the stock are expected to amount to
only about 10% of net annual profi- at the end of the forecast period.
6.07      Under the debt service covenant of Loan 579-MA, NEB may only incur
new debt, without the Bank's approval, if the maximumn future debt service is
covered at least 1.5 times by net revenues during the fiscal year or a later
twelve-month period preceding the date on which the new debt is drawn down.
During negotiations agreement was reached to repeat this covenant in the
proposed loan.

7.  .`SURAN'JFS OBTAPET,D DURING NEGOTIATIONS
7.01      At loan negotiations assurances were obtained that:
(a) the Bank will be consulted before appointments are made
to the positions of General Manager, Deputy General Manager
and Chief Financial Officer (paragraph 3.07);
(b) Nfl3 will maintain tariffs at a level to yield a rate of return
of not less than 8% per annum on net fixed assets in opera-
tion (paragraph 3.11);
(c) NEB will continue to employ auditors satisfactory to the
Bank (paragraph 3.17);
(d) NEB will continue to limit its short-term debt to M$10 mil-
lion (paragraph 3.26);
(e) NEB will continue to engage consultants satisfactory to
the Bank (paragraphs 3.08, 3.09 and 4.11);
(f) the Bank will not disburse on the items for Port Dickson
station to be financed from the loan until satisfactory
supplementary financing has been obtained for the Boilers
and Turbo Alternators (paragraph 4.14);
(g) NEB will not incur long-term debt without the Bank's approval
unless its debt service coverage exceeds 1.5 times (para-
graph 6.07).

staff quarters is included under operating costs and depreciation chargeable on hire apparatus and re-
chargeable work has been deducted from other income.

National Electricity Board of the States of Malaya
Notes on Financial Statements and Forecasts
1.,       The financial staterments for the years ending August 31, 1963
through 1969 were audited by I.cssrs. Price > aterhouse & Co. and their opinicn
ias unqualif ied.
2.        NEB's accounts reflect historic costs.  Long-term borrowings in foreign
currencies have been converted into Malaysian dollars at rates of exchange rnJling
at the dates of the loan agreements. Because of the revaluation and devaluation
of foreign currencies there was, at the 31 of August 1969, a contingent asset of
about I$9.3 million representing the excess of the Malaysian dollar equivalern, of
long-term loans in foreign currencies shown in NEB's accounts over the NEB's
liability for repayment of these loans. Due to the German revaluation this
contingent asset has since been reduced to about M$3 million.
3.        Included in the fixed assets are M$21.2 million for land of wihich
14$l.0 million is in respect of freehold land taken over from the Government unrder
the provisions of the Electricity Ordinance for which it has not yet been possible
to obtain satisfactory titles. The Federal Government has undertaken to assist
NEB to obtain titles to this land from the State Governments concerned; it i£ not
anticipated that NEB will suffer any damages because of the lack of titles,
14.       NEB collects capital contributions from new customers if the invest-
ment in an extension is not expected to earn an adequate rate of return.  The
Government makes capital contributions for rural electrification schemes.  These
contributions are not repayable and are not a part of the rate base. NEB
transfers annually 15% of the total accumulated contributions to revenues.
5.        NEB uses straight-line depreciation. The average depreciation ranged
between 3.9% and 3.5% in the 5 years ending August 31, 1969. For the forecasts
an average depreciation rate of 3.5% has been used which is conservative.
6.        NEB is presently paying dividends at the annual rate of 5%, the legal
limit being 6%. No increase in the dividend rate paid is anticipated but the
actual amount paid to shareholders will decrease from M$8.3 million in 1968/69
to M$5.0 million from 1969/70 onwards as NEB will have to withhold the 40%
income tax.
7.        By a 1969 amendment to the Income Tax Act, NEB has been removed from
the schedule of tax exempt statutory bodies and is now liable to pay income,
development and payroll taxes the same as any private company. As the Malaysisn
tax laws grant substantial capital allowances to tax payers making heavy capital
expenditures and these allowances are partly granted in the year when the
assets come into operation ITEB tax payments will be subject to substantial
fluctuations in future years.

8.        In connection with loan 579-1MA, NEB obtainedUJdaltaLafi'nanFrng Tor'hpl,
turbo-alternators and boilers of Port Dickson units 3 and 4. A British Govern-
ment loan of 1V$15,129,606 granted to the Malaysian Government interest free and
for a period of 25 years including 7 years' grace to finance the turbo-alternators
will be relent to NEB for 25 years including 7 years' grace at an estimated 6%
interest. For the boilers an Indian suppliers' credit was obtained for
I,07,198,194 at 5% interest for 12 years including 2 years' grace.
9.        The projections are based on the following assumptions:
(a) Sales of energy as discussed in paragraph 5.02;
(b) Accounts receivable, accounts payable and consumers' deposits will
increase at the same annual rate as sales of energy;
(c)  Tariffs will be maintained at their present level, with the
exception of the tariffs to the Perak River Hydroelectric Power
Company which will be raised by about 15% in 1971/72;
(d) The proposed Bank loan will be for US$20 million for a period of
20 years including a grace period of h1 years, with interest at 7%
and commitment charges of 3/4%;
(e) The proposed bilateral financing will total US$26.7 million at
63$ interest and is to be repaid in twelve equal annual installments
beginning in 1974/75; and,
(f) The entire surplus after dividends will be transfered to reserves,
and there will be no transfer of reserves into ordinary stock capital.
10.       The forecasts for operating, administration and maintenance expenses3
have been based on present costs for each method of generation, adjusted for 1oel
consumption and annual increases in salaries and wages of 10%.
