were unsatisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the project\n            implementation should start only after all the essential\n            preparatory work has been completed, and conversely, doing\n            the preparatory work during implementation should be avoided\n            as much as possible. Once the implementation has started,\n            persistence and perseverance are important for the success\n            of the project. Once a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) has\n            been signed by the government with the Bank, to follow the\n            Bank's procurement guidelines, it is important for the\n            government to follow the Bank's procurement procedures\n            so that unnecessary delays can be avoided. It is good to\n            complete land acquisition and other social aspects of the\n            project before the commencement of the implementation as\n            these matters normally take a longer time than expected.\n            Using qualified consultants to assist with the original\n            design and cost estimates will prevent large changes in the\n            project during the implementation. It is important to\n            establish a clear results framework from the outset and only\n            identify results that are measureable. Also, it is necessary\n            to evaluate the project's performance against these\n            results framework on regular basis, and not against\n            disbursement rate that cannot necessarily be a good proxy\n            for project performance."}, "docdt": "2010-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
