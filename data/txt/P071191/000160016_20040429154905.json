During the\n            construction phase, expected impacts include noise and dust\n            nuisances, construction waste disposal, and safety concerns.\n            Other impacts during operation include odors, sludge\n            removal, and disease and hazard prevention and control. To\n            reduce noise, build in damping in the plant, screen plant\n            equipment with sandbags, notify residents, confine noisy\n            work to daytime, equip workers with protective devices, and\n            restrict construction traffic in the nighttime. Lessen\n            vibration impacts by using modernized and well-maintained\n            equipment, limit the use of percussive equipment when\n            excavating sewer trenches and tunnel shafts, use dead weight\n            when compacting trenches close to the building, provide\n            building supports, and locate works away from sensitive\n            buildings. To relieve impacts from dust, restrict work on\n            excessively windy days, spray unsealed routes and excavation\n            work faces, cover stockpiled excavated material with\n            tarpaulins or spray with water, and equip employees with\n            masks. To avoid traffic congestion, restrict vehicle\n            movement, divert traffic and provide diversion signs,\n            minimize lengths of open trench, and expeditiously complete\n            backfill and reinstatement. Inspect site access roads\n            regularly and make repairs, and cover and pave roads and\n            streets used for laying pipes. Apply protective measures in\n            areas close to historical sites, and implement Chance Find\n            Procedures. Collect and dispose of wastes, demolition, and\n            excavated material at appropriate sites, and restrict\n            surface runoff from the site to prevent water pollution. To\n            ensure public safety and site security, control access of\n            unauthorized personnel, provide pedestrian access, and use\n            safety barriers and signs. To decrease air pollution, do not\n            burn wastes on site, and routinely maintain construction\n            equipment and vehicles to minimize exhaust emissions.\n            Minimize wastes generated during construction, reuse\n            construction wastes where practicable, use appropriate\n            methods for storing waste materials, and dispose of wastes\n            at appropriate sites. To prevent degrading of water quality,\n            monitor raw water and treated water, and avoid\n            cross-contamination with sewage. To prevent water supply\n            reduction, prohibit illegal connections, avoid leakage, and\n            ensure proper maintenance. To maintain occupational health\n            and safety, maintain hygiene, medical surveillance, showers\n            and sanitary facilities, an emergency response plan, and\n            earthquake emergency preparedness procedures. Monitor\n            nematodes, coliforms, and heavy metal content of treated\n            sludge, and transport sludge in closed containers to prevent\n            to infection risks to farmers and the public. Cover\n            equipment and containers likely to cause odor nuisance."}, "docdt": "2004-03-01T00:00:00Z"}
