        Annex 1)
        Document number: 22055 IRN (Interim Assistance Strategy) Date of latest CAS discussion:
        April 16,2001

General Context

Inthe last decade, following almost two decades of war, debt crisis and international isolation which
depreciated the capital stock and disrupted economic and institutional development, Iran embarked on a
far-reaching political, economic and social reformprogram.

A very broadspectrum o f Iran's political actors and society ingeneral has embraced the overall principles
and processes o f the Third (FYDP) Five Year Development Plan 1999-2004.              Complex debate has
centered on the speed, the dislocations, burden and social implications o f the reformprocess, inparticular
with respect to the planned removal o f energy sector subsidies. Mindful o f the transition costs, the
govemment has operated with great caution to avoid social dislocation.

Achievements duringthe period o fthe ThirdFYDPhave been impressive. Iranhas practically no extemal
debt, high foreign reserves, no major balance o f payments pressures and a moderate fiscal deficit, which
now reflects increasingly explicit subsidies, including indirect subsidies (largely in the energy sector).




                                                       2

Growth has been robust with real GDP growing on a 6 percent average during 2000/01                 - 2002/03,
reaching 7.4 percent over the past year. Structural reforms have advanced with gains in financial markets,
trade and price liberalization and tax policy.              Institutional reforms have included increased
decentralization and greater accountability in budget and public expenditure process. Education and
health have realized significant gains. Inclusion o f women has improved with high female education
enrollment at all levels. Female inclusion in the labor force is markedly better (and high by MNA
standards) but still insufficient. Efforts to move from an economy driven by state dominance and
subsidies to increased private sector participation have had some success, though private FDI and
domestic investment remains low by intemational standards. Improvementsinthe investment climate for
the private sector have gone forward, though slowly. Investment for the run-down economic
infrastructure has picked up, but remains constrained, more by the lack o f access to best practice and best
technology than finance.       Social programs targeting poverty and the disadvantaged have undergone
reform, but accountability and results remain uncertain. Finally, following a long period o f neglect,
efficient resource management and environmentally sustainable development have become priorities.

As Iran embarks on the FourthFYDPthis year, it is at a criticaljunction. Continuingthe direction ofthe
ThirdFYDP,there isbroadconsensus on four pillars o fthe FourthFYDP:

                   Achieving fast, sustainable growth, relying on the transition to a market economy.
                   Sharing the h i t s o f growth, addressing the needs o fthe poor and disadvantaged.
                   Enhancingnaturalresource management and the environment.
                   Buildingan efficient, accountable andtransparentpublic sector.

These pillarsrepresent goals about which there i s little debate.

Regarding the water sector, which is one o f the pillars o f the Fourth FYDR, mentioned above, there i s
broad agreement among different groups in Iran on the direction o f the reform agenda. However, less
consensus exist on the paths to be taken to achieve the agenda. Through various consultation processes,
working documents outlining the essence o f the long-term strategies in the above sectors have been
drafted (i.e. Long-Term Water Development Policy Guidelines) calling for the executive branch to start
puttingtogether a program for implementation. As it is the case with other economic sectors, Iranis at an
importantjuncture inwhich it can accelerate its reformprocess and leap forward toward modemization o f
the water sector or at best slow down and underachieve its potential while jeopardizing the sustainability
o f its natural resources.

The Bank's assistance strategy can play a critical role in facilitating Iran's transition and modemization
through a consistent program combining activities on infrastructure development and knowledge
generation on one hand, and actions aimed at bridgingthe gaps between physical resources management
and people/institutions capacity buildingon another hand.

The main issues affecting the water sector in Iran have been identified through various assessments: l o w
water use efficiency in urban and rural uses; limited participation by stakeholders in development
planning and management; large needs for rehabilitation and development o f hydraulic infrastructure for
sustainable water usage; problems o f pollution caused by the discharge o f untreated wastewater into
public waterways and aquifers; and weak institutions involved in the sector and limited coordination
among stakeholders (See also Para. B 2 and B3).

Past involvement o f the World Bank in Iran water sector has been limited and fragmented due to various
factors.   As a result, significant knowledge gaps have emerged. Opportunitiesto reverse this trend have
been sought in the context of the April 16, 2001 Interim Assistance Strategy (2001-2004) through
dialogue, leading to the identification o f promising Bank financed infrastructure projects inwater supply

and sanitation, and irrigation. The emphasis in the dialogue i s slowly changing from a narrowly focused
provision o f commercial financing to a potential strategic partnership indevelopment as Iran i s embarking
onto a reform agenda aimed at promoting growth in a socially and environmentally sustainable way and
focusing on competitiveness and inclusion into the global economy. The objectives o f the Fourth FYDP
and the needs for implementationo f the reform agenda open new opportunities for partnership interms o f
technical assistance and a lendingportfolio aimed at well targeted interventions focusing on integrating
people, institutions and resources while combining infrastructure with knowledge for the water sector.
The Bank should use the large infrastructure needs in the sector to promote capacity building, and
institutional development. The assistance strategy for Iraninmeeting the water sector challenges needs to
be centered on the following interventions:

                 Pricing policy reforms inwater as gradual ways to improve service delivery requiring a
                 particular attention to cost recovery and investment financing;

                 Design tariff schemes to help poor communities retadimprove their livelihoods and
                 access to basic services in lieu o f the current broad interventions and not well conceived
                 cross subsidy system (Water Supply and Sanitation);

                 Capacity building of sector institutions such as the Regional Water Boards, the
                 Regional Water and Wastewater Companies, The National Water and Wastewater
                 Engineering Company etc. The capacity building effort will include technical,
                 operational, financial management, planning, budgeting and other activities related to
                 improvingthe efficiency o f water service delivery; and

                 Manage and plan land and water resources in a well coordinated and integrated way
                 allowing allocation o f resources between sectors and regions in an efficient and socially
                 and environmentally sustainable manner.

The Bank's assistance over the next 10 years puts water supply, sanitation and hygiene, irrigation and
drainage, and water resource management at par ina strategic framework supported by the following four
pillars:

                 Recognizing that investment without reform will be ineffective in reaching the goals o f
                 environmentallyand socially sustainable development;

                 People and institutions shouldbe at the center o f sustainable water resource development;

                 Delivering water and other related services requires substantial expenditures someone has
                 to pay for; and

                 Safeguarding water resources i s a shared responsibility and involves tradeoffs.

Through flexible and simple interventions takmg into considerations Iranian planning and budgeting
institutions, The World Bank program will support the water sector while focusing on the political
economy o f change and recognizingthe important implementationschallenges. The Bank will not seek to
intervene in all aspects of water but would identify those opportunities where it can improve
implementation, establish the right framework for monitoring and evaluation and strengthen the national
and provincial institutional capacity to carry out reform and achieve results.

Water supply and Sanitation Context

The Bank strategy for assisting Iran, as described above and in Interim Assistance Strategy, reviewed
current development situation in Iran, progress of the process of reforms, and highlighted the
development challenges and prospects faced by the country, particularly with respect to water and
sanitation. It also outlined the assistance strategy that the Bank Group will follow during the next two to
three following years while preparing a Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). The Interim Assistance
Strategy was also complemented by an "Urban Water and Sanitation Sector Note", which was discussed
at a World Bank Institute (WBI) workshop on June 2002, and endorsedby the Government in September
2003. Government and Bank agreedon the following: (i) strategy, (ii) implementationprogram for
                                                            the              the
Bank assistanceto be part o f the coming CAS (2004-2007), and (iii)     the key performance indicators (See
Annex 13) for the sector.

2.      Mainwater supplyand sanitationsector issues and Government strategy:
About 96% o f the urban population i s connected to public water supplies. By contrast, only about 16% i s
connected to public sanitary sewerage and only part o f the collected sewage i s treated before disposal.
The bulk o f sewage is discharged untreated and constitutes a major source of pollution to groundwater
and a risk to public health. Ina number of cities without sanitary sewerage, households discharge their
sewage through open rainwater drains.

World Bank Assistance to the Sector: Inaddition to preparing and disseminating the Water Supply and
Wastewater Sector Note in2002 the World Bank has an active Tehran SewerageProject.

World Bank Sector Assistance Strategy: Followingthe discussions that took place in September 2003,
the GO1and the Bank agreed:

(i)     to adopt the main conclusions of the sector strategy note which emphasized institutional reforms,
        i.e., clarification and demarcation of the responsibilities of the institutions involved; streamlining
         of financial policies; implementation of a tariff scheme consistent with the cost recovery
         objective; optimization of investment; selecting appropriate least-cost technologies; addressing
         environmental and healthconcerns; and implementingan integrated water resource management.

 (ii)   to implementthe agreedupon strategy inthe followingthree phases:

         Phase I:Execution o f the water and sanitation investment projects for the two cities of Ahwaz
         and Shiraz (2004-2009) and preparation and initiation o f sector reforms (2004). This includes the
        preparation drafting o f terms o f reference-TOR and selection of consultants) o f studies and
        technical assistance(TA) programs covering the following areas: demand management, customer
         education, institutional reforms, the regulatory framework, tariffs and cost recovery, technology
         and investment priorities, sanitation strategy and integrated water conservation. A new tariff
        policy will be drafted duringthis phase with WBI assistance. WBI will also assist inpreparing
         workshops relatedto institutions and sanitation strategy.

         Phase 11: Execution o f the water and sanitation investment projects for the four cities of Rasht,
         Anzali, Sari and Babol (2005-2010), launching o f the studies prepared in phase I,and
         implementationo fthe new tariff scheme initiated andpreparedinphase 1.

         Phase 111: Implementation of reforms prepared under the first two phases. Investment projects
         will thenbeprepared for other new cities under an adaptableprogramloan(APL).

3.       Sector issuesto be addressed by the project and strategic choices:

Issues

(a)      Poor performance of water supply and on-site wastewater disposal facilities, causing increasing
         risk for ground and surface water pollution and health and environmental risks resultingfrom the
         discharge andre-use ofuntreated effluent for irrigation.

(b)      Limitedtechnical, institutional and financial capacity of WWCs.

(c)      Lack o f clarity o f institutional responsibilities o f sector entities.

(d)      Nontransparent andinadequatetariff structures and levels.

Inaddressingtheseissuesthe projectwill aimat:

(a)      increasing coverage of sanitation services in the proposed cities in significant proportions and
         improving access to quality water supply;

(b)       improving the financial and operational performance of Ahwaz and Shiraz WWCs;

(c)      implementing a capacity building component for the WWCs concerned and other sector
         institutions; and

(d)      preparingthe reform agenda that will be implementedinphases I1and I11definedinthe strategy.

C.       Project DescriptionSummary
1.       Project components (See Annex 2 for a detailed description and Annex 3 for a detailed cost
         breakdown):

Long-term development plans have been designed for the extension of water and wastewater system and
facilities in Ahwaz and Shiraz over the period 2004-2027. These plans are formulated to serve a
population o f about 2.2 and 1.9 million respectively inAhwaz and Shiraz by 2027. They are scheduled to
be implementedin four phases and the project under consideration covers works proposed under phase 1
(Refer to the enclosedmap). Areas to be covered will be as follows:

InAhwaz: The water component ofthe project aims at improving the quality ofwater andregulating the
pressure in the water system. This will be done by rehabilitating the existing water treatment plants and
providing additional treatment to ensure adequatewater quality, constructingfive new reservoirs with the
required pumping stations, and implementing the necessary transmission lines. Additionally,
rehabilitation o f the water network and implementation of 19,000 house connections will take place
where needed throughout the project period. Financing o f the house connections will be done from the
WWC's ownrevenues.

To upgrade and expand the treatment capacity of the water treatment plants No. 1 and 2, dual media
filtration, ozonation and activated powder injection systems are proposed to be added. Inlight o f the lack
of sufficient local experience with such technologies, a design and build contract whereby services from
internationalexperience i s acquired i s beingconsidered.

The wastewater component includes the improvement and rehabilitation o f the existing treatment plant in
the west o f Ahwaz (Choneibeh) including the construction o f 9 kmpipeline from the treatment plant to
the proposed sludge lagoon that will be constructed under the project. Additionally, this component
includes the construction of the first two modules of a new treatment plant inthe east o f Ahwaz, and the
implementationofthe wastewater collection systemthat are planedto connect 750,000 personsby 2007.




                                                           6

In Shiraz: The water component will finance works that will increase supply capacity and regulate the
pressure inthe water network. This will be achieved by digging and equipping 17 wells; constructing four
reservoirs, the required pumping stations and pressure reducing valves; and laying and extension o f the
transmission and distribution system. Rehabilitation o f the water network and implementation o f 22,000
house connections will take place where needed throughout the project period. Financing o f the house
connections will be done from the WWC's own revenues. The wastewater component will include works
that will extend the collection system in the city, the construction o f the first two modules o f a new
wastewater treatment plant and the provision o f outfalls from the treatment plants

For the wastewater treatment works o f the first phase in both cities, it i s proposed to apply the
design-build-operate approach in order to optimize the design and to ensure proper operation and
maintenance o f completed works inthe initial stages o f operation while buildinglocal capacity to runthe
treatment plants. Build-operate and transfer-type o f contracts would be considered for the subsequent
phases. These contracts will increase the involvement o f international private sector in providing
wastewater services, which will ensure sustainable service delivery.

The project also includes operation and maintenance equipment and TNtraining/consultant services for
institutional development and project management, engineering design and construction supervision,
updating o f the wastewater development program and feasibility studies and engineering design for phase
2 investments.

The proposed Bank loan would be US$279.00 million. No co-financing has been raised only few
institutions such as the Islamic Development Bank are active in the sector. The remaining amount o f
about US$190.82 million equivalent would then be provided by Government and locally through internal
cash generation. Bank financing under interceptors and laterals would, to a large extent, be limited to
pipes with a size above 200 mm serving as interceptors. The cost estimates are based on prices o f latest
contracts awarded and on current Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE) rate o f 8,400 Rials to one US$, and
future exchange rates will be adjusted to local inflation to take place during the years o f project
implementation.

2.    Key policy and institutionalreformssupportedby the project:

The contribution o f the project to reforms will be threefold. First, it sets well-defined financial and
operational performance criteria, the main ones being to reach a workmg ratio equal to 0.75 and an UFW
ratio below 27% by the end o f the project. Meeting these criteria will require considerable effort interms
o f technical, financial and commercial management. Second, it initiates the preparation o f a
comprehensive sector reform agenda that would be implemented in future phases (see paragraph B-2).
Third, it has an upgrading component (training, TA, equipment and establishment of Technical Support
Units(TSU) withinWWCs andNWWEC) aimed at strengthening the overallmanagementcapacity o fthe
companies involved.

3.       Benefitsandtarget population:
The proposed project i s expected to benefit a population o f about 2.4 million people, living in two large
cities and representing about 3.5% o f the population o f Iran. While the water systems are well developed
and population coverage i s almost total inthe two cities, sewerage coverage i s very l o w and the need to
develop adequate sewage systems i s urgent. Only one wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), located in
Ahwaz, i s inoperation at the present time and even this plant treats only part o f the generated wastewater
and i s inneed o f rehabilitation. Because o f the deleterious effects o f the current state o f living conditions
and the environment, the construction o f modem sewage systems is expected to generate significant
health and environmental benefits.

The implementation o f the project will address the water and sanitation needs o f the populationo f the two
cities, a large proportion o f which i s poor. The topographic characters o f the cities in question and the
downstream effects o f water and sewage flow are such that the most polluted areas are the ones inhabited
by the poorest o f the population. Traditional water-related diseases such as helminthes, hepatitis A,
conjunctivitis, s k m diseases, and to a lesser extent typhoid and cholera are quite prevalent.

4.       Institutional and implementationarrangements:
Sector Organization: Several institutions are involved inthe sector. At the central government level it i s
under the responsibility o f the Ministry o f Energy (MOE), with a deputy minister specifically incharge of
water and sanitation. At the regional level eleven Water Boards manage and allocate water resources
while thirty-three provincial and city WWCs provide supply water and wastewater services. These
WWCs are assisted by NWWEC in matters of policy, investment planning, human resources
development, and in the establishment of standardized systems and procedures. Finally, the National
Economic Council sets tariffpolicy for the whole country, with some differentiation across regions.

Implementation Arrangements

Project Management
Each WWC will be responsible for the management and implementation of its project and for subsequent
operation and maintenance of the facilities that will bebuilt.TSUs will be established within each WWC
and the NWWEC to strengthen capacity within Govemment institutions. Responsibilities of the TSUs in
WWCs will include planningcoordination, monitoring and reportingwhile the TSU inNWWEC will also
be incharge of consolidating periodic reports for all implementingagencies.NWWEC will also assistthe
WWCs in preparing International Competitive Bidding (ICBs) and large value consultancies. TSUs will
report directly to their respective WWCs and NWWEC. Duringnegotiations of the project, agreementhas
beenreached onthe TSUs' staffing levels and responsibilities.

Project Implementation and Schedule
WWCs/TSUs will use local consultants for engineering design and construction supervision for routine
works, but would need foreign expertise for complex works such as wastewater treatment works. Final
agreementon these arrangementshasbeenreached duringnegotiations.

Important packages of the project, estimated at a total amount o f about US$SO million, are at a final
design stage and are scheduled for the first year o f the implementation period. MOE and WWCs have
agreed to hire consultants to prepare tendering documents to be ready for execution by Bank loan
effectiveness. Still a satisfactory implementation o f the Project requires that: (i)
                                                                                   WWCs be supported by
competent TSUs; and (ii) Management and Planning Organization (MPO) and WWCs provide
                              the
counterpart funds on a timelybasis.

Project Monitoringand Supervision
Fulfillment of the key performance indicators will be monitored along with the execution of the project
and TSUs are expected to play a major role inbothmonitoring and supervising the project.

Bank supervision will also be needed, which will require significant resources, particularly inthe first two
years o f implementation. Inaddition, capacity building will require a major effort. On average, two to
three supervision missions per year will be needed with approximately 25 staff weeks for each year, i.e.
 125 staffweeks for the whole project implementationperiod.

FinancialManagement

The Ahwaz and Shiraz Water and Waste Water Companies (WWC) operate as private sector entities and
the financial systems inplace are based on the principles and procedures of the trading law o f The Islamic
Republic o f Iran. The responsibility for the project implementation will be assigned to the respective
WWC and the NWWEC. Each o f these water companies will be assisted by a TSU to follow on the
project activities including the preparation of the project accounts and financial statements. The BRD
loan will be lent to The Islamic Republic o f Iranwho will channel part ofthe proceeds and make available
the counterpart financing, on-budget transfer basis, to the WWCs while the balance of the loan will be
channeled inthe form o f liability. The repayment o f the capital and all cost associatedwith the part of the
loan, made available as liability, such as commission and commitment fees would be the responsibility of
the respective WWC. As per applicable rules the WWCs have to meet certain internal requirements,
requested by the Ministry of Finance, prior to receiving this part o f the loan proceeds. The decision to
process the funds inthe form of loans or grants will depend on the nature o f the activity financed with all
sewerage capital investment to be financed through budget transfers from the central government to the

WWCs. The part o f the project made available to the water companies on budget transfers basis will be
implemented through the regulations governing the national budget processes. All payments, under this
part o f the project, will be subject to the applicable government controls. These controls are appliedby the
1) MPO with mandate to allocate the needed funds, from the loanproceeds and counterpart funds through
a framework agreement with the WWCs; 2) the Ministry o f Economic Affairs and Finance (MEAF) who
assigns the financial controllers responsible for payments control, co-signing o f checks, keeping accounts
o f the spending unit and providing monthly financial reports to the treasury; and 3) the Court o f Accounts
(COA) who perfonns post audits to the transactions and payments under this part o fthe project. The flow
o f the funds to be channeled on lending basis to the companies will be subject to the policies, procedures
and controls inplace at the water companies. These controls have been found to be adequate. Accordingly
these procedures and controls being the government and the WWC, plus the engagement o f an external
independent auditor, will be used to follow on the overall project funds being the loan proceeds and the
counter part financing. While part o f the technical assistant component o fthe project, will be implemented
by The NWWEC who operates as a private sector entity and collect fees from the WWC across the
country.

The two W W C and the NWWEC are equipped with accounting systems that are capable o f generating
year-end financial statements. However, it was observed that the accounting systems require enhancement
to become capable o f generating timely project reports including the Bank required Financial Monitoring
Reports (FMRs). To overcome this limitation in the project reporting the NWWEC, who overview and
monitor the operations o f the WWC inthe country, has proposed to open a cost center within the present
accounting systems used by the WWCs. This cost center will be configured to report on transactions
relating to the project including the source and use o f funds and the activities financed through the project
funds. It was agreed that a version o f the system will be configured to reflect this additional cost center
prior to end o f June 2004. The services o f a financial officer, to be domiciled within each o f the TSUs,
will be required prior to project effectiveness. This officer has to collaborate with the MEAF controller,
maintain the project accounts with the help o f the configured accounting system, prepare the project
budget and consolidate the accounts for the generation o f the project Financial Monitoring Reports
(FMRs). Inorder to institutionalize these tasks the financial officer will prepare, with the assistance of a
consultant, a project manual for financial procedures detailing the tasks and procedures for the project
including the flow of funds and information between the various units implementing the project.

The NWWEC will submit to the Bank, quarterly and within 45 days from the end o f the Iran Hejri
calendar quarter, a set of FMRs presented in Englishdetailing the project financial status at each o f the
two water companies and the consolidation o f the over all activities. The FMR format was prepared and
agreed with the borrower.

The Borrower opted to replenish the Special Account (SA) using transaction based disbursement, by
means o f Statements of Expenditures (SOEs), usingthe SA for those expenditures below the disbursement
letter threshold, and by direct payments accompanied by supporting documentation for the balance. The
Project's financial statements will be audited annually by an external independent auditor, acceptable to
the Bank, in accordance with intemationally accepted auditing standards. The WWCs will submit the
project audit reports and the entity audited financial statements to the Bank not later than six months
following the closing o f the fiscal year subject to the audit. The fiscal year inThe Islamic Republic o f Iran
follows the Hejri Solar Calendar thus startingon March21, xx andending on March20, xx+l. The project
audit Terms of Reference (TOR) will be prepared and submitted for the Bank's n o objection, n o later than
nine monthsprior to the end o f each fiscal year.

As the different portions o f the loan, depending on the channeling modality, will be subject to different
regulations and controls, and to ensure that funds are available for project implementation five U S $
Special accounts will be opened in addition to the accounts for the counter part financing. Each water
company will open two U S $ Special Accounts and will follow on the project withdrawal applications

and direct payment requests relating to its activities. While the NWWEC will manage the fifth $ SA

D.      Project Rationale
1.      Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:

Rationale for Selecting the Cities
The two cities have been selected for eligibility under the proposedproject from a list o fprioritizedurban
areas included in the five-year development plan. This selection i s based on the criteria of existing
environmental conditions, including important environmental externalities going beyond the city's
geographical boundaries, sewerage conditions and threat to health, existing social conditions, and
progress inproject preparation. The degree o f pollution or pollution threat is the main selection criterion.
InAhwaz the main source ofwater, the Karoon River,is highlypollutedby wastewater discharges.This
river, whichi s the largest inIran, is also the source ofwater for other important cities located downstream
of Ahwaz. The city o f Shiraz, which has a rich cultural heritage and a great tourism potential, has a weak
wastewater collection system and no treatment facilities.

Alternatives Considered
Altematives analyzed are of strategic and technical nature:


(i)     Strategic: Public utilities versus private sector approach: Currently, neither the local legal
        and institutional environment nor the internationalconditions are favorable for thejump-start into
        advanced forms of private sector involvement such as build-operate-transfer (BOTS) or
        concessions. Deep reforms have yet to be implementedin many areas: procurement regulations,
        foreign exchange regulations, banlung (there are currently only public banks), foreign
        participation, labor regulations, etc. Lifting constraints and creating an enabling environment for
        the development of the private sector i s an important objective for Iran in general, regardless of
        what takes place inthe water sector. The fulfillment of this objective takes a macroeconomic and
        institutional dimensionthat goes beyond the water sector. Some of these reforms may be fostered
        through this project but most o f them require important structural horizontal actions rather than
        sector-specific actions. Discussions about other arrangements such as service or management
        contracts are also premature before a proper enabling environment is put in place, the legal
        framework i s overhauled and the reforms listed above, particularly in the area o f pricing, are
        implemented.


(ii)    Technical: Inthe course o f the preparation of the development program, different alternatives
        were evaluated with respect to the number and location of treatment works, on-site sanitation,
        alignments for the trunk main systems, method o f pipe-laying, pipe materials, and phasing for
        programimplementation.

                 The option o f on-site sanitation was found unfeasible in Ahwaz and Shiraz due to high
                 water tables. The borrower expressedthe concern of polluting the water tables in case of
                 improper construction of on-site sanitation. Furthermore, the government has already
                 invested significant resources in the upgrading and expansion or in the construction o f
                 treatment plants (Choneibeh inAhwaz, Emergency Zone inShiraz). Finally, various parts
                 o f the trunkmains are beingimplementedwith local financing.

                 For the wastewater treatment works alternative treatment processes; activated sludge,
                 oxidation ditches, oxidation ponds and aeratedlagoons, and site locations were evaluated
                 with the activated sludge method proved to be the least cost solution. The comparison

                 between the different altematives took into account investment, long-term operation and
                 maintenance costs as well as evaporation and seepage costs.           Under the project all
                 treatment plants will be tendered as a design-build-operate (DBO) contract, consequently
                 the final treatment process will be agreed upon through bidding.

         (c)     Various options have also been analyzed on the handling o f sludge, which will be treated
                 sufficiently to ensure its use for soil conditioning; and

         (d)     For the wastewater treatment works considerations have also been given to conventional
                 financing versus a DBO contract. For phase 1, it was also proposed to apply the DBO
                 approach in order to optimize the design and to ensure proper operation and maintenance
                 o f completed works.

3.       Lessons learned and reflected inthe project design:

The lessons learned from the Tehran Sewerage Project will be incorporated inthe design o f this project.
The experience with this project highlights the need to: (i)    establish strong project management capacity
through locating TSUs within Government entities and WWCs rather than outside and to retain
institutional capacity within government institutions; (ii)      plan and finance the necessary household
connections to the water distribution and wastewater collection networks; (iii)    familiarize the Borrower's
staff withBank requirements, including those relatedto safeguards; (iv) have an appropriate tariff scheme
to ensure the financial viability o f the WWCs; and (v) consider a selective use o f the private sector.

4.       Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
Borrower commitment and ownership are reflected through (i)           Government giving high priority to the
sector, particularly to wastewater in its long-term planning and its request to the Bank for continued
support to the sector; (ii) MOE financing from its own budget the background studies and its willingness
to pay (WTP) for detailed engineering and preparation of tenders for this project; (iii)        WWCs taking
initiatives to respond quickly to the Bank's requirements and formally agreeing on the proposed strategy
inthe sector and future collaborationwith the Bank; and (iv) willingness of Government to fund urgent

operations (construction o f network, wastewater treatment plants, etc.) in many cities, including the ones
being considered inthis project, prior to the proposedproject implementation.

5.       Value added of Banksupport in this project:
The value added o f Bank support would mainly include: (i)     addressing a long standing problem, i.e. lack
o f wastewater collection systems within an appropriate policy and financial framework; (ii)     assisting the
Government inthe preparation o f sector reforms; (iii)   introducing key financial and operational indicators
that would improve the efficiency of the WWCs; (iv) providing foreign exchange that i s essential for the
purchase o f mechanical and electrical equipment for water and wastewater treatment works; (v) raising
the level of awareness and attention to environmental, health and social issues; and (vi) fostering
competition through the involvement o f international contractors for major civil works contracts and
equipment.

E.       Summary Project Analysis (Detailed assessmentsare inthe project file, see Annex 8)
         (limit to 2 to 3 pages withone table)

1.       Economic (see Annex 4):

0        Costbenefit                    NPV=US$million;           ERR=% (see Annex 4)
0        Cost effectiveness
0        Other (specify)

The benefits expected under the project from the provision o f modem sewerage systems are better health
for the targeted population, protection o f the limitedwater resources, provision o f an alternative source o f
water for irrigation and reduction inthe cost o f environmental degradation. The main health effect would
be a significant reduction inwater-borne diseases, mainly indiarrhea and dysentery. These diseases result
invarious economic costs - workdays missed for adults and schooldays missedfor youngsters duringthe
sickness period, the cost o f medication and eventually o f hospitalization. In addition, there will be a
significant improvement in the living conditions o f targeted population. The water component will
provide safe and affordable drinkable water to the expanding populationinthe two cities.

Water in Shiraz: The population o f Shiraz, which i s estimated at about 1.2 million inhabitants in 2003,
enjoys almost total coverage by the water supply network. Plannedinvestment is therefore needed to meet
the needs o f future additional population as well as to rehabilitate parts o f the existing network. Since
water demand i s projected over a longer horizon (beyond 2027), this appraisal assumes that other
investments will be carried out at least up to that year.

In the hypothetical situation o f no project households and other users would have to find alternative
means o f meeting their needs, essentially by purchasing water from water vendors at highprices and by
investment in storage capacity. The avoidance o f such cost i s the main benefit o f the project. Secondly,
given the advantage o f house connection over buyingand storing water and the huge difference in cost,
the project will allow households to consume a larger volume o f water than under the alternative, which
will increase their welfare (their consumer surplus). Thirdly, the Shiraz WWC provides water in much
better hygienic conditions than water vendors, which reduces healthhazards. All these benefits will rise in
the future as populationincreases.

Even ifbenefits are limited to the first component, i.e. the cost o f water in the absence of the project, the
investment i s largely justified, yielding an IRR higher than 40% (Annex 4). Sensitivity analysis shows
that IRR remains high, at about 25%, even if benefits are cut by as much as 20% and cost raised inthe
same proportion as compared to the base scenario. The cost o f water under altemative means of supply i s




                                                        13

estimated at about one U S dollar per cum against less than ten cents only for pipe water. Taking into
account the other two types o fbenefits will result inan even higher economic return.

Water in Ahwaz: Like Shiraz, the population o f Ahwaz, which reached over 1.1 inhabitants in 2003, is
fully covered by the water distribution network, but capacity needs to be expanded in treatment and
storage, as well as in the transmission and distribution network in order to meet the future needs o f a fast
growing population.

Economic benefits are similar to those for Shiraz water project Once again, even ifbenefits are limited to
the avoidance o f the cost o f water under the alternative to the project, the estimated economic IRR i s
found to be very high, equal to 32% inthe base case and remaining close to 20% even under unfavorable
assumptions concerning costs and benefits. For Ahwaz, the alternative to meet water demand, which will
be in this case much lower than under the project, i s through the purchase o f bottled water, which i s
partially used during summer time, and more likely through the purchase o f bulk water from water
vendors. This alternative supply i s very costly, estimated at about US$ 1per m3.

Wastewater in Shiraz: Three types o f benefits are separately assessed: avoidance o f the cost of
alternative methods o f sewage discharge if the project i s not undertaken, health benefits and finally the
increase inagricultural value-added that would result from the use o f treated wastewater inirrigation.

Under conservative assumptions concerning the healthbenefits the IRRi s close to 20%. The mainbenefit
o f the project i s saving the cost of absorption wells as an alternative to discharge wastewater, which
accounts for more than 80% of total economic benefits over the period 2004-2027.

Health benefits   are underestimated if they are based only on the illness cases reported to Shiraz public
health services. There are many other cases that are not reported to these services, those that are handled
by private hospitals or clinics or by referring to pharmacies. According to the socio-economic survey
carried out in preparation for the Project, about 7.5% o f households had at least one case o f diarrhea
duringthe two weeks preceding the surveys. Based on this information and on conservative assumptions
concerning the effects o f improper discharge o f wastewater on health, health benefits are estimated to be
much larger than what the official data imply and IRR rises to over 40%. The latter still exceeds 15%
even ifbenefits or cost are respectively lower and higher than inthe base scenario (Annex 4).

Wastewater inAhwaz: Benefits are assessedaccording to the same method as for Shiraz, relying on the
same three types o f economic benefits.   Inthe case of Ahwaz, there maybe anadditionalfourthbenefit, a
less polluted environment inand along the Karoon River, which would stimulate and improve the quality
o frecreational activities inthe city.

Once again it i s believed that official health data underestimate the real extent o f water-borne diseases.
The socio-economic survey for Ahwaz gives about the same ratio for the incidence o f diarrhea among the
population as in Shiraz, which is much higher than the implied official ratio. Based on survey results the
IRRis estimated inthe base scenario at about 8.5% (5.7% basedonHealthDepartment data). Itdeclines
to less than 5% if cost or benefits change unfavorably by 20%. The saving o f the cost o f discharge to
absorption wells accounts for a large proportion o f the project benefits.

These values are much lower than for water. Still they are acceptable, especially when considering that
the project will generate other benefits that are difficult to measure, the main one being the significant
improvement inthe environment and inthe quality o f life, starting with immediate surroundings.

Tariff Policy: The current system comprises connection rights, subscription fees and water consumption
tariffs in addition to the house connection fees, which are directly bome by the customer. All these
components are set and revisedon a periodic basis by the National Economic Council.

Connection rights for water are currently based on dwelling size and a city adjustment coefficient, which
depends on several factors the most important o f which are the cost o f water supply and population
density. Average connection fees are about US$310 for the whole country and the minimum fee is
approximately equal to US$l50. Ahwaz fee is estimated at about US$280 in2003. With a few exceptions,
the connection fee for wastewater i s the same as that for water. These fees have been regularly increased
inthe last five years, at the rate of 10% annually inall these years withthe exception o fthe year 2000 in
which the fee was increased by 15%. In addition to connection fees, the WWCs charge the customer the
fullcost for houseconnection.

Regarding water consumption, the current system is based on a fixed fee that depends only on the size o f
the connection pipe and on the type o f customer (household or other types), and on a volumetric charge
basedon increasing block-tariffs. The fixed fee, or the subscription fee, i s about 2,000 Rials (25 U S cents)
for most domestic customers while the structure o f variable tariffs i s based on a complex formula. The
formula is the same for all WWCs and there i s no volumetric charge ifconsumptionfalls below 5 cumper
month. Above this minimum, prices increase with the level o f consumption and generally vary across
companies. The average volumetric tariff for the country stood at about 6 U S cents in 2002 and it varied
from 2 cents for monthly consumption below 20 cum, to about 4.5 cents and 12.5 cents respectively for
20-40 and for more than 40 cum o f monthly consumption (Annex 4).

Tariffs and water bills are low even ifwhen relatedto income and they are extremely l o w by comparison
withtariffs practicedinrecent years inother countries with similarand even lower per capita income than
Iran, Tariffs inJordan, Tunisia and Yemen, for instance, are between five and fifteen times higher than in
Tehran and several times higher than the average tariffinall o f Iran(Annex 4).

New measures introduced in the system have given conflicting signals as to the direction the tariff
structure is taking. On the one hand tariffs have been raised in greater proportions for higher than for
lower consumption brackets. In addition to the regular increases, the Council introduced since 2001 a
penalty or surcharge for consumption exceeding a certain volume varying across cities in the range o f 18
to 25 cum per month (24 cum for Ahwaz and 20 cum for Shiraz). This penalty was set for the year 2002
at 100% o f the tariff given by the formula for consumption above the cut-off volume. It has been raisedto
150% in 2003 and i s expected to be further increased to 200% in 2004. These changes are thus widening
the tariff gap between low and highconsumption brackets. On the other hand the decision has been taken
to set lower bound and upper bounds for tariffs, defined with respect to average cost. In2002 the lower
bound was set at one fourth of average cost and the upper bound at three times the average cost. This
adjustment explains the significant increase inthe average tariff for the low consumption category o f 0 to
20 cum per month between the years 2001 and 2002. These changes reduce tariff differences between
consumptionbrackets and therefore work inthe opposite direction o f the first measures o ftariff increases.
Moreover, and in spite of these increases, revenues from water sales, and from wastewater when
applicable, do not cover operation and maintenance cost in most cases. The worlung ratio for Ahwaz
WWC is estimated at 96% and 90% respectivelyfor the budgetyears 2001-2002 and2002-2003 while for
Shiraz it has been estimated at 107% and 92% for the same years. These ratios are currently significantly
above the ratio o f 75% targeted for the end o fthe project period.

The rate structure i s needlessly complex for both volumetric rates and connection fees. Volumetric tariffs
are based on complex formulas that differ across consumption brackets and WWCs. Because of this
complexity the tariff structure lacks transparency. Moreover, the structure is such that rates increase by
more than threefold when consumptionrises from 20 cum or less to slightly higher volumes. This sharp




                                                       15

change may not be an issue under the existing system inwhich tariffs are generally low but deserves to be
reviewed under a new framework in which tariffs would be based on costs and rebalanced between
consumption brackets.

 Regarding sewage bills they are currently levied and collected only in city neighborhoods where a
 network exists and are based on water bills (70%). Since these services have been very limited, or
 practically non-existent, the need has not yet been felt by the WWCs to properly assess the costs
 involved. As these services develop costs should be assessed separately from water so as to evaluate the
 appropriateness o f the existing tariff structure.

All these shortcomings point to the need for a consistent and comprehensive tariff reform. Aware o f this
need, the Government has appointed a working group to that effect. According to members o f this group,
the proposed reform will be in line with the objectives set in the draft Fourth Development Plan
(2005-2009), which are simple and transparent tariff structures and full cost recovery for water supply and
wastewater services.

Since most urban households are already connected to the water network and only a few are connected to
a sewerage network that i s yet to be constructed in most cases, the issues o f willingness to pay and
affordability o f connection rights may arise. Inorder to ease the burden the government has facilitated
household access to bank credit for this purpose. For water consumption, a guiding objective i s to
gradually narrow the blockrate spread, which i s too wide under the existing system, to move ultimately to
a unique cost-based tariff system and to provide income subsidies to the poor. This implies that the tariff
reform, along with significant improvements inproductivity and in the management o f these companies,
should aim at reducing this ratio towards the 75% target. The principles stated inthe Fourth Development
Plan are sound and point in the right direction o f an efficiency based tariff policy. Guided by these
principles, a comprehensive and consistent reform should replace the inconsistent piecemeal approach o f
recent years. A workshop on comprehensive tariffreforms i s scheduled under the Project, to be organized
jointly with WE31and with a follow-up on recommendations.

2.      Financial(see Annex 4 and Annex 5):
        NFV=US$ million; FRR=% )

The project will generate financial benefits to the Ahwaz and Shiraz WWCs from several sources,
including: increased water sales and disposal o f wastewater made possibly through the investments
undertaken under the project; income from connection fees made possible from the new water and
wastewater connections due to the project and the increased tariff that will be implemented in order to
meet financial performance targets agreed to between the Government o f Iran and the World Bank. The
analysis has been conducted in current terms based on net cash flows generated by the project over a 25-
year period. The analysis shows that the financial rate o f return (FRR) for Ahwaz would be 13.3% and
 10.2% for Shiraz both o f which are above the 10% assumed cost o f capital. Detailed analysis i s presented
under Annex 5.

FinancialAssessment ofthe Water andWastewater Companies(WWCs):

A detailed analysis has been carried out for the Ahwaz and Shiraz WWCs dealing with the past, current
and future financial performance of the WWCs. The detailed analysis i s presented in Annex 5 whereas
the section below summarizes the financial situation o f the WWCs and the implications of the proposed
project ontheir likely future financial performance.

Past and current performance of the Wastewater Comuanies: Both the Ahwaz and Shiraz WWCs have
been incurring significant net losses in the past which are projected to continue in the year ending
March 20, 2004. While both companies have achieved working ratios (operating expenses/operating
revenue) below 1inthe past, insufficient past spending on maintenance resulted in underestimation of
the working ratios achieved. Maintenance spending as a percentageof gross fixed assets was as low as
0.29% in2002/03 inShiraz and 1.5% on average inAhwaz. The industrystandardcalls for 2.5%-3%.

The financial performance of the companies i s further aggravated by high water losses resulting in a
much larger need for water to pass through the system than i s billed for. Water losses were as high as
45% in 1999/00 and have come down to about 37.7% in 2002103 in Ahwaz and have averaged about
30% inthe past in Shiraz. Of the water that passes through the system, only about 73% was paid for in
terms o f collections in2002/03 inAhwaz. The collection performance has remained the same in2003/04
at about 74%. Nonetheless, at the end of 2002/03, the accumulated accounts receivables equaled 12
months o f billings. In Shiraz, collection performance has been very good inthe past but i s estimated to
have deteriorated in 2003/04 possibly as an effect of increased tariff in 2002/03. The good collection
performance of the past has resulted in relatively manageable accounts receivables, which reached 5.6
months at the endof2002/03.

Future Financial Performance of the WWCs: Projections to assess the future financial position and
performance o f the WWCs have been carried out for the period 200415-2013/14. The project financial
analysis presented above was estimated over the project's 25 year expected lifetime.             The key
assumptions for the projections are presented in Annex 5. Detailed assumptions are recorded in the
project files.




                                                     17

The projections for the future financial performance have been anchored by the financial targets agreed
between the Government o f Iran and the World Bank during their sector strategy discussions in
September 2003. These targets comprise the following:

                  Working ratio o f 0.75 by the financial year 2008/09 (operating expenses excluding
                  depreciation and interedoperating revenue.

                  Labor productivity reaching 3 by project completion (expressed as number o f staff per
                  1,000 water connections).

                  Accounts receivables reduced to 4 months by 2008/09.

          0       Unaccounted for water to reach27% by 2008/09.

The targets aim to gradually improve the financial and operational performance o f the WWCs by
achieving cost recovery o f O&M, and part o f capital investment. Meeting these targets will require
increases in the water and sanitation tariff, but will also depend on simultaneous improvements in
collection performance and a significant reduction in water losses. The main targets will be covenanted
inthe loan agreements, particularly the worlung ratio, collection ratio and UFW. The analysis assumes
that the cost i s govemed by a Bank loan to the company. The Government i s assumed to cover in grant
form the cost o f water components not covered by the Bank loan or connections fees as well as the cost
o f the wastewater components not covered by connection fees.

Likelv Future Financial Performance o f Ahwaz: As illustrated in Annex 5, meeting the targets under the
agreed financing arrangements will require a significant tariff increase o f 84% in 2004/05.      After this
year it would fall to about 32% and then lie around 15% during the rest o f the project implementation
period. The average tariff increase between 2004/05 and 2008/09 would be about 32%. However, a net
deficit would be incurred to the WWC because what remains from the revenues once operating expenses
are covered i s still insufficient to cover depreciation and financial charges. The net accumulated deficit
would amount to US$7.9 over the period 2004/05-2013/14. As a second scenario, the tariff increase
required to achieve full cost recovery, has also been analyzed, which shows that the tariff increase would
initially (in 2004/05) need to be much larger at loo%, but the average tariff increase during the project
implementation period would practically be the same, 33%.           A key prerequisite for both scenarios,
however, i s that an aggressive action plan on improving collections is implemented which includes the
writing-off o f accounts receivables that are deemed unlikely to be collected.         Annex 5 presents a
breakdownof each company's accounts receivables and the assumptions deployedto achieve the target o f
accounts receivables not exceeding 4 months by 2008/09. Similar effort should be made on reducing
water losses. UFW i s high, particularly for Ahwaz.

Likelv Future Financial Performance o f Shiraz WWC: As illustrated in Annex 5, the tariff increases
required differ significantly inthe base and second scenario. Inthe base scenario   - which targets the tariff
increase required to meet the worlung ratio target o f 0.75 by 2008/09         -the tariff increase i s very
significant inthe year 2004/05, about 70% andwould be greatly reducedthe year thereafter to about 23%.
The average tariff increase between 2004/05 and 2008109 would be about 34%. A net deficit of US$10.4
million would be incurred due to what remains from the revenues once operating expenses are covered i s
still insufficient to cover depreciation and financial charges. As in the case o f Ahwaz, the impact on the
required tariff increase differs significantly when seeking full cost recovery. Inthis case, the required
tariff increase in2004/05 would be 88% and the average increase would be 36%. However, an important
issue i s that in the base scenario, Shiraz would have to work hard to improve its performance beyond
meeting the financial targets agreed to in order to avoid negative cash flow inthe years 2004-2008. The
cash flow position would be much better under the scenario where tariffs are increased for full cost-
recovery. The cash flow issues above-mentioned can also be positively affected by improving efficiently
o f operations and by reducingUFW to less than agreed upontarget o f 27% by end o fproject.

3.        Technical:

The project i s technically sound as investments under the project were selected based on a comprehensive
water and wastewater development plan o f the Ahwaz and Shiraz. During the preparation o f these plans,
different technical alternatives were analyzed and the most feasible one was selected. The feasibility
criteria took into account technical, economical, environmental, health, and social factors o f each
alternative. Inboth cities, phasing o f works i s planned in a way to optimize the operation o f the water
system by dividing the project area into pressure zones, reducing as a result pumping costs. For
wastewater, surveys o f wastewater characteristics were carried out and most suitable treatment process
(activated sludge) was selected for the two cities. To achieve the project objectives however, the
implementation capacity o fAhwaz and Shiraz water andwastewater companies should be raised. The rate
o f connections and implementation o f the secondary network i s key to ensure proper operation o f the
treatment plants (proposed and the ones under construction).

4.        Institutional:
4.1       Executingagencies:

Two main executing agencies will implement this project: Ahwaz and Shiraz Water and Wastewater
Companies. The NWWEC and the Department o f Environment (DOE) will also be involved.

4.2       Projectmanagement:

The WWCs, assisted by their TSUs, will plan and manage their project components. They will supervise
construction works, consultants and O&M. They will be in charge o f all procurement issues and will be
supported by the NWWEC in procurement using ICBs and large consultancies. The NWWEC will
consolidate periodic reports, and would prepare with the support o f consultants all ICBs related to the
project. DOEwill be responsible for its component, which is mainly capacity buildingo f the enforcement
role o f the regional departments o f environment. TORSwill be prepared for key TSU staff.

4.3       Procurement issues:

Lessons learned from past and ongoing Bank-financed projects in Iran show difficulties when applying
fiduciary requirements for these projects. There are several procedures and practices under the current
procurement framework in Iran that do not fully conform with the Bank procurement practices. Among
these difficulties i s the approach for recruiting consultants including, restrictions regarding hiring
international consultants, restrictions on participation o f foreign bidders, restrictions on invitations to
bidding to the list of qualified contactors by MPO, absence o f clear evaluation criteria in bidding
documents etc.

The most important impediment for procurement under Bank projects i s the non-adherence to Loan
Agreements. Some institutions that are involved inimplementation do not acknowledge the precedence o f
procurement arrangements stated inloan agreements over national procedures. Some discrepancies exist
between the Bank Guidelines and procedures and some o f the national procedures. Whde procurement
under ICB can be conducted according to the Bank Guidelines with some constraints, the situation i s
more difficult when it comes to the selection o f consultants and national competitive bidding. The
followingtwo agreements havebeenreachedwith the government for loan effectiveness:

(i) Agreement onthe applicabilityoftheBankGuidelinesfor the selection andemploymentof
          consultants and procurement under ICB. This will be ensured by providing a one-year, renewable
          exemption for all procurement packages under the project, which will be carried in accordance
          with the loan agreement (the list of these packages are provided inAnnex 14). This will be later
          replacedby the framework agreement that the Government and the Bank are currently working on
          to address all fiduciary issues for Bank financed projects; and




                                                        19

(ii)      Agreement on National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures that will be acceptable to the
          Bank. This should include the development o f an N C B document that will be acceptable to the
          Bank. This can either be based on a modified national document or a modified version o f the
          Standard BiddingDocuments (SBD) of the Bank.

The second main issue i s the limited capacity in the WWCs to conduct procurement according to the
Bank Guidelines. The current capacity for these companies is limited to conducting local and national
level procurement and mainly for works and recruitment o f design and supervision engineering firms.
Weak knowledge of Englishlanguage i s also a serious constraint. The capacity o f the WWCs should be
enhanced by recruiting competent procurement officers for concerned WWCs, and at NWWEC. These
officers will have the task o f ensuring that Bank procedures are followed during the different phases o f
the procurement cycle. It i s essential that procurement officers be recruited by July 2004 in order to
familiarize themselves with the project and the Bank procedures. Upon recruitment, intensive training on
the Bank procurement procedures should be carried.

The project will be implemented inthe two WWCs. The majority o f the procurement packages shouldbe
launched during the first two years. To prepare for the project and ensure that the first year bidding
packages will be ready by loan effectiveness, the WWCs should recruit consultants to commence the
design and preparation o f biddingdocuments activities for the different works. A critical sub-component
i s the procurement process for the design and construction o f Waste Water Treatment Plants. Takmg into
consideration the required periods for recruiting a consultant to carry out the assignment for the design
and supervision, pre-qualification o f contractors, tendering and award o f contracts and the construction
phase; this sub-component i s already on a tight schedule and the process for long listing of consultants for
the design and supervision should be launchedby June 2004.

4.4       FinancialManagement issues:

The discussions with the government revealed that part o f the loan proceeds will be channeled to the
WWCs inthe form o fbudget transfers while the balance will be transferred inthe form o f liability where
the repayment o f the capital and all cost associated with the interest and commitment fees would be the
responsibility o f the WWC. These additional costs will have impact on the financial status o f the WWCs.
While the funds channeled in the form o f budget transfers, and the counter part financing for part o f the
funds channeled inthe form of liability can only be disbursed after the budget lines are opened withinthe
government budget and a framework agreement detailing the activities to be financed i s signed between
the MPO and each o f the WWCs.

To mitigate the risk o f the WWCs not being able to make available part o f the project counterpart funds,
the support o f the MPO is required through committing to provide these funds, to the water companies.
This can be achieved through the framework agreements to be signed with the WWCs. Also, the Bank
will assist the WWC and the NWWEC to achieve the objectives of the project financial arrangements
through the launch o f workshops and initial intense supervision. (Financial management arrangements are
detailed inAnnex 6).


5.        Environmental:              Environmental Category: A (FullAssessment)

5.1       Summarize the steps undertaken for environmental assessment and EMP preparation
          (including consultation and disclosure) and the significant issues and their treatment emerging
          from this analysis.

The proposed project i s an environmental and social improvement operation. It has been classified as
Category "A" because o f the extension o f water treatment plants, the construction of wastewater




                                                       20

treatment plants, the re-use of sludge and treated effluent, the potential impact from the discharge of
industrial effluents, and the presence of archeological sites inthe city of Shiraz.

Environmental assessment (EA) studies including environmental management plans (EMP) were
prepared for the two cities incompliance with the requirements of the Islamic Republic of Iran as well as
the World Bank Procedures, including Operational Policy OP 4.01 "Environmental Assessment" and
Operational Policy Note OPN 11.03 "Cultural Heritage". The reports covered three major areas: (i)
Project description, legal and regulatory framework, and baseline conditions; (ii) Analysis of impacts and
design alternatives; and (iii)EnvironmentalManagement Plan.

The EA indicated that the execution of the project will have positive impacts in terms of reducing
pollution of natural resources, will generate significant economical, social and public healthbenefits, and
will enablethe government to enforce existing environmental regulations and standards.

Major environmental issues are: (i)   risk of poor performance of water treatment facilities that would lead
to insufficient water quantity of inadequate quality if the water supply system i s not properly maintained
and monitored; (ii)possible discharge of toxicharmful industrial substances into the wastewater
collectionnetwork becauseof lack of enforcement on the provision o fthe requiredpre-treatment; and (iii)
use of treated effluent for irrigation and of treated sludge for soil conditioning could, in case o f any
adverse diversions intreatment quality, cause a healththreat to people.

Other issues are mainly related to inconvenience to be experienced duringconstruction such as disruption
o f traffic pattem, disruptedaccess to residential or/and other buildings, change in the landscape (loss of
vegetation), noise nuisance, air pollution due to dust formation, safety hazard from construction activities
and inappropriate disposal of excavated materials and construction debris.

Mitigationmeasuresto ensurethat potential adverse environmental impacts are minimizedwere identified
and include:

          Routine maintenance of the water supply system and regular monitoring o f water quality
          includingwater sources, treatment plants andreservoirs;

          Connections will be provided only to industries that pre-treat their effluents to levels which
          comply with the World Bank Environmental Guidelines mentioned in the "Pollution Prevention
          and Abatement Handbook";

          Restricting the use of treated effluents for irrigation in case World Health Organization (WHO)
          Guidelinescannot bemet;

 0        Drying o f sludge for one year, before its use as soil conditioner, to ensure elimination of
          nematode eggs;

          Construction activities will be coordinated with all concerned authorities prior to the start of the
          construction works. Inaddition GoodPractice EnvironmentalProcedures will be adopted.


5.2       What are the main features o f the EMPand are they adequate?

The EMP covers all components funded by the project as well as existing water supply sources and
wastewater treatment facilities including any facilities that are under construction. The plan outlines the
measures incorporated in the design, construction and operation o f the project to mitigate potential
environmental impacts. It also includes a monitoringprogram, institutional arrangement for implementing
the various tasks as well as capacity buildingand technical assistancefor key stakeholders involved inthe




                                                        21

project. The cost of implementing the EMP was estimated and appropriate budgetary allocations were
provided as part of the project cost.

5.3      For Category A and B projects, timeline and status o f EA:
        Date o f receipt o f final draft: January 2004.

EA reports have been made available at the Info Shop and a number o f locations in Iran including:
Department o f Environment, Ministry o fEnergy, and WWCs.

5.4      H o w have stakeholders been consulted at the stage o f (a) environmental screening and (b) draft
         EA report on the environmental impacts and proposed environment management plan? Describe
         mechanisms o f consultation that were used and which groups were consulted?

At the initiation of the project, technical, financial, environmental and social issues associated with the
project were discussed in meetings attended by consultants, representatives o f City Councils,
Municipalities, WWCs and various other stakeholders. Further consultations were held during project
preparation to facilitate stakeholder involvement and awareness at all levels o f project implementation
and to ensure that information required for decision-malung i s available to all interested parties.

TORSfor the EA studies were developed and shared with key stakeholders in scoping meetings, which
were held on April 2002. In addition the Bank team provided a one-day training on August 2002
regardingthe Bank's safeguardpolicies.

The EA process included public consultations, which were carried out at various stages. Consultations
involved line ministries, city authorities, provincial DOE, WWCs, local communities, NGOs and the
public. This process was complemented by additional consultations undertaken in preparation o f the
Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) and the Social Assessment (SA).            The EA executive summaries in
EnglishandFarsi were distributedto all concerned stakeholders. A public hearingwas held inAhwaz on
October 28", 2003 and in Shiraz on January 4*, 2004. The public hearings were attended by a large
number o f people including representatives o f most ministries, Governors, MPs, local communities,
NGOs, contractors, consultants, university professors andmedias. The public didnot have any restriction
on the implementation of the project, on the contrary all presents welcomed the project, requested its
initiation the soonest possible and asked for additionalactivities to solve pollution problems.


5.5      What mechanisms have been establishedto monitor and evaluate the impact o f the project on the
         environment? D o the indicators reflect the objectives andresults o f the EMP?

The EMP includes monitoring activities to be conducted during construction and operation.
Responsibilities for daily monitoring o f construction activities and compliance with the EMP will be part
o f the construction supervision activities. Monitoring o f environmental impacts duringoperation will be
undertaken by the operators o f the facilities, who will be supervised by the WWCs. An intemational
consultant will assist the environment and safety officer at the TSUs in implementing and monitoring the
EMP activities. The Bank will receive regular reports from the WWCs on the progress o f the project
including the status of EMP. Moreover, a Bank environmental specialist will participate at the
supervision missions. In addition, provisions have been made for the recruitment o f an intemational
specialist to monitor the project in the mid term review and the Implementation Completion Report
(ICR).

The adopted indicators reflect the objectives o f the EMP and provide a basis for improved project results.
Moreover, the project provides clear monitoring indicators (Annex 13) to be used for monitoring and
evaluation purposes duringproject supervision.

6. Social:

6.1      Summarize key social issues relevant to the project objectives, and specify the project's social
        development outcomes.

A Social AssessmenWillingness To Pay survey was conducted and a summary is shown in Annex 4.
This section draws on its findings.

Quality of life for the poor and vulnerable. The central social concern o f this project is meeting a basic
need of resident populations in Ahwaz and Shiraz for inadequate water and sanitation system with
adverse impact on their health and immediate environment. Although water supply coverage i s high,
sanitation i s desperately poor, particularly inunplanned and informal settlements, which are substantial in
both cities. Individual infiltration sewerage systems are common: when found combination with a
deteriorated potable water infrastructure, dnnking water i s contaminated by untreated sewage. In poor
areas and informal settlements, open drains and collection o f stagnant pools o f wastewater are common.
During summer or when it rains these create an unpleasant and unhealthy environment characterized by
odor, flies and polluted stagnant water. Poor children are particularly exposed, and pedestrian
communication is difficult and unpleasant. Vendors sometimes wash vegetables and other food items in
water from open drains, and untreated effluent ends up being used for irrigating food crops in nearby
agncultural areas, thus bringingdirect, risking bothpublic health and the wider natural environment.

Serious public health hazards are a particular risk for poor and vulnerable people inhistoric city centers
and informal settlements, and put at risk the entire city population. During field visits, discussions with
poor families revealed the highhealth care costs to families caused by water-borne diseases, particularly
inthe summer. A major positive long-termoutcome ofthe projectparticularly for the very poor, wouldbe
a more livable and healthy environment, a greater sense o f dignity and quality o f life, better health, and
reducedhealth care costs.

Poor tenants are particularly vulnerable, because increased property values and increased water and
sewerage rates will be reflected in higher rents, possibly resulting in evictions o f the poorest tenants and
their replacement Protection measures such as rent caps may be required and are discussed below, and
city councils and community organizations have a significantrole to play.

Although people are aware o f issues in general, there i s a need to influence current knowledge and
attitudes. Expectations that government provides subsidies and free services will need to be moderated by
increased awareness o f the need for individual cost-sharing. By including stakeholders in the project
implementationphase, such concerns will be addressed. (See also 6.3 below).

6.2      Participatory Approach: H o w are key stakeholdersparticipating inthe project?

During project preparation, meetings were conducted in Ahwaz and Shiraz to discuss the technical,
financial, environmental and social issues associated with the project. These meetings were attended by
the WWCs, the design consultants, members o f the City Councils, Municipalities, WWCs and various
other stakeholders. The EMP public workshop discussions (attended by a Bank staff member inthe case
o f Ahwaz) were well conducted, informative, and well attended by officials and members o f the public,
men and women. NGOs and CBOs have already been involved, and the project is creating a space in
which newly elected councils (comprising in many cases active and committed citizens), individual,
citizens and the WWCs can enhance participation.

For Shiraz and Ahwaz, both o f which are considerably larger cities with populations o f around 1million,
mechanisms for local consultations and participation seem to be limited primarily to the Friday prayers,




                                                       23

and.local neighborhood councils have yet to be established, but elected city councils will be closely
involvedinthe project.

6.3      How does the project involve consultations or collaboration with NGOs or other civil society
         organizations?

The project has already involved NGOs and CBOs. There have been close consultations with local
stakeholders that included the municipalities, members of regional authorities, local councils and
residents on the street. Public consultation meetings took place inrespect o fthe environmental assessment
that included active NGOs inAhwaz and Shiraz.

Other civil society organizations will play an important role inthe public communications aspect o f the
project. Willingness to pay for sewerage services will not come through top-down communication from
officials, but from an accurate family level appreciation of benefits and costs. A participatory action
research approach i s requiredinorder for community members to work out and understand the costs and
benefits of the project to them. The local health services (centers, clinics and posts) would organize
workshops inwhich the costs o f the burdenof disease arising from waterborne pollutioncanbe calculated
at the family level: burden of disease on children and their development, costs of medical care,
medication, treatment, transportation, hospitalization and time lost, plus workmg hours lost through the
illness of a working individual or for care of a dependant. Anticipated savings from reduced burden of
disease can be related to the costs o f connection and services. This awareness can then be disseminated
through community and neighborhood groups: neighborhood cooperatives, social and religious groups
and adult learning, and local opinion leaders. Community-based awareness raising and information
dissemination i s far more effective inIran than official communications. Public education and awareness
campaigns will also be undertakenby local NGO's experienced indealing with water and sanitation issues
incoordinationwiththe WWCs andlocalcity councils.

6.4       What institutional arrangements have been provided to ensure the project achieves its social
          development outcomes?

Social development outcomes will be insured by: (i)    the creation o f city-wide andor local neighborhood
committees that will be established inthe preparation phase o f the project (see 6.2), and whose role will
be to coordinate and mediate between residents, WWCs and other concerned institutions; (ii)       instating
public education andawarenesscampaigns that will also target gender differences inthe use of water and
sanitation services; (iii)the implementation of an equitable standard tariff against consumption that also
considers the ability to pay of different income groups; and (iv) institutional capacity buildingthat will
help WWCs better understand community beliefs, knowledge and practices as well as handle customer
relations; ensure maintenance and deal with complaints. Public education and awareness campaigns will
be undertaken by local NGO's experienced in dealing with water and sanitation issues in coordination
with the WWCs and local city councils. The MOEwill have national responsibility for ensuring that the
WWCs meet service standards.

6.5       How will the project monitor performance interms o f social development outcomes?

In addition, a participatory approach will be incorporated into the monitoring and evaluation of the
project. These will comprise beneficiary assessments that will include residents, the neighborhood
councils (where available), representatives of local groups and other concerned NGO's. These
assessments, in which communities themselves can help identify the relevant indicators, will gauge
changes in attitudes and practices and feed into the public relations and customer service department of
the WWCs, with the aim of helping them better understand the issues at hand. These will include gender
related concerns and differentiation inthe use of water and sanitation services. Elected city councils will
continue to be closely consulted.

As part o f project preparation a comprehensive social assessment has been launched in each o f the cities.
This assessment, which is to establish baseline indicators at the level o f households, will examine, report
and make basic suggestions on: a) current health conditions o f the local populations in direct relation to
the existing water and wastewater systems, b) the cost to subscribers for completion o f individual
household connections inrelation to existing systems, c) factors that could positively or negatively affect
the incidence o f connections to the new project; d) the levels o f deprivation or poverty severe enough to
hinder households from getting physical connections without supplementary support; and e) estimates o f
actual costs to consumers o f water and wastewater systems.

Duringimplementation, a phase I1of the survey will be launched in conjunction with the execution o f
works. These are meant to monitor project impact on the health and income o f residents. These surveys
will also include bothqualitative and quantitative assessments.They will take place inAhwaz and Shiraz
within 6-12 months of the establishment o fconnections ineach o fthe individual cities. The areas sampled
will represent different income levels, but will ensure inclusion o f areas with highly vulnerable
populations. The findings of these surveys will be shared with all stakeholders, and inparticular with city
councils.

7.2     Describeprovisions made by the project to ensure compliance with applicable safeguardpolicies.

Preparation o f the project was comprehensive, encompassing an assessment o f issues conceming
environment, cultural heritage and land acquisition.

Environment and Cultural Property: The potential negative environmental impacts o f the proposed
project were defined indetail through the EA. The findings o f the EA were the basis for the development
o f an EMP with a special cultural heritage component to address issues related to cultural property in
Shiraz and to meet the requirements o f OPN 11.03. The EMP defines appropriate prevention and
mitigation measures as well as monitoring activities. Institutional strengthening has been also included in
the EMP; in addition to the environment and safety officer at the project TSU, the project will provide
necessary laboratory equipment to conduct required analyses. The implementation of the EMP will be an
integralpart o f the project supervision process, and a Bank environmental specialist will participate at the
supervision missions to monitor the implementation activities. The preparation o f the environmental
assessment included extensive public consultation and the produced documents will be disclosed at the
InfoShop and inpublic places inIran.

Projects in International Waters (OP 7.50): While Operational Policy 7.50 i s applicable, no notification
to other riparian states i s required given the rehabilitation nature o f the works to be financed under the
project.

Cultural Property (OPN11.03):
Shiraz. Shiraz, the capital o f Fars province, i s an ancient city. It lies 35 kmnorth o f Persepolis, the most
important historic site o f ancient Iran, contains several other historic sites, and i s an important tourist
destination. Most o f the works lie outside the city inbarren, uninhabited or agricultural lands, well away
from any areas o f cultural interest. However, the sewerage lines inthe city required careful treatment. The
final design o f the project concerning the pipelines was sent to the Cultural Heritage Organization (CHO),
which has legal authority to ensure protection o f archeological sites. Following careful review and
recommendations, some minor changes were incorporated in the design, and CHO has now issued a
permit for construction o fpipelines.

Ahwaz. There are no sites o f culturalvalue inthe area.

Involuntary ResettlementOPIBP 4.12:

The implementation o f the project required includes the expropriation o f land for the construction o f
treatment plants, pumpingstations and sewerage lines. Given the common characteristics o f this project in
each city, a Resettlement Policy Framework has been prepared together with abbreviated resettlement
action plans for the first two cities. Iranian law conforms in all major respects to Bank guidelines, and
provides for minimization o f disturbance, advance notification to owners, compensation o f all right
holders at full value independently assessed, and right o f negotiation and appeal. Inno case are residences
or current economic activities or livelihoods affected. In Ahwaz there i s expropriation of an unused
agricultural plot o f 67 ha from 13 owners, with compensation currently being negotiated, and two small-
undeveloped urban plots for pumping stations from private owners. All other land i s public land
expropriated by transfer with compensation from other public organizations. Full documentation i s
available to support the plants, and a Bank social scientist has visited the sites and confirmed the findings
o f the local social scientist. The project therefore complies with the requirements o f OP 4.12.

F.        Sustainabilityand Risks
1.       Sustainability:
The sustainability o f the project would be ensured through: (i)      implementation o f agreed upon reforms
that cover governance, tariff setting, institutional and regulatory framework, demand management etc.;
(ii)thelocallevel,strengtheningthecapacityofindividualWWCs,inordertooperateonacommercial

level, strengthening the capacity o f the NWWEC for its role in advising and guidingthe WWCs, and in
monitoring their performance; and (iv) increasing the participation o f the private sector in operation and
maintenance andother routine activities.

                 Bank Procurement and financial procedures: The implementation o f on-going projects
                 has been hampered by MPO's reluctance to apply Bank guidelines procedures
                 systematically. The Bank i s currently working with the authorities on a framework that
                 will cover all fiduciaries aspects. In addition, in the context o f the proposed project,
                 assurances were obtained that all procurement packages will be carried out inaccordance
                 to the Bank guidelines. It was agreed duringnegotiations (see paragraph 6 o f minutes of
                 negotiation) that the Government will issue an approval to that effect, n o later than July
                 31, 2004 to cover procurement packages for the first year o f the project, until an

                    AHWAZ AND SHIRAZWATERSUPPLYAND SANITATION

Methodology:
The economic analysis carried out for this Project, which follows the cost-benefit approach, deals
separately with each o f the two cities and with the water and wastewater components. Since the Project
period is relatively short (2004-2009), the analysis covers a longer period (2004-2027), which coincides
with the planning horizon o f the water and wastewater development programs. Bothbenefits and cost are
therefore projected for this longer period.

Water investmentcomponents:

Benefitsofwater components
Without the Project a large number o f households would not be connected to the water distribution
system and supply capacity would fall short o f an ever-expanding population. In this hypothetical
situation some households would be deprived o fpipe water and would need to rely on altemative sources
of supply. The major benefit o f the Project i s therefore to avoid the cost o f altemative supply, in addition
to the more hygienic nature o fpipe water as opposed to water sought from other sources. The altematives
to the project are the purchase of water from vendors or o f bottled water. The cost that would be avoided
thanks to the project is the cost o f water purchased from vendors and the cost o f installing, operating and
maintaining household storage tanks. These benefits are estimated for the additional population that
would be deprived from pipe water if the project i s not implemented. It is important to stress that they
should be considered as a minimum value o f the true benefits since they omit the hygiene, quality and
commodity advantages o f access to potable pipe water. An additional benefit, which i s partially taken into
inthis analysis, is that households will also generally consume muchlarger quantities o f water under the
Project, given the greater accessibility and lower cost o f pipe water as opposed to vendors' water.

Thus, with the project newhouseholds would avoid the cost o fvendors' water, which is muchhigher than
the price they would the WWC. They will also avoid the cost o f purchasingand maintaining water tanks.

Cost ofthe Project
The Project gives rise to two cost components, the investment cost and O&M cost. These outlays are
adjusted so as to reflect economic as opposed to commercial values. Starting with the breakdown between
expenses in local and foreign currencies, taxes are deducted and the local components deflated by an
exchange conversion factor so as to allow for a premium on foreign exchange over its official value. In
the absence o f estimates on the shadow exchange rate for Iran, a 10% premium i s assumed and a
sensitivity analysis i s introducedfor this value inthe simulations.

Regarding O&M cost, expenses are detailed for operating the treatment plants, broken down into energy,
chemicals and labor. Economic prices are used instead o fprices paidby WWC, particularly for energy for
which the real cost i s much higher than paid cost and labor which receives wages inthe public sector that
are considered higher than its opportunity cost. For energy we use Iran's export price o f electricity while
for labor we assume, inthe absence o f estimates for the shadow price o f labor, a 20% difference between
the latter and the actual wage.

Wastewater investment components:

Benefits: The wastewater network is very underdeveloped inboth cities. Ground water, environment as
well as health are threatened by the use o f absorption wells and the discharge o f wastewater in open
ditches and canals. Furthermore, as the population grows an increasingnumber o f households would have
to incur costs associated with digging and maintaining absorption wells. Given these pecuniary and non
pecuniary effects, the project i s expected to generate the following benefits: (i)     avoidance o f cost o f
absorption wells and their maintenance; (ii)    reduction inwater-borne diseases and intheir associated costs
o f hospitalization, medication, loss o f workdays and school days; (iii)reuse o f treated wastewater in
irrigation with the associated increase in agricultural value-added; (iv) general improvements in the
conditions o f immediate neighborhoods and the environment in general with the associated improvement
inthe quality o flife.

The present analysis focuses on the types o f benefits that can be quantified. This excludes benefit (iv),
which i s very difficult to quantify and takes the health benefit partially into account only because the
information available on water-borne diseases underestimates their real incidence among the population
inthe two cities. The first type ofbenefit [(i)]   i s estimated following the same methodology as for water
wells. This cost also turns out to dominant other benefit components. The health benefit i s estimated on
the basis o f the number o f water-bome disease cases provided by the local health department and makes
use, alternatively o f the health results o f the socio-economic assessment. It is also based on estimates o f
the proportions o f hospitalized versus external patients, duration o f the sickness, cost o f hospitalization
and external care and on assumptions concerning the opportunity cost o f labor (applied to the number o f
work days missed). Finally, the value o f treated wastewater reused inirrigation i s estimated on the basis
o f information (collected for the Feasibility Studies) provided on water requirements, yields, crop prices
and estimates o f differences inyields between irrigated andrain-fed agriculture.

 Estimatingthe IRRofthe Project water componentsfor Ahwaz and Shiraz
The different steps and results obtained by applying this methodology are shown intables (1) and (2) o f
this annex respectively for Ahwaz and Shiraz. Most o f the information used i s provided inthe feasibility
studies that have been implementedfor the two cities.

 Row (1): The connected population i s the staring point for estimating the benefits o f the project. Ahwaz
is already at 100% connection rate and the number of beneficiaries o f the Project will be the same as the
additional number o f inhabitants (Row 2)

Row (3): Annual increase in the number o f connections. Without the Project new households (new
subscribers) would purchase storage tanks. Therefore, the new connections will equal the number o f new
tanks that wouldbe installedeachyear. This number grows with the population.

R o w (4): Per capita water consumption per day. According to projections (Feasibility Studies), this
quantity will stay constant at 160 liters inAhwaz and increase from about 140in2004 to 150 1in2027 in
Shiraz.

Rows (5) and (6): Annual cumulative increase in water consumption with and without the Project: The
quantity in the situation without the Project represents the total quantity o f water that new households
would have to purchase from water vendors. This quantity will grow each period, as the number o f
households that would be denied the benefits o f pipe water will increase. Obviously, per capita
consumption will in this case be lower than if these households had access to WWC water. The present




                                                   56

analysis makes the assumption that they would buy only 75% o f what they would consume if they were
connected.

Rows (7-a)   -  (7-c): Cost o f alternative source o f water without the project: expenses on purchases o f
water from water vendors account for the bulk o f this cost while the other two components, cost o f
storage tanks and maintenance, have minor values. Regional information collected in the Feasibility
Studies provides estimates o f over one U S dollar (9000 Rials) per cum purchased from vendors.

Rows (8) - (10): Unadjusted and adjusted costs o f the Project: Costs are estimated at constant 2003
values. Therefore, they do not take into account any price adjustment components. However, capital cost
includes contingencies. As previously stated, shadow prices for foreign exchange and labor are used so as
to reflect the opportunity cost for each o f these two inputs. As tables (1) and (2) show, total cost i s
dominated by capital cost ininitial years and by O&M cost as additional water supply increases.

Estimates o f IRR: For Ahwaz the IRR is estimated at 32% and NPV at over US$93 million in the base
scenario in which the cost values are those estimated inthe Feasibility Studies and the benefits are based
on a price for vendors' water equal to US$1.07. IRRremains relatively higheven iftotal cost increases by
20% over initial projections (25% and NPV equal to US$94 million). Assuming a 20% cost increase and
a decline o f benefits inthe same proportions as compared to the base scenario still yield a relatively IRR,
equal to 18%. For Shiraz, the return i s even higher, reaching 48% in the base scenario and declining to
25% in the case combining an increase in cost and a decline in benefits by 20%. (Table 5) Other
sensitivity analysis involving shadow prices show relatively highvalues for IRR. Thus, the Project water
components largely pass the economic profitability test.

EstimatingIRRfor the Projectwastewater components:
Tables (3) and (4) show the steps followed in estimating IRR and NPV for wastewater, respectively for
Ahwaz and Shiraz. The approach i s similar to that used inthe analysis o f the water components. The base
scenario i s based on the results o f the socio-economic assessment carried out for the Project, which
estimates the incidence o f diarrhea at about 7.5% o f the population, and on the assumption that the new
sanitation system would result inthe avoidance of 10%o f the total number o f cases o f diarrhea. Estimated
IRRis inthis caserelatively low for Ahwaz, equal to 8.5%. For Shiraz, IRRis muchhigher, equal to 42%
(NPV equal to US$42 million). Since the new infrastructure will be built for a period much beyond the
20027 horizon, an alternative scenario is considered using the same assumptions as in the first but
extending cost-benefit analysis until the year 2052. IRR rises for Ahwaz in this case to 13%. It also
increases for Shiraz. Raising cost by 20% or reducingbenefits inthe same proportions as compared to the
base scenario still yields an IRR for Shiraz in the range o f 16 to 18%, but very l o w values for Ahwaz,
ranging between 2.5 and 3.5% (Table 5). It should be recalled that these values do not take into account
the significant improvements inliving conditions that the Project i s likely to generate.

Even though the values o f IRR are much lower for wastewater than for water, particularly in the case o f
Ahwaz, they basically pass the test o f economic profitability. For Ahwaz, the adjustment o f the number o f
diseases raises IRRto an acceptable level. Still the estimates are conservative ones, given that they do not
include any value for the expected improvements inthe environment and inthe quality of life in general
(less smells, cleaner recreational areas, etc.)

Tariff Policy:
The current system comprises connection rights, subscription fees and water consumption tariffs in
addition to the house connection fees, which are directly borne by the customer. These fees are set and
revised on a periodic basis by the National Economic Council, which i s chaired by the President o f the
Islamic Republic o f Iranand includes several government departments.

Connection rights for water are currently based on dwelling size and a city adjustment coefficient which
depends on several factors the most important o f which are the cost o f water supply and population
density. [The formulas for calculating connection fees are very similar across the WWCs. For Ahwaz the
following formula was applied in the year 2002: Y = (0.0015X2 + 1000)*1.91*a*X,              where Y i s the
connection fee, X i s the size o f the dwelling and a i s the city coefficient which depends on population
density and the relative cost o fwater supply.]

 Average connection fees are about US$310 for the whole country and the minimumfee i s approximately
 equal to US$l50. Ahwaz has a lower average fee, estimated at about US$200 in 2002. For wastewater,
 the connection fee i s the same as that for water with a few exceptions such as the cities o f Rasht and
 Anzali inGuilan province where the wastewater fee i s set at 90% o f that for water. These fees have been
 regularly increasedinthe last five years, at the rate o f 10% annually in all these years with the exception
 o f the year 2000 in which the fee was increased by 15%. In addition to connection fees, the WWCs
 charge the customer the full cost for house connection which averages about US$50.

 Regardingwater consumption, the current system i s based on a fixed fee that depends only on the size o f
 the connection pipe and on the type o f customer (household or other types), and on a volumetric charge
based on increasing block-tariffs. The fixed fee, or the subscription fee, i s about 2,000 Rials (25 U S
 cents) for most domestic customers. For the variable fee the current tariff structure is based on complex
 formulas. The formula used i s the same for all WWCs and there i s no volumetric charge if consumption
 falls below 5 cum per month. Above this minimum, prices increase with the level o f consumption and
 generally vary across companies. The average volumetric tariff for the country stood at about 6 U S cents
 in2002 and it varied from 2 cents for monthly consumptionbelow 20 cum, to about 4.5 cents and 12.5
 cents respectively for 20-40 and for more than 40 cum of monthly consumption. A year earlier (2001),
 the average price paid inthe bracket 0-20 was only one cent and the corresponding volumetric bill didn't
 exceed 18 cents against 48 cents in2002.

 Tariffs and water bills are low even if when related them to income and they are extremely l o w by
 comparison with tariffs practicedinrecent years in other countries with similar and even lower per capita

Average rates have been increased in proportions varying between 23 and 8% since 1999, the lowest
increasebeingrecordedin2003. This moderate increase, which i s expected to be the same in2004, i s far
below the inflation rate, which has averaged about 16% in recent years. The Economic Council
differentiates between what it considers as low consumption, which varies from one city to another and
lies in the range o f 20 to 25 cum per month, and higher consumption. Tariffs for the second category
have beenraised by at least twice as much inrelative terms than tariffs for the first category (Table-8).

However, new measures introduced in the system have given conflicting signals as to the direction the
tariff structure i s taking. Onthe one handtariffs have beenraised ingreater proportions for lower than for
higher consumption brackets. Inaddition to the regular increases, the Council introduced since 2001 a
penalty or surcharge for consumption exceeding a certain volume varying across cities inthe range o f 18
to 25 cum per month (24 cum for Ahwaz and 20 cum for Shiraz). This penalty was set for the year 2002
at 100% of the tariff given by the formula for consumption above the cut-off volume. It has been raised
to 150% in 2003 and is expected to be further increased to 200% in 2004. These changes are thus
widening the tariff gap between low and highconsumptionbrackets. On the other handthe decision has
been taken to set lower bound and upper bounds for tariffs, defined with respect to average cost. In2002
the lower bound was set at one fourth o f average cost and the upper bound at three times the average
cost. This adjustment explains the significant increase in the average tariff for the low consumption
category of 0 to 20 cum per month between the years 2001 and 2002 (Table 5). The Council raised the
lower bound to one third and reduced the upper bound to 2.5 of average cost in 2003. These changes
reduce tariff differences between consumption brackets and therefore work inthe opposite direction of
the first measuresof tariffincreases. Moreover, and inspite ofthese increases, revenues from water sales,
and from wastewater when applicable, barely cover operation and maintenance cost inmost cases. The
workmg ratio for Ahwaz WWC is estimated at 96% and 90% respectively for the budget years
2001-2002 and 2002-2003 while that for Shiraz it has been estimated at 107% and 92% for the same




                                                  63

years. These ratios are currently significantly above the ratio o f 75% targeted for the end o f the project
period.

The rate structure i s needlessly complex for both volumetric rates and connection fees. Volumetric
tariffs are based on complex formulas that differ across consumption brackets and WWCs. Because of
this complexity the tariff structure lacks transparency. Moreover, the structure is such that rates increase
by more than threefold when consumption rises from 20 cum or less to slightly higher volumes. This
sharp change may not be an issue under the existing system in which tariffs are generally low but
deserves to be reviewed under a new framework inwhich tariffs would be based on costs and rebalanced
between consumption brackets. It i s important to stress in this regard that 15 to 20 cum o f water
consumed per month represents non negligible quantities which should not be associated with low
income households under a cost-based tariff system. The system i s even more complex and less
transparent for connection rights.Given these complexities and inappropriate targeting, reform i s needed
inorder to address the mainobjectives ofcostrecovery, efficiency, transparency andequity.

Regarding sewage bills they are currently levied and collected only in city neighborhoods where a
network exists based on the water bills (70%). Since these services have been very limited, or practically
non-existent, the need has not yet been felt by the WWCs to assess the costs involved. As these services
develop costs should be assessed separately from water so as to evaluate the appropriateness o f the
existing tariff structure.

All these shortcomings point to the needfor a consistent and comprehensive tariffreform. Aware o fthis
need, the Government has appointed a worlung group to that effect. According to members of this
group, the proposed reform will be in line with the objectives set inthe draft Fourth Development Plan
(2005-2009), which are simple and transparent tariff structures and full cost recovery for water supply
and wastewater services.

 Since most urban households are already connected to the water network and only a few are connected
 to a sewerage network that i s yet to be constructed in most cases, the issues o f willingness to pay and
 affordability o f connection rights may arise. In order to ease the burden the government has facilitated
 household access to bank credit for this purpose. For water consumption, a guiding objective is to
 gradually narrow the block rate spread, which i s too wide under the existing system, to move ultimately
 to a unique cost-based tariff system and to provide income subsidies to the poor. This implies that the
 tariff reform, along with significant improvements in productivity and in the management o f these
 companies, should aim at reducing this ratio towards the 75% target. The principles stated inthe Fourth
 Development Plan are soundand go inthe right direction o f an efficiency based tariff policy. Guided by
 these principles, a comprehensive and consistent reform should replace the inconsistent piecemeal
 approach o f recent years.

              AHWAZ AND SHIRAZWATER SUPPLY AND SANITATIONPROJECT

The poor sanitation situation and the unsuitable quality of potable water in Ahwaz have constituted a
threat to public health. Inboth cities, Ahwaz and Shiraz, wastewater i s improperly discharged into open
canals, streets and surrounding areas, especially inthe eastern section of Ahwaz. Inaddition to creating an
unpleasant sight, this action has caused the spread of many water-bome infectious diseases (diarrhea,
conjunctivitis, hepatitis A andB,paratyphoid, typhoid, dysentery).

Giventhese poor conditions it is important to assess how the inhabitants perceive and value the project.
Several information-gatheringtechniques have been used inthis SA to obtain socio-economic data and in
particular to:

                 gauge the attitudes of residents towards current and proposed water and wastewater
                 services;
                 elicit the willingness to pay of households of different socio-economic backgrounds for
                 improvements in sanitation and water supply services that will be brought about by the
                 newproject; and
                 identify potential problems that could disrupt the development and execution o f the
                 project, explore any potential negative results that could impact vulnerable section o f the
                 population, determine mechanisms for addressing community concems, and guide on-
                 going monitoring procedures.

The mainapproaches/techniquesusedconsisted of:

                 A sample survey of about 800 households stratified by income and wastewater
                 connections, to obtain basic socio-economic information and data on willingness to pay
                 (WTP) and potential affordability of increasedpayments for water supply and wastewater
                 disposal;
                 Focus group discussions with local residents in different parts o f the city to enhance the
                 data obtained from the household survey and to promote community participation inthe
                 design and implementationo f the project; and
                 Stakeholder interviews with government and non-government agencies.

The willingness survey involved about 800 households located inthree different areas o f each o f the two
cities of Ahwaz and Shiraz, which are distinguished according to the price o f land. Barring data on
income distribution, the survey uses the price of land as a proxy o f income or standard of living.The three
areas thus defined are low-income, middle-income and high-income areas and the sample includes inthe
case of Ahwaz respectively 390,280 and 130households.

Regardingwillingness to pay for the project sanitation services, a distinction i s made between connection
fees and volumetric fees and a second distinction i s made between households already connected to the
sewerage network and those which are yet to be connected. The first category of households was
randomly assigned a proposed additional connection fee equal to 25%, 50% or 75% o f the average
connection fee currentlycharged by the city WWC. The second category of households i s divided inthree
sub-categories according to income level (price o f land). The low-income sub-category i s randomly
assigned 25%, 50% and 75% of average connection fee; the middle-income sub-category i s assigned
between 100% and 150% o f average fee while the high-income sub-category i s assigned the higher



                                                65

proportions of 175%, 200% and 225%. Interviewedhouseholds were asked to declare whether they would
pay the proposed amount for connection or not. The interviewer explained, on the basis of the
questionnaire, that connection fees were neededto cover capital cost.

The second contribution requested from households is a volumetric bill, which is supposed to cover the
operation and maintenance of the sewerage network. The amounts proposed inthe survey are chosen as
proportions of latest bills.Fivepercentages, 75%, loo%, 125%, 150%, or 200%, were randomly assigned
to households and converted in nominal values. Again, the question is closed, households are asked to
state their willingness or unwillingnessto pay the proposed amount.

Data provided by Ahwaz Water and Wastewater Company (AWWC) showed that 72% of all consumers
were already connected and paid monthly fees, and the remaining customers (28%) were not connected.
Inthe caseof Shiraz only 10% ofthe populationis already connected.

For Ahwaz, 50% o f the inhabitants were located inthe poorer areas, 35% in the middle class zones, and
15% in higher income level zones. These percentages were then considered in allocating questionnaires
into three income groups and two categories (connected and not-connected).

For this purpose, first the total number of households was divided into connected and not- connected
categories using the above percentages. As a result 580 questionnaires were allocated to connected
households and 223 to unconnected ones. The next stage involved calculating the total number o f
households living inthe poor, middle and high-income areas of the city and dividingthese by the required
number of questionnaires to provide the sampling interval for eachincome group (Table 1). These were
obtained separately for connected and unconnected consumers. When these were applied to the AWWC
consumer lists, the initial list of sample households was obtained.

Monthly income averages about US$360 among households of the sample. About 20% o f these
households declared that their revenue i s below US$175 per month while almost 50% put their revenue in
the range of $175 to US$375. Differences in income level across groups are not large, implyingthat the
breakdown of the city in zones according to the price of land does not adequately match income
distribution.

Households were requested to state whether they were willing to pay a randomly assigned amount for
connecting to a new sewerage network, an additional amount for an improvement in the network
(rehabilitation and treatment) for those who are already connected, and an absolute amount for
households that are not connected yet. They were also requested to state their willingness to pay for
operation and maintenance o f the sewerage network as well as for improvements in the water system
throughrehabilitation o f the network and other actions such as the change inwater intake inAhwaz from
a wastewater-polluted intake to another upstream intake.

The additional connection fee that was put forward inthe survey varied betweenthe equivalent of US$32
and US$96 for connected households and between US$32 and US$288 for non connected households.
For the first category o f households the proportion o f a positive response varies between 42% and 49%
(Table-2-a). These are relatively low positive response rates but it should be recalled that what i s

already paid connectionfees.

InShiraz the constructionofthe sewerage network is still inearly stage andonly 10% ofthepopulationis
connected. The current average connection fee i s estimated at about US340, which i s muchhigher than in
Ahwaz. The survey methodology and the WTP questionnaire are the same inbothcities. Regarding WTP
o f an additional fee for the minority of households that are already connected, the results show that
positive responseproportionsbetween33 and almost 50% (Table-2-b). Considering that these households
are askedto pay new additional fees, these proportions are not low.

For the second category of Shiraz households, the non-connected ones which account for 90% o f all
households, the amounts requested are new connection fees, varying between 85 and US$255 inthe low
income area, 340 to US$510 inthe middle-income area and 595 to US$765 inthe high-income area. The
positive responserates are inthe range of about 32 to 52%, which are higher than inAhwaz, even though

For Shiraz, the contribution to O&M of the sewerage system, which is requested in the survey, varies
between 150 and 200% o f the monthly bill, which goes for the sample households form US$5.5 to
US$6.7. WTP proportions do not exceed50% of the number o fhouseholds (Table-4-b-b).

Finally, households expressedtheir willingness to pay for expenses on improvingthe water supply system
in Ahwaz, through the rehabilitation of worn out pipes and the transfer of the water intakes. The
additional amount requested varies between 1.9 andUS$4.5 depending on the income level as defined in
the sample. The percentages of positive responses are above 50% for the middle and high-income areas
and about 45% in the low-income area. (Table-5). Results for Shiraz are similar to hose of Ahwaz,
although the positive responseproportions are somewhat lower.

WTP for connection, for covering O&M expenseson sewerage as well as for investment inimproving the
water supply system are positively correlated with the level of education of the head o f the household,
meaning that the higher his education, the more the head of the household i s willing to pay for the new
services. This relationship holds at varying acceptable degrees of statistical significance for the three
types o f services (connection and discharge o f wastewater and improvement o f the water system). As
expected, the correlation between WTP and the level of income i s also positive, although its statistical
significance i s weaker for connection fees than for use of the network.

Generally, the results of the survey have shown low levels of WTP, even though the payments requested
inthe survey were moderate. The relatively low levels ofincomeinAhwaz maypartly explainthe lack of
strong positive response, but other social attitudes may also be at play. It i s believed that all matters
outside the house or the ownership of a person are the responsibility of the government. This includes
matters such as provision of electricity, water, health, etc.

This insufficient interest infinancial contributionto the new services does not implythat the citizens do
not appreciate the importance of new sanitation services. On the contrary, according to the results o f the
rapid appraisal section of the questionnaire, 78% o f the respondents inAhwaz have mentioned the project
as beingcritical, 10%have statedthat people should not pay for the project, 21% have accepted to pay if
the fees are not too high and if they can be paid by installments, and finally, 14% have agreed to pay
unconditionally. The rest of the respondents have emphasized the fact that they are already paying taxes,
so they don't see why they should pay more.

The respondents were also somewhat skeptical towards the implementation of the project by government
organizations. This was especially due to previous promises and commitments made which were not
materialized and left such projects unfinishedin some cases. That i s why 26.7% o f respondents insisted
on rapid implementation of the project. About 30% of respondents, despite their agreement with the idea
o f the project, were distrustful of project implementers and expressedconcerns that the project might be
mismanaged or deviated from its main goals.

The Focus Group Discussion results give a similar feedback, although they show more readiness among
low-income groups living inpoor districts to pay for improvement of water and wastewater services, as
health problems are more critical inthose neighborhoods. However, these groups believed that financing
the project was the responsibility o f the government. Such attitude has been cultivated by the promises
made by the Government in the past to provide such services free o f charge. Changes inthese attitudes
may be already talung place butmajor shifts will take time to materialize.

Affordability: The water bill i s not currently an issue since the average price o f water does not exceed five
U S cents per cum both inAhwaz and Shiraz. Given average consumption volume and a subscription fee
o f 25 cents (2,000 Rials) for most households, the average monthly water bill does not exceed US$1.5.




                                                 70

Given an average monthly income o f US$360 for the sample o f households surveyed in Ahwaz, this
water bill accounts for about 0.4% o f income. Even if we assume that households tend to overstate the
level of their income for social reasons, the water bill should not account for more than 0.7-0.8% o f
average income. Adding the sewerage component, which i s set at 70% o f the water consumption bill, will
only add an extra US$0.87. Thus, inthe current tariff system, the average household pays about US$2.4,
subscription fee included, or about 0.67% o f the average income declared in the survey. The water and
wastewater bill represents similar income shares among low-income households.

I. ProjectFinancialCost-BenefitAnalysis
The financial analysis compares the project costs with the project benefits. All costs and benefits are
expressed in current terms and are incremental in nature, valued as the difference between the
costs/benefits "with the project"and "without the project". The analysis was carriedout over the period o f
the average expected life o f the investments o f 25 years. The detailed financial analysis o f each WWCs
inthis Annex presents the present values (PVs) o fthe financial flows andthe NPVs and FRR for Ahwaz
and Shiraz, respectively.

For the financial benefits, the WWCs will have the increased sales revenue due to the ability to meet
increased demand at a higher tariff implemented to meet the financial targets agreed to and the cost
savings due to reductions in water losses. On the cost side, the WWCs will have the outlays for the
project's capital cost and capital investments beyond the project periodestimated inthe feasibility studies,
the increased salary and utility costs due to the project and the increased maintenance spending as
estimated inthe financial forecast.

11.     FinancialAssessmentofthe Water andWastewater Companies(WWCs)
This Annex presents a detailed assessmento fthe two WWCs, including the impact on the tariffbased on
different scenarios for the financing of the investment costs and level o f cost recovery achieved. The
analysis below deals with the past, current and future financial performance o f the WWCs. The financial
year for the WWCs ends on March20.

Pastand CurrentPerformanceof Ahwaz
Based on audited accounts for the past four years, Ahwaz WWC has been incurring significant net losses
which are projectedto continue inthe year ending March 20, 2004. Operatingincome before depreciation
and interest has been positive resulting in a worlung ratio (operating expensesloperating revenue) below
1. However, spending on maintenance has been insufficient in the past (on average 1.5% o f gross fixed
assets, whereby industry standard i s around 2.5-3%), which makes the achieved working ratio of 0.75
underestimated. Depreciation represents a significant expense to the WWC, reaching 26% o f total
revenue in2002l03.

The financial performance o f the company is further aggravated by highwater losses resulting ina much
larger need for water to pass through the system than i s billed for. Water losses were as high as 46% in
1999100 and have come down to about 37.7% in 2002103. Of the water that passes through the system,
only about 74% i s estimated to be paid for in 2003104. At the end o f 2002103, the accumulated accounts
receivables equaled 12months o fbillings.

FutureFinancialPerformanceofAhwaz WWC
Projections to assess Ahwaz's future financial position and performance have been carried out for the
period 200415-2013114. The projections have been prepared based on assumptions summarized in this
Annex. Detailedassumptions are recorded inthe Project Files.




                                                72

The projections for the future financial performance have been anchored by the financial targets agreed
between the Government of Iran and the World Bank during their sector strategy discussions in
September 2003. These financial targets comprise the following:

                Working ratio of 0.75 by the financial year 2008/09 (operating expenses excluding
                depreciation and interesdoperating revenue).

                Labor productivity reaching 3 by project completion (expressed as number of staff per
                 1,000 water connections).

                Accounts receivables reduced to 4 months by 2008/09. (During appraisal, more analysis
                will be done to identifymeasuresto reach agreedupontargets i.e., actionplanfor arrears,
                write-off etc.,).

                Unaccounted for water to reach 27% by 2008/09.

The targets aim to gradually improve the financial and operational performance of the WWC by
achieving cost recovery of O&M, and part of capital investment. Meeting these targets will require
increases in the water tariff, but will also depend on simultaneous improvements in collection
performance and a significantreduction inwater losses.

The analysis considers a base scenario whereby the financial targets agreed are achieved under the
following financing arrangement (Illustrated in Table-1 below): Part of water supply investment i s
financed by a loan. The rest o f water supply and all wastewater investment are financed by connection
fees and grants from the Government. The analysis shows that, through 31,500 new water connections
and 22,300 new wastewater connections, Ahwaz would be able to contribute 166 billion Rials (US$19.7
million) to the financing o f the project from new connections.        This is based on a water charge
(connection and installationfee) o f 2.3 millionrials and a wastewater charge of 2.76 million rials).

Capacity Building,
Training and Studies

A second scenario which analysis the impact on the tariff if full cost recovery is to be achieved has also
been included. As illustratedinTable 2 below, the base and the reference scenarioshave different impact
on the performance of the Ahwaz WWC. Inthe base scenario, the tariff increase inyear 2004105 would
be significant and would reach 84%. After this year it would fall to about 32% and then lie around 15%
during the rest of the project implementation period. However, a net deficit would be incurred to the
company becausewhat remains from the revenues once operating expenses are coveredi s still insufficient

 An important issue i s that in both cases Ahwaz would generate a positive cash flow position. This i s
 achieved in part by an overall improvement in the collection performance from the current rate o f about
 74% to 90% by the end o f the project implementation period (2008109) while simultaneously making
 provisions for doubtful revenue o f its billings and writing o f f arrears. Given the age o f some o f the
 accounts receivables listed above, it would seem likely that some write-offs should take place (see Table
 3 below). It has been agreed that a detailed Action Plan be prepared and implemented during first 2 years
 o f project execution. This action plan will identify the necessary measures to increase the collection o f
 billings, including arrears but also, where appropriate, write-off consumer debts that are unlikely to be
 collected. This effort will be done inparallel to reducingthe accounts receivables to agreed 4 months by
 2008109.

 Assumptions for proiections of financial Derformance of Ahwaz WWC
 The analysis i s based on actual audited results for the years 1999100-2002103 and company estimates for
 2003104. The projections cover the years 2004105-2013114. The project implementation period is
 2004105-2008109.

 Key Assumptions for financial statements

 Water demand                 i s assumed to be increasing at the average rate of 1.5% per year as of
                              2004105 (Source: company).

 Water connections            are assumed to be increasing at the rate of 3% per year as o f 2004/05 (source:
                              company), adding 31,500 new water connections between 2004105 and
                              2008109.

 Sewerage connections         are assumed to be increasing at the rate o f 3% per year as o f 2004105 (source:
                              company), adding 22,300 new connections between2004105 and 2008109.

Water tariff         Base scenario: i s assumed to be increasing as required to meet the financial
                     targets agreed to between the Government o f Iran and the World Bank (by
                     2008109 a working ratio o f 0.75, accounts receivables reduced to 4 months,
                     labor productivity o f 3 staff per 1,000 connections and unaccounted for water
                     reduced to 27%.) The water supply components are assumed to be provided
                     partly as a loan to the company. The Government i s assumed to cover in
                     grant form the cost o f water components not covered by the Bank loan or
                     connections fees as well as the cost o f the sanitation components not covered
                     byconnection fees.

Sewerage charge      the charge for disposal o f wastewater i s calculated as a coefficient o f the
                     water sales and varies with consumer category. InAhwaz, consumers with a
                     connection pay for this service regardless if there is a waste water treatment
                     plant inoperation or not (Source: company, audited accounts)

Water losses         include technical and non-technical losses and were 37.72% in 2002103
                     (source: company). Losses are estimated to be have been reduced to 35.6%
                     in2003104 andare estimatedto reduce gradually towards 27% by2008/09 as
                     agreed between the Government o f Iran and the World Bank (Source:
                      strategy discussions)

Water resources       90% are assumed to come from the KarounRiver and 10% are from wells.

Water Production      comprises water requirements to meet demand plus losses. Reduces over
                      lifetime o fproject as losses are reducedfaster than demand grows.


Water cost           Ahwaz pays a water right to the regional water board for both the Karoun
                      and the wells. The cost was 22.0 rialslm3 in 2002103 and i s assumed to
                      increase at the rate o finflation (Source: NWWEC)

NWWEC                  an administration fee is paid to the NWWEC. Assumed to increase by 25%
                       during the project implementationperiod (2004/05-2008/09) to contribute to
                       the expected increased cost o f the NWWEC as it enhances its regulatory
                       function. Assumed to increase by 5% per year after 2008/09

Provisions             Include the writing-off o f 40% o f its 2004/05 current account receivables
                       over a five-year period (8% each year) and (considered bad debts) and a
                       provision for doubtful collection o f current billings equivalent to all non
                       collected billings o fthe current year.

Depreciation           the current charge i s based on the straight line methodology and assumed to

                       passed onto the WWC at the cost o f borrowing. An average interest rate o f
                       5.35% has been assumed in the projections based on a 10-year forecast o f
                       LIBOR and the World Bank spread. A commitment fee o f 0.75% less a
                       0.5% waiver, i.e. 0.25% on the undisbursed amount i s applied (source:

Past and current performanceof Shiraz
Like Ahwaz, Shiraz has incurrednet lossesthe past four years based on its audited accounts and a loss i s
also estimated for the year ending March 20, 2004. The working ratio in the past has been very weak
with operating expenses before depreciation and interest reaching as high as 1.17 in 2001/02 but came
down in 2002/03 to 0.92 due to a significant increase inrevenue as a result o f a large tariff increase that
year. The working ratio for 2003/04 i s expected to be below 1but to have deteriorated from 0.92 to 0.98.
The situation would have been even worse had Shiraz been spending sufficiently on maintenance.
Maintenance spending as a percentage of gross fixed assets was as low as 0.29% in 2002/03 when the
industry standard calls for 2.5%-3%.      Depreciation represents a significant expense to the WWC, for
example in2002/03 the depreciation charge accounted for 16%of total revenue.

Water losses have averaged about 30% in the past. Collection performance has been very good in the
past but i s estimated to have deteriorated in 2003/04 possibly as an effect due to the increased tariff in
2002/03. The good collection performance of the past has resulted in relatively manageable accounts
receivables, which reached 5.6 months at the end of 2002/03.

FutureFinancialPerformanceof Shiraz WWC
Projections to assess Shiraz's future financial position have been carried out for the period
2004/5-2013/14. The assumptions for the projections are summarized below and a detailed record o f the
assumptions i s kept inthe Project Files. The projections have been undertaken with the financial targets
outlined above inthe section covering Ahwaz that have been agreedbetween the Govemment o f Iran and
the World Bank. Likewise, an analysis has been undertaken to assess the tariff required for full cost
recovery as inthe case of Ahwaz. The analysis shows that, through 38,000 new water connections and
50,000 new wastewater connections, Shiraz would be able to contribute 323 billion Rals (US$38.5
million) to the financing o f the project from new connections.          This is based on a water charge
(connection and installation fee) o f 3.6 millionrials and a wastewater charge of 3.5 millionrials).

The tariff increasesrequired differ in the different scenarios (see Table-4 below). Inthe base scenario -
which targets the tariff increase requiredto meet the working ratio target o f 0.75 by 2008/09 - the tariff
increase i s very significant in the year 2004/05, about 70% and would be greatly reduced thereafter to
average about 34% duringthe project implementationperiod. A net deficit o f US$10.4 million would be
incurred. Inthe second scenario (achieving full cost recovery), the tariff increase in2004/05 would reach



                                                  78

88%, but the average increase foe the project implementation period would only be 2.4% greater than in
the base scenario.

InShiraz, the collection performance has been relatively good inthe past with overall collection rates
reaching as highas 90%. The collection performance i s reported to have deteriorated in2003/04 possibly
as an effect due to the increased tariff in 2003/04. Based on the company-audited statements, the
accumulated accounts receivables equaled about 24.7 billion rials (US$2.94 million) in 2002/03. The
largest debtor i s the domestic consumer (50%), followed by the government (16%). The arrears from the
domestic category average about 76 days and the government's arrears average 430 days (See Table-5
below).

To meet the financial targets agreed upon to, an overall improvement inthe collection performance from
the current rate of about 75% to 90% by 2005/06 while simultaneously making provisions for doubtful
revenue of its billings and writing off arrears i s required. Given the age o f some o f the accounts
receivables listed above, it would seem likely that some write-offs should take place. It has been agreed
that a detailed Action Plan be prepared which will identify the necessary measures to increase the
collection of billings, including arrears but also, where appropriate, write-off consumer debts that are
unlikelyto be collected. It is important to note that underboth scenarios analyzed, Shiraz would have to
make extra efforts to manage its workmg capital inorder to avoid negative cash flow certainyears.

Assumptions for proiectionsof financial performanceof Shiraz WWC
The analysis i s based on actual audited results for the years 1999/00-2002/03 and company estimates for
2003/04.   The projections cover the years 2004/05-2013/14.        The project implementation period is
2004105-208/09.

Key Assumptionsfor financialstatements
Water demand                  i s assumed to be increasing at the average rate o f 1.3% per year as of
                              2004/05 (Source: company)

Water connections    are assumed to be increasing at the rate of 2.5% per year as of 2004/05
                     (Source: company), adding 38,000 new connections

Sewerageconnections  are assumedto reach 75,000 by 2008/09 by increasing by 10,450 connections
                     per year untilthat year. After 2008/09, the increasewill slow to 5 %per year
                     (Source: feasibility study)

Water tariff         Base scenario: i s assumedto be increasing as required to meet the financial
                     targets agreed to between the Government o f Iran and the World Bank (by
                     2008/09 a worlung ratio of 0.75, accounts receivables reducedto 4 months,
                     labor productivity o f 3 staffper 1,000 connections and unaccounted for water
                     reducedto 27%.) The water supply components are assumedto be provided
                     partly as a loan to the company. The Government i s assumed to cover in
                     grant form the cost of water components not covered by the Bank loan or
                     connections fees as well as the cost o f the sanitation components not covered
                     byconnection fees.

Sewerage charge      the charge for disposal of wastewater i s calculated as a coefficient of the
                     water sales and varies with consumer category.

Water losses         include technical and non-technical losses and were 32% in2001/02 (source:
                      company). Losses are assumed to have improved to 30% in 2003/04 and
                     then reduce gradually towards 27% by 2008/09 as agreed between the
                      Govemment of Iran and the World Bank (source: strategy discussions)

Water resources       80% come from wells and 20% from river sources

Water Production      comprises water requirements to meet demand plus losses. Increase very
                      slowly as demand i s growing faster than the reductioninlosses.

Water cost            Shiraz pays a higher price for the water from the dam than from its own
                      wells. The cost for water from the river was 285 rialdm3 in 2002/03 and
                      19.92 rialdm3 for water from the wells. The cost i s assumed to increase at
                      20% for the water from the dam and 10% for the water from the wells

General

1.      Procurement in the Islamic Republic o f Iran i s governed mainly by the "By-laws on Government
Transactions". Inprinciple, this law governs all public sector entities including state owned enterprises.
The provisions of these laws allow decentralization in conducting public procurement by the public
entity. Although there are no provisions by law for a central procurement organization, the MPO in the
Ministry o f Economic Affairs and Finance (MEAF) conducts a central role in public procurement. It
regularly issues documents on public procurement that are followed by the public entities. These include
regulations, circulars, biddingdocuments, standards for technical specifications and unit prices. These last
two are mainly for civil works and consultants. More importantly i s the system for qualifying contractors
and consultants. The MPO categorizes all contractors and consultants according to their capacity and
specialization. Public entities can invite bidders from among the recommended lists o f these qualified
contractors and consultants The entities on these lists will be determined according to the size o f the
contract and the capacity o f the contractors and consultants, takmg into consideration their on-going
commitments. Recruitment o f international consultants i s always subject to the approval o f the MPO. A
draft procurement law i s in its final stages o f being approved. However, the Bank has not reviewed this
yet. The major issues that face projects financed by the Bank i s the unfamiliarity o f the MPO and other
government entities o f the Bank procurement guidelines and procedures, and consequently not accepting
to apply these procedures or allow their precedence incases o f conflict with those o f the Bank.

2.      The Bank intends to conduct a Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) in FY04. A
Public Expenditure Review (PER) mission was conducted in2003 with participation o f procurement and
financial management senior staff and consultants. This has resulted in a good preliminary assessment of
the public procurement environment in Iran. This assessment has not been considered as a substitute for
the CPAR, but it helped identify some critical issues that need to be addressed under Bank financed
projects. These issues were further supported by observations from TTLs, PS and PAS involved in
projects in Iran. A dialogue has been initiated between the Bank and the Iranian Government, and in
particular MEAF with the objective o f reaching a framework agreement on fiduciary issues in World
Bank projects in Iran. The Bank has conducted a mission to address this subject in mid December 2003.
The outcomes of this mission will be a Memorandum o f Understanding that will set the steps towards
reaching a framework agreement to ensure adequate procurement and implementation arrangements for
Bank financed projects inIran.

3.      In the interim, the MEAF will provide, on behalf o f the Govemment, a one-year (renewable)
exemption for all procurement to be conducted under the project. This exemption will ensure that all
procurement will be carried in according with the loan agreement provisions. The procurement packages
that will benefit from this exemption are all those listed inthe first year procurementplan.

Use of BankGuidelinesandStandardBiddingDocuments

4.      Procurement o f Goods and Works will be carried in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for
Procurement under IBRD and IDA Credits (January 1995 and revised in January and August 1996,

                                                  128

September 1997 and January 1999). For ICB o f works and goods the standard biddingdocuments (SBD)
of the Bank will be used. These will be: Procurement o f Works, Procurement o f Smaller Works, Supply
and Installation of Equipment (to be used for the construction and installation o f wastewater treatment
plants with the appropriate modifications) and the SBD for the procurement o f Goods. For procurement
under National Competitive Bidding (NCB), agreement should be reached on a standard bidding
document, in Farsi, that will be acceptable to the Bank to be used for the procurement o f works. The
agreement on this document will be under the framework that will be reached as indicated under
paragraph 2 above. The draft o f this document will be prepared by the NWWEC and submitted to the
Bank for review by end o f May 2004, with a final draft to be ready by end o f July 2004. The agreed
procedures for NCB should ensure that all bidding opportunity will be advertised with a reasonable time
for submission o f bids (not less then thirty days), evaluation criteria will be clearly stated in the bidding
documents, pricing o f bids will be based on unit rates proposed by the bidders and not on offering
discounts (or increase) on unit rates, a one envelope system will be used, a public bid opening in which
the prices o f bidders are read out will be promptly conducted after the deadline for submission o fbids and
award will be to the technically responsive bidder who has offered the lowest price and had the required
qualifications.  For all evaluation reports, the Bank standard evaluation report form for the Procurement
of Goods or Works will be used, to be simplified incase o fNCB procedures.

5.       Procurement o f Services will be carried out in accordance with the Guidelines: Selection and
Employment o f Consultants by World Bank Borrowers (January 1997, revised in September 1997,
January 1999 and M a y 2002). The standard Request for Proposal (RFP) for Selection o f Consultants and
the standard forms o f contracts will be used for all contracts above US$lOO,OOO equivalent. A simplified
version o f the standard RFP and contracts will be used for contracts below US$lOO,OOO equivalent.
Selection o f individual consultants will be carried by comparison o f CV's and using simplified contracts,
acceptable to the Bank. For the evaluation o f firms, the Sample Form o f EvaluationReport for Selection
of Consultants will be used. One issue that will be discussed and agreed under the framework agreement
for procurement arrangements i s the applicability o f the Consultant Guidelines to all Bank financed
assignments under the project and that all eligible consultants can apply to participate in the procurement
process without any restriction.

Advertising

6.       A General Procurement Notice (GPN) will be published online in the United Nations
Development Business (UNDB), dgMurket and in at least in two local newspapers o f nationtal
circulation. The GPNwill provide a description o f the Project and will list all contracts for the works and
goods that will be procured under ICB, and consultants' services estimated at more than US$lOO,OOO.
Specific Procurement Notices (SPN) for all pre-qualifications, ICBs and NCBs for goods and works will
be published in at least two national newspapers. For the construction and installation o f new treatment
plants and contracts for works estimated to cost more the $5 million), the SPN will also be published
online in the dgMurket and UNDB. For all requests for Expressions o f Interest (EOI) estimated to cost
more then $100,000, publicationwill be online inthe dgMurket, UNDB and inthe nationalpress.

ProcurementCapacity

7.       The preparation mission has conducted a preliminary assessment o f the procurement capacity o f
the four water and wastewater companies that were the subject o f the feasibility studies. The contracting
departments in these companies have considerable experience in local procurement, and in particular
procurement o f works. However, they have no exposure to intemational procurement, nor howledge of


                                                 129

Bank procedures in relation to procurement o f large works and selection and employment o f consultants.
Weak knowledge of English language represents also a considerable obstacle.

8.       The capacity of the contracting departments in the two companies will be strengthened to enable
them to handle the procurement activities under the proposed loan. This will be achieved by recruiting a
procurement officer in each o f the TSUs that will be established for the each WWCs and a senior
procurement officer for the NWWEC. In addition, the WWCs should recruit and/or nominate from the
existing staff, candidates to be trained on the Bank procurement guidelines, procedures and use o f
StandardBiddingDocuments (SBDs).

9.       The main procurement function o f the TSUs in the WWCs will be to conduct national and local
competitive bidding for works and the selection o f consultants for the related design and supervision
service. For the procurement o f large contracts under ICBs and recruitment o f consultant firms, these
TSUs will be supported by the experts recruited within the NWWEC to ensure efficiency, accumulation
o f experience and avoid duplications o f efforts. WWCs/TSUs will use local consultants for engineering
design and construction supervision for routine works, but would need international expertise for more
complex works such as wastewater treatment works.

10.      It is critical that the NWWEC and the WWCs should select and recruit qualified procurement
experts July 2004. The pre-appraisal mission has provided sample TORSfor the assignments o f these
officers. These recruits should be trained on Bank procurement procedures prior to the effectiveness o f
the loan. Such training can be carried by arranging training o f these recruits in an institution that delivers
training on Bank procurement according to the Bank procedures, or alternatively to arrange for a training
workshop to be delivered inIran. The second alternative may be more cost effective and more acceptable
to the Iranian Government.

ProcurementPlan

11.      The procurement plan for the first year i s detailed in Annex 14. This plan contains the
programmed activities for water and wastewater networks in the two cities at an estimated value o f
US$81 million, and for technical assistance packages at an estimated value o f US$22.43 million. The
packaging for the remaining water and wastewater networks will be re-programmed duringthe first year
of the project after the consultants for the design o f these networks are recruited.. Each company will
update the plan for all the procurement activities under its sub-components. The Senior Procurement
Officer in the NWWEC will be responsible for consolidating these plans. Procurement o f all works,
goods and services will be undertaken in accordance with this plan as approved by the Bank. This plan
has to be updated quarterly.

ProcurementImplementationArrangements

12.      The procurement for each company will be handled by the T S U o f each company with support
from the TSU inthe " W E C for all ICBs for works and consultancy assignments estimated to cost more
than US$lOO,OOO.

13.      The procurement arrangements for works are as follows:

     (i)   Works for the water network: estimated at US$121 million o f the overall project cost to include
           rehabilitation and expansion o f water treatment plants, construction of new transmission lines,
           construction of reservoirs, building and equipping pumping stations, drilling and equipping

                                                130

       wells in addition to the rehabilitation and expansion of the secondary distribution network. Due
       to the nature of the works and the gradual building up of the network, a sizable portion o f these
        sub-components will be bidunder NCB procedures. For any contract requiringtunneling with a
       value more then $10 million, a pre-qualification process of contractors will be carried. All
       contracts over $5 million will be procured under ICB procedures. Rehabilitation and expansion
       o f the existing network (laterals) will be done in small packages under NCB procedures that
       will be distributedover the five years of the project. The main procurement packages will be
       launched during the first two years of the project.

   (ii)Worksforthewastewaternetwork:estimatedatUS$246millionoftheoverallproject.This
       cost includes construction of outfalls for the WWTPs, construction of main trunks, laterals and
       interceptors, building and equippingpumping stations, in addition to the installations o f house
       connections. The majority of contracts for the trunks and pumping stations will be carried under
       ICB procedures. For any contract requiringtunnelingwith a value more then $10 million, apre-
       qualification process will be carried. All contracts over $5 million will be procured under ICB
       procedures. Addition of house connections will be done in small packages under NCB
       procedures distributed over the five years of the project.

   (iii)ConstructionandInstallationofNewWastewater Treatment Plants: the estimatescost is
       US$66 million for the two new WWTPs in the two cities and the rehabilitation of Ahwaz
       western WWTP. The construction of the new WWTPs will be conducted under ICB procedures
       while conducting pre-qualification to determine the qualified contactors that will be invited for
       the two bids. The biddingdocuments will be based on the SBD for the "Supply and Installation
        of Equipment" modified to fit the specific requirements under the project. Due to the
        considerable time for design and construction, the schedule for this sub-component i s on the
        critical path and should be launchedprior to loan effectiveness. The rehabilitation o fthe Ahwaz
       western WWTP will be done usingNCB procedures.

14.   Consulting Services, Technical Assistance and Training.             The main packages under this
component are as follows:

   (0   Supervision services for water and wastewater works: the estimated value o f the assignments
        for the supervision for water and wastewater works i s US$15.30 million. These will be
        packaged to the extent possible and the selection will be mainly usingthe Least Cost Selection
        (LCS) method for assignmentsestimated to cost less then $200,000 while the Quality and Cost
        based Selection Method (QCBS) will be used for the other assignments. Preparation o f TORS
        and long listingprocess for the supervision of works to be executed inthe first year for the two
        cities should commence prior to the loan effectiveness.

   (ii)DesignandSupervision ofWWTP: these canbetwo orpossiblyonecontract torecruita
        consultant to design and supervise the construction, installation and operation of the two new
        WWTPs. The long listing process should be launched at the earliest time possible as this
        component i s on a critical path. It i s important to launch the requests for expression o f Interest
        promptly. The method of selection to be used i s QCBS. The estimated value for this sub-
        component is 2.59 US$ million.

   (iii)Environmental MonitoringSystem, Studies inthe sector and technical assistanceonleak
        detection measures will be programmed during the first year o f the project. The methods o f
        procurement to be used will be QCBS for values above $100,000 and selection based on


                                                131

          Consultants Qualifications (CQ) for values less then $100,000. The estimated value for this
          sub-component i s US$ 6.5 million.

          Strengthening the WWCs and Training: this sub-component includes several specialized
          training activities and targeted technical assistance for the water companies. The methods o f
          selection to be used will be LCS for training estimated to cost less then $200,000 and CQ for
          the technical assistance for values below $100,000 and QCBS for the remaining assignments.
          The estimated budget for these activities i s US$2.3 million.

          Project Management: this component i s estimated at US$ 5.0 million and targeted to recruit
          individual consultants and firms to assist in the management o f the project at the water
          companies. The methods o f selection will be CQ for values o f assignments estimated at less
          then $100,000 inthe case o f firms and comparison o fCVs for individual consultants.

15.     Equipment for LeakDetection: this component is relatively small (US$ 2.16 million) and aims
at acquiring equipment that will assist the companies inthe detection o f leaks and the maintenance o f the
distribution and collection systems. Procurement will be done according to ICB, NCB using a bidding
document and procedures acceptable to the Bank and shopping methods inaccordance with the provisions
o fparagraphs 3.5 & 3.6 o fthe Guidelines.

16.     Goods and Works. Procurement o f goods and works will be carried out using the following
methods:

           International Competitive Bidding will be used for contracts o f works estimated at
          US$5,000,000 and above, andfor contracts o f goods estimated at US$500,000 and above.

          National Competitive Bidding, including national advertisements, bidding documents that are
           acceptable to the Bank, and public bid openings will be used for contracts o f works estimated to
           cost less than US$5,000,000 equivalent per contract, and for contracts o f goods estimated to
           cost less than US$500,000 equivalent per contract. The aggregate value o f contracts that will
           be awarded under this procedure will not exceed US$300,000,000 equivalent for works, and
           US$2,000,000 equivalent for goods.

           Shopping may be used for goods estimated to cost less than US$lOO,OOO equivalent per
           contract. The request for quotations shall be inwriting and addressed to at least three suppliers.
           The request for quotations will contain the following: technical specifications, delivery time,
           payment conditions- and any other information that may assist the suppliers in preparing
           competitive offers. The aggregate value o f contracts that will be awarded under this procedure
           shall not exceed US$500,000 equivalent.

           Direct Contracting will be used for the specialized procurement of goods when NCB and
           Shopping methods would not be efficient and economical, and for works o f an emergency
          nature. Direct Contracting would follow the requirements inparagraph 3.7 o f the Guidelines for
           Procurement under IBRDLoans and IDA Credits.

17.     Consultant Services: The following procurement methods for selection o f consultants will be
used: (i) QCBS will be used for selection of consultant services with value o f contracts estimated at more
than US$200,000 equivalent for the assignments for supervision services for tunnels and main trunks,
design and supervision o f WWTP, environmental monitoring system, Studies in the sector technical
assistance on leak detection measures and strengthening the WWCs; (ii)     LCS will be used for supervision
services and training estimated to cost less then $200,000 (iii)Selection Based on Consultant's

                                                132

Qualifications will be used for assignments estimated at less than US$lOO,OOO equivalent per contract for
the technical assistance on leak detection measures, strengthening the WWCs and project management;
and (iv) Selection of Individual Consultants will be used in accordance with paragraphs 5.1 to 5.3 o f the
Guidelines. In exceptional cases, and wherever justified in the context o f the overall interests of the
Project, single-source selection of consultants for services estimated to cost less than $50,000 equivalent
per contract may, with the Bank's prior agreement, be procured in accordance with the provisions o f
paragraphs 3.8 through3.1 1o f the Consultant Guidelines

18.     For assignments for consultant firms estimated at less than US$lOO,OOO equivalent, the short list
may be comprised entirely o f national firms, provided at least three qualified local firms are available and
competition including foreign consultants i s not justified.     However, international firms will not be
excluded from consideration, ifthey have expressed interest.

19.     The thresholds for procurement methods and prior review are indicated in Table B. The total
value o f contracts subject to prior review i s estimated at US$234 million. All other contracts will be
subject to post-review and procurement audit on a random basis by the Bank. Procurement files will be
maintained for review by the Bank'ssupervision missions.

Overall Procurement RiskAssessment

20.     Based on the existing information on the overall environment for procurement and in particular
the approach to procurement under Bank financed projects and the procurement capacity assessment o f
the companies, the overall procurement risk assessment i s judged to be high.The measures for mitigating
these risks will be through the framework agreement that will be reached between the Bank and the
Government on the fiduciary arrangements for Bank financed projects, reachingan agreement on standard
bidding document that will used for procurement o f works under NCB, providing training to the
procurement officers inthe companies and preparingfirst year biddingpackages.

21.     The NWWEC has recruited two consulting firms for the preparation o f the first year design and
bidding documents for the water supply and wastewater networks to be funded from the Companies'
budgets. The deliverables o f these two firms will be the design and bidding documents for the works
under the first year procurement plan.

Frequencyof Procurement Supervision

22.     Bank supervision missions will be carried out every four months for the first year and every six
months thereafter. Two ex-post review audits will be done during the first year and from thereon at least
once a year. The ex-post review missions will be supported by a national consultant.

Documents for Withdrawals

The borrower has indicatedofficially that the transaction based disbursement method will be used for this
project.

Use of Statements of Expenditures(SOEs) (same as procurementthresholds)

Duringimplementation, SOE will be used for all expenditures for: (i)        Treatment works under contracts
costing less than US$5,000,000 (ii)     works under contracts costing less than US$5,000,000 equivalent
each; (ii) goods under contracts costing less than US$500,000; (iii)services under consultant firms
contracts costing less than US$lOO,OOO equivalent each and under individual consultant contracts costing
less than US$50,000 equivalent each; and (iv) the project management costs, under such terms and
conditions as the Bank shall specify by notice to the Borrower. The supporting documentation would be
maintained by the W W C and made available for review by Bank supervision missions upon request,
documentation relating to SOEs would be retained for up to one year from the date the Bank receives the
audit report for the fiscal year inwhich the last withdrawal from the loan account was made.

Special Account (SA)

As the different portions o f the loan, depending on the channeling modality, will be subject to different
regulations and controls, and to facilitate project implementationand make timely payments o f the Bank's
share o f eligible expenditures to contractors, suppliers, consultants and others, each WWC will open two
U S Dollars SAs, after receiving the Central Bank (CB) approval, at a commercial bank. The SAs that will
deposit the funds channeled as budget transfers to the WWC will have an authorized allocation o f US$4
million and an initial deposit o f US$2 million, while the SAs that will deposit the funds channeled inthe
form o f liability being will have an authorized allocation o f US$2 million and an initial deposit o f US$1
million. The full allocationmay be claimed when disbursements and special commitments, financed from
the budget transfer funds, reach US$15 million while the full allocation may be claimed when
disbursements and special commitments, financed from the liability funds, reach US$7 million. The fifth
 SA managed by the NWWEC will have an authorized allocation o f 0.5 million and an initial deposit o f
US$ 5250,000. The full allocation may be claimed when disbursements and special commitments reach
US$I.5 million. The Replenishment o fthe SA would follow Bank's procedures, and a Bank's statement o f
 SA transactions would support all replenishment applications. The minimum amount for applications
regarding direct payments and special commitments would be 20% o f the respective authorized
 allocations to the SAs. Requests for replenishment each o f the SA will be submitted on a monthly basis.
Also local accounts will be opened for the project counterpart funds and will be replenishment as per
 local procedures. The SA statements will be part o f the project financial statements, which will be audited
 annually by independent extemal auditors acceptable to the Bank.

Executive Summary and Conclusion

 The Ahwaz (A), Shiraz (S) Water and Waste Water Companies (WWC) and the National Water and
Waste Water EngineeringCompany (NWWEC) (E), supported by Technical Support Units (TSU) will be
responsible for managing the project funds and all related financial transactions. The WWC operates as
private sector entities and the systems inplace are based on the principles and procedures o f the trading
 law o f The Islamic Republic o f Iran. Part o f the loan proceeds will be channeled to the WWCs inthe form
 o f budget transfers, while the balance will be transferred in the form o f liability where the repayment o f
the capital and all cost associated with the interest and commitment fees wouldbe the responsibility o f the

WWC. The part of the project made available to the water companies on budget transfer basis will be
implemented through the regulations governing the national budget processes. All payments, under this
part o f the project, will be subject to the govemment laws, regulations and controls. While the flow o f the
funds channeled on lending basis to the companies will be subject to the policies, procedures and controls
inplace at the water companies. The technical assistant component ofthe project will be implementedby
the NWWEC which operates as a private sector entity and collects fees from the W W C across the country.

In the absence of a Country Financial Accountability Assessment and being the first project to be
implementedby these two WWCs and the NWWEC, the financial risk i s rated high.Certain activities are
required prior to declaring the project effective so to reduce this risk and allow easy flow o f project funds
and the generation o f reliable project reports on timely basis. The two WWCs and the N W W E C financial
management arrangements were reviewed and the findings can be summarized as follows:

                                              reduce the project financial risk.
Overall Financial       Satisfactory
Managementrating



This assessment showed that despite being owned by the government the WWCs and the NWWEC
operate as private sector entities and follow the principles and procedures as definedby the trading law of
The Islamic Republic of Iran. The companies issue year-end financial statements that are audited by
external independent auditors. The control environment was found to be adequate however the financial
system requires enhancement to become capable o f generating timely project reports including the
Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs).

WWCs &NWWECCurrent FinancialManagement Practices and IT System

The two WWCs, beingAhwaz and Shiraz, and the NWWEC were visitedandthe financial systemswere
reviewedby examining the respective accounting systems, accounting policies andprocedures, budgeting
systems, assets management procedures, reporting systems capabilities, staffing, intemal controls policies
andprocedures, internal auditing and external auditing arrangements. The systems inplace are capable of
following on the project fimds to be channeled through Special Accounts (SA) which would be opened by
each WWC and the NWWEC. However the accounting standards followed by the WWCs and the
auditing standards applied by the WWCs external auditor's, specially the presentation o f the auditor
opinions, are not in conformity with International Accounting Standards (IAS) and International
Standards of Auditingrespectively. Inorder to adhere to the IAS, staff will be required to attend training.

                                                  140

Training programs will be designedand deliveredwithin the scope of the project. To allow proper project
reporting, the accounting systems will be enhanced to become capable of generating quarterly project
reports as requiredbythe Bank inthe form of Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs).

The WWCs & NWWECEnhancedArrangements

The WWCs and the NWWEC systems are characterized with acceptable controls, however, to avoid the
risk of not being able to generate timely reports for project management and monitoring purposes, the
accounting systems will be enhancedthrough the creation of a new cost center that will recordthe project
transactions and accounts. This configuration will be finalized and tested prior to the end of June 2004.
Also, financial officers will be hired, within the TSUs at eachWWC and at the NWWEC, to follow on the
project accounts and generatethe project individual financial reports and the quarterly FMRs.The current
laws requires that two accounts be opened within the government budget and a framework agreement
signed, inorder to reduce the risk of the project not beingable to disburse the funds channeled on budget
transfer basis and as counterpart funds to the WWCs.

As the enhanced procedures that will follow on the project accounts are not reflected in WWCs
regulations and inorder to ensure the accuracy and completenessof the project accounts andto define the
relation between all departments involved with the project implementation thus facilitate the flow of
information related to the project, the financial officers, assistedby an external financial consultant, will
prepare the project Financial Operations Manual, integratingthe applicable laws and outlining the project
arrangements by detailing:

                 The Financial Officer's responsibilities within the WWCs financial departments and his
                 relationshipwith the MEAFfinancial controller;

                 The insertion of the Project inthe Development Budget and the framework agreementto
                 be signedbetween MPO andthe WWCs.

                 The project chart of accounts and accounting principles, practices and methods the
                 project will follow. This chart of account should reflect the classification o f WWCs
                 classifications, ifapplicable, for easy reconciliation;

                 The budgetingprocess;

                 The reconciliationprocedures, timingand output betweenthe two systems;

                 The request for funds from the MEAFandthe replenishment of the project SAs

                 The document flow;

                 The frequency and forms of the financial reports;

                 Banking arrangements,

                 others

Flow of Fundsand Controls

As the differentportions of the loan, depending on the channeling modality, will be subject to different
regulations and controls, and to ensure that funds are available for project implementation, five U S $
Special Accounts will be opened in addition to the accounts for the counter part financing. Each water
company will prepare and follow on the project withdrawal applications and direct payment requests
relating to its activities, while the NWWEC will manage the fifth SA which will be used to finance the

                                                 141

TA activities with scope to cover the two WWCs. The flow o f the project funds will depend on the
channeling modality. All invoices, either for advance payments or for incurred expenses will be subject to
applicable controls and procedures. These invoices will be approved by the appropriate implementing
department and will be honored through payments signed by the MEAF controller if financed from the
budget transfer funds. In turn, the MEAF will transfer the counterpart funds to WWCs after the MPO
opens the required budget lines. Deposits into and payments out o f the $ SAs, to pay
contractors/suppliers/consultants, will be made in accordance with the provision of the Loan Agreement.

AuditingArrangements

Each o f the two companies and the NWWEC will issue a separate audit report as they are independent
entities with no financial relation whatsoever between them. Accordingly, each of the WWCs and the
NWWEC will remit to the Bank not later than six months after the end o f each year, the project audit
report covering the part implemented by the respective company. The extemal audit reports shall
encompass all project related activities and shall be in accordance with internationally accepted auditing
standards e.g., Intemational Standards on Auditing (ISA). The annual audit report of the project accounts

shall include an opinion on the project financial statements. Also, the audit report shall include a separate
opinion on the different SAs transactions reconciling opening and year-end balances. In addition to the
audit reports, the auditor will prepare a "management letter" identifying any observations, comments and
deficiencies, in the system and controls, that the auditor considers pertinent, and shall provide
recommendations for their improvements. The external independent auditor should be acceptable to the
Bank and his TOR will be prepared and submitted for the Bank's no objection, at least nine months prior
to the end o fthe project fiscal year.

Also, each o f the WWCs will remit to the Bank not later than six months after the end of each year, the

DisbursementArrangements

To ensure that funds are readily available for project implementation at the two companies, four SAs in
U S Dollars will be opened at a commercial bank as per the Central Bank instructions and will be operated
by the respective WWCs. A fifth SA will be opened and managedbythe NWWEC.Initially, an advance
for the equivalent o f about six months expenditures will be transferred to each o f the SAs upon
effectiveness o f the Loan and receipt o f signed withdrawal applications. The SAs that will deposit the
funds channeled as budgettransfers to the WWC, will have an authorized allocation o f US$4 million and
an initial deposit o f US$2 million, while the SAs that will deposit the funds channeled in the form o f
liability will have an authorized allocation o f U S $2 million and an initial deposit o f 1 million. The full
allocation may be claimed when disbursements and special commitments, financed from the budget
transfer funds, reach US$15 million while the full allocation may be claimed when disbursements and
special commitments, financed from the liability funds, reach US$7 million. Whde the fifth S A managed
by the NWWECwill have an authorized allocation o f 0.5 million and an initial deposit o f $250,000. The
full allocation may be claimed when disbursements and special commitments reach US$1.5 million.
Replenishment applications will be prepared and submitted to the Bank by the appropriate company.
Authorized signatories, names and corresponding specimens o f their signatures will also be submitted to

The strengths that provide basis o freliance on the project financial management system include:

          (a)- The centralization o f all payments by the WWCs and the enhancement o f the accounting
          system for the generation o fthe FMRs.

          (b)- The laws, controls andregulations applicable to the public sector and to the WWCS that will
          be applied for the project activities and funds.

BankSupervision

The requirements for Bank supervision will intensify initially in order to ensure that the financial
arrangements are implemented. The first supervision mission after effectiveness will take the form o f a
launch workshop where a seminar on Bank rules, regulations and guidelines will be presented. The
project will be supervised every four months for the first eighteen months, then every six months
thereafter. Bank supervision missions will consist of visits to the two WWCs, the NWWEC and MPO to
review financial management practices, procurement methods, payment procedures and documentation,
inadditionto fieldvisits to the project sites andother agencies concerned.

              AHWAZ AND SHIRAZWATER SUPPLYAND SANITATIONPROJECT


A.      OVERVIEW

The proposed project covers the rehabilitation and expansion ofthe waster supply andwastewater system
inAhwaz and Shiraz citiesinorder to copewith growingdemands.

Ahwaz, the capital of Khozestan province is located at approximately 875 kmfrom Tehran. The present
population i s about 950,000 and i s projected to reach 2.2 million by the year 2027. Ahwaz i s one of the
most important economical centers of the Islamic Republic of Iran as it i s locatedinan oil-rich region and
hosts a number o f large industries. The Karoon River, the largest river in Iran, flows along Ahwaz and
dividesthe city into two separate drainage zones.

At present, 99% and 63% of the population are connected to public water supply and sanitary sewerage,
respectively. Areas without wastewater either use seepage pits or discharge their wastewater in open
channels, rivers or inopen grounds creating wastewater pools, polluting the soil and water resources, and
creating healthhazards. To improve the wastewater situation, the existing wastewater treatment plant that
was constructed in 1977 has been recently rehabilitated and put into operation. This treatment plant,
which i s based on tertiary activated sludge with nitrification, denitrification and chlorination, serves the
westerndrainage zone but can only treat the wastewater generatedby 140,000 persons.

The pollution o f the Karoon Riveris a major problem and apriority issue not only for Ahwaz but also for
the whole province. The discharge of untreated municipal and industrial effluents, the drainage from
agricultural lands, and the uncontrolled discharge o f solid wastes directly into the River and its tributaries
have considerably degraded the water quality of Karoon. Available treatment facilities have provedto be
insufficient to produce adequate drinking water quality. At present, water from well fields i s being
transferred around 70 km and blended with the river water in order to reduce the concentration o f
contaminants and make it treatable. However, the maximum water that can be obtained represents less
than 10% o f Ahwaz water demand and as such cannot improve the degraded water quality to acceptable
levels. Consumers are switching to new sources o f hnking water (15-20 liter deposit-refund containers)
or taking measuresto reduce the contamination of the drinhng water (filtering andboilingtap water).

The poor water quality is largely contributing to highdiarrhea prevalence that reaches 50% duringpeak
months. Out of the total gastro-enteritis cases inIran duringthe year 2000, 10% were reported inAhwaz,
which accounts for only 1.5% o f the total population o f the Islamic Republic of Iran but where there is
acute pollution o f both ground water and surface water. Furthermore, estimates o f water production and
consumption rates indicates a very highpercentage o f unaccounted for water (around 40%) as a result of
the poor conditions o fthe existing distributionnetwork.

Shiraz is the capital ofFars province and is located at approximately 925 kmto the south ofTehran. The
present population i s about 1,200,000 and i s projectedto reach 1,950,000 by the year 2027. Shiraz has a
richhistorical heritage and i s close to Persepolis, the most important archeological site o fthe country.

It is estimated that about 99% of the inhabitants of Shiraz are currently connected to the city's water
supply network. Water quality monitoring indicates that the water supply is of acceptable quality and in
compliance with national and WHO standards. Chemical, physical and bacteriological analyses are



                                                 155

conducted on a daily basis at various points including water sources, storage reservoirs and distribution
network. The major problems raised by the Water and Wastewater Company i s the high percentage o f
unaccounted for water (around 30%) and the need to rehabilitate a considerable portion o f the network.
Rehabilitation o f the network has been initiated but i s proceeding at a very slow rate due to limited
financial resources. Other problems identified by the Water and Wastewater Company are the relatively
low water quality o f Alluvial ground water sources that have highlevels o f hardness and nitrates, and the
insufficient water pressure insome zones o f the distributionnetwork.

Similar to other cities, wastewater collection, treatment and disposal are the main environmental concern
inShiraz. At present only 8% o fthe population is connected to the wastewater collection system. Dueto
the high water table and low soil permeability, the use o f existing seepage pits has been unsatisfactory
causing groundwater contamination. A great part o f the wastewater i s discharged inthe seasonal rivers o f
the city or in open drainage channels that run along the roads adjacent to the residential areas. Duringthe
dry periods, the channels become open wastewater collectors emitting noxious odors, attracting
mosquitoes and affecting the health o f the residents. The wastewater collected by the existing sewers i s
conveyed along Khoshk River that divides the city in two parts and ultimately discharges in Maharloo
Lake.

The impact o f wastewater onpublic health i s consideredto be less than that experienced inother cities yet
water related diseases such as cholera and gastro enteritis are being reported by the health centers o f the
city and have been attributed mainly to the irrigation o f raw eaten vegetables with untreated wastewater.
It was also reported that around 21 wells have been decommissioned due to contamination, mainly in
areas where groundwater i s relatively high.Inorder to improve public health conditions and to reduce the
contamination o f the water resources, the Water and Wastewater Company has started implementing a
wastewater system for the whole city.

B.      Project Objectives and Components

The objectives o fthe proposed Water and Sanitation Project are:

C.      Project Description

The requiredworks for water and wastewater will be completed over four phases, with phase one from
2003 to 2007, phase two from 2008 to 2012, phase three from 2012 to 2017 and phase four from 2018 to
2027. The proposedWater and Sanitation Project will cover works to beincludedinthe first phase (2003
to 2007).

Ahwaz:
Water supply: At present 99% of the City's population i s served by the water supply network. The total
water demand o f the city i s 4.53 m3/s and i s expectedto reach 6.4 m3/s by the year 2027. Karoon River i s
the main source o f water for the City of Ahwaz. Over the past 30 years, average and minimumflows in
the river were 700 and 170 m3/s respectively, which by far exceeds the total water demands o f the year
2027. The deterioration of water quality in the river i s a major concem. Existing conventional water
treatments plants have proved to be inadequate in providing a treated water quality that would meet
drinking water standards. Water quality analyses over the past 20 years clearly show that the river water
does not meet potable water standards and requires additional treatment mainly for eliminating odor and
taste, and reducing dissolved solids prior to its use, hence additional treatment processes are proposed. In
addition and to meet the water demand of the year 2027, an increase inthe capacity of existing facilities
(treatment plants, storage reservoirs and distribution network) is needed. As part of the proposed project,
the following water works will be executed:

              Rehabilitation o f the three existing water treatment plants by the construction o f pre-
              sedimentation units and the addition of dual media layers, ozonation and activated carbon
              in Treatment Plants 1 and 2. In addition to the renovation and replacement of various
              mechanical and civil processing unitsand installation of flow meters and data loggers at the
              inlets and outlets of the Treatment Plants 1&2. Moreover, extension of Treatment Plant 2
              will be implemented to increase its capacity from 4.05 m3/sto 5.2 m3/s and extend the
              intake 20 minside the river to ensurewithdrawing acceptablewater quality;

              Layingo f 10 kmsteel transmission pipelines from the water treatment plants 1and 2 to the
               storage reservoirs, diameter ranges from 700- 2000 mm;

              Rehabilitation and extension of the water network with diameters ranging from 200-600
              mmwith atotal lengthof266 km;

              Construction of five concrete square reservoirs o f 50,000 m3 capacity each inHasir Abad
              area as well as construction of requiredpumpingstations.

Wastewater: Presentwastewater volume generatedinthe city o f Ahwaz i s 99,400 m3 /d (29,300 m3 /d in
the westem zone and 70,100 m3 /d inthe eastern zone) and i s expected to reach 504,400 m3 /d (203,900
m3 /d in the westem zone and 300,500 m3 /d inthe eastem zone) by the year 2027. Ahwaz wastewater
plan proposes that sewage generated in the westem zone will be conveyed to the existing Choneibah
wastewater treatment plant, while sewage generated in the eastern zone will be conveyed to a new
wastewater treatment plant. The Choneibah wastewater treatment plant will be rehabilitated and its
capacity will be increased to reach 204,000 m3 /d by the year 2027. The proposed new wastewater
treatment plant inthe eastem zone i s based on activated sludge process plus nitrification, denitrification
and chlorination. The plant will be constructed in 3 phases to reach a capacity of 300,500 m3 /d by the
year 2027. As part of the proposed project, the following wastewater works will be executed:




                                                  157

               Construction of 60 kmof concrete trunk mains ineast and west of Ahwaz, out of which 2.6
               km of Western trunk main with size 1200 mm and 3.5 kmof the eastern trunk main with
                size 1600 mm will be constructed as tunnels. The eastern trunk main will collect
               wastewater from the easternbasin and transfer it to the proposed new treatment plant, while
               the western trunk main will collect the wastewater from the western basin and transfer it to
               the existing Choneibeh treatment plant;

               Construction of 162 km o f PE laterals and interceptors and 16 lift and pump stations.
               Works under this sub-component will cover an area of 1465 ha

               Rehabilitation and expansion o f the existing treatment plant at the west of Ahwaz,
               Choneibeh, to meet its design capacity of 200 P.E. This will be done by replacing various
               mechanical parts, repairing o f concrete parts, adding a new unit that will enable treating a
                flow of 54,575 m3/das well as providing sludge lagoons and storage facilities.

               Construction of first two modules of the treatment plant with a capacity o f 522 P.E, treating
               a flow of 102,000 m3/d. The proposed treatment process i s activated sludge with
               nitrification and de-nitrification. As this treatment plant i s proposed to be constructed as a
               DBO, its design will be finalized after tendering.

Shiraz:
At present 99% ofthe City's population is servedbythe water supply network. The total water demand of
the city i s 288,600 m3/day and i s expected to reach 474,400 m3/day by the year 2027. The current water
demands are supplied from surface and ground water resources. Surface water i s provided from the
Douroudzamdam located 100kmnorth-west o f Shiraz. The quantity of water that i s currently transferred
from the Dam i s about 71,700 m3/day, representing 25% of the present water demand o f the city, and i s
being increased by the Fars Regional Water Board to reach 155,500 m3/day by the year 2005. The
existing water treatment plant utilizes a conventional water treatment scheme which includes:
flocculation, sedimentation, filtration and chlorination. The remaining supply o f the city's water i s
provided from 69 ground water wells, which supply 261,800 m3/day. Out of the total number o f operating
wells, there are 16 wells that are located in the Alluvium aquifer inside the city while the others are
located in the Karstic aquifer. Wells located in the alluvium aquifer supply only 40,600 m3/day of
extremely hard water and will be soon put out o f service. As part of the proposed project, the following
water works will be executed:

               Dnlling and equipping of 17 new wells tapping Karstic water resources. Total water
                abstractedby these wells amounts to 82,000 m3/d;

               Laying of 34 km GRP transmission pipelines feeding distribution system and transmitting
               water from wells to reservoirs. Diameters range between 500-1200 mm;

               Rehabilitation and extension o f the water network including installatiop o f pressure
               reducingvalves. Diameters range between 200-400 mmwith a total length of 235 kmo f PE
               pipes;

               Construction o f four concrete reservoirs Sonboleh (7500m3), Abeverdi (300 m3), R8
                (20,000m3), and R20 as well as constructionof two pumping stations.

Wastewater: Shiraz i s divided into two major drainage zones, referred to as Emergency Drainage Zone
and Long Term Zone with drainage areas o f 6,760 and 15,315 hectares, respectively. The Present
generatedwastewater volume i s around 206,600 m3 /d (64,500 m3 /d inthe emergency zone and 139,100
m3 /d in the long-term zone) and is expected to reach 363,850 m3 /d (115,750 m3 /d inthe emergency
zone and 248,100 m3 /d inthe long-term zone) bythe year 2027.




                                                  158

The wastewater management systemhas been designed for the year 2027 and includes around 3000 kmo f
collection mains and trunk lines and two secondary treatment plants referred to as the Emergency plant
and the Long Term plant.       The necessity for two treatment plants i s not related to the urgency o f
implementing treatment works, but rather to the fact that the city i s divided into two drainage zones. Both
treatment plants are based on the use o f activated sludge with effluent disinfection by chlorination. The
Emergency treatment plant has an ultimate capacity o f 123,500 m3 /d ,whereas the Long Term plant has
an ultimate capacity o f 266,000 m3 /d. Treated effluent o f both plants will be reused for irrigation,
whereas the generated sludge o f the plants will be re-used as a fertilizer.

At present trunk lines are being laid inthe two drainage zones especially where wastewater is flowing in
open streams. The land for the Emergency treatment plant (75 ha in area) has been acquired and the
construction of the first phase works has commenced.          A full EA was not performed prior to the
construction of the Emergency wastewater treatment plant. Consequently and as part o f the EA study o f
the proposed Shiraz Water and Sanitation Project, a post review was undertaken with respect to the
sitting, engineering design, technical and environmental performance as well as any potentialrisks related
to the operation o f the WWTP. Under the proposed project, the following wastewater works will be
executed:


               Construction o f 95 km o f concrete trunk mains in the emergency and long-term areas.
               Diameters range between 500- 1200;

               Construction o f 740 km o f PE laterals and interceptors. Works under this sub-component
               will cover an area o f 5496 ha;

               Construction o f 50,000 additional house connections;

               Construction o f two modules with a total capacity o f 100,000 m3/d in the long-term zone.
               To optimize the efficiency o f the treatment plant, each module i s designed to be capable o f
               operation in four independent streams. However, as this treatment plant i s proposed to be
               builtunder DBO contract. Its designwill be finalized duringthe tendering process;

               Construction of 20 km outfalls to discharge treated effluent for emergency plant and long-
               term treatment plants as well as sludge storage site.

D.       ProjectEnvironmentAssessment

The proposed project has been reviewed, environmentally screened and classified as Category A
consistent with the provision of Operational Policy OP 4.0 1 "Environmental Assessment". Preparation o f
the project was comprehensive, encompassing an assessment o f issues concerning environment, cultural
heritage and land acquisition. For each city, an environmental assessment (EA) including a detailed
archeological assessment, a resettlement action plan and a social assessment were prepared by local
consulting firms withthe assistance o f International firms.

The environmental assessment reports including environmental management plans (EMP) were prepared
for the two cities incompliance with the requirements o f the Govemment of the Islamic Republic o f Iran
as well as the Procedures o f the World Bank, including Operational Policy OP 4.01 "Environmental
Assessment" and Operational Policy Note OPN 11.03 "Cultural Property". The reports covered three
major areas:

               Project description, legal andregulatory framework, and baseline conditions;

               Analysis o fimpacts and design altematives; and



                                                159

              Environmental Management Plan.

The EA reports have been reviewed and commented on by the Bank at various stages of preparation.
Prior to appraisal, the reports will be made available at the Info Shop and a number o f locations in Iran
including: Department of Environment, Ministry of Energy, and WWCs. The Executive Summary has
beenprepared inbothEnglishandFarsi and will be distributedto the ExecutiveDirectors ofthe Bank.

The preparation process for the Environmental Assessment included public consultations, which were
carried out at various stages. The consultations involved line ministries, city authorities, provincial
Departments of Environment, operating water and wastewater companies, local communities, NGOs and
the public. This process was complemented by additional consultations undertaken inpreparation o f the
RAP and SA. The EA executive summaries in English and Farsi, were distributed to all concerned
stakeholders. Public hearings were held in Ahwaz and Shiraz on October 28th, 2003 and January 4th,
2004, respectively and were attended by a large number of people including representatives o f most
ministries, Ahwaz Governor, Ahwaz MP, local communities, NGOs, contractors, consultants, university
professors and medias. The public did not have any restriction on the implementation o f the project; on
the contrary all presents welcomed the project, requested its initiation the soonest possible and asked for
additional activities to solve pollutionproblems.

E.      Summary ofMainEnvironmentIssues

The EA assessment indicatedthat the execution of the project will have positive environmentalimpacts in
terms of reducing pollution o f natural resources, will generate significant economical, social and public
health benefits, and will enable the government to enforce existing environmental regulations and
standards.

The project will extend andrehabilitate water networks to ensure 100%water supply coverage, to provide
good quality water on a continuous basis, to cater for population growth and to reduce unaccounted for
water. Thus the project will provide controlled water supply to the households and will reduce overdraft
of the aquifer. It will improve health conditions of the population by providing them with adequate water
quantity and quality from sustainable sources.

The provision of wastewater collection and treatment facilities will have a strong positive effect on the
overall environment and the public health conditions in both cities. There will be improvement o f the
water quality inthe streams andrivers that flow throughout the cities. A major benefit o f the project i s the
protection o f groundwater resources from contamination by untreated sewage. As a result, economic
benefits will occur in terms o f increased water volume o f good quality, increased tourism activities
especially inShiraz, and lower medical costs associatedwith treatingwater-borne diseases. There will be
considerable benefits to the farmers who are presently usingpollutedwater or raw wastewater

The wastewater treatment facilities will also provide an opportunity to better control industrial discharges
through pretreatment and connection to the collection system as stipulated inthe Iranian law. Finally it i s
worth noting that the design o f the treatment plants has taken into consideration the use of their by-
products (treated effluent and generatedsludge) with the aim o fprotectingthe environment and the scarce
water resources. This will generate significant economic, social and health benefits and will enable the
Government to enforce the law that prohibits the use o fraw wastewater for irrigation.

A summary ofmajor potentialenvironmental issues is given inthe following sections.




                                                160

Supply of Adequate Water Quantity and Quality:

Water quantity and quality should meet water demand as well as allowable drinking water standards set
by the Iranian Government and WHO. Among the parameters of concern are the bacteriological
contamination of the water, the concentration level of nitrate, the presence of nitrite and the concentration
o f heavy metals.

Ahwuz: Projected water demandfor the year 2027 i s 6.4 m3/s, which represents only 3% o f the minimum
Karoon flow reportedover the last 30 years and 0.9% of the mean annual flow of the river. Furthermore,
and in order to ensure adequate water supply, treatment plants have been designed to meet maximum
daily demand and storagereservoirs have been providedto supply 50% ofthe peak daily consumption. In
addition, the rehabilitation of the water distributionnetwork and the routine operation andmaintenance of
the system including the control of illegal connections will reduce the unaccounted for water to
acceptable limits.

The proposed advanced water treatment process can ensure good quality water that would meet national
standards and WHO drinking water standards. This process will ensure the elimination o f bacteriological
contamination, as well as the removal o f taste, odor, turbidity, and solids. Based on the quality o f raw
water (Ref. Table 1) and the proposed treatment processes, treated water will meet drinkmg water
standards. Duringproject implementation, a continuous monitoring program would be implemented to
ensure that drinlung water i s in compliance with the required standards. The monitoring program will
cover biological andphysicalparameters as well as heavy metals andpesticides residues.

Shiruz: Geological and hydro geological studies, geophysical logging, test pumping and water quality
analyses were undertaken to assess the water quantity and quality of the underground water. Based on
these studies, the safe yield of the ground water was found to be about 1,556,000 cudd, which i s by far
above the projectedmaximumwater demand (664,363 cudd) for the year 2027.

The water balance for the study area during the first phase was prepared on the basis o f the population
figures (1,240,592 for the year 2003 and 1,360,895 for the year 2007), the maximum water demand
(403,644 c u d d and 452,858 c u d d for the years 2003 and 2007 respectively) and the yield of wells and
the treatment plant capacity at Douroudzam dam (Table 2). The water balance indicates that the total
water resources will by far exceedthe water demand o f the project area duringthe first phase.

Water quality analyses o f surface and ground water are summarized in Table 3. The analyses indicate
that the water quality i s chemically acceptable. The concentrations of all chemical parameters are below
the maximum allowable standards set by the Iranian Government, WHO and CEE. Bacteriological
analyses of well water could not be obtained, however available analysis of water quality in existing
storage reservoirs indicates the absence o f bacteriological contamination and confirm the efficiency o f the
chlorination system. The provision o f a wastewater network for collecting and diverting the generated
wastewater to a treatment plant will certainly eliminate potential bacteriological contamination o f ground
water. Inaddition, the proposed project will finance the regular monitoring o f water quality.

Quality of Treated Effluent
The treated effluent should be o f acceptable quality so that it canbe safely discharged into water bodies or
re-used for irrigation. This means that the effluent quality should meet the standards for discharge into
water bodies and the WHO guidelines for agriculture re-use. One o f the major parameter of concern i s
the level o f nematodes eggs, which should be less than 1 egg per liter for water used in irrigation. The
other major concern i s the concentration level o f nutrients such as ammonia, nitrate and phosphate which
could result in algal growth inthe receiving water bodies. The level o f heavy metals i s also o f concern



                                                 161

and could have adverse impacts on agnculture and water bodies. Regular monitoring o f these variables
will be requiredto ensure strict adherence to the prevailing standards.

Existing and proposed treatment plants, in both cities, are based on the activated sludge process plus
chlorination. In addition, the existing and proposed wastewater treatments in Ahwaz are provided with a
nitrification-denitrification process. Activated sludge can ensure a treated effluent o f acceptable quality
for discharge in receiving water bodies and/or re-use in agnculture. This process will result in the
removal o f nematodes to less than one percent o f the concentration in the raw wastewater entering the
treatment plant. Therefore the presence o f nematodes in the treated effluent will be directly related to
their concentration inthe raw wastewater. Analyses conducted on raw wastewater (ref. Table-4) indicated
the presence o f nematodes but at very low levels. As soon as the wastewater treatment plants start
operating, monitoring o f nematodes in the influent and effluent will be conducted. An allocation for the
installation o f filters for the removal o f nematodes has been made in case the treated effluent does not
meet the required standards with respect to nematodes.

Ahwaz: The discharge o f treated effluent from Chouneibeh wastewater treatment plant into Karoon
River occurs mostly inwinter. Duringthat period, the treated effluent will not be chlorinated in order to
avoid the formation o f halogenated compounds (trihalomethanes) in the river. Moreover, the existing
outfall from the treatment plant, discharges treated effluent at the bank o f the river. An extension o f the
outfall to the inside o f the river, in order to ensure proper mixing, will be implemented as part o f the
project. By the year 2027, the treatment plant capacity will be 2.36 m3/s, which represents 1.18 % and
0.34% o f the minimumand mean annual flow o f Karoon, respectively. Analyses o f water quality before
and after discharge o f treated effluent indicated that water quality inKaroon would not be affected by the
discharge o f treated effluent. On the contrary, several parameters in the treated effluent are at lower
concentrations than those o f the river. The only parameter that could slightly affect the water quality of
Karoon i s the electrical conductivity o f the treated effluent, which i s relatively high and i s related to the
high value present in the raw sewage as a result of ground water infiltration into the sewage. The
implementation o f the collection network will certainly limit ground water infiltration and i s expected to
result in decreasing electrical conductivity in both raw wastewater and treated effluent.            During the
operation phase, continuous monitoring o f raw wastewater, treated effluent as well as water quality o f
Karoon River before and after the discharge point will be undertaken. Under emergency conditions and in
case the treated effluent does not meet the standards for discharge, the effluent will be re-routed and
discharged in the sludge lagoons that will be constructed at 6.5 km from the treatment plant site. An
emergency pipeline connection has been provided from the discharge outlet to the station that pumps the
sludge to the lagoons.

Treated effluent from the proposed eastern treatment plant will be discharged in a concrete channel that
runs for a distance o f 5 km after which it will flow in Maleh Stream that discharges in Shadegan wetland
which i s located at a distance o f 80 km. The channel runs along agricultural areas and has adequate
capacity to accommodate the generated effluent by the year 2027. At present, the channel receives most
raw wastewater but once the project is operational, the channel will only receive the treated wastewater
which can be re-used for agncultural purposes. The implementation o f the project will have no negative
impact neither on the quantity o f water discharged to the wetland nor on the water quality o f the wetland.
Indeed water discharged from Maleh (run-off plus treated wastewater) represents only 5% o f the total
water discharged to the wetland. Under no project, raw wastewater i s discharged to Maleh and i s used for
irrigation during the summer while under the proposed project, treated wastewater i s discharged and/or i s
used for irrigation. Interms o f quantity, almost the same quantity will be used for irrigation and will not
reach the wetland in summer. However when water is not used for irrigation, less pollution loads will be
discharged to the wetland.




                                                  162

Shiraz: treated effluent from both treatment plants will be discharged into concrete channels that run
along agricultural areas and ultimately discharge into Maharloo Lake which covers an area o f around 200
hectares with an average water depth o f 40 cm. The lake water i s brackish with high levels o f salts
(average NaCl 188 g/l) and metals including iron, cadmium and lead. Hence, the lake water will not be
affected by the discharge o f treated effluent. The discharge o f the final treated effluent to Maharloo Lake
will occur mostly in the winter season, since in the summer the effluent will be used for irrigation. In
view o f the treated effluent quality, which will be in compliance with the prevailing standards for
discharge to water bodies, and the dilution effects o f the rainy season, no adverse impacts are envisaged
on the lake. Infact, the environmental state o f the lake i s expected to improve in comparison to the base
condition due to improved water quality o f the discharging rivers. Moreover, the implementation o f the
project will not cause any changes in the salt balance o f the lake since the wastewater flows represent a
very small fraction (around 1%)o fthe total flows that enter the lake throughrainfall and drainage.

Sludge Quality
Generated sludge from wastewater treatment plants, inAhwaz and Shiraz, will be usedby farmers as soil
conditioner or fertilizer. In such case, the sludge quality will have to comply with the FAO, EU and
WHO guidelines for the use o f sludge in agriculture including the limit o f less than one intestinal
nematode egg per 100 gm o f dry solids and the limits on the concentration o f heavy metals. The adopted
treatment processes, the one year storage period, and the control o f industrial discharges to the sewage
system would ensure that the WHO nematode standard and EUand FA0 guidelines on the level o f toxic
substances would not be exceeded. The use o f sludge will be restricted to cereals and in case o f non-
compliancewith the required standards; the sludge will be disposed inthe existing landfills.

Moreover, national guidelines for sludge re-use would be developed in coordination with line ministries
(Ministry of Energy, Department of Environment, Ministry o f Agnculture Jihad, Ministry o f health and
Medical Education, etc.) and concerned stakeholders. These guidelines would set out good standards o f
practice and monitoring and define roles and responsibilities. Training workshops on re-use o f treated
sludge will be also provided to all concemed stakeholders.

SolidWastes
Generated solid wastes from water and wastewater treatment plants, screenings and gnt from the inlet
works as well as dned sludge from water treatment plants will be collected and disposed by the WWCs in
the existing landfill sites which are located outside the cities. Considering, the quality o f raw surface
water and the water treatment processes, the level o f toxic substances inthe sludge generated from water
treatment plants can not exceed the EU limits with respect to the concentration o f heavy metals.
Nevertheless and as an extra precaution, WWCs will ensure that dried sludge will not be mixedwith other
types o f waste but will be located in a specific cell and signs will be posted notifying o f the special waste
contaminations.

Dischargeof Industrial Effluents
In Ahwaz, around 57 industrial facilities are located within the project area o f which 11 are o f
significance with respect to their impacts on wastewater quality and quantity. Similarly, a number o f
medium and small industries are located within Shiraz project area, however only 5 industries are o f
significance. Although some facilities have already installed pretreatment units, several industries
discharge their effluent without any treatment. The discharge of untreated industrial effluents can affect
the performance o fthe wastewater .treatment plants, resulting ina lower quality treated effluent.

The project will only provide connections to industries that do not discharge toxics, which may affect the
performance of the wastewater treatment plants. The discharge o f industrial effluents will be subject to




                                                 163

the approval of both the Director of the treatment plant and the director of the DOE. The project will
ensure that the industrial effluent discharges are pretreated to levels which comply with the World Bank
Environmental Guidelinesmentioned inthe "Pollution Prevention and Abatement Handbook", talung into
consideration the achievable reductions at the treatment plants for all important parameters o f concern.

The DOE has promulgated standards for industrial discharges to surface water. Moreover under the
World Bank funded sewage project for Tehran, standards for industrial effluent discharge into sewage
systems are being developed in close coordination with DOE and other concemed line ministries. The
standards include the following industrial sectors: food, textiles, tanneries, pulp and paper, metal,
pharmaceutical and electronic industries as well as general standards for the remaining industrial sector.
The project will ensure compliance with these standards, when applicable and the promulgation of a
national law for the discharge of industrial effluents to sewage networks. For those industries for which
their industrial water will not be pre-treated, and/or will not be connected to the network, DOEregional
branch will require that each polluting industrial establishments will prepare a compliance action plan
(CAP) which will address the major pollutants, the type of pre-treatment required and the investments,
and monitoring costs for the pre-treatment facility. Operational permits for those industries will be
subject to the implementation of the CAP as yearly monitoredby the WWCs and enforced by the DOE.
The project EMP will include the preparation o f CAPSfor the 11most important industrial facilities in
Ahwaz and the 5 significant industries inShiraz.

Archeological and Historical Sites

Shiraz has many recorded archeological and historical sites.         The implementation of the water and
sanitation project will not require the demolition of any known historical sites, nor will it directly affect
any known archeological sites. Onthe contrary, the project will have a positive environmental impact, as
itwill eliminate the uncontrolledflows anddischargesofwastewater adjacentto historical sites.

The sitting of all the project works was selected in close coordination with the Cultural Heritage
Organization following several site visits so as to ensure that these facilities are remotely located from the
archeological and historical sites as well as from areas where there i s potential o f finding archeological
remains. Duringfinal designs, further site inspections will be conducted by surveyors and archeologist to
check the construction drawings in the field. Construction activities that are close to existing
archeological or historical sites will be identified, and special protection and constructionprocedures will
be developed to mitigate any potential impact on these sites. Moreover, chance find procedures were
developed and will be used by the WWC, Cultural Heritage Organization, contractors and supervision
engineers in case unanticipated archeological materials are encountered during the course of the
constructionactivities.

Duringconstruction, there are potential indirect impacts on existing archeological sites due to vibration
from drilling and compacting equipment; loss of amenity due to dust, noise and visual intrusion. Good
construction practices, including special procedures to be adopted in areas in close proximity to
archeological sites would mitigate most impacts to acceptablelevels.

The long-term permanent impact o f the project on the existing archeological sites will therefore be
positive due to proper collection o f wastewater, reduced incidence of flooding, improved amenity and
aesthetic quality of the city, which would outweigh any temporary adverseimpacts.

Other Issues
The general disruption during construction will be mitigated by coordinated planning o f construction
activities. This will include coordination with all concerned authorities prior to the start o f the
construction activities. Other adverse construction activities will be mitigated through the adoption of



                                                  164

Good Practice Environmental Procedures. Odors from the wastewater treatment plants will be minimized
by careful planning and implementation of the plant operation and maintenance. Regular odor emission
monitoring from the wastewater treatment plants will be implementedto mitigate any non-compliance by
taking appropriate operating measures.

Impacts arising from the potential occurrence o f earthquake will be mitigated through (i)following
Iranian and International seismic design requirements as well as (ii)developing and implementing
emergency preparedness plans which would cover activities to be implemented before, during and after
earthquake occurrence.

F.      EnvironmentalManagementPlan(EMP)

MitigationMeasures
Mitigation measures have been identified to ensure that the defined objectives o f the project are achieved
whilst preventing and reducing any adverse environmental impacts. The mitigation measures are to be
executed by the construction contractor (construction phase) and the operators o f the facilities (operation
phase) with supervision by the WWCs. Inaddition, the following measures will be implemented:

The final design process will detail and finalize construction drawings and tender documents of the
project components.      This process has incorporated final review o f the designs by environmental
specialists to ensure that all required environmental issues are properly addressed and tender documents
include specific provisions concerning environment, health, safety as well as the use o f archeological
chance find procedures in the event that unknown archeological andor historical sites are encountered
during the course o f construction. Moreover, the Bank will review all construction contracts to ensure
that the required mitigation measures have been incorporated inthe biddingdocuments.

Pre-tender conferences will be held to brief pre-qualified contractors on the effective implementation o f
mitigation measures. All pre-qualified contractors will be called to a pre-tender conference at which
environmental, health and safety issues will be outlined. Cultural heritage issues in Shiraz will be also
addressed. The contractors will be briefed on: (i)     chance find procedures, (ii) procedures to be
                                                                                    special
adopted inthe vicinity o f sites defined as requiringprotection, (iii)penalties for non-compliance, and (iv)
coordinationwith concerned authorities.

Liaison arrangements will be established between the public, contractors, and the Project Management
Unit. A procedure will be established to allow the general public to lodge complaints at the Project
Management Unitabout excessive disturbance.

MonitoringPlan
Monitoringo f construction activities will have to ensure that mitigation measures o f construction impacts
are being implemented properly, while monitoring o f operation is to ensure that no unforeseen negative
impacts are arising. Proposed monitoring requirements during the construction and operational phases
have been identified and included parameters to be monitored, location, frequency as well as responsible
agency.

Duringconstruction, the monitoring programwill include dust andnoise. Monitoringo fthe water supply
will includebiological, physical and chemical parameters as well as heavy metals andpesticides residues.
Duringthe operation o f the wastewater system, monitoring will include data on BOD, COD, suspended
solids, phosphates, nitrates, salinity, heavy metals, fecal coliform andnematodes eggs. The treated sludge
will be monitored for nematodes, Coliforms and toxic metals. Soil and agncultural products will be
monitored for significantpollutants includingheavy metals, Coliforms and nematodes.



                                                 165

The WWCs will develop and supervise the implementation o f monitoring programs for raw water, treated
water, surface water, raw wastewater, treated effluent and sludge and industrial discharges to the sewage.
WWCs will also provide advisory services to industries.

The regional DOESwill establish formal programs for monitoring and controlling discharges to the
environment from wastewater treatment plants and industries, treated sludge, surface water, and soil
including actions to be taken in case o f non-compliance. DOE will also develop a system for the
enforcement o f standards related to industrial discharges. Activities to be implemented by DOE will be
conducted in close coordination with the World Bank funded Environmental Management Support
Project.

The Ministry o f Health and Medical Education will establish a program for monitoring drinlung water
quality and the occurrence o f water-borne diseases. A public hygene education campaign will be also
conducted by the Ministryincluding videotapes, TV programs and distribution of leaflets.

The Ministry of Amculture Jihad will establish and implement formal programs for monitoring the
quality o f soil and agricultural products on a pilot area including actions to be taken in case o f
deterioration in quality. The Ministrywill develop education programs and awareness campaigns on best
agricultural and irrigationpractices.

'Ifsignificant adverse impacts are identified by the concerned organizations, appropriate mitigation
measures will be taken and arrangements for amendments o f the EMP will be made. The Ministry o f
Energy will have the overall responsibility to ensure that adverse impacts are maintained to acceptable
levels and corrective actions are taken when required.

A project monitoring report will be prepared on the effectiveness o f the EMP once every 6 months and
willbe sent to the WorldBank after review and approval o fDOE.

InstitutionalStrengthening
The institutional arrangement and capacities o f the organizations in-charge with the implementation and

              when usingtreated effluent and sludge. A public hygiene education campaign will be also
              conducted bythe Ministry of Education.

An assessment of analytical capacities of the laboratories at the two existing water treatment plants in
Ahwaz, at Chouneibah existing western wastewater treatment plant and at Emergency wastewater
treatment plant which i s under construction has been conducted; additional requiredequipments were also
identified and will be supplied as part of the proposed project. For the proposed Eastem Wastewater
Treatment Plant and Long-Term Zone wastewater treatment plant, fully equipped laboratories will be
provided as part o fthe construction contracts.

Technical assistance will be provided to the DOE to set up baseline data on existing environmental
conditions and to develop a quality assurance and a quality monitoring program as well as an enforcement
programfor industrialdischarges. These activities will be implementedinclose coordination with the on-
going World Bank Environmental Management Support Project. Similarly, technical assistance will be
provided to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education to set up baseline data on the occurrence of
water bomdiseases andto develop a monitoringprogram for their occurrence.

Cost Estimate
The cost of the Environmental Management Plan during construction (mitigation measures including
additional treatment and monitoring) will be bome mostly by the contractor (construction phase) and the
Supervision Engineer who will make the necessary provision as part of their contracts. During the
operation phase, mitigation measures and monitoring activities will be implemented by the operator of
each facility. A total amount o f 4.9 million dollars will be allocated for the implementation o f the
environmental management plan as detailed inTable 5 and will be included inthe project cost. It should
be notedthat the total cost does not include:

              Cost of additionaltreatment incorporatedinthe design o f the project;

              Cost o f mitigating negative construction impacts (included in the construction contract
              cost);




                                               167

Cost o f mitigation measures and environmental monitoring o f the eastem wastewater
treatment in Ahwaz and the long-term wastewater treatment plant in Shiraz (included inthe
constructionand operation and maintenance contract cost);

Cost o f setting up a new laboratory at Ahwaz eastern wastewater treatment plant and Shiraz
long-term wastewater treatment plant (included in construction cost);Cost o f Environment
and Safety Officer at eachTSU (included inTSUs cost).

A. Introduction

Since Iran geographically lies in a semi-dry region, water shortage always has been a major problem.
Rapid populationgrowth at least until 1996 coupled with massive urbanpopulation growth and expansion
have exaggerated the problem. An irrational pattern o f water consumption complicates the situation thus
projects to promote water conservation and reuse are important. Most Iranian cities lack a sewerage
system. Untreated wastewater usually ends up in agricultural land outside cities, causing health risks and
environmental hazard to natural habitats, such as Anzali lagoons. Water and Wastewater program, which
began inTehran, i s expected to cover six cities (Shiraz, Ahwaz, Sari, Babol, Rasht and Anzali)., o f which
the first project covers Ahwaz and Shiraz.

B.ProjectDescription

The present report concerns the land acquisition and compensation required for WW projects o f six cities
mentioned above. The proposed WW projects for six cities intend to enhance environmental and health
conditions in the above mentioned cities. Moreover the project development objectives also include: 1)
To improve the quality o f life and alleviate poverty in the proposed six cities in Iran, 2) Increasing
coverage o f sanitation services, 3) Implementing a pilot program o f hygiene and sanitation practices to
improve health conditions o f targetedpopulation, 4) Promotingreuse o f treated effluent.

The first two cities will be financed by the Bank (Shiraz & Ahwaz) as a stand-alone project. The
remainder will be financed as one or more "repeater projects". Since all cities share common sub-project
characteristics, this policy framework will apply to all six cities. However individual city land acquisition
plans will be presented to the Bank as individual "Resettlement Action Plans" under the present policy
framework.

PrinciplesandObjectives GoverningResettlement

Rationalefor expropriationof land

Land acquisition i s necessary inthis project in order to provide for 1) water treatment plants, 2) pumping
stations and 3) channels and pipes to carry the outfall to its destination.                These requirements are
determined by the engineering designs in each particular case, and result from a) the size o f the

'The   IranAHWAZ AND SHIRAZ WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION PROJECTis the first ina program o f
repeater projects that will involve land expropriationfor works (treatment plants, pumpingstations and sewerage
lines). Because the exact expropriation requirements for future sites are not known, but follow the same general
pattern, a Resettlement Policy Framework has beenprepared, together with Resettlement Action Plans for the two
sites. However most pre-feasibility work has been done, and it is possible to be fairly certain that the land
acquisition would entail n o impact on residences or economic activities and only the asset value o fundeveloped land
i s concerned. Therefore, the resettlement instrumentsprepared by the client have been entitled respectively Land
Acquisition and CompensationPolicyFrameworkandAbbreviatedLand Acquisition and CompensationPlan
for each city concerned. This makes the purpose o f the instruments clear to the client. However, the instruments
respond fully to the Bank's policyrequirements inthe context o f this project

population to be served and the volume o f water to be treated; and b) the topography o f the land, which
normally requires wastewater treatment plants to be situated in the lowest lying convenient area in order
for maximum use o f gravity. None of the public Water and Wastewater Companies (WWCs) owns
sufficient land appropriately located that would allow the project to be undertaken without expropriation.

Minimizationof expropriationof land

The expropriation o f private land i s minimized in accordance with Iranian law2, which requires public
utility projects o f any nature to make maximum use o f public land, and only to resort to expropriation
when there is no alternative. Minimal expropriation of private land also serves the interest o f the public
water and waste water companies which are obliged to pay compensation awarded by independent
assessment as explained below. Preference i s always given to transfer o f government or public land from
other agencies where this is available, but even inthis case compensation i s payable.

Engineers in public WWW projects take great care to avoid disturbing existing structures, especially
residences, urban facilities, areas o f cultural, religious or cultural heritage value, parks or other areas o f
public value.

Legalprocessis obligatory

All expropriations must be carried out according to the provisions o f Iranian law3.              The law o f
expropriation defines the procedures to be followed and protects the rights o f all parties involved.
Wrongs committed during expropriation may be redressed by the courts with provision for payment o f
damages and punishment of offenders. The law under which WWCs are established gives the WWC the
power to expropriate land (Article 14). The company must also obtain from the Article 5 Commission4
agreement to any necessary changes inland use inaccordance with the city master plan.

Compensationand eligibilityprinciples

Whenever expropriation o f private land i s unavoidable, Iranian law clearly indicates that land should be
expropriated through full compensation at market value, independently determined, with advance public
notice, negotiation and right o f appeal. hghts to compensation extend to owners, tenants, workers, or any
person who can demonstrate any interest lost as a result o f expropriation.

D. Descriptionof Procedure for Preparingand Approving Land Acquisition Plans (Resettlement
ActionPlans perOP 4.12)

The expropriating authority i s the relevant WWC serving the city concerned. The following steps apply
inthisprojectwhereby aWWC prepares aLandAcquisition Plan.
         1.       The Third Development Plan established the principle that cities o f a certain size should
                  have WWW treatment facilities in the public interest. The WWC is responsible for
                  establishing the public necessity of constructing the facilities, and drawing up terms o f
                  reference for the consultant engineers.
         2.       Consulting engineers prepare a number o f design scenarios for decision by the WWCs.
                  One o f the criteria for the best scenario is least expropriation impact on private land and

                  least disturbance o f any nature. At this stage land expropriationrequirements are known
                  inbroadoutline.
         3.       Under Article 14 o f the expropriation law, the WWC applies to Minister o f Energy for
                  permission to expropriate. The company justifies the specific need for land acquisition
                  and its urgency. They annex to the letter the full rationale together with sketch maps. No
                  further actions may be taken without the express consent o fthe Minister.
         4.       On review o f the evidence, and on finding the application justified, the Minister gives
                  permission to the company to expropriate with the consent of the owner and to pay
                  agreed compensation.
         5.       The details o f planned expropriation, together with details o f any expropriations for the
                  project that have already been undertaken, are consolidated in a Land Acquisition Plan.
                  The WWC ensures that the LAP conforms to the requirements o f Bank policy. The
                  document i s transmitted to the Bank, which determines whether the plan conforms to
                  Bank requirements for financing.

E. EstimatedPopulationDisplacement

In the present project, no physical displacement of persons, residences, or economic enterprises is
expected and any such instances will be fully detailed.5 There are no informal settlements o f any kind
nor illegal occupants.      Typically only a few persons (normally less than 20) are affected by the
acquisition o f land.6

F.       Eligibility Criteria for Defining Categoriesof DisplacedPersons

1.PrivatelandinIrani s classified as:

         a.       Barren land

                  Development for urban land; and by the Ministry o f Jihad o f Agriculture for agricultural
                   land including pasture, forest, farmland etc.

    compensation

H.MethodsofEvaluatingAssets

Notification of intent to expropriateand identificationof owners. The WWC identifies the owners of
the parcels affected from the LandRegistry. Ifthe registry has no information on the owner, the company
conducts a field survey to identify the owner from local knowledge. Notification i s made through the
local or nationalpress. Thus anyone other thanthe ownerh can present their claims.

Evaluation, negotiations and acceptance of offer. Through repeated visits to the plots, the WWC
identifies the owners and all right holders. They obtain an expert evaluation of the plot and all the rights,
including the price o f the land, and they make an offer to every person concerned. Ifthe offer i s accepted
they sign a preliminary agreement contract and fix a date to go to the land registry for legal transfer o f
title. Some WWCs have decided to create an expropriation committee. The main reason i s to avoid
individual decision-making. The committee i s not ajudicial body and its creationi s not mandatory.

Independent assessment. If the offer i s not accepted, an independent evaluation is made by three
assessors. Assessors are trained, certified and registered with the Ministry o f Justice. But they do not
have anyjudicial status and their assessments may be rejectedby the owners. One i s appointed byWWC,
one by the owner, and the third by consensus between both parties. Each assessor independently visits
the plot concerned and makes a professional evaluation based on local market price at that time. Each
assessor prepares a written evaluation. These evaluations are opened inthe presence o f the owner. These
three assessments form the basis o fnegotiation for a final price agreedby the owner.

Ifthe independentevaluations are widely different, or ifthe owner is not willing to accept the offer, the
WWC legal office or land expropriations committee prepares a report to the managing director explaining
the situation and reporting the owner's demand. The company may settle with the owner for the owner's
proposedprice or may confirm the original offer inwhch case the owner has right o f appeal (see below).




                                                     176

Ifthe owner cannot be found, or if the owner fails to appear, all other parties sign an affidavit, which
states that, the owner was duly notified and invited to appear and failed to do so. This document i s filed as
evidence o f due process. The local Prosecutor (district attorney) i s informed and obtains from the local
court an order for the owner to appear, which i s served by the police. The police report the outcome and if
the owner still fails to appear the court acts on the owner's behalf.

I.OrganizationalProceduresforDeliveryofEntitlements

When agreement i s reached between WWC and the owner, a letter o f agreement is signed.            This letter
sets a date to appear in the Land Registry for transfer o f title. The Company writes to the Land Registry
authorizing its official to sign on the company's behalf. Land registry transfers the title on certification
by the owner that he has received full compensation.

Compensation o f other right holders. Other affectedpersons may be compensated directly by the WWC.
Inthis case they sign a letter to the WWC stating that they have been paid full compensation for their
rights, which the WWC provides to the LandRegistry prior to transfer o f title.

Alternatively, the owner may agree duringnegotiations to compensate all right holders, inwhich case the
owner provides the same evidence to the WWC as a condition of payment o f compensation which
includes reimbursement o fthe owner's payments to right-holders.

Procedure when owner cannot be traced. Ifthe owner has not appeared, the court opens and administers
an account inthe owner's name and administers the transfer o f title.

J. ImplementationProcess

As above, sectionI.

K. GrievanceRedress

Agreement i s reached in the great majority o f cases without recourse to appea,;   for redress o f gnevance.
Grievances and appeals may arise inthe following cases:
Owner not willing to part with land. Since the public interest has been determined, the court acts inplace
o f the owner.

All other cases. Any affected person may appeal to the court for redress. The court has the power to
hear submissions, review the process, and make such provisions as it deems fit. These include ordering
compensation to be paid, halting works, finingthe owners.
Inmost cases, the owner benefits from suchappeals. However, inthe case ofany delay, owners lose since
no provision i s made for inflation.

L. Arrangementsfor FundingCompensation

Compensation is always paidby the WWC. There are two ways that this i s funded.


         (a)      Through budgetary provision in the recurrent budget, where the WWC earns revenue.
                  This i s not normally the case inthis project.

         (b)      Where the need for expropriation has been foreseen in the five-year development plan.
                  This i s the case with most expropriations in this project. Expropriation takes place under

               Article IX of the law of expropriationof Land inthe public interest. A translation o f this
               article already has been submitted to the WB.

M. Mechanisms for Consultations with and Participation of Affected Persons in Planning,
ImplementationandMonitoring

As explained above, (sections H and K), owners and right holders are actively involved in the
negotiationprocess.

N. MonitoringofImplementation

Ineach case, when any type of land acquisition and compensation is involved the following timetable is
prepared. This timetable serves as a monitoring device showing all actions involved, the responsible
agency, expected completion date, the reason(s) for any delay and new expected completion date:

               AHWAZ AND SHIRAZWATER SUPPLY AND SANITATIONPROJECT

 Location. Ahwaz, capital of Khozestan province, is located in the south-west. The province is well
 h o w n as the site o f most of the currently operational oil wells. Its estimated population of 1.1million
 has been affected by major displacements during the Iraq-Iran war, and by a significant drop in socio-
 economic development from 1980 - 1986, since when it has improved slightly. The Karoon River, the
 most important in Iran, divides Ahwaz city into east and west. Unfortunately almost all industrial,
 institutional, urban and rural waste water ends up inthe Karoon, creating huge environmental and health
 problems. Additionally, high seasonalrainfall and poor drainage cause many problems including access
 to educational and other facilities. The Ahwaz Wastewater project thus has a highpriority.

Location. Shiraz, the capital of Fars province, is located in south-center of the country, 895 km from
Tehran. With an estimated population o f 1.5 million, it i s the sixth largest city of Iran. It i s an old,
important and internationally famous city. Persepolis, the most important historic site o f ancient Iran, lies
about 35 kmto the south, and there are anumber o f other historic sites. Therefore the city i s an important
tourist destination.    However despite the fact that population growth rate has decreased nationally,
population growth in Shiraz i s more than twice o f the national average rate, owing to high rate o f in-
migration.

Shiraz i s constructingor plans two Waste Water Treatment Plants (WWTPs) The emergency WWTP near
completion i s located in south-west of the city. The site selected for the Long-Term Zone WWTP, for
which work has not begun, i s located inthe south of Shiraz. Wastewater will be transferred by gravity, so
no pumping stations i s required. Land required for all pipelines in all cases belongs to Shiraz
Municipality. The outfall will use existing channels. Therefore the only land expropriationrequired i s for
the two treatment plants. The expropriating authority i s the Shiraz Water and Wastewater Company
(Shiraz WWC).

Expropriation: EmergencyWaste Water TreatmentPlant. This site covers 75 ha. The landhas long
been in the public sector. Expropriation was a matter o f transferring title from one public organization
into the name o f another the Shiraz WWC. Expropriation has taken place, and the value o f the land
assessed (5000 Rials/mz (about U S $0.60). However, compensation has not been finalized and title has
not yet beentransferred owing to a dispute over which of three public sector organizations has title to how
much and therefore how compensation is to be apportioned. Such disputes are not uncommon given the
history o f land redistribution in Iran. Field visits have confirmed these facts. The land in question is
uninhabitedagncultural land o f low productivity.

(a) In the first phase 25 ha was expropriated from a public sector organization, the Fars Province
    Natural Resources Organization pars NRO) and the construction of emergency WWTP was
    started. A surrounding wall was constructed and construction o f emergency WWTP for the first
    module (covering 300.000 population), i s completed.        However, when the remaining 50 ha was
    expropriated from the same organization, two other claimants, bothinthe public sector, emerged.

(b) Shiraz University claimed that the 50 ha portion, disputing the title with Fars NRO. Overall
    agreementhas been reached, the value o f the land i s assessed, and only payment o f compensation and
    transfer o ftitle remain.

(c) At the same time another organization(Endowment or Vaghf organization) has claimed that a portion
    of the land belongs to them and has presented reliable documentation.              Negotiation with the
    endowment organization also has taken place, and again. Agreement has beenreached onthe value o f
    the landand the price; transfer o ftitle and full compensation i s expected shortly.

Expropriation: Long-TermZone Waste Water Treatment Plant. The site selected for mainWWTP

and paid in full by the company. Shiraz WWC and Emdad have signed a preliminary transfer agreement
and have selected representatives to appear inLandRegistry Office shortly for official transfer of title.

Compensation for cultivation. The land for the main plant i s now saline and uncultivable, although it
had been used in the past for cultivation. An old dispute exists between those farmers and the Emdad
charity concerning cultivation rights. The agreement to transfer land commits the Emdad charity to fully
compensate all agncultural rights (called "root rights" in Iran) at prevailing market rates. Apart from the
above-mentioned agreement, those claims have not proven reliable so far. There i s no resettlement,
relocation or loss o f shelter, loss o f assets or access to assets, loss o f income sources or means o f
livelihood.

Cultural Heritage and pipelines. An agreement between WW Co. and Shiraz Municipality has been
reached on the construction o f pipelines and the permission letter i s received from the Municipality.
Since Shiraz i s a historic city o f great value, the final design o f the project concerning the pipelines was
sent to Cultural Heritage Organization. Following careful review and recommendations, some minor
changes were incorporated inthe design, and CHO has now issued a permit for constructiono fpipelines.

Documentation and verification. All letters o f agreements and required permits are on file and have
been reviewed by a local social scientist. A field visit to check the information on site was made by a
local social scientist and by a Bank social scientist.

Background

1.       Costs to provide water supply and wastewater services for Iran's population have escalated in
recent years. The cheapest water sources such as nearby rivers and aquifers are fully used and more
distant sources are now often necessary to consider. At the same time the costs o f collecting, treating and
disposing o f wastewater have risen. The combination o f tapping ever more distant or deeper water sources
and meeting the country's demand for environmental protection has resulted in growing pressure to raise
tariffs to consumers and to require higher subsidies from local and central government budgets. Inorder
to reduce such pressure for higher tariffs and subsidies it i s necessary to make certain that water and
wastewater companies plan, invest and operate in the most economical fashion possible. The experience
from the well managed water and wastewater companies in Iran and abroad shows that the cheapest way
o f balancing supply and demand i s through demand management programs. Such programs comprise a
series o f policy reforms, investments, operational improvements, and incentives to encourage consumers
to adapt their level o f demand so that each consumed cubic meter i s wisely used and is not wasted. Inso
doing investment and operating costs for wastewater are also reduced since the volume o f wastewater i s
also kept to the minimumnecessary.

Objectives

2.       The objectives o f the demand management program inwater and wastewater companies (WWC)
are to identify and implement the policies and investments that will encourage consumers to reduce losses
and wastage so that their benefits from consuming each cubic meter are at least equal to the costs,
including those to properly manage the resulting wastewater.

Decisionsrelatedto Sector Policy

3.       The single most important reform to encourage consumers to consume economically i s to show
them what each cubic meter o f consumed water costs and to allow them to decide how much water they
wish to consume at that cost. Inorder to enable them to do so it becomes necessary to make a series o f
decisions, both relating to the tariff and subsidy policies inthe sector, and relating to how the water and
wastewater companies will manage demand. The first four decisions require a political support from the
highest level in Iran since they concern tariffs and subsidies, and how WWCs should be managed. These
fundamental decisions are:

               To decide that consumers shouldpay the full costs o ftheir consumed water.

               To decide on a system o f government subsidies to help those classified as poor to pay the
               full costs o ftheir water consumption.

               To provide consumers with a signal how much water they are consuming which means that
               reliable meteringbecomesnecessary.

               To improve the capability o f WWC and to give WWC incentives to accurately meter
               consumption o f each consumer and bill and collect user charges that reflect the volume of
               consumed water.

Decision One: "Each Consumer ShouldPay the FullCosts o f Water Consumed"

4.      In order to make the payment o f tariffs acceptable there must be agreement on how the costs o f
water will be calculated in each system each year in an open and transparent fashion. It i s proposed that
the cost o f water should be calculated usingthe following method:

               The necessary levels o f water consumption and production should be projected over the
               next 15 years into the future;

               All the costs necessary to meet demand should be estimated for eachyear. The costs should
               be expressed in constant prices o f the year for which the calculation i s made and include
               both water supply and wastewater;

               The costs should be expressed as an average cost per cubic meter o f water o f consumption.
               This average cost will be the result o f dividing the sum o f discounted operations and
               maintenance costs and investment costs over the 15 years by the sum o f the discounted
               quantities o f water consumed each year. The discounting i s necessary to make costs that
                occur indifferent years comparable to each other. It i s recommended to use a discount rate
                o f 10%per year.

               The costs o f water and wastewater that each consumer should pay must be adjusted each
               year by multiplyingwith (l+inflation rate) in order to maintain the user charges inconstant
               prices.

DecisionTwo: "The Poor Should Receive Government Subsidies to Help Pay"

        Decision One may result inuser charges that will be highinrelation to the income o f the poor. A
         system o f government subsidies will become necessary to help them pay for the full costs o f
        water supply and wastewater. Such subsidies should be financed by the central government
        budget and not by other consumers in order to give incentives to WWCs to serve wealthy and
        poor consumers equally well. (Experience shows that ifutilities are forced to cross-subsidize poor
         consumers with what they can make wealthy pay over and above cost they tend to provide better
         service to the wealthy and poorer service to the poor.) It i s recommended that a decision be
         adopted what percentage o f consumers that will be eligible to receive government subsidies. It is
         also recommended that a central government decision be adopted how eligible consumers will be
         identified. (One simple way o f identifying eligible consumers is to include only those households
         that consume below a minimummonthly volume o f water, necessary to meet the most important
        needs.) Finally, it is recommended that those households that have been declared as eligible to
        receive subsidies should receive subsidy vouchers that are good for paying for water and
         wastewater services.

DecisionThree: "Each Water Connection Should be Metered"

        The principle should be that the water consumption should be metered at the level o f an
         individual connection ("abonnt").   This i s necessary because consumers without meters have no
         incentiveto save water.

DecisionFour: "WWC ShouldHave Incentives and Ability to Collect Revenue"

7.      Inorder to give WWCs the incentive to collect revenue, based on accurate meter readings, they
should be authorized to bill and collect revenue on the basis o f metered consumption only. Further, they




                                                      192

should be allowed to keep and use the collected revenue freely to pay for the costs o f operations and
maintenance and of investment. This principle o f financial autonomy should be "freedom with
responsibility" and will force WWCs to provide good service (or else consumers will refuse to pay for
tariffs) and efficient service (or else consumers will also refuse to pay because costs become too high).

Decisionsrelatedto the DemandManagement at the WWC Level

8.       Once sector policy has been decided that will give them the incentives and tools to manage
demand the WWCs have a number o f decisions to how to actually make use o f their authority to manage
demand. There are at least six decisions and actions that WWC can make to manage demand starting with
metering:

Decision Five: "Meter Productionand Consumption"

9.       Inorder to get the correct signals where demand is the WWCs must meter productionaccurately
and meter each consumer. No substitute exists for good metering data, starting with each production
point, continuing with strategically placed district meters in the distribution system and ending with
metering the consumption o f each abonnt. Precise meter readings will indicate which are the consumers
and the scope for consumption and the cumulative share o f the number o f abonnts will be as indicated in
the table below (withthe number o f subscribers sorted by descending consumption:

      Table: Cumulative Sharesof Subscribersversus Cumulative Share ofTotalConsumption

     Cumulative Share o fTotal           Cumulative Share o f Total       Comment

                                                                          unaccounted water
     30%                                 80%                               The 30% largest abonnts
                                                                           usually consume two thirds o f
                                                                           total cinsumption
      100%                               100%                            I The smallest abonnCs consume
                                                                           one third o ftotal consumptionI

10.      The table shows that unaccounted water (the difference between total production and the sum o f
all individual consumption meter readings) i s the single largest "subscriber" (although unwelcome).
Unaccounted water is explained by many factors, such as leakage, illegal and unregistered subscribers,
imprecise meters, and mistakes or collusion by WWC personnel worlung with metering, billings and
collections. Common to all these factors i s the fact that consumption is wasteful andthis i s why efforts to
identify and reduce the different sources o f unaccounted water i s the highest priority in demand
management. The priority order o f reducing wastage and marginal consumption i s then first to attack
unaccounted water, then concentrate on the 30% largest subscribers, and finally proceed with medium-
size and smaller consumers.

Decision Six: "Control the Consumption o f Government Subscribers

11.      Government subscribers constitute a common source o fwastage since such clients are often lax in
paying for their water consumption. Failure to pay inturn creates the common misunderstanding that such
clients are not obliged to control wastage. However, wastage can be reduced if government abonnis are
given an incentive to consume economically. The easiest way to provide such an incentive is to provide a
non-fungible item in their government budget earmarked for payment o f water supply and to allow the




                                                      193

government client to receive part o f the cost savings in case their consumption turns out lower than
historical levels.

Decision Seven: "Reduce Both Commercial Losses and Technical Losses"

12.      Unaccounted water comprises both the "commercial" losses that result from missingconnections,
misrepresented consumption levels and errors in the W W C commercial system and "technical" losses
such as leakage in the distribution system, overflowing storage reservoirs, and meter inaccuracies. It i s
difficult to say whether "commercial" or "technical" losses are more significant. What i s certain,
however, i s that experienced operators typically try to first reduce commercial losses before attacking
technical losses. The reason i s that less investment i s necessary to reduce commercial losses although
more management know-how and better information systems are necessary.

Decision Eight: "Educate and Help Subscribers to Reduce On-site Wastage''

13.      It is common to findthat consumers who have become used to heavily subsidized or free water
have adopted wasteful habits in their homes, such as keeping taps open or tolerating lealung appliances
and the like. Such wastage occurs after the meter and will not appear as "unaccounted" water. However, it
offers an opportunity to save water. The strongest incentive for consumers to reduce such wastage i s their
obligation to pay higher tariffs for their water consumption. However, public acceptance o f higher tariffs
and demand management is better if the W W C offers its subscribers free or subsidized help in locating
and fixing leakage in their homes. Simple and cheap repairs can reduce consumption substantially and
earn the collaboration and good will o f consumers. In the end, the best form o f demand management i s
what well-educated consumers themselves undertake to consume at economical levels.

Decision Nine: "Make the Tariff Structure Simple and Understandable"

14.      Tariff structures in Iran are quite complex and not easily understandable for consumers. The
original intent for introducing different consumer categories and progressive tariffs where the average
tariff increases with higher consumption level may have been to shift the tariff burden to those categories
who are intuitively most able to pay such as industry, commerce or large domestic consumers. Experience
proves however that the original intent i s often distorted to the extent that the burden o f paying tariffs i s
shifted to increasingly fewer abonnCs while increasingly more are subsidized through cross-subsidies.
Such unequal sharing o f total costs can easily encourage those abonnCs who are subsidizing the others to
collude with the personnel o f WWC to report and pay less than actual consumption levels. Too high
tariffs can also encourage cross-subsidizers to drill their own wells and stop being clients o f the WWC.
Either way, inefficiency results and the scope for demand management are reduced. It i s better then to
make the tariff structure simple and easily understandable, either by having a simple unit rate per cubic
meter consumed, equal for all consumers or possibly a lifeline tariff. The latter comprises two parts: one
fixed monthly charge for a minimum, life-line amount of water (inthe order o f 5 m3 monthly) and then a
constant unit charge for all consumption above the life-line amount. Such simple tariff structures provides
the strongest incentives for WWC to meter and collect and for consumers not to waste water or use water
that does not produce benefits for them.

Decision Ten: "Educate Politicians, WWC Managers and Staff, and Consumers"

15.      The final decision ina demand management program for the water supply and wastewater sector
inIranwill have to be a wide program o f education to explain the necessity o f demand management and
to show which reforms and investments that can be expected to produce efficient and equitable patterns of
consumption. Such education must be continuous and be conducted indifferent settings in order to reach
the intended beneficiaries with precise messages.

              AHWAZ AND SHIRAZ WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATIONPROJECT


Background

1.      Institutional arrangements in Iran's water and wastewater sector are dnven by the government's
desire to increase decentralization. At the central level policy and control over the sector's investment
budget are vested with the Ministry o f Energy through its Vice-Ministry o f Urban Water and Wastewater
Affairs, the Management & Planning Organization and the Economic Council. The Vice-Ministry is
assisted in carrying out its normative duties through the National Water and Wastewater Engineering
Company (NWWEC).

2.      At the regional level there are Regional Water Boards (RWBs) responsible for capturing and
transmitting raw water that i s then treated and distributed by Provincial or City Water and Wastewater
Companies (WWCs). Inthe case o f Shiraz the water i s also treated by the Regional Water Board and sold
to the Shiraz WWC as bulk supply. Inthe case o f the capital o f Tehran, a separate company, the Tehran
Sewerage Company, was established in 1992 to manage and implement the sewerage investment
programs and operate the sewerage system. It i s unlikely that this separation o f water supply and
wastewater services will be replicatedin any other cities or regions inview o fthe advantages o fplanning,
implementing and operating the two services together.

3.      The state-owned WWCs are able to manage their day-to-day operations with a measure o f
autonomy where Managing Directors can make most decisions on operations and staffing within the
limits o f the centrally authorized staffing levels and with some flexibility to provide extra compensation
to well performing employees. However, the WWCs do not control their own investment programs and,
therefore, have limited scope to improve investment and operating efficiency and the level and quality o f
service. Moreover the WWCs have to follow an organizational model developed by the NWWEC and
cannot select a model that would be more appropriate for their particular situation.

4.      The de jure institutional arrangements are reasonable given the size and diversity o f the country.
However, there is a need for formalizing and sharpening the de facto responsibilities o f the Central
Govemment, the Regional Water Boards and the WWCs. Due to the lack o f financial autonomy o f the
WWCs and o f the RWBs investment efficiency and standards of operations and maintenance have
suffered. What i s required i s to match accountability for providing water supply and wastewater services
with the necessary autonomy, incentives andtools to comply with the duties. Greater clarity inthe rights
to use water resources i s also necessary to allow the WWCs to plan ahead, including contracting with
private operators and to attract private investment financing.

Objectivesof Study

5.      A two-part study is proposed to clarify institutional responsibilitiesand accountabilities inorder
to derive the full benefits from the existing legal framework. The first part o f the study should map the
complex arrangements, authority and responsibilities o f the stakeholders inthe water sector, including but
not limited to:

         - The Economic Council
         -  The Management & Planning Organization




                                                      195

        - The Ministryo fEnergy
        - The Ministryo f HealthandMedical Education
        - The Department ofEnvironment
        - The National Water andWastewater Engineering Company
        - RegionalWater Boards
        - ProvincialWater and Wastewater Companies
        - City Water and Wastewater Companies
        -  Municipalities

6.      The second part of this study should describe in detail the institutional arrangements, tasks and
responsibilities o f all the main components of the organization of WWCs in selected cities and/or
provinces. A clear and transparent organization with effective autonomy for the institutions will form the
basis for efficient operations and will be the main driver for further development and balanced decisions
for preparation and implementationo fnew programs.

SuggestedScopeof Study

The first part of the study should strike a proper balance between description and analysis of the existing
legal framework. The dejure authority under the legislation shouldbe described and analyzed interms o f
de facto decision-malung and quality o f the decisions. One aspect that could explain the quality o f the
decisions i s the amount and quality of data and information on which decisions are made. A second aspect
that helps explain where the de facto decision-making authority i s the funding and recuperation o f
operations and maintenance costs, and of investment costs, respectively. The two key aspects o f
information and fundingcould help explain how water and wastewater projects are identified and selected
among several competingprojects; how and by whom projects are prepared; how they are implemented;
and how they are finally operated and maintained.

Inthis context, the congruencebetween existing legislation andpolicies and adopted decisions shouldbe
examined in order to identify the need for possible amendments to either the existing legislation and/or
the strengthening of the sector regulation. The transparency of decisions and the use ofpublic hearings to
buildpolitical support should be documented, where applicable, and the contents and form of contracts
(such as between Regional Water Boards and WWCs related to the quantities and quality o f raw water
supplies) between the different sector agencies should be exemplified and assessed. In this respect, it is
important to describe how the use of scarce water resources i s optimized, either within a river basin, or
within a confined groundwater aquifer. The legally mandated and actually paidextraction charges of raw
water should be documented.

9.      The secondpart of the study should focus on WWCs that play a key role inproviding the water
and wastewater services of a quality that i s mandated. Under the assumption that water and wastewater
services are best providedby specialized and professional WWCs the study should suggest ways inwhich
the WWCs couldbe provided greater financial and investment autonomy. Inthe beliefthat cashoperating
surpluses offer the most secure source of financial revenue for operations, maintenance and investment
costs the study should propose how WWCs could be given sufficient incentives to manage efficiently in
order to maximize their operating cash flows.

10.     The second part of the study should also identify and evaluate different options for Public-
Private-Partnerships (PPP) that could be considered by individual WWCs inorder to raise the efficiency
and quality of project implementation and particularly operations and maintenance. The legal feasibility
of differentPPP options shouldbe analyzed and confirmed. Analogously, the financial feasibility o f PPP
without relying on government subsidies should be evaluated. Finally, the political support in favor of
PPP should be gauged, both at the level of the central government and at the WWCs. Inthis respect, the




                                                     196

objectives and expectations o f both WWCs and other sector agencies in contracting with private firms
should be clarified. The WWCs are likely to expect that private operators will transfer knowledge and
bring international best practice to the sector. It is also likely that both the WWCs and the Central
Government expect private operators to either bring investment financing or strengthen their operating
cash flows in a way that would facilitate private, non-recourse borrowings in order to accelerate
investments.

ExpectedReports

12.     Three reports are expected. The first would be a short progress report to be written during the
field mission and that should list collected legislation and other relevant documentation. The second draft
report should be produced within two months o f the completion o f the field mission. It should be
submitted to the Ministry o f Energy for their comments on the basis o f which the third and final report
should be produced within one month upon receipt o f the comments from the Ministry of Energy.

Background

1.      The customer o f water supply and wastewater services i s the most important link in the chain to
provide safe water and adequate sanitation. A population that is better educated as to safe hygiene
practice i s able to compensate for the eventual inadequacies o f the public water supply and sanitation
system such is the case when consumers will always boil water before ingesting it. By the same token,
well-educated customers are able to make optimal use o f improved water supply and wastewater systems.
Knowledgeable consumers are also best placed to monitor the quality of services and demand
improvements and put the provider o f water supply and wastewater services under scrutiny and pressure
to correct for any inadequacies that may result. Conversely, when continued unsanitary hygiene practices
could negate many o f the benefits that new investments in a water supply and wastewater project may
bring. For this reason it becomes essential to match the water supply and wastewater project being under
preparation with a customer health education program, first inthe two project cities o f Ahwaz and Shiraz,
and later inother cities as well.

Objectives

2.       The objectives o f the assignment are to design and implement a pilot health education program
for the beneficiaries o f the proposed IranWater Supply and Wastewater Project. The pilot program should
be based on existing or collected information on hygiene practices of the project population and initially
targets those population segments where the incidence o f water and sanitation-related disease i s the
highest.

Scope of Work

3.       The assignment comprises three distinct components:

                A survey to identifypractices o fwater consumptionand o fhygiene practices inthose areas
                and among those population segments where the incidence o f wtiter and sanitation related
                disease i s the highest;

                The design of a customer health education program; and

                The implementation o f the health education program on a pilot basis.

4.       The survey of present water drawing and sanitationpractices should be sufficiently large to be
statistically significant. It should not only map present practices but should also attempt to identify the
historical sources o f health education for those included in the survey. The survey should assess the
population's understanding of the links between better health and the level and quality o f water service
and sanitation. The survey should also attempt to quantify the incidence o f water and sanitation related
disease and the associated burden and cost o f health care. It will be key to map the population's level o f
satisfaction o f on-site sanitation systems and to evaluate the motives and willingness to pay for collective
wastewater collection and treatment system. For the same reason it is important to identify and quantify
the present costs o f on-site sanitation systems, including the collection and disposal of septic tank sludge.




                                                      198

Inorder to optimize the costs ofthe survey and maximize its usefulness it is likely that collaborationwith
a Non Governmental Organization (NGO) or academic institution will provejustified.

5.       The design of the customer health education program should build on the results o f the survey
and be keyed to cost efficiency and sustainability. To this end the design should identify the present
modes and sources o f health education, such as schools, religious institutions, and health care facilities
and build and improve and possibly introduce health education to disseminate and sustain safer and more
hygienic water use and sanitation practices. It i s likely that elementary school cumcula will prove to be
central to disseminate and inculcate better health education. The design phase should include the
preparation o f educational pamphlets or the like, and possibly the use of media such as radio and
television.

6.       The implementation of the health education program on a pilot basis should aim at maximum
cost efficiency and sustainability as well. For this reason it will likely prove o f advantage to conduct the
pilot program through a NGO, through the existing education channels, and in collaboration with
religious institutions. The pilot should include a simple system o f monitoring to permit a subsequent
evaluation of the program's effectiveness. If possible, the pilot program should dovetail with the
implementation o f the Bank-financed water supply and wastewater investment program so as to increase
the motivation o f the target populationto modify its water use and hygiene practices.

Purposeof consultancy

The purpose o f this consultancy i s to assist the Government o f Iran in the development of a National
Strategy and Action Plan for Sanitation and Hygiene'.              The Strategy i s intended to increase the
effectiveness and efficiency o f the investments o f the government and people o f Iran through the
provision an overall policy framework to guide decision-makmg and resource allocation withinthe sector.
The Action Plan will present a realistic programme o f specific, affordable and concrete actions to
implement the Strategy.

The Strategy and Action Plan shall consist of:

               The clear identification o f institutional, financial, technical and capacity issues;

               The development o f altematives to address these issues;

               A range o f analyses o f these alternatives (e.g. SWOT analyses for institutional feasibility,
               sensitivity analyses to test the robustness o f altemative financial approaches, etc.); and

               Recommendations based on these analyses.

Background

About 92% o f the urban population o f Iran is connected to public water supplies. By contrast, only 16%
i s connected to public sanitary sewerage and only part o f the sewage i s treated before disposal The
remarkably high water supply connection rates o f 92% are not matched by connection rates to sanitary
sewerage which only average 16%, creating an environmental hazard. In Teheran, only 15% o f the
population i s connected to a sanitary sewerage system although the bulk o f collected wastewater i s being
treated. The remainder i s discharged untreated and constitutes a major source o f pollution and public
healthrisk. Five major cities lack a sewerage system altogether. Most households use traditional seepage
pits causing a threat to groundwater contamination. In a number o f cities without sanitary sewerage,
households resort to discharging their sewage through the open rainwater drains.

The rural situation i s different, but hardly better. At least one in five rural homes in Iran does not have
access to basic sanitation'.    Research literature in Iran (http://~~~.irvl.net/lRAN32.HTM)                confirms
that the diarrhoeal disease caused by poor water and sanitation contributes to malnutrition, a major public
healthproblem with long-term consequences for health andproductivity.




'"Sanitation" inthis document refers to the physical systems(e.g. sewers, septic tanks, latrines, treatment works)
for the safe management o fhumanexcreta. "Hygiene" refers to the related humanbehaviors that promote health
(e.g. washing hands with soap after defecation and before preparing food, safe handling o fwater inthe home, etc.)
* Surveys and estimates o frural sanitationcoverage between 1994and 1999indicate that between40% and 80% o f
the ruralpopulation have access to improved sanitation. Inreviewing these data, the WHO/UNICEF Joint
Monitoring Programme for Water and Sanitationestimated ruralcoverage at 74%

In this context, the Iranian govemment is undertaking a number o f initiatives to improve water and
sanitation in both rural and urban areas. Inparticular, the Government o f Iran i s planning to invest the
equivalent o f 11 billion U S dollars to improve sanitation and water supply services over the coming six
years. Loans from the World Bank are being sought to finance approximately 10% o f this amount. One
o f the Bank loans being considered will, among other objectives, enable the prioritized extension o f
sewerage services in six towns, with a goal o f improving both health and the quality o f life o f urban
residents. These funds must be used strategically to maximize public health benefits, and the Govemment
o f Iran (GoI) wishes to review and update the institutional, financial, and technical framework for these
and other investments inurban and rural sanitation and hygiene.

Strategy developmentProcess

Sanitation and hygiene involve many stakeholders working in a variety o f institutions. At the ministerial
level, these will include the Ministry o f Energy, the Ministry o f Economic Affairs and Finance, the
Ministry of the Interior, The Ministry of Housing and Urban Development, the Ministryof Health, the
Management and Planning Organization, the Environmental Protection Organization, and the Ministry o f
Education. A similarly broad range o f governmental stakeholders will exist at provincial and community
levels. Other key stakeholders include: international organizations and agencies, including UNICEF,
UNDP, and WHO; the private sector; international and local NGOs; universities and research centers;
Community-Based Organizations, etc.        The strategy must reflect the needs and concerns o f this broad
range o f stakeholders if they are to put its guidance in practice. Accordingly, the strategy will be
developed in a consultative and participatorymanner to ensure the broadest possible ownership.

3.1 Sequence of strategy development

A. Project Inception. Consultants shall prepare, (under appropriate guidance andreview from the Bank
and local authorities and experts,)

      1. an initial outline o f topics and issues for a national sanitation strategy, which highlights the
     questions to be addressed by such a strategy and
     2. a process by which the sanitation strategy may be developed in close coordination with all major
      stakeholders

B. Inaugural Workshop, at which the consultants will present the strategy outline, issues, and process
for review, comment, and debate by various stakeholders. The outline should present leading options to
address the substantive issues.

C. Development of a draft strategy based on the guidance o f the inaugural workshop, field work
throughout Iran, and discussions with sector specialists, community representatives, govemment
authorities, members o f the private sector and other stakeholders. The strategy must address the diversity
o f geographic, environmental, social and cultural conditions in Iran, and may well propose different
approaches in different regons to contribute to the overall goals. Informal review and comment should
be sought on preliminary drafts o f the strategy before the validation workshop. The strategy must address
capacity constraints within the sector, and how they may be reduced.

D.Validation workshopfor the draft strategy. The completeDraft Strategy shouldbe circulatedto the
relevant stakeholders at least two weeks before the workshop. The workshop will review the key issues
ofthe strategy andthe options available to address them.

E. Developmentof a draft actionplan. The purpose o f the action planis to translate the strategy, (as
revised at the validation workshop) into actions, which can increase the effectiveness and efficiency o f

investments in sanitation and hygiene. The action plan may include proposed capital investment plans,
institutional rearrangements, promotional campaigns, and/or policy revisions. The action plan must
include activities to increase sector capacity to address the challenges o f sanitation and hygiene. Informal
review and comment should be sought on a preliminary draft o f the action plan well before the validation
workshop (see below).

F. Finalvalidationworkshop for the Draft Strategy and Action Plan. The complete Draft Strategy
and Action Plan should be circulated to the relevant stakeholders at least two weeks before the workshop.
The workshop should review the final strategy (as revised in light o f the preceding workshop) and the
concrete proposals o f the Action Plan. The workshop should foster debate and discussion, with the clear
purpose o f strengthening the final Draft Strategy and Action Plan.

G. Submission of the Final Draft Strategy and Action Plan, incorporating feedback from the second
workshop.

3.2 Overall approach

The documentation and workshops for the strategy and action plan should highlight:

               The clear identification o f institutional, financial and technical issues;

               The development o f alternatives to address these issues;

               A range of analyses of these alternatives (e.g. SWOT analyses for institutional feasibility,
               sensitivity analyses to test the robustness o falternative financial approaches, etc.); and

               Recommendationsbasedon these analyses.

Draft documents prepared along these lines should provide the basis for discussion and validation at the
three stakeholder workshops outlined above.

It is anticipated that the consultant will use the following methods in developing a draft Strategy and
Action Plan:

Review of existingtechnicalstudies on environmentalhealth and sanitation inIran.
Review of existingpolicies and practiceson sanitation,hygiene, environmental health, and wastewater
management in Iran at national, provincial and municipal levels. Inparticular, are there sanitary surveys
designed to permit the review o f neighborhoods and communities to determine the suitability o f their
sanitation and wastewater management? I s there a "tool" in existence, which would permit a local
government to conduct a survey to classify neighborhoods as to their suitability or unsuitability for on-site
sanitation, and to observe the extent to which on-site sanitation i s failing or not failing? Are their existing
percolationtest standards, and how helpful are these?

Interviews with sector professionals and managers in water and sanitation agencies, provincial and
municipal governments, health departments, and other related ministries and government departments,
such as environment and rural development

Field visits to study the most acute problems, and to learn o f proposed approaches to address these
problemsvisit the proposedtowns visit rural areas/schools as well.




                                                       202

Consultations (both formal and informal) with major stakeholders from a variety o f sectors. These will
include workshops with participation from such sect.ors as health, urban development, rural development,
water resources, etc.

Team composition

Itisproposedthat a five-person team canbestaddressthe needs o fthe task:

         International expert in sanitation and hygiene as team leader, to coordinate the work, and
         bringintemational experienceto bear on the problem.

         International expert on finance and economics, familiar with the costing and financing o f
         sanitation and hygieneprograms, and the financial implications o fpublic policy.

         Local specialist in environmentalhealth, familiar withboththe problems on the ground and the
         ways and means by which policies and practices may be effected inthe GoI.

         Local specialist in urban sanitary engineering, familiar with the planning and implementation
         o f sanitary investments ininfrastructure.

         Local specialist in rural community health, familiar with the status and nature of rural public
         healthpromotion.

It is anticipated that the first three consultants will do the bulk o f the work, with support from the urban
sanitary engineer andrural community health specialist.

             AHWAZ AND SHIRAZWATER SUPPLY AND SANITATIONPROJECT


Background
1.      The ultimate sustainability o f the Ahwaz and Shiraz Water Supply and Sanitation Project i s
contingent on a sequence o f reforms and their effective implementation. First, the appropriate sector
development goals must be clearly formulated and benefit from explicit political support from the highest
level. An example would be the adoption o f the general principle that revenue from consumer tariffs plus
government subsidies in both water supply and sanitation should cover the costs o f operations and
maintenance, and replacement (OMR). Second, the project reforms must be accompanied by the
necessary instruments of implementation such as laws and executive decrees to enable effective
implementation. Third, institutional reforms are required to create the sense o f accountability with service
providers and give them incentives to implement, operate and maintain the project facilities inan efficient
and sustainable fashion. Fourth, the capacity o f the service providers and o f those agencies or units that
monitor and regulate the service providers must be built. Failure to ensure the success o f each link inthe
chain to prepare, implement and operate the project will reduce overall program effectiveness and
sustainability or even cause the project to fail.

2.      At the presenttime only the first linkinthe chain o freformhas been forged. A general agreement
on principles o f sector development resulted from the September 2003 discussions betweenthe Bank and
the Ministry o f Energy. However, the second step to provide the necessary instruments is still largely
pending. Similarly, the third step to reform institutional accountability and incentives can only be taken
once the institutional study has been conducted and its conclusions have been adopted and internalizedby
the relevant Iranian agencies and ministries. Finally, the capacity building has only been identified in
general terms and mustnow be detailed for the two project cities Ahwaz and Shiraz and for the NWWEC.
It is expected that Ahwaz and Shiraz be the precursor for similar capacity buildingprograms inthe four
project WWCs inPhase 2 o f the Bank's sector assistance and subsequently for other WWCs.

Capacity BuildingPriorities
3.      A number o fpriority areaswhere capacity mustbe strengthened havebeen identified(See Annex
13.)The priorities relate to four areas:
        A.       The minimumcriteria for the participation o fWWCs inthe programregarding
                         Governance
                         Financialmanagement
                         Commercial management

                         Efficient operations and administration
                         Environmental healthimpact

        B.       The development and upgradingo f the regulatory capacity o fNWWECregarding
                         Coverage o f service provision

                  0      Quality o f service provision

                         Efficiency o f service provision




                                                     204

         C.        The capacity to analyze the economic costs and benefits o f project investments including
                   butnot limitedto areas such as
                            Demandprojections

                   0        Least-cost analysis

                   0        Economic cost benefit analysis


         D.        The capacity o f individual WWCs to analyze tariffs, costs and subsidies with a view to
                   achieve cash flow equilibrium by a given time horizon with respect to

                   0        Calculation o f economic and financial costs o f service
                            Design o f the average tariff level and structures
                            Design o f level and targeting o f subsidies and manner o f administration
                            Design o f public awareness and consumer educationprograms

ProposedProgramImplementation
4.      The capacity building must begin as early as possible during project implementation and may
actually precede the plannedBoard presentation inthe case o fwater supply and wastewater tariffs (where
a workshop on water supply and sanitation pricing policies with the World Bank Institute (WBI) i s
planned) It i s expected that the WBI will play the leadrole in guidingthe capacity buildingfor which the
NWEECwill be well placed to assume the main responsibility on the client side. To the extent possible
all training materials should be available in Farsi. It i s similarly proposed that training materials be
available over the Internet for reasons o f cost efficiency and individual client convenience. The WBI i s
already the repository o f a number o f training modules that could be updated and adaptedto F a r i g

5.       A special effort will be made to achieve a multiplier effect through implementingthe program by
or with the participation o f training institutions, such as universities and technical institutes. The
incorporation o f selected sections o f the capacity building training materials into the standard curricula
should be encouraged in order to modemize the education o f direct relevance to the sector. The
substantial period o f professional isolation for sector staffjustifies this kind o f broader upgrading o f the
relevance and modes o f academic andpractical training.

Monitoring andEvaluationof the CapacityBuilding program
6.       The entire capacity buildingmust be continuously monitored and evaluated inorder to adapt it to
the specific needs o f the WWCs and the NWWEC. Program implementation should be monitored in
terms o f number o f trainees, volume o f training as measured in trainee days, and costs of individual
events, comprising all relevant costs and the form o f financing. It must also be noted that the capacity
buildingprograms will also benefit the entire sector since training materials will be developed ina format
that permitseasy dissemination.




  The WBI already has training modules inthe following areas that are o fdirect relevance to the Irancapacity
building program: (1) economic cost-benefit analysis;(2) demand forecasting; (3) least cost analysis; (4) elements of
finance; (5) tariffanalysis; (6) procurement o fworks; (7) procurement o fgoods; (8) user o f consultants; (9)planning
for maintenance; (IO) institutional analysis; and (11) reducing unaccounted water;.
