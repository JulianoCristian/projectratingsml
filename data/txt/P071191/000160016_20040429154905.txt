Shiraz Water Supply and Sanitation Project            Environmental Assessment Report
Annex B-IV: Environmental Standards
(According to article 5 of the regulations for the prevention of water pollution)
Introduction and Definitions:
These standards are prepared according to the articles 3 and 5 of the regulations concerning
the prevention of water pollution (1994), in collaboration with the Ministries of Hygiene,
Health and Medical Education, Power (presently Ministry of Energy), Industries, Mines and
Metals, Interior Affairs, and Agriculture Jihad by the Department of Environment.
In this paper of standards, the following definitions and expressions are used:
Surface Water: It refers to the seasonal or permanent waters, natural or artificial lakes, and
ponds.
Absorbing Well: It refers to a hole or ditch that is capable of absorbing water and its bottom is
at least three meters above the ground water table.
Absorbing Trench: It refers to a system of horizontal canals into which sewage is directed in
order to be absorbed into the ground and the distance between its bottom and the Ground
water table is at least three meters.
Bypass: It refers to a canal that leads the sewage from one part to another or to an exit canal
without passing form one part or all the parts of the sewage treatment plant.
The Composite Sample: It refers to a 24-hour sample from the samples that are collected in
intervals of at most 4 hours.
General Considerations:
1. The discharging of the sewage must be done according to the standards that specify the
maximum density of the polluting factors and the observation of the limits set by these
standards must be supervised by the Department of Environment.
2. The authorities of the sources of pollution must purify the produced sewage to the limits
of the safe standards with appropriate and economical technology and by expert
examiners.
3. The act of measuring the density of the polluting materials and the amount of the flow
in the sewers must be carried out immediately after the flow passes the final unit of the
sewage treatment plant and before it is discharged into the environment.
4. The act of measuring for the purpose of comparing the densities with the established
standards before the sewage works must be done by the use of compound samples. In
systems with disconnected disposal, the measuring carried out at the time of disposing is
valid and proper to be examined.
B-15



Shiraz Water Supply and Sanitation Project           Environmental Assessment Report
5. The sludge or the other solid materials produced by the sewage works must be properly
purified before their final disposal and the final disposal of these materials must not cause
any pollution in the environment.
6. The treated effluent must be disposed of in the receiving water gradually and in a way
that the maximum amount of dilution will take place.
7. The exiting sewage must not have a disagreeable odor or contain scum and floating
substances.
8. The color and the turbidity of the effluent must not noticeably change the appearance of
the accepting water and the place of disposal.
9. The methods used for measuring the pollutants will be based on the methods mentioned
in" Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Waste Water.
10. Making use of Septic Tank and Imhoof Tank systems with using absorbing wells and
trenches in the areas that the distance between the bottom of the well or the trench and the
surface of the subterranean waters is less than 3 meters is forbidden.
11. In addition to the necessity of observing the related standards, the effluent must not
affect the quality of the water for the purposes for which it is used.
12. It is not acceptable to dilute the purified sewage to reduce the amount of the polluting
factors to the established standard levels.
13. Making use of methods of vaporizing the sewage is allowed, provided that the
Department of Environment issues the permit.
14. Making use of side passages is forbidden, but those side passages, which are used just
for eliminating the defects of the treatment plant units or are used for mixed collecting of
the city sewage and rainwater can be used.
15. The sewage works must be planned, constructed, and utilized in such a way that, they
contain the required preparations for minimizing the pollution to the least amount during
emergencies such as unfavorable and adverse whether conditions, the disconnection of
electricity, the defects of the mechanical equipment. Those kinds of industrial wastewaters
whose pollution does not exceed the standard limits, can be disposed without treatment,
provided that the Department of Environment grants the permit.
Note 1: The disposal with a density higher than the standards given, will be allowed, provided
that the exiting hogwash does not increase more than 10% the density of
Chloride, Sulfate, and dissolved materials of the accepting source in the
radius of 200 meters.
Note 2: The disposal with a density higher than the standards given, will be allowed, provided
that the density of Chloride, Sulfate, and dissolved materials of the exiting
hogwash does not exceed those of the consumed water by 10%.

Speech of the Client Representative
After presenting a brief status report on the current Shiraz water and wastewater
system conditions, Mr. Hagh Negahdar, Managing Director of SWWC said that the
pros and cons of the proposed plan would be explained in details by the consultants.
He then described the stages of loan application from the World Bank (WB) and
explained each in details. He stressed that a VWB loan would greatly accelerate the
implementation of related plans to resolve the present problems. He concluded that
SWWC could not complete its projects neither in the short nor the middle terms
through the present Government credits alone, and therefore the use of other
financial resources, the most preferable of which is a WB loan, were necessary.
Documentary Film
A 25 minutes documentary film was screened after Mr. Hagh Negahdar's speech. It
showed the present water and wastewater conditions in the City of Shiraz and some of
the on-going works.
The Feasibility studies
The Project's Consulting Engineer and Project Manager for Studies (Mr. Tootoonchi)
began his Power Point presentation with a report on the current conditions of water
supply, the shortages and the problems faced by the sector; saying that Shiraz water is
supplied from the two resources of surface and ground waters. The surface water is
supplied from the treatment plant in the Doroodzan Dam, while the alluvial and
karstic wells comprised the ground water resources. He further stated that the lack of
sufficient number of reservoirs has resulted in water being pumped directly to the
network, creating many problems.

Shiraz Water Supply and Sanitation Project      Environmental Assessment Report
He then described the development of the Water Scheme of Shiraz, which will last for
a period of 25 years, divided to four phases. He estimated the cost of the project
during the first phase (5 years) at 26.5 million USD (present values). The main works
involved in this period consist mostly of upgrading and rehabilitation of the system to
ensure a reliable water supply.
He stated that the proposed plan shall end the direct pumping of water to the network
through the construction of new reservoirs. The plan also proposes the division of the
city into new sub-zones and control of pressure by installing pressure-reducing valves
in each of the subzones. According to the feasibility a total of 71 million USD would
be needed (at present values) to develop the entire project.
He concluded by stating that through development of surface and ground (karstic
wells) resource, water of adequate quantity and quality would be available for 100%
population coverage in the great and ancient city of Shiraz.
During the second part of his presentation, Mr. Tootoonchi described the present
wastewater situation in Shiraz. He stated that Shiraz has currently a population of 1.2
million, and added that so far 25,000 wastewater connections have been provided, and
that the construction of one treatment plant and some of the trunk mains are currently
under way.
Explaining the proposed plan in this sector, he remarked that during the first phase of
implementation all the main trunks will be installed while house connections will be
constructed gradually. He stated that two wastewater treatment plants were proposed
in Shiraz, the first in the Emergency Zone (under construction) and the Second in the
Long-Term Zone. The Emergency WWTP will consist of two modules, the first of
which is under construction and will become operational by year 2004.
The Long-Term WWTP consists of five modules, each of 50,000 m3/day in capacity.
Two of these modules will be constructed during the first phase.
He pointed out that the wastewater project cost estimates amount to 122.12 million
USD (current value) for the first phase and a total of 300 million USD by 2027.
In conclusion he expressed hope that by 2027, all the projected population of
2, 000, 000 of Shiraz would be served by a wastewater collection and treatment system.
The environmental issues
Representing the Environmental Consultants commissioned to prepare the E. A.
report, Dr. Azimi began his presentation by describing the environmental problems of
Shiraz caused by the lack of appropriate systems for water supply and collection and
treatment for wastewater. These problems include the pollution of surface and ground
resources and related health issues, the high level of Unaccounted for Water (UFW),
the declining water quality in wells supplying the city's potable water, and a higher
demand for quality water by the increasing population.
He added that as a positive aspect of the project, the treated effluents constitute a safe
resource for irrigation and the treated sludge can readily be used as soil conditioner in
F-3



Shiraz Water Supply and Sanitation Project       Environmental Assessment Report
agricultural lands. During the non-irrigation seasons, the treated effluent will be
discharged into Maharloo Lake. Currently the Lake's environmental condition is
deteriorating due to inflow of raw-wastewater. However he also stressed the need for
cooperation with the Ministry of Agricultural Jihad to train farmers on the benefits,
proper procedures and the constraints of using the treated effluent and sludge for
irrigation and conditioning the soil.
Referring to the short term environmental impacts of the plan, Dr. Azimi said that the
considerable volume of works involved could create employment for many people
and become a great source of income for the city. Although the construction works
can also lead to problems such as traffic congestions, dust and noise, they are,
however, temporary in nature and can be reduced to an acceptable limit by taking
appropriate measures. He stressed that in addition to mitigating the negative impacts;
the Environment Management Programme would include monitoring and capacity
building to ensure the proper implementation of plans. To this end, the Shiraz WWC
will be strengthened as far as manpower and equipment are concerned, to be able to
provide the necessary technical assistance to other concerned organizations in
carrying out their legal duties.
Dr. Azimi reaffirmed that the mitigating measures would be implemented by the
contractor during the construction phase and by the operator during the operation
phase of the plan. Throughout all phases SWWC will monitor the actions of the
contractors and operators. Moreover the Department of Environment, the Cultural
Heritage Organization and the Ministry of Health and Medical Education will control
and ensure the quality of aforementioned mitigating measures. Dr. Azimi ended by
stating that the Environment Management Programme would cost 1.7 million USD,
and this figure was included in the total costs of the project.
He concluded by saying that the collection, treatment and sanitary discharge of
wastewater will improve the people's health and well being, reduce the level of
pollution particularly in Khoshk River and the Maharloo Lake and ground resources,
andfinally improve the environmental conditions of Shiraz.
Question and Answers:
After the above presentations, participants at the meeting raised a number of questions
which were responded by a panel consisting of Messrs. Sahmeddini and Imami,
respectively the Client's Technical Director and Project Manager for the Treatment
Plant under construction, Dr. Javan Client's PMU  Director, Mr. Tootoonchi,
Managing Director of Iranab, the consultant of the feasibility studies and Dr. Azimi,
the environmental specialist for Lar Consultants. The followings are some of the
important questions raised and the corresponding answers.
1- Q by member of the Water Authority of Fars:
Is it justified to increase the share of surface water in the total water supply, despite
the fact that the surface water is subject to pollution?
A: Water Treatment Plant is designed with the proper capacity to eliminate the
surface water pollution through treatment processes that include disinfection.

2- Q by a Shiraz University professor:
Considering the decreasing quality of ground water resources, have you foreseen
the use of surface water resources as well utilization of new dams as a compensating
measure?
A: the Option to construct new dams, such as Shesh Pir, is currently under study.
However, it would take few years before the construction of the dam could start and
that is only when the study justifies the project.
3- Q by an expert from a local consultant:
Have you considered decentralized - versus centralized - treatment plants in
Shiraz?
A: Yes, but according to our study, due to the landscape of Shiraz and the high cost
of land, utilization of decentralized treatment plants is not suitable.
4- Q by the representative of Shiraz Municipality:
Does the wastewater collection scheme include industrial public sanitary units and
the surface runoffs?
A: Our project does not include surface runoff.  However, it would accept
industrial wastewater provided that it is pretreated to the limit required by the
treatment plant. Meanwhile, the project includes the public sanitary units.
5- Q by representative of the Department of Environment (DOE):
Wouldn't it be more proper to use bottled-water for drinking while our water
distribution is used only for sanitary?
A: Our study shows that this option is not economical. Furthermore, such an
option requires full public cooperation, which should be considered as a long-term
process.
6- Q by representative of the Department of Environment (DOE):
How does the Maharloo Lake fit in the scheme of securing a reliable point of
discharge for treated effluent from the wastewater treatment plant, is it to be a
temporary or a long-term option?
A: The treatment plant has been designed in such a way that the quality of effluent
meets the standards for discharge to surface waters.  Meanwhile, the quality
standards for agricultural reuse have also been considered. Due to the fact that in
certain period of year there is no need for agricultural water, the extra expenses for
treatment process to meet the surface water standards is justified.
7- Q by the Soil & Water Expert from Research Department of Agricultural
Jihad:
In general, enough attention has not been given to use of sludge as fertilizer. How
has this subject been addressed in this study?
A: The sludge is not for use in agricultural products that would be consumed raw.
Likewise, the sludge is not meant to be used for any process of agricultural
F-5



Shiraz Water Supply and Sanitation Project       Environmental Assessment Report
production, which could involve manual work by farmers. In addition, the one-year
storage of sludge has been considered before distribution to farmers.
8- Q by a university student:
Considering the fact that the route of wastewater disposal passes through a number
of structures that are considered as cultural heritages - such as Band-e Amir - and
considering that the resulting damages and losses would not be reparable, what
remedies have been foreseen for this problem?
A: The designer of the collection network has been very careful not to choose any
route that might pass through cultural heritages. Furthermore, we are legally
required to have a representative of Heritage Office present during the excavation
process, and we have to obtain the necessary permits from the local Heritage Office
before any excavation work.
9- Q by the Head of Board of Directors of Shiraz NGOs:
Considering the high economic value of the treated wastewater, why should it be
discharged to Maharloo Lake?
A: As was mentioned in our previous answer, the treated wastewater is going to be
discharged in the Maharloo Lake only when there is no need for agricultural water in
the area.  However, the economic value of the treated wastewater has been
considered in the feasibility report.
10- Comment by a Shiraz University professor and Member of an environmental
NGO:
Discharge of treated wastewater to Maharloo should be more thoroughly and more
exactly studied.
A: In our plan the monitoring of water quality of Maharloo Lake has been
thoroughly studied and the related cost has been calculated for the next 5 years.
11- Comment by Shiraz University professor from the Department of Pest Control:
As the result of wastewater collection, treatment and disposal, the problems of
cockroaches, Aleppo Boil insect and mice in Shiraz would be greatly reduced.
Conclusion:
At the end Public Consultation Meeting, Mr. Hagh Negahdar, the Managing Director
of Shiraz WWC thanked the active participation of all project stakeholders in
preparation of these urgent projects and wished that this support would continue
during the project implementation.
