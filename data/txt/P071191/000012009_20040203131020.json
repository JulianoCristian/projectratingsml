    SANITATION PROJECT", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "This executive summary is aimed at\n            presenting the main findings of the Environmental Assessment\n            conducted for the Iran Water Supply and Sanitation Project.\n            Ahwuz, the capital of Khouzestan province is one of the most\n            important economical centers of Iran, located in an oil-rich\n            region and hosts a number of large industries. Areas without\n            wastewater either use seepage pits, or discharge their\n            wastewater in open channels, rivers or in open grounds,\n            creating wastewater pools, polluting the soil and water\n            resources, and creating health hazards. The Karoun River\n            flows along Ahwaz and divides the city into two separate\n            drainage zones: the eastern zone and the western zone.\n            Therefore, pollution of the Karoun River is a major problem,\n            and a priority issue not only for Ahwaz, but for the whole\n            province, for the poor water quality is largely contributing\n            to high diarrhea prevalence that reaches. Similar to Ahwuz,\n            wastewater collection, treatment and disposal are the main\n            environmental concern in Shiraz. Although the proposed\n            project will reduce the pollution loads discharged to the\n            Karoun River and Maharloo lake, it will not solve the\n            pollution problem of these two water bodies, primarily due\n            to agricultural drainage and industrial discharges. This\n            Environmental Assessment summarizes the policy and legal\n            requirements, as well as Bank safeguard policies. Mitigation\n            measures are as follows. To reduce noise disturbances, work\n            should be restricted to normal working hours; equipment with\n            appropriate silencers should be used, only run when\n            required. Dust suppression measures should be employed, such\n            as spraying and dust enclosures, to minimize air pollution.\n            Movement of construction vehicles should be restricted to,\n            and from the sites during normal working hours; traffic\n            diverted through suitable roads to the expected traffic\n            loading; adequate traffic signals should be in place; and,\n            expeditious completion of backfill, and reinstatement\n            completed. The application of protection measures in areas\n            close to existing historical sites should be ensured.\n            Wastes, demolition and excavated materials should be\n            collected, and disposed of at appropriate locations, while\n            surface runoff from the site should be restricted. Moreover,\n            wastes generated during construction should be minimized, by\n            reusing construction wastes where practicable, and,\n            appropriate methods for the storage of waste materials\n            should be conducted. To mitigate the degradation of water\n            quality, the operation and maintenance of the water\n            treatment plant shall be ensured, as well as the continuous\n            monitoring of raw water, and treated water, including water\n            quality at various locations within the water supply system,\n            avoiding cross contamination with sewage. Adequate treatment\n            (retention time) should be provided to control the number of\n            nematode eggs, in addition, chlorine should be used to\n            disinfect the effluent, and for Ahwaz nitrification and\n            de-nitrification to control concentration of nitrogen.\n            Regular monitoring of treated effluent, which shall not be\n            discharged in the Karoun river, nor re-used in irrigation if\n            its quality does not meet the standards. Capacity building,\n            training and awareness will be supported to comply with\n            environmental standards and guidelines."}, "docdt": "2004-01-30T00:00:00Z"}
