1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
(this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative)

1.1 Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for Bank assistance)

With a GDP of $320 per capita in 1999, Yemen was one of the poorest countries in the world. Despite
significant progress which placed Yemen ahead of the average for comparator countries in several areas,
the country was facing an enormous social challenge with an increasing poverty rate (25% in 1998) and
very poor health indicators. With only 55% of the population having access to medical services, there
were high rates of infant mortality, maternal mortality, and malnutrition among children. These rates were
all much higher in rural areas where about 65% of the population lives.

In education, the situation was similar: major improvement since 1970, but then a slowdown in the 1990s
at still low levels. The rate of adult literacy was 44% overall, and 24% for women. The primary school
Gross Enrolment Rate (GER) was 93% for boys, but only 50% for girls. The rates in rural areas were
much worse, especially for girls: the 1994 census reported only 24% of rural girls attended school.
Quality of schooling was poor: the net primary attendance rate, reflecting a high repeat rate, was only
55%.

The Government of Yemen (GOY) had a high financial commitment to education with a high 8% of GDP
spent on education. The Government and the Bank had agreed on a sector strategy, reflected in the
Yemen Education Sector Assistance Strategy Note (September 1999), which gave highest priority to basic
education and aimed at addressing the main issues in the education sector: (a) low participation rates and
large disparities in access, with girls and rural areas at a disadvantage; (b) poor quality of education at all
levels; (c) a weak Government capacity; and (d) inefficient resource use.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The objective of the Basic Education Enhancement Project (BEEP) was to increase the grade 1-6
enrolment of rural children, especially girls, in basic education of adequate quality. The key performance
indicator was the increase in the GER for girls in grades 1-6, in the four governorates covered by the
project. At the district level, it was expected that enrolments would increase by 30% overall with girls
constituting the majority of the increase. As Yemen did not have the capability yet to assess learning
achievements, increased enrolments and project outputs (teachers trained, availability of teaching/learning
materials) were used as proxies for better quality of education.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The Project Development Objectives were not revised.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
(original and revised, briefly describe the "primary target group" identified in the PAD and as captured
in the PDO, as well as any other individuals and organizations expected to benefit from the project)

The target beneficiaries were children in the grade 1-6 age group in underserved rural areas in four
governorates with low Net Enrolment Rates (NERs) with a specific focus on girls: about 100,000 girls
were expected to gain access to education of acceptable quality. The project was also expected to improve



                                                       1

communication between the Government and beneficiaries (communities) in meeting their educational
needs and increasing community involvement in basic education. In the long term, the project was
expected to benefit the population at large through support to the Government's education reform program.
Improvements in sector management capacity and efficiency at the central level of MOE and a gradually
increasing number of governorates were expected to allow more extensive and equitable access to schools
of better quality.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

Project Component 1 - Expansion of Access (Total est. cost: US$43.6 million)

The objective of the access component was to increase the number of classrooms available for grade 1-6
students, especially for girls, in about 20 focus districts of the four target governorates.

Subcomponent 1.1. School construction, extension, and rehabilitation: This subcomponent provided funds
for: (i) construction and extension of 3- or 6-classroom schools (about 2,100 new classrooms) with toilets
and boundary walls in underserved rural areas; (ii) rehabilitation of serviceable schools (with about 480
classrooms);    and    (iii)  building    management       capacity    of   MOE     for   implementation  of
construction/rehabilitation programs at all levels of its administration.

Subcomponent 1.2. School maintenance program: This subcomponent provided funds for the
implementation of cost-effective maintenance and repair methods, and for building management capacity
of MOE for implementation of routine school maintenance programs at all levels of administration.

Project Component 2 - Quality Improvement (Total est. cost: US$11.2 million)

The quality component was expected to improve the learning environment of rural basic schools.

Subcomponent 2.1. Improving teacher skills and deployment: This subcomponent supported: (i) annual
refresher training for all grade 1-6 teachers in the project governorates prior to the start of each school
year, and a two to three day training module annually in specific teaching domains; (ii) a 3-week training
for all inspectors, headmasters, and deputy headmasters on supporting and mentoring teachers; (iii)
transportation and related costs of inspectors' visits to schools in the project governorates; and (iv)
technical assistance and workshops to support a teacher deployment and hiring plan.

Subcomponent 2.2. Supplying furniture and educational materials: This subcomponent provided furniture
for classrooms built or rehabilitated by the project, and basic educational kits materials to all students in
schools built or rehabilitated by the project.

Project Component 3 ­ Capacity Building (Total est. cost: US$7.8 million)

The capacity building component was expected to strengthen the capacity of MOE to efficiently and
sustainably implement the project and basic education reforms, especially in the four governorates.

Subcomponent 3.1. Community participation: This subcomponent provided funds for building
management capacity at the central, governorate and district levels for community participation. It was
expected to support activities of the Community Participation Unit (CPU) established within MOE in
1999 to increase community participation in education programs, including access programs, school
construction (site selection, financial contribution, and supervision) and maintenance, and school
management.



                                                        2

Subcomponent 3.2. Planning, monitoring, and evaluation: This subcomponent was to support the
management capacity of MOE to: (i) implement the routine annual school survey; (ii) plan and follow-up
on the implementation of policies and work plans; and (iii) utilize the management information and
communication system for planning and decision-making.

Subcomponent 3.3. Project management and coordination: This subcomponent provided funds for
technical assistance, training and equipment to strengthen the project implementation capacity of MOE,
and especially the establishment of a Credit Administration Unit (CAU).

1.6 Revised Components

The original components were not revised.

1.7 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding allocations)

Closing date: The closing date of the project was extended by one year to June 30, 2007 to complete: (i)
construction, equipping and furnishing of on-going project schools; and (ii) on-going training programs of
the MOE. The cost savings generated by favorable US$/SDR exchange rate movements since project
appraisal were used for: (i) extension, rehabilitation, equipping and furnishing of additional schools in
project governorates; (ii) procurement of learning aides; and (iii) conducting a comprehensive school
survey in 2005/2006.

Reallocations: Based on the substantial savings from the SDR/US$ exchange rate, which amounted to
about 10% of the total Credit, the GOY requested the first reallocation of Credit proceeds to the civil
works and goods categories. The GOY and IDA agreed to use the additional resources to finance high
priority activities that were considered economically and technically justified, as they contributed to the
GOY's five-year strategy on increasing access to basic education. These activities included: the extension,
rehabilitation, and equipping of 125 additional schools in the targeted governorates. The reallocation was
approved in November 2005. A second reallocation of the Credit proceeds was approved in March 2007.
The GOY decided, at a late stage of the project (about a year before the revised closing date) to transfer
funds directly to schools to implement the maintenance program. The development of a financing
mechanism acceptable to the Bank took several months, and it soon became clear that the MoE would not
be able to spend the allocated funds (US$ 2.0 million) during the remaining period of the project. As the
ongoing Basic Education Development Project (BEDP, Cr. 3988, which closes on June 30, 2010)
included a civil works sub-component, it was decided to transfer the BEEP maintenance activities to
BEDP and to reallocate the unused funds to other high priority BEEP activities.

Project scope: With the additional resources allocated to civil works and goods, the Project scope went
beyond the original 20 focus districts and covered all the rural districts (70) in project governorates. The
change in the Project's scope was made possible by the improving implementation capacity of the MOE.
It was consistent with the PDO of increasing enrolment in the Governorates in which the NER for girls
was lowest.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their mitigations
identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)

· The project design was consistent with priorities in IDA's assistance strategy, and directly addressed the
education priorities identified in the 1999 CAS and the Yemen Education Sector Assistance Strategy of
1999, i.e., improving access to and quality of basic education for girls.

· Project design was kept simple as earlier IDA projects supporting Yemen's education sector suffered
from weak implementation capacity in the sector. While directly addressing the urgent priorities of
improving access and quality, the project design included strengthening the management capacity of
MOE.

· Findings of the mid-term review (MTR) of the Yemen Basic Education Project (Cr. 2412, closed on
December 31, 2000) that poor condition of school facilities, including the lack of toilets and boundary
walls, was a constraint for girls attendance were taken into account.

· The project design benefited from evidence provided by other development partners' experiences
(UNICEF, GTZ) with the community participation impact on reducing construction costs, improving
school management and increasing girls' enrolment.

· During project preparation, the Government, especially MOE, was intensively involved in: (i) preparing
building blocks for the project by a change in the MOE structure aimed at streamlining administration and
school mapping of the targeted governorates; (ii) defining the project concept at several meetings and
workshops that included central and governorate MOE staff; and (iii) developing the three project
components.

· The project preparation team met with parents, local councils and school committees during visits to
villages, and consulted with school managers, teachers, and local and regional administrators. These
discussions yielded suggestions on how to improve schools and school management, and were
incorporated in the design of the project.

· Critical risks related to MOE implementation capacity were identified and assessed adequately, and
corresponding mitigation measures were appropriate and minimized risks. The risks related to the role of
other departments (Ministry of Finance) and local authorities were stated in terms that were too general.
The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) identified the lack of commitment of central authorities and local
political leaders to the approval and implementation of educational plans as a potential risk, and
mentioned the teacher redeployment plan as a possible controversial aspect. However, with the Local
Authority Law adopted in 2002, the implementation of the teacher redeployment plan became mainly
beyond the control of the MOE. The lack of an appropriate mechanism for the transfer of maintenance
grants to schools was not foreseen during appraisal.

2.2 Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status, and actions taken,
as applicable)

The overall progress of the project was assessed as satisfactory during the MTR in October 2003. The
MTR pointed out the teacher hiring and redeployment issue and stressed the lack of female teachers in
rural areas. The GOY showed a strong commitment to reducing inefficiencies resulting from non-
objective criteria for school selection and teacher deployment by adopting a series of specific decrees
between 2004 and 2007. The measures taken aimed at: (i) basing school establishment and school
personnel deployment decisions on school mapping data and technical criteria; (ii) linking the post of the
teacher to the school rather than to the individual, which is expected to counter one of the significant
challenges of providing teachers, especially female teachers, in rural areas on a sustainable basis; and (ii)
linking the job nature allowance of teachers, principals, supervisors, and other staff to the actual post.

Assessment of teacher training activities was another issue mentioned during the MTR. As a result, MOE
conducted in 2006 a study on the "Evaluation of training programs and their impact on grade1-3 teachers,
school headmasters and basic education supervisors".

The lack of budget and recognition of the CPU was also noted by the MTR. Although the CPU was
successful in raising community awareness of girls' education and in facilitating community involvement
in school construction, additional efforts were needed to involve communities in school management and
oversight. In order to sustain and develop the activities of the CPU, the MOE upgraded it to a General
Directorate for Community Participation (DGCP) within the newly created Sector for Girls' Education.

The CAU established within the MOE to facilitate the project implementation was renamed the Project
Administrative Unit (PAU) in 2005, as it was also in charge of the administrative and financial
management of the BEDP and the Education For All--Fast Track Initiative (EFA-FTI) Catalytic Fund
project.

The project in its early years failed to produce system generated reports and to maintain proper and full
project recording because of the unavailability of acceptable and reliable accounting software. The weak
system which was in place at the project inception was latter changed during the preparation of BEDP.
The weak budgeting capacity of the PAU, reported by IDA's financial management team, was improved
over the project life through specific training and monitoring by the project team.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Monitoring and evaluation design: The PAD included arrangements for monitoring and evaluation relying
mainly on the Technical Office and the PAU with strong support from the Bank's field office in Yemen.
MOE was expected to develop annual education plans and budgets within the framework of the agreed
Letter of Basic Education Policies. The results and monitoring framework contained quantifiable
indicators for the access, quality, and capacity building objectives. Although the indicators proposed to
measure the Project's main outcomes were adequate for quantifying progress in terms of enrolment
(especially of girls) in the project governorates, the absence of baseline data and specific target for the
GER is a shortcoming in the PAD. GER baseline data and target value were probably not available at the
time of appraisal, and were added by the task team in 2003.

Indicators for the quality component were not sufficiently developed. Due to the lack of capability to
assess learning achievements in Yemen, the PAD proposed increased enrolments and project outputs
(teachers trained, availability of teaching/learning materials) as proxies for better quality of education.


                                                     5

Although the quality of education obviously has an impact on enrolment through drop out and repetition
rates, increased enrolment can hardly be interpreted in terms of quality. It would have been more
appropriate to assess quality improvement through transition rates which could have been estimated using
the Annual Educational Survey (AES) data. Moreover, the results framework used input indicators such
as percentages of teachers trained or schools supervised as output indicators.

The quality of the PAD's results framework (including intermediate performance indicators) and
readiness of implementation arrangements for M&E were rated moderately satisfactory in the QSA
undertaken in 2006.

Monitoring and evaluation implementation: Project activities supported MOE in implementing AESs
from 2000 through 2004 and a Comprehensive School Survey (CSS) in 2005-06. The data was used to
estimate outcome performance indicators such as enrolments in the target areas. For the AES, forms were
filled out by district officers and school headmasters, while for the CSS surveyors were hired and trained
to visit schools and fill out forms. In 2006, MOE started using web-based surveys (WBS) where school
headmasters were asked to fill out online-forms through mobile phones. The use of three different
methods for data collection poses the problem of data consistency over time. Data provided by the AES
seem to be inflated since the 2005-06 CSS shows lower enrolments than in 2004-05. In order to ensure
that the results can be monitored in the sector, the Bank-led BEDP and FTI supervision mission in July
2007 agreed with the MOE to: (i) review the questionnaires of the AES and the WBS in order to ensure
data consistency over time, and (ii) conduct a small sample survey of 500 schools using the AES paper-
based method in order to undertake quality control of the WBS during the school year 2007-08.

It is also worth mentioning that: (i) while outcome indicators 2 and 3 were supposed to be estimated for
the focus districts only, they were actually calculated at the governorate level, which is justified by the
fact that the project scope moved from 20 to 70 focus districts; and (ii) very little analytical work has been
produced by the Technical Office or other MOU units on the comprehensive data provided by the annual
surveys. Data related to the quality component was provided by relevant MOE Sectors (teacher training,
supervision, and general education). However, the data provided (percentage of teachers trained, schools
supervised, schools with adequate teachers) did not include details about how these indicators were
calculated such as the total number of teachers trained, schools supervised, schools adequately staffed,
and students/teacher ratios.

Monitoring and Evaluation utilization: IDA and the GOY utilized the information available to follow up
the progress of the Project. Statistics provided by AESs were used during supervision to assess progress
toward the achievement of the development objectives. In order to ensure data consistency, PDO
indicators for the ICR were calculated using the CSS 1998-99 and 2005-06 data, which are comparable.
Issues related to specific sub-components or activities such as the school maintenance mechanism, teacher
redeployment and community participation were timely reported and monitored.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)

Procurement: The PAU managed successfully an important number of procurement tasks, handling the
procurement of goods and selection of consultants, and providing support to governorate implementation
teams which were in charge of the procurement process for civil works. The overall execution of the
project in terms of procurement was satisfactory as confirmed by an Independent Procurement Review
(IPR) of bank-financed projects in Yemen, in 2004.

Financial management: The project did not encounter any major fiduciary compliance issues, and
unqualified audit reports, including the audit report at the closing date of June 30, 2007, were presented as


                                                      6

required by the Bank. Because of the unavailability of an acceptable and reliable software at the project
inception, project management was unable to produce system generated financial monitoring reports
(FMRs), neither for financial reports nor for full FMRs.

Environmental safeguard: Three main environmental issues were identified by the environmental impact
assessment conducted during project appraisal: site selection for new schools, water availability for
hygienic purposes, and operation and maintenance of schools, including sanitation facilities. For site
selection, environmental criteria were identified and incorporated into the Project Implementation Plan
(PIP), and included into the Environmental Management Plan (EMP). The project team conducted field
visits to talk to site supervisors, engineers, GEOs and communities and reviewed documentation to verify
the effectiveness of safeguard procedures. No asbestos or toxic material was used in construction and no
safeguard issues were reported. For the water availability issue, the project included construction of toilet
facilities for each school and, given the scarcity of water in Yemen, 'dry toilets' were selected as the
standard toilet design. On the maintenance side, training was provided to school maintenance committees
and basic maintenance tool kits were provided to schools; the school maintenance grants scheme was not
implemented.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed by present
operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and institutional capacity, and
next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)

The principles of simplification, alignment and harmonization were applied for BEEP well ahead of the
Paris Declaration. The simple design and implementation arrangements were key factors in the project's
success. IDA and other donors worked as partners with the government in drafting the Basic Education
Development Strategy and they review the strategy annually with the government. The BEEP was fully
embedded in the GOY educational strategy and implemented by MOE structures at central and local
levels. As a result of BEEP achievements, the education sector became the furthest along in Yemen in
donor harmonization and resource mobilization, with a Partnership Declaration signed by 12 donors.
Yemen received, in 2003, a US$10 million grant from the EFA-FTI Catalytic Fund, to improve enrolment,
particularly of girls, in the governorates of Al-Baida, Dhmar, Hajjah, and Hodaida. BEDP was launched
in 2005 with contributions from The Netherlands and UK, as a continuation of BEEP and a pre-SWAP
operation. BEDP supports the GOY in expanding the provision of quality and equitable basic education
(grade 1-9) in 10 governorates different than those covered by BEEP and the EFA-FTI Catalytic Fund
project. Yemen's success in joining the first group of countries to benefit from the EFA-FTI Catalytic
Fund, followed by its demonstrated ability to use the funds for educational advancements, enabled the
country to build on its success and qualify for two further grants.

The BEDP came as a continuation of BEEP to support efforts of the GOY to increase access to basic
education, improve the quality of teaching and learning, and strengthen the institutional capacity of the
educational system. It formed a major part of a wider program of implementation of the Basic Education
Development Strategy (BEDS) adopted by the GOY to lead the country toward achieving the Millenium
Development Goals (MDGs) of universal primary enrolment and of gender parity. The BEDP is expected
to contribute to a 20% country-wide increase of enrolment in basic education (Gr.1-9) through schools
construction, extension and rehabilitation. BEDP also took over the implementation of the school
maintenance grants, delayed because of the lack of a transfer mechanism compatible with the Bank's
fiduciary requirements (see 1.7). Activities started by the BEEP at the governorate level of and aiming at
improving the quality of basic education were expanded and reinforced through BEDP. While putting
emphasis on curriculum review and development, the BEDP addresses quality issues through the
provision of educational materials, supporting better teacher management, improving pre-service and in-
service training and strengthening the education system supervision and support structures. Building on


                                                     7

the experience of BEEP, the BEDP included the preparation of a broadly accepted teacher recruitment
and deployment strategy involving relevant departments and teacher representatives.

Although the project achievements in terms of increased girls' enrolment in grades 1-6 in the five
governorates are likely to be irreversible, some risks to the sustainability of project outcomes must be
mentioned:

    (i)      the lack of female teachers in rural areas is a real constraint to retaining girls; the teacher
             recruitment and deployment strategy should address, as planned in BEDP, the issues of
             recruitment, training and deployment of female teachers and specific incentives for female
             teachers in rural areas;

    (ii)     community participation is a critical factor in ensuring girls' enrolment; although the project
             was successful in mobilizing communities for schools construction in target governorates,
             their future involvement in school maintenance and management needs additional support
             from the MOE;

    (iii)    as schools in Yemen's rural areas are exposed to severe weather conditions, lack of
             maintenance might reduce substantially the life span of school buildings; the ICR mission
             noticed that some of the new buildings were already altered and recommended to speed up
             the implementation of the school maintenance grant mechanism; and

    (iv)     although the continuity of MOE teacher training and supervision programs was ensured
             through BEDP's funding, the sustainability of these activities will depend on their future
             transfer to MOE recurrent budget.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

The overall relevance of Project objectives is high, both at the time of preparation and at completion. As
stated in the 2006 CAS, about 42% of the population of 19.2 million still live below the national poverty
line, most of them (83%) in rural areas, and Yemen ranked 151st out of 177 countries on the 2005 Human
Development Index. Despite significant improvements in basic education indicators, many areas of
concern remain: high fertility rates (population growing at over 0.5 million people per annum); infant and
child mortality; maternal mortality; malnutrition (about 3 million people); and low adult literacy rates.
Adult illiteracy in Yemen, approximately 47%, is higher than the 39% average for low income countries.
Almost 70% of Yemeni women are illiterate compared with 27.3% of the men. This stems from a lack of
access to basic education, particularly for girls. Despite a significant improvement from 51% in 1999 to
62% in 2005, the country's GER for girls remains low. Yemen still has a long way to go to achieve the
MDGs of universal primary completion and gender parity.

The strong performance of the BEEP in the most difficult districts is largely attributed to its design: (i) a
clear development objective relevant to the country/sector priorities; (ii) targeting of a limited number of
governorates; and (iii) simple and flexible implementation arrangements with a focus on building local
capacity. The three project components were well identified and designed, and were duplicated for BEDP.
It should be mentioned, however, that: (i) the provision of school furniture should have been included in
the access component instead of being part of the quality component; (ii) indicators for the quality
component were not sufficiently developed (see 2.3); and (iii) the risks related to the implementation of
the maintenance grant mechanism and the teacher redeployment plan were underestimated (see 2.1).




                                                     8

Despite the low institutional capacity at the country level, the project was implemented by the MOE
through its existing structure. Each administrative entity at both the central and decentralized level
implemented and monitored the activities that felt under its responsibility. This implementation structure
proved to be successful. Annual plans were approved in a timely manner and regularly monitored by the
Steering Committee. The implementation responsibility was largely undertaken by the PAU which
coordinated activities with the sectors involved in the project. The PAU provided effective support to the
Governorate Implementation Teams (GITs). It maintained smooth coordination with MOE departments
both at the central and governorate/district levels, and contributed to a transfer of capacities to MOE staff
in charge of implementation.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on outputs in
Annex 2)

The objective of the Project was to increase the grade 1-6 enrolment of rural children, especially girls, in
basic education of adequate quality. This objective was expected to be achieved by the following three
outputs: (i) an increase in the number of classrooms available in remote rural areas; (ii) improved quality
of resources (including teachers) available at schools; and (iii) strengthened management capacity of
education, including community participation. All development objective indicators surpassed initial
targets. According to the MOE Comprehensive School Survey 2005-06 and to updated population
projections (based on the CSO's Population Census 2004), the GER for the population aged 6-11 in
grades 1-6 in the five governorates reached 89.9% in 2005, compared with 77.5% in 1999. Between 1998-
99 and 2005-06, total enrolment in the target governorates increased by 48.4%, 50% more than the initial
objective. This significant growth in access has been complemented with improvements in gender equity
with girls' share in the incremental enrolment reaching 70%, significantly higher than the original target
of 60%. Girls GER in project governorates improved substantially from 45.1% in 1999 to 77.9% in 2005.

The project improved access to basic education by bringing schools to remote rural villages within the
five governorates. The Project funded the construction of 497 new schools, the extension of 240 schools,
and the rehabilitation of 183 schools. It contributed to the expansion of the school system with 2,961 new
classrooms in 70 districts, instead of 2,100 planned in 20 districts, representing 96,300 additional places
or 54% of the total incremental enrolment in the five governorates during the 1999-2005 periods.

Although project indicators do not assess directly the impact on quality, it is likely that education
provided to students in the project governorates was of "adequate quality". Project indicators show that



                                                       9

the 920 project schools were provided with an adequate number of qualified teachers. Teacher
deployment is one of the most serious challenges facing the education sector in Yemen. Many remote
areas have difficulties attracting and keeping teachers. The GOY took several steps toward improving
teacher deployment, including: (i) linking teachers' positions to schools rather than to individual teachers;
(ii) linking a recent salary increase to teacher's actual teaching load; and (iii) redeployment of 10-20%
teachers at the governorate level. Although teacher recruitment and deployment involves other
departments and local authorities, MOE's leadership is essential to the development and implementation
of a comprehensive and effective teacher deployment/redeployment strategy. A consultant study on
teacher redeployment conducted under BEDP in July 2007 recommended reinforcing the authority of
MOE on its regional structure.

Project activities also contributed to improving the quality of teaching through: (i) refresher training for
53,200 teachers; (ii) school management training for 3,300 school headmasters; and (iii) specific training
for 620 supervisors. In 2003-04, the project supported 3,825 supervisors' visits to schools in the target
governorates. According to the MOE Guidance & Inspection Sector, BEEP funding allowed MOE to
undertake a minimum of three inspection visits per school and per year in the five governorates since
2004. In 2006, MOE conducted a study on training programs and their impact on grade1-3 teachers,
school headmasters and basic education supervisor. The study indicates a positive perception of the
training outcomes by trainees and provides an evaluation of trainees' performances. It does not assess,
however, the actual impact of the training programs on the quality of teaching.

The project provided schools in the target governorates with educational material. All students in schools
covered by BEEP received basic educational kits. About 208,000 student kits were distributed over the
course of the project. As reported by school headmasters/mistresses and community representatives, the
distribution of educational kits was an additional incentive for parents to send their children to school and
the kits were highly appreciated by students. The project also funded the provision of teaching materials
including laboratory kits, computers and books for libraries for selected schools; preparation of user
manuals for the laboratory kits and computer systems; and specific training for math and sciences
teachers on the use of the teaching material. This activity was not initially planned in the project. Since
teaching materials were distributed during the summer 2007, their impact could not be assessed at the
time of the ICR.

3.3 Efficiency
(Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms, least cost, and
comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return)

An ERR was not calculated for this project. The economic analysis carried out during appraisal
recognized that cost-effective options were selected for the two major sub-components: classroom
construction and in-service teacher training.

The cost effectiveness of civil works (accounting for 70% of final project expenditures) was good, with
the average unit cost of classroom construction ($13,700) comparing favorably with those of other
projects in the sector. The project provided more additional classrooms than planned during appraisal,
resulting in an overall enrolment increase of 48% higher than the project's objective of 30%. The project
adopted cost-effective school designs and decentralized bidding procedures which resulted in relatively
low unit costs per square meter, comparable to the low-cost end of Social Fund for Development (SFD)
and Public Works (PWP) constructions despite the fact that: (i) 100% of BEEP schools were in rural areas
(94% for the PWP and 86% for the SFD) where the construction is more expensive due to the difficult
access to many sites; and (ii) the PWP usually provides fewer facilities than the two other projects. (see
table after).

These unit costs include community participation which was estimated between 3 and 5% of the total
construction cost for the BEEP. This participation was mainly provided through local materials (mainly
stones and sand) , unskilled labour, water or/and cash.

The number of teachers who benefited from in-service training also surpassed targets. The unit cost per
trainee was 20% lower than expected.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)
Rating: Satisfactory

The overall outcome of the Project is rated as satisfactory. The reasons are:

· The relevance of objectives was and continues to be high;

· The relevance of the components was and continues to be high for all of the components;

· The Project contributed substantially to an increase in enrolment in grades 1-6 in the five target
governorates and to a reduction in the gender gap;

· The Project contributed to strengthen the capacity of the GOY at national, governorate and district
levels;

· The Project assisted the GOY in the design and implementation of key educational reforms and policies
such as teacher redeployment, criteria-based resource allocation, and fee abolition for grades 1-6;

· The Project was successful in promoting and developing community participation;

· The success of BEEP contributed to improve donor harmonization and resource mobilization for future
operations (BEDP, EFA-FTI);

· The project applied successfully cost-effective approaches; and

· The shortcomings at the design level (baseline data and target values for GER, and quality indicators)
are considered as minor since they did not affect the overall performance of the Project.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The project directly addressed the CAS objective of creation of an early stream of social benefits for the
poor by increasing enrolment in basic education (grades 1-6) in 70 underserved rural districts. According
to the beneficiary survey, 35 to 50% of the families in the communities covered by the project were
considered as poor.




                                                     11

The gender gap was reduced in the five governorates as Gender Parity Index (GPI) improved globally
from 0.39 in 1999 to 0.72 in 2006. Moreover, the project contributed to raise awareness about and
facilitate additional support to access for girls to basic education.

The project promoted community participation in school identification, construction, maintenance and
management, and was successful in involving actively about three-forth of the beneficiary communities in
the school construction and rehabilitation activities.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)

The project had a substantial institutional impact at the central, local and community levels.

At the central level, the implementation structure, where each administrative entity within MOE was
responsible for implementing and monitoring those activities within its purview, and the capacity building
activities strengthened the MOE sectors (project, training, general education and curricula and
supervision) involved in the project. The planning capacity of MOE was strengthened through specific
support to the implementation of annual school surveys, the use of school mapping, and preparation and
monitoring of educational plans.

The project improved the technical capacity of the human resources in the GEOs and DEOs in the five
governorates. They were able to effectively implement project activities, manage decentralized
procurement of civil works, supervise schools, monitor Project progress, and work closely with
communities. The project also contributed to institutional strengthening in the target governorates through
the provision of training for a substantial number of teachers, school headmasters/mistresses, and
supervisors.

The capacity of local communities was developed through the support provided to school Father and
Mother Councils established in around 75% of the schools covered by the project. Communities actively
participated with the MOE and project staff in the design, preparation and implementation of sub-projects
in their areas.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

    · The success of BEEP contributed to the mobilization of additional funding to support basic
         education through the EFA-FTI Catalytic Fund, and catalyzed donor harmonization with a
         Partnership Declaration signed by 12 donors;

    · The cost effective approach adopted by BEEP for school construction was generalized to all
         MOE projects and duplicated in other sectors; and

    · In order to ensure the sustainability of the activities initiated by the CPU, the MOE established
         the DGCP within the newly created Sector of Girls Education.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(optional for Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes)

The beneficiary survey, conducted by a local independent consultant, covered 281 construction sub-
projects (around 30% of total number of new/extended/rehabilitated schools) in 62 districts. The main
findings of the survey are:




                                                       12

    · The project had a direct impact on schooling in the surveyed communities, increasing total
        enrolment by 81%, and girls' enrolment by almost 100%. Gender gap in enrolment was reduced
        by 7 points.

    · Around 70% of schools surveyed have established Father or Mother Councils, and 83% of the
        councils were actually in operation at the time of the survey.

    · Almost all schools with Father/Mother Councils were visited by CPU local representatives and
        received training on: operating community-based organizations, team work, financial
        management, and school operation and maintenance.

    · About three-forth of the communities visited actively participated in sub-project identification,
        site selection, and implementation monitoring. The survey also noted the interference of other
        stakeholders such as school headmasters, community leaders (sheikhs) and local authorities
        which had the final word in the identification of about one half of the sub-projects.

    · At least 76% of the communities surveyed contributed to the cost of their sub-projects. Most
        contributions (90%) came in-kind through the provision of land, construction material and labor.

    · Maintenance of about one-half of the schools visited is ensured fully (28%) or partially through
        cost sharing with MOE (23%) by communities. Other contributors are MOE solely (26%), and
        local authorities at the governorate (12%) and the district (5%) levels.

    · Beneficiary communities are globally satisfied with the project. Around 92% considered the
        school sub-projects funded by BEEP as responding to one of their top priorities; and about 58%
        rated project performance as very good or excellent, 38% as good, and 4% as bad (all of them in
        the governorates of Amran and Al-Mahweet).

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

The overall Risk to Development Outcome is rated as moderate. It is likely that the PDOs in terms of
increased access to and quality of basic education, especially for girls in the covered rural areas will be
sustained. The project used and strengthened the MOE's capacity for managing the sector as well as
decentralization of sector management, including involvement of parents in school councils. The
government is committed to the objectives of the project as well as to efforts for strengthening the
management of the system. In addition, the involvement of communities in the construction and
maintenance of schools is likely to leverage additional resources and capacity to support the school
system. The main risks, considered as moderate, to the continuation and expansion of the outcomes
achieved with the Project's support are:

    · Lack of school maintenance: Although the project supported the establishment of a maintenance
        mechanism involving local communities, the implementation of a major component the program
        (the school maintenance grants scheme) was not completed by the project's closing date. It is
        expected to be implemented under BEDP;

    · Lack of female teachers in rural areas: the MOE is fully aware that girl's retention in the upper
        grades of basic education is strongly correlated with the availability of female teachers, and is
        developing incentives for female teachers in rural areas as part of its teachers hiring and
        redeployment strategy;

    · Continuity of support to community participation:          there is a risk that the local structures
        established with the support of the project would progressively slow their activities due to lack of




                                                    13

         support and resources. The DGCP should be expected to provide them with support in the areas
         of school operation and maintenance.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
Rating: Satisfactory

IDA's performance during preparation is rated satisfactory. The project concept evolved dramatically
from the identification phase to appraisal, reflecting the team's efforts to meet the sector needs and adapt
to the Borrower's priorities. The IDA team also provided adequate advice to the GOY during the
preparation phase, based on lessons learned from the implementation of other projects and available
sector work. Project design and objectives were in line with the education reform priorities defined in the
CAS. Alternative options for project concept and components were carefully assessed. Critical risks
related to MOE implementation capacity were identified and assessed adequately, and corresponding
mitigation measures were appropriate and minimized risks. The flexible and decentralized
implementation approach adopted proved to be highly effective in building the Borrower's institutional
capacity and ensuring cost-effectiveness.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Highly Satisfactory

The IDA team performed in a highly satisfactory manner during Project supervision. The team was based
in the Country Office; hence they were available to provide just-in­time advice to the Borrower.
Decentralization of the team has also helped to strengthen policy and technical collaboration with other
donors. IDA has earned a leadership role in providing analytical support for the development of
educational strategies which have been used as a basis for systemic changes supported by the donor
community. The team has also been able to use trust funds to develop activities which had positive
effects on supervision. The team carried out an adequate number of supervision missions and integrated
specialized consultants whenever needed. The skills mix was appropriate and the team was resourceful in
getting support from other units such as procurement and financial management as well as from the
Network. The decentralization of the fiduciary team has also ensured appropriate and timely support for
the project.

The project supervision was rated as Highly Satisfactory by the QSA undertaken in 2006.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank's overall performance is considered satisfactory, based on the following factors:

     · The project was well designed to respond to the low level of HD indicators and weak sector and
         country institutions in Yemen;

     · The supervision was effective in providing just-in-time technical assistance and active feedback
         of findings and recommendations to the Borrower;




                                                     14

    · Strong focus on achieving PDOs and flexibility to adapt the Project's activities to the evolving
         implementation experience; and

    · Good teamwork with the Borrower, among IDA team members and with other donors.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The Government's performance is rated satisfactory. GOY maintained a high financial commitment to
education. Over the past decade, the overall allocation to the education sector has oscillated between 5
and 7% of GDP (5.4% in 2005). Education has been one of the pillars of the government's successive
five-year plans, and its Poverty Reduction Strategy and 2025 vision. The abolition of school fees for girls
(grades 1-6) and boys (grades 1-3) was a strong move from the government which confirmed its
commitment to achieving the MDGs of universal primary enrolment and of gender parity.

During the 1997-2006 period, the GOY showed strong commitment to the Project's objectives and
activities throughout the preparation and implementation phases. Commitment was particularly strong
from the MOE which maintained the focus on expanding access to education to the entire country, with
particular attention to disadvantaged groups. During the implementation period, the GOY fulfilled its
financial, technical and institutional obligations.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The MOE closely and effectively worked with the IDA team during the preparation and implementation
phases. The MOE prepared timely annual implementation reports, detailing progress and difficulties faced
by the Project. Audits of the Project were regularly carried out and on time, and were generally favorable.
Procurement reviews were favorable as well.

Annual plans and progress reports were approved in a timely manner by the Steering Committee. The
implementation responsibility was fully taken by the CAU/PAU which coordinated activities with the
sectors involved in the project. The PAU provided effective support to the GITs. It maintained smooth
coordination with MOE departments both at the central and local levels, and contributed to the transfer of
capacities to MOE staff in charge of Project implementation. It was praised by successive supervision
missions for its monitoring of project indicators and for the quality of the tasks performed. However,
weakness in the PAU budgeting capacity was reported by IDA's financial management team. It seems
also, that the PAU's performance suffered from the unit's handling of two additional projects (BEDP and
FTI grant) during the last two years of the project. The dynamism of GEOs and DEOs was one of the key
factors contributing to project achievements. They demonstrated real capabilities in implementing project
activities, managing decentralized procurement of civil works, supervising schools, monitoring project
progress, and working with communities.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The overall Borrower's performance is rated satisfactory based on the following:

    · Strong commitment to the Project objectives and activities;
    · Good dialogue and collaboration with the IDA team;
    · Fulfillment of its financial and institutional commitments;


                                                     15

    · Effective coordination between the central, governorate and district levels; and
    · Good performance of the PAU in the administrative and financial management of the project.

6. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)

    · Strong focus on a single development objective is instrumental in achieving substantial
        changes in development trends. In keeping a clear focus on girls basic education in rural areas,
        the project not only surpassed its original development objectives in the target governorates, but
        also catalyzed additional support to basic education at the national level from the government,
        local communities and donors.

    · Limiting the project's scope to a small number of governorates guarantees the success of
        decentralized activities. Because of the limited number of governorates covered by the project,
        the PAU was able to ensure close monitoring and effective support to GEOs and DEOs, and
        therefore to progressively develop their management capacity.

    · Challenges posed by HR strategies should not be underestimated. While the poor distribution of
        teachers and extreme shortages, especially of female teachers, were recognized during appraisal,
        there was no detailed diagnosis of the hiring and deployment mechanisms in place. The role of
        other departments, local authorities and community leaders, originally clearly underestimated,
        proved to be critical in the implementation of MOE teacher redeployment plan.

    · Community involvement in the definition of educational needs is critical to ensure girls
        enrolment. Community participation in the school site selection and construction contributed to
        developing ownership. CPU work with communities was instrumental in raising awareness and
        mobilizing communities for girls education.

    · Simple and flexible implementation arrangements with an emphasis on strengthening the
        capacity of government agencies proved to be effective in achieving project goals, and ensuring
        ownership. In a context of weak capacity, flexible implementation plans allow for corrective
        measures with a main focus on achieving development objectives.

    · Although the use of a CAU ensures a smooth implementation of project activities, it does not
        build the administrative and financial management capacity of MOE. The CAU/PAU approach
        ensured ownership by MOE and contributed to develop the capacity of the sectors involved in the
        project. However, the management experience accumulated by the PAU was not transferred to
        MOE central administrative and financial units.

    · Decentralization of the task team helps to ensure effective supervision and monitoring of
        projects, build Borrower capacity, and develop partnerships. Despite the turnover of TTLs,
        adequate supervision was provided to the project. The decentralization also allowed the team to
        develop a strong relationship with the government, and to provide timely advice and follow-up on
        actions as necessary. The Team has also used strong relationships with donors to mobilize skills
        and resources from other donors to complement IDA efforts.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

The MOE expressed disappointment with the rating of project outcomes and borrower's performance (see
Annex 7) based on the fact that project outcome indicators were largely surpassed, effective coordination
was ensured with IDA and implementation teams, and project success resulted in more funds allocated to
basic education and improved coordination among donors. It should be mentioned that the achievements
mentioned by the MOE were reported in the ICR. However, the rating took also into account (i) the
minor shortcomings at the design level (see 2.3); (ii) the delay in the implementation of the school
maintenance grants scheme (see 1.7); and (iii) the issue related to financial reporting (see 2.2).

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1: Expansion of access

Subcomponent 1.1. School construction, extension, and rehabilitation: The Project funded the
construction of 497 new schools, the extension of 240 schools, and the rehabilitation of 183, all equipped
and furnished by the Project. It has contributed to the expansion of the system with 2,961 new classrooms
in 70 districts, instead of 2,100 planned in 20 districts, representing 96,300 additional places. More
classrooms were built by the Project thanks to: (i) the reallocation of $5.7m from other components, and
(ii) a lower unit cost per classroom ($13,700 instead of $15,000). The lower average unit cost of
construction per classroom, mainly explained by cost-effective school design, decentralized bidding
procedures and community participation (5% of construction cost), is now used as a basis for future MOE
projects.

Subcomponent 1.2. School maintenance program: The maintenance subcomponent was designed to
support the implementation of a cost-effective school maintenance program. The project funded capacity
building activities: Training of maintenance committees (including community members) established by
MOE in schools all over the five target governorates; preparation of maintenance manuals; and provision
of basic maintenance tool kits to the schools. The implementation of the maintenance funding mechanism
(school grants), has been delayed because of the lack of a transfer mechanism compatible with the Bank's
fiduciary requirements, and was therefore transferred to BEDP.

Component 2: Quality Improvement

Subcomponent 2.1. Improving teacher skills and deployment: With support from BEEP and other
development partners, MOE prepared a training plan and training modules aligned on the new curriculum.
The project funded refresher training for 53,200 teachers, school management training for 3,300 school
headmasters and specific training for 620 supervisors. In 2003-04, the project supported 3,825
supervisors' visits to schools in the target governorates. According to the MOE Guidance & Inspection
Sector, BEEP funding allowed MOE to undertake a minimum of 3 inspection visits per school and per
year in the five governorates since 2004. MOE conducted in 2006 a study on the "Evaluation of training
programs and their impact on grade1-3 teachers, school headmasters and basic education supervisors".
The study demonstrates a positive perception of the training outcomes by trainees and provides an
evaluation of trainees' performances. It doesn't provide, however, a clear indication on the actual impact
of the training programs on the quality of teaching. The continuity of MOE teachers training and
supervision programs for the following years will be ensured through BEDP's funding, and should be
progressively transferred to MOE recurrent budget.

Teachers' deployment is one of the most serious challenges facing the education sector in Yemen. Many
remote areas have difficulties attracting and keeping teachers. The low proportion of female teachers in
rural areas (9% in 2005/06), in particular, might have a negative impact on girl's enrolment and retention,
as shown by a recent UNICEF study (Accelerating Girl's Education in Yemen- UNICEF 2007). The
GOY took several steps toward improving teachers' deployment including: (i) linking teachers' positions
to schools rather than to individual teachers; (ii) linking a recent salary increase to teacher's actual
teaching load; and (iii) redeployment of 10-20% teachers at the governorate level. The consultant study
on teachers' redeployment conducted under BEDP in July 2007 recommended to reinforce the authority
of MOE on its regional structure. Although teachers' recruitment and deployment involves other
departments and local authorities, MOE's leadership is essential to the development and implementation
of a comprehensive and effective teachers' deployment/redeployment strategy.


                                                     19

Subcomponent 2.2. Supplying Furniture and Educational Materials: All students in schools covered by
BEEP received basic educational kits. About 208,000 student kits have been distributed over the project's
life. Teaching materials including laboratory kits, computers and books for library were only distributed
to schools during the summer 2007. Around 500 schools were provided with books for library, computers,
demonstration labs, posters and maps, and 200 cluster schools were equipped with audiovisual equipment.
The project prepared user's manuals for the laboratory kits and computer systems, and provided specific
training on the use of the teaching material to Math and Sciences teachers.

Component 3: Capacity Building

Subcomponent 3.1. Community Participation: During the first years of the project, a Community
Participation Unit (CPU) has been established at the MOE, as well as in each governorate and district
covered by the Project. GTZ has provided assistance to the MOE in the development of the CP strategy
and training of their staff. CPUs participated in site selection and worked with communities to increase
their awareness in the education of girls. Communities' involvement in site selection facilitated their
contribution to construction and rehabilitation costs and was a key factor in the substantial improvement
of girls' enrollment. Building on BEEP's success, MOE incorporated community participation in school
construction projects on a systematic basis. In order to sustain and develop the activities of the CPU, the
MOE upgraded it to a General Directorate for Community Participation (DGCP) within the newly created
Sector for Girl's Education.

Subcomponent 3.2. Planning, monitoring, and evaluation: The project supported training and
dissemination workshops on Educational surveys, as well as TA on the use of EMIS for planning
purposes. Annual Educational Survey (AES) were conducted during 1999-2005 and data was used to feed
the school map. The Sector of Projects started using systematically school mapping for the preparation of
MOE annual planning including Social Development Fund (SDF) projects. It should be mentioned
however that the quality of data collected needs to be assessed and that MOE capacity in data analysis
remains weak. The mission recommends reinforcing the role of the Technical Office as the main source
for MOE official statistical data and as a data service provider to other MOE Sectors.

Subcomponent 3.3. Project management and coordination: One important strategic choice was to have the
Project implemented through MOE rather than a separate project management unit. The implementation
of BEEP relied heavily on the MOE project sector teams at both central and governorate level with direct
support from the PAU and regular on-the-job trainings. This approach which developed the capacity of
the ministry at all levels and reinforced its ownership of the Project was considered as a best practice and
transposed to other bank-funded projects in Yemen.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

The economic analysis conducted at the Project appraisal looked mainly at two dimensions: (i)
consistency with the CAS and impact en enrollment, and (ii) cost effective approaches. This analysis
takes two parts: (i) impact assessment of improvement in girls' enrollment by difference-in-difference
(DID) estimation; and (ii) unit cost analysis of school construction program.

1. Assessment of Enrollment Increase

The first part of the analysis focuses on the impact of BEEP on the girls' enrollment. The M&E indicators
show that enrollment achievement surpasses the PDO target, but this analysis aims to understand to what
degree the BEEP was effective in increasing the enrollment in the BEEP districts.

The analysis used data from National Poverty Survey (NPS) in 1999 and Household Budget Survey
(HBS) in 2005, both of which were conducted by the Central Statistical Organization (CSO) of Yemen.
The data was prepared to form a panel format, by aggregating household information at the district level,
and matching the districts data for 1999 and 2005. Due to geographical re-categorization of districts and
governorates and the difference in the design of the cluster between 1999 and 2005, 255 out of 330
administrative districts were matched and used for the analysis.

The regression was modeled as:
Y = 1 + 2d BEEP + 3d 2005 + 4d BEEP       *2005+5X +

where Y is the Net Enrollment Rate (NER) in basic education (aged 6-14) d BEEP is a dummy for a BEEP
districts; d 2005 is a dummy for the second year (i.e. 2005); and d  BEEP*2005is an interaction term between
BEEP districts and second year dummy; and X is a set of control variables.

The result of the analysis strongly supports that the BEEP had a statistically-significant positive impact on
the enrollment of girls. From the analysis, it is evident that (i) BEEP districts were originally 9.9
percentage points lower than non-BEEP districts in the girls' NER, which validates the selection of target
districts, (ii) girls' NER improved by 20.6 percentage points between 1999 and 2005 in non-BEEP
districts, and (iii) girls' NER in BEEP districts improved by 14.4 percentage points more than non-BEEP
districts (i.e. 35.0 percentage points improvement from1999), given the other controls constant.

The BEEP also benefited boys although the size of benefit is smaller than girls. Boys NER increased by
10.7 percentage points in non-BEEP districts, while NER increased by 18.2 percentage points in BEEP
districts.

These facts confirm the findings in the M&E indicators that the BEEP was successful in (i) increasing the
NER at a faster rate than in non-BEEP districts, and (ii) reducing the gender gap in the enrollment by
increasing girls' enrollment faster than boys.

2. Assessment of Construction Cost

This part aims to provide an update of the cost-effectiveness analysis conducted for the BEEP PAD. An
analysis of annualized unit cost per student from school construction reveals that the BEEP design of
classroom construction was much more cost effective than alternative design of classroom construction
employed in different IDA projects.

An annualized cost of classroom is calculated by the following formula1:

          AC =      IC  k (1+ k)n
                       (1+ k)n -1
where AC is Annualized Cost; IC is Investment Cost; k is the interest rate; n is the useful lifetime of the
investment in years.

Average construction cost per classroom under BEEP school is US$13,700.2 One of the advantages of the
BEEP design of school is its physical strength. BEEP schools are constructed by using durable materials,
so life of the building can be assumed 30 years. Given a 10 percent interest rate, the annualized cost for
BEEP classroom is US$1,453 over 30 years.

This annualized unit cost per classroom is much less than alternative design employed by IDA's another
project, Child Development Project (CDP). CDP was implemented between 2000-2005, which was the
same period as BEEP, but employed different design of school construction with different cost.
Assumption used for calculating an annualized cost for CDP schools is $3,9063 and life of the building is

2This is estimated by dividing the total new school building cost by number of new classrooms constructed; therefore this cost
includes cost for the fence, latrines, and administration room, which can't be separated.

3Per classroom construction cost under CDP was much lower than BEEP mainly due to (i) the lack of other facilities than
classrooms (i.e. no verandah, no latrines, no office, and no enclosure walls); (ii) classrooms with smaller dimensions; and (iii) the
recruitment of contractors through local communities (Dupety D. Mission Reports Feb. 18-Mar 11, 2005). Field visits have



                                                                  22

10 years. According to the assumption, the annualized cost for CDP classroom is US$636 for the first 10
years. However, the cost of construction will be more expensive in the second (after 10 years) and third
(after 20 years) construction because of the interest rate. As a result, in a 30-year period, the overall
annualized cost per classroom is US$2,187.                 4



The unit cost per student is also advantageous for BEEP schools. According to the standard design for
BEEP, the classroom size is either 30 or 40 student capacity. Yet, statistics shows average students per
classroom in BEEP governorates are 63. By applying this number, annualized cost per student is US$ 23
over 30 years. On the other hand, CDP schools are smaller in size, and with some generous assumption of
40 students per classroom, and annualized cost per student is US$55, which is more than double the cost
of BEEP school. From this comparison, the unit cost per school is lower in a short-term if a school design
of relatively short life was adopted; however, in a long-run, durable design of school is much more cost
effective.5

 The formula used for calculating the annualized cost is AC=[IC*k(1+k)^n]/[(1+k)^n-1]

 where AC= Annualized Cost, IC= Investment Cost, k=interest (discount)rate, n= useful life of investment (years)
 Assumptions: Interest rate of 10%
 Classrooms size for BEEP school is 63 students per year (actual)
 This assumes no maintenance cost, and construction cost after the life of investment.
 Life of investment is an assumption based on assessment of materials and site visits.
 For CDP school, the investment cost in the 2nd and 3rd cycle reflects the increase due to the interest rate.




revealed materials used for construction were cement rather than stones, and therefore, expected lifetime of the classroom is
shorter.

4If a cost of demolishing the old building is included, the cost will be higher.

5This does not include the benefit of walls, latrines, teachers' rooms etc. By considering these benefits in the BEEP schools, the
cost-effectiveness will be higher.

The survey analyzed the project's impact on enrollment and community participation in the target districts
and governorates, and reflected the beneficiaries' perception of the project.

II. Impact on enrollment

As shown in the Table (2) the number of enrolled children in the surveyed schools has increased by
44,949 or about 80.7%, number of boys enrolled in basic education has increased by 26,376 (70.8%) and
number of girls enrolled in basic education has increased by 18,799 (99.8%). This means that project
impact on basic education is very high, increasing enrollment of children in rural area would improve
development indicators related to education sector in the country.

Gender Gap

Enrollment relation male/female of school children has been investigated to indicate enrollment gap
before and after implementation of the project. Enrollment gap before the project, in average for all five
governorates, was 33.2% and decreased to 27.0% after the project, a reduction by 7.3%.

Beneficiaries

Interviewed persons were asked some general questions regarding number of beneficiaries, estimated
illiteracy rate among the community, unemployment situation and poverty conditions. Figures provided
by interviewed people indicate perception and concerns of rural people regarding illiteracy problems: how

The main characteristics of the communities who benefited from BEEP interventions in the five
governorates are indicating that 65,726 families benefited from the project. Total population who
benefited, as estimated by the communities themselves is 679,862, of this number 199,828 is in Sana'a
governorate, 236,015 in Amran governorate, 101,150 in Al-Mahwit governorate, 64,053 in Raymah
governorate and 78,816 in Ad-Dala'a governorate respectively. This means about 21.7% of the total
population in Sana'a; 26,9% in Amran; 20.4% in Al-Mahwit; 16.2% in Raymah; and 16.7% in Ad-Dala'a
directly or indirectly benefited from BEEP.

Perception of BEEP

Field survey has indicated that the implemented sub-projects are representing the first priority by 95.0%
of the benefiting communities in the governorates. Table (5) below explains the opinions of the
interviewed community members whether implemented sub-project was among the top priorities of the
community.

Community Participation mechanism

The mechanism used by BEEP Project was based on the approach initiated some years ago by the
ministry of education, the Fathers' and Mothers' Councils which actually limits community participation
to parents who are part of the local community. Since BEEP activities are in the field of education,
parents' or fathers' councils are the appropriate community organizations to deal with. Table (6) below is
providing information on number of Fathers' and Mothers' Councils established and/or developed by
BEEP to represent the community interest, create partnership relations with the Project, mobilize
community resources, and undertakes operation and maintenance responsibilities in a sustainable manner.
Fathers' and Mothers' Councils are established as according to the Ministerial Decree No (103) for the
year 2002, regarding implementation of the regulation for Fathers' and Mothers' Councils. This ministerial
decree has outlined in detail the regulations for functioning Fathers' and Mothers' Councils established in
the schools involving them in selection of sites for schools, provision of classrooms, maintenance of
buildings, furniture, and equipment, as well as broader functions related to the day-to-day running of
schools.

Total number of community organizations established in different schools targeted by BEEP interventions
in all 62 districts of the five surveyed governorates is 196 Councils which represent about 69.7% of the
total number of schools visited in the five governorates. There are 159 Fathers' Councils in the boys'
schools, and 37 Mothers Councils in the girls' schools which represent respectively 81.1% and 18.9% of
total number of Councils established in the five governorates. In the schools financed through BEEP
Project, most of the Fathers' Councils are still active and playing an important role in operation and
maintenance of the premises, this is because communities have been involved from the beginning, even
before final preparations for tendering and constructing took place. Participating communities have
contributed to share the cost of sub-project and are considering themselves as the owner of the activity
implemented. Total number of Fathers' and Mothers' Councils which are still operating in schools visited
by survey teams in the five governorates is 163 Councils which represent about 83.2% of total number of
councils established. Fathers' Councils still operating are 131 councils which are about 82.4% of total
Fathers' Councils established in the schools visited by survey enumerators. Mothers' Councils still
operating are 32 councils which are about 86.5% of total Mothers' Councils established in the girls'

schools in all districts visited by survey teams. Above figures are indicating that the operational Mothers
Councils are in the average more than the Fathers' Councils which shows how active and persistent are
the women, women have proved that they are more disciplined, better organized and insisting to succeed
even though the society is a men society.

Areas of community participation

Total number of communities who participated in the BEEP construction sub-projects in Sana'a
governorate is 48 about 67.6% of total communities visited by survey teams; 59 communities or about
70.2% in Amran; 40 communities or about 67.8% in Al-Mahwit; 23 communities or about 71.8% in
Raymah; and 26 communities or about 74.3% in Ad-Dala'a. In a society like Yemen, these participatory
results are very good, considering general conditions in the five targeted governorates in addition to the
social and economic difficulties prevailing in rural areas in the country.

 Inspecting of Project
 Completion



Due to the continuous interference on community affaires by different partners such as the local
authorities, the government officials and the stakeholders, community participation as described in the
Table (8) is not as effective as expected. Field survey has indicated that a significant number of
community projects, have unfortunately not been identified, selected and located by the benefiting
communities. In the project document it was clearly defined that local communities should be involved at
least in the three main activities related to the project preparations to be fully aware about implementation
process and being well informed to become able to properly perform the responsibilities for operation and
maintenance once the sub-projects handed over to the communities: (i) defining the sub-project needed by
the community based on school mapping and community priorities; (ii) identifying type and size of sub-
project and choosing of the project site; and (iii) being involved in the implementation process and
undertaking responsibilities in operation and maintenance of the completed facility. Field survey shows
that benefiting communities have not been fully involved because institutions and personalities have
sometime interfered and good-willingly took the role originally designated to the community.
Communities role was in the range between 30.0% and 70.0% of total decisions taken regarding these
three preparation activities. The parties that often interfere in community affaires are four; the schools'
headmasters, branch offices of the MOE, local councils as well as the Sheikhs and Akels. Table No (8)
below shows that the level of communities participation as an average for all five governorates is 54.1%
of all the cases in the communities visited by survey teams, in the area of project identification, and
56.0% in the area of choosing the project site.

Cost sharing

Despite the difficult living conditions of most of the families and very high poverty rates in rural areas in
Yemen, almost all communities have contributed to the cost of sub-projects. Few communities have
provided their contributions in-cash, the majority of the participating communities contributed in-kind
through the provision of stones, land, accommodation and food to contractor's engineers and workers,
and guards to watch machines, equipments and construction materials. This indicates how enthusiastic
were the communities to enroll their children in the new/extended/rehabilitated schools. Table (9) below
provides information regarding the different type of contributions delivered by the communities to share
the cost of the facilities implemented in their areas.

IV. Evaluation of BEEP performance by communities

Field data has indicated that communities are very satisfied with project performance; sub-projects have
been designed, contracted and implemented within a time record which didn't exceed several months.
More interesting is the distribution of sub-projects over the five target governorates and within the
districts that has been praised by people at all levels. Even the communities living at the remotest areas
with very difficult road connections have been reached by BEEP.

Communities were asked to rate both project and contractors performances. Sixty three or 32.1% of total
communities visited evaluated project performance as excellent; 73 or about 37.2% as very good; and 72
or about 37.1% as good. Six communities (3%) evaluated contractor performance as excellent; 14
communities (7.1%) as very good; and 95 communities (48.5%) as good. are of total communities
questioned. Contractor's performance was considered as bad by 44 communities (22.4%) and very bad by
31 communities (15.8%).

V. Community participation and sustainability

The issue of sustainability was a primary objective of community participation approach; it was the main
focus of BEEP Project since its inception and has been built into an adequate model incrementally during
the project course. The major elements of sustainability were envisaged to be:

· Clear partnership concept, joint ownership of implemented schemes and cost sharing between BEEP
Project and benefiting communities.

· Demand-driven community sub-projects, allocation and implementation of interventions have been in
response to local community demands.

· Affordable in-cash or in-kind contributions laid with some flexibility to accord to the various
economic conditions.

· Capacity of the Ministry of Education built to manage community participation through the newly
established community participation unit, district offices and training and human resources development.

· Capacity of local communities built through training, human resources development, regularly
monitoring and exchange of data and information.

· Ownership of the implemented activities by communities.

BEEP Project has started implementing activities in one governorate to test responses of local
communities to the modified involvement approach BEEP intends to apply. It has been noted that local
communities have accepted the new approach and expressed their willingness and readiness to fulfill
community commitments to the Project including the establishment of community organizations and
delivering contributions to share the project cost. Due to the positive community responses the Project has
extended its program to cover the originally targeted four governorates, at a latter stage.

Mobilization & Facilitation

Representatives from the CPU divisions in the provincial branch offices have been nominated to
participate in field visits to play a facilitator role. The community facilitators were sent to the field to
create trustful relationship with communities and start disseminating the community participation
concept. Communications with women by CPU representatives/facilitators was relatively limited due to
the customs and traditions but in some areas where girl's school/s did exist communications with women
living in the surrounding areas/sub-districts was established through either the female teachers or girls
studying in a secondary school or at the 9th class in the basic education. Field survey has indicated that in
many areas female teachers have encouraged Mothers to established Mothers' Councils most of which has
been found operational and held regularly meetings. Mothers' Councils are in several aspects much better
than the Fathers' Councils. BEEP has technically assisted community leaderships by providing a
multidimensional training program that followed the primary meetings and discussions and includes,
organizing and forming of community organizations, team and group work, financial and management of
community organization in a transparent way and operation and maintenance of community projects.
Table (11) shows the number and percentage of communities in each governorate who have benefited
from the project training program with fields of training.

depending on payments from the branch office of MOE and local council. In Amran there are 13 (22.0%)
communities who are fully responsible for operation and maintenance, 13 (22.0%) who do share cost with
the MOE, 21 (35.6%) who are relying on payments from MOE and 12 (20.4%) who didn't pay because
schools is new and has no operation and maintenance cost yet. In Al-Mahwit there are 11 (27.5%) who
are fully responsible, 5 (12.5%) who do share cost with MOE, 22 (55.0%) who are depending on
payments of the MOE and local council. In Raymah there are 7 (30.4%) who are fully responsible, 4
(17.4%) who do share cost with MOE, and 12 (52.2%) who are relying on payments from MOE and local
council. In Ad-Dala'a there are 12 (46.2%) who are fully responsible, 6 (23.1%) who do share cost with
the MOE, and 8 (31.7%) who are depending on payments from MOE and local council.

Challenges and constraints

Community participation is facing a number of challenges and constraints, some are related to poor
performance of communities due to limited experience in managing private and communally owned
enterprises, and many are related to mismanagement of the leadership. Social and cultural factors are still
playing a negative role, especially in rural and tribal areas with high illiteracy rate. Tribal and family
conflicts do spoil relations between members of the leadership and sometimes also between community
members. In areas where literacy rates high, the political disputes are reflected into the operations of the
leadership or the community as a whole.

BEEP cooperated mainly with Fathers' Councils as representing the participating communities, while in
some other governorates beneficiaries have formed their community participation committees, constituted
of parents, teachers and community members. Forming participation committees has certain advantages.
It involves both current and future parents. However, such committees need legal entity of their own, to
be able to deal with funds and continue to take responsibility for the school (and the community) in a
sustainable manner. The constitution of the Fathers' Councils is intrinsically gender- discriminatory
system because it is biased to the male's category (the fathers) who do dominate these councils, and
females (the mothers) are left out. It has been noticed that even the mixed schools have male councils;
mothers are not represented in those councils. Insufficient attention is paid to information on the
population eligible for education (ages 6 and above) and the barriers that delay enrolment, reporting
concerns only those enrolled, per class, late enrolment is common, but more so in rural areas than in
urban areas.

Poverty is also a major barrier to enrolment of boys and girls, not only in terms of direct and indirect costs
of schooling, (registration fees, uniform, books, pocket money etc) but also poor families need the time of
the children, boys and girls, to be spent on some income generating activities such as crops production,
livestock herding, selling goods on the streets, work in the labor market. If only some family members
can attend school because of poverty, boys take the priority. Most of the difficulties faced by community
organizations are created by local authorities and influential personalities, Sheikhs and parliament
members, who do interfere in the community affaires by identifying, selecting and locating community
projects without consulting the benefiting communities.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

Borrower's ICR

1. Overall Project Assessment

1.1 Objectives:
The Project Development Objective (PDO), aiming higher enrolment increase and improved access of
vulnerable groups, was appropriate and relevant at the time of project preparation because enrolment of
school children in the grades 1-6, especially girl's enrolment, in Yemen was lower compared to other
underdeveloped countries. While the construction of school facilities had made some good progress
immediately after implementation of the project, the government still needs to ensure that all school
children have access to basic education.

1.2 Design:
The simple and focused project design was extremely relevant when the capacity of the GEOs was still in
a flux. The strong emphasis on participation of parents' councils and community was also instrumental in
the education reform context of Yemen, where the enthusiasm and demand for education by communities
was relatively high. Requiring a minimum of small contributions to school cost by communities was an
effective way to increase their ownership. The project design included capacity building of school
masters/mistress, local education officials and local authorities in planning and prioritization of
development activities related to education sector.

1.3 Implementation:
As a result of discussions during the negotiations period, between the borrower and creditor (World
Bank/IDA & Government), management structure to be created to manage the project at different levels
has been designed and included in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD). This project was designed to
be implemented by MoE itself unlike all other previous World Bank projects, where the implementation
is the responsibility of a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) created for this purpose. Proposed
management structure was clearly defined and management functions have been properly divided
between different administration layers as follows:

Central level
At central level within the ministry of education, a Credit Administration Unit (CAU) has been
established to undertake the overall management of the project. CAU was headed by an executive
manager who reports directly to the Minister of Education. CAU and a Central Implementation Team
(CIT) that was composed of the Director Generals under MoE sectors, the technical office, and
representatives of the CPU are responsible for the overall implementation of the project at the central
level. CAU worked closely with the MoE Deputies of the sectors and concerned Director Generals in
coordinating project activities at the central and at the Governorate levels.

Steering Committee
The overall guidance, policy formulation and oversight the implementation of the authenticated project
strategies and plans was the responsibility of the Steering Committee (SC), which was established at
central level and Chaired by H.E. the Minister of Education; members of SC are the Deputies of the
Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation (MOPIC), the Ministry of Finance (MOF), the
Ministry of Civil Service (MOCS), and the Ministry of Education (MOE). The main responsibilities of
the Steering Committee (SC) were the setting up of policy guidelines and steer BEEP to ensure that
project objectives are achieved. SC was reviewing and approving annual project work plans and budgets.
SC was supposed to meet quarterly to discuss progress reports produced by the project and undertakes the
appropriate actions to alleviate any deviations occurred within the reporting period. CAU was supposed to


                                                       37

assist the SC to perform its functions. Steering Committee held about four meetings annually except in
2007.

Governorate level
Since, most of the project activities were implemented at Governorate level, An implementation team has
been established at each targeted Governorate. Governarate Implementation Team (GIT) was chaired by
the Director General of the Governorate Education Office (GEO). GIT members were three managers
representing the three sectors of the MoE, one representative from the Community Participation
Promotion Unit (CPPU) at Governorate level, in addition to GEO's manager for planning and statistics.
GIT in the Governorate was fully responsible for implementation of the ongoing activities in the
Governorate, as described under each of the three project components. District Education Offices, where
sub-projects were actually being implemented, are committed to provide the necessary assistance to the
GIT at governarate level. Director General of GEO who was the chairman of the GIT was liaised by the
Credit Administration Unit (CAU) based on project implementation matters.

District level
The District Education Offices (DEOs) headed by the District Education Officers, were responsible to
follow-up project implementation progress and report to the Implementation Team at the Governorate
level. The main tasks envisaged for DEOs were: (a) distribution of textbooks and teaching/learning
materials; (b) contributing to the selection of the teachers to attend training courses; and (c) provide the
required support to the Community Participation Activities.

Community level
MOE staff at Governorate and district levels were working side by side with the local communities on
identifying needs and priorities, selecting project locations, following-up construction works and over-
sighting the implementation of the operational strategies.

As it was the first time for MoE to take the responsibility of the implementation of the project, some
activities took longer implementation time than expected especially during the first couple of years. Delay
was also noticed, especially during the first year in the school construction, because it was the first time
for the MoE to involve beneficiaries in school site selection and construction supervision.

BEEP could have achieved a greater impact than it was at present if (i) BEEP annual work plans were
developed within a more integrative approach into MoE Plans; (ii) wider role for MoE technical office in
monitoring and evaluation of the project.

The overall performance is satisfactory for the following reasons. (i) First, one of the key PDOs is the
increase of girls enrolment rate in rural areas has been achieved, and most of the key performance
indicators also have been achieved. (ii) Sub-projects have considerably contributed to institutional
building in the sector, especially at the school level. (iii) BEEP has contributed to institutional changes,
including strengthening the foundation of the educational system through capacity building of school
headmasters/mistress, local education officers and local communities in planning and prioritization
decision-making, creation of functional communication and interaction between district offices and
schools management. These institutional changes and positive achievements are extremely important
outcomes for achieving the PDO and further development of the education system in the Republic of
Yemen.

2. Assessment of the outputs and outcomes
2.1 Major outputs and outcomes
All three project development indicators have been fully achieved and even exceeded the targets at the
closing date of the project. Details are as follows:


                                                     38

Increase GER of Girls in grades 1-6: Gross Enrolment Rate (GER) of girls has not only reached the
target (54%) but exceeded the target in all five targeted governorates; field survey has indicated that the
average increase is 78%, based on population projection from MoE (Feb. 2005) on the 1994 census.

Increase overall enrolment for school children in grades 1-6: The overall enrolment of school children
has increased by more than the targeted figure 30%, increase by the end of the project as average for all
five governorates was 48%.

Increase the girls share in total enrolment in grades 1-6: Girls share in total enrolment of school
children has been increased by more than the targeted figure of 60%, the increase realized for girls share
by the end of the project as average for all five governorates was 70%.

BEEP has contributed significantly to the provision of appropriate access and improving the learning
environments for grades 1-6 students especially in the remote rural areas through building new schools,
extending and rehabilitating existing schools. The Project has improved the teaching quality and teaching
environment and attracted school children to remain at schools to continue studying at higher educational
level through some activities which includes teacher training, provision of learning materials and
supporting regular supervision visits. It also contributed to build MoE capacity in planning and
implementation of education plans through a set of activities such as establishment of community
participation system, supporting technical assistance in development of MoE 5 years plan, supporting
Education Services, supporting monitoring and evaluation visits, Training of Governorates
Implementation Teams (GIT) and provision of equipments to GITs and laying out the foundation for MoE
EMIS.

The project has achieved its objectives and supported policy and institutional reforms that aim to expand
access to quality education in the first six grades in a sustainable manner.
The access component supported the implementation of: (a) the new policy for school site selection, which
should be based on school mapping and consultation with the benefiting community; (b) using of a cost-
effective standard design for constructing schools; and (c) efficiently utilizing of classrooms by gradually
increasing the double shift teaching system
The quality component supported: (a) new teaching/learning methodologies that have been introduced
with the revised education curricula for grades 1 ­ 6; (b) the associated introduction of in-service teachers
training; and (c) realistic and effective deployment of teachers to rural areas and liking remuneration with
work performance.
The capacity building component supported: (a) activating the community participation on different
activities related to development of basic education such as entirely involvement in project preparation
and implementation at central and governorate level, identifying type of school required, selecting the
school site, supervising the construction process; (b) gradually shifting of operational functions performed
by MoE central level to the governorate level including planning, implementation and monitoring of
education facilities; and (c) strengthening of planning and monitoring capacities by using annual work
programs to formulate and implement education projects.

2.2 Achievements and Outputs

It is evident that the project has exceeded the expectations on its performance indicators and fully met
outputs related to the development objectives, as follows:

Expansion of Access: 2,961 additional classrooms have been constructed and made available to school
children in the grades 1-6, the large part of these classrooms have been provided through the construction
of 497 new schools with 3 and 6 classrooms. All new constructed schools were adequately equipped with



                                                       39

furniture, sanitation facilities and boundary walls. 243 of the existing schools in rural areas have been
extended by constructing additional classrooms and facilitating them with sanitation facilities and
boundary walls where necessary. 183 of the old school buildings were rehabilitated and additional
faculties were also provided (these include teacher rooms, toilets and boundary walls) to improve
education environment, attract girl students and help retain students in general. The school selection is
based on the school mapping data and local community participation involvement in the intervention
processes. These interventions helped a lot to increase the number of children enrolled, including girls, in
basic education. The project has provided 96,630 additional places for new students and improved the
teaching and learning environments for more than 40,000 students. This makes the total number of
students benefiting from the construction part of this component to 136,630 students.

The project provided school maintenance kits to 2000 schools as well as developed, printed and
distributed two training manuals one for technicians and the other for teachers. The Training program on
routine maintenance was provided to more than 8000 headmasters, teachers and parent council members.
The Main impacts of this component can be summarized as follows:

         Increasing enrolment especially of girls.
         Improvement of learning environments.
         Out-reach the most under served communities.
         Building capacity at Governorates and district levels.
         Lowest unit cost for construction of schools.
         Increasing the efficiency of expenditure.
         Guarantee the operation of schools.
         Improving the school mapping.
         Community participation involvements
         Establishment of routine school maintenance system.

Quality Improvement: All new, extended and rehabilitated schools were supplied with basic education
facilities; adequate furniture, basic tools and teaching materials. The 136,630 student students in grades 1-
6 who are benefiting from project classrooms have received school kits, school bags with basic learning
materials. The 920 educational structures; new, extended and rehabilitated schools have been provided
with the required number of qualified teachers.

18,297 grades 1-3 teachers working in the five target Governorates have participated in a three part
training programs. 19,830 grades 1-6 teachers in the five target Governorates have participated in a
training program. 11,099 subject teachers have also received training in their areas of specialties. 342 lab
technicians have participated in a special training course. 621 supervisors and 3,270 headmasters/mistress
in the five Governorates have benefited from the 3-weeks specialized training courses in there areas of
specialties. All the training activities have been planed by MoE training sector and implemented
regionally under its supervision.

More than 90% of the five targeted Governorate schools have received regular supervision visits with
project support; at least three supervisory visits per year have been conducted.

The project has provided 500 schools with various learning resources which include about 200 titles
school library, demonstration labs and demonstration posters and maps as well as equipping 200 cluster
schools with audiovisual equipment to enhance there training facilities.

The project supported several teacher redeployment activities including workshops and filed visits,
however as this issue involves other ministries and local authorities only about 20% of teacher
redeployment plans were implemented. MoE has realized that a new approach to this issue has to be


                                                       40

developed benefiting from other countries experience. MoE has hired a consultant financed by the Basic
Education Development Project to help the ministry in this area and in this regard a decree was issued to
link new teacher posts to schools.

Main impact of this component may be summarized as follows:

        All project classrooms are provided with basic furniture.
        All students in the project schools received basic student kits.
        Planning of annual training programs were prepared by MoE.
        More than 90% of the targeted Governorates teachers, supervisors and headmasters/mistress
        participated in annual training.
        Improve the training capacity of MoE.
        Improve of the quality of rural basic schools.
        Difficulties of teacher redeployment are realized and more adequate measures will be introduced.

Capacity Building: A community participation mechanism was established, MoE staffs at Governorate
level were trained and several awareness activities were conducted. The contractual arrangements with
the benefiting communities were managed with an excellent manner, agreements were signed with the
community organizations through which roles and obligations of each partner as well as the participatory
conditions and value of the in cash and/or in kind contributions to be delivered by the benefiting
community have been clarified. Nearly 80% of Project schools have managed to ensure active community
participation in school management and in providing the routine maintenance to the project schools.
The quality of the annual education plans and follow-up reports have been improved; the level of
improvement realized through the BEEP was very good. Annual education surveys were supported and
the data provided by the survey were used by MoE and the donors to plan interventions such as BEDP
and FTI, however the quality of data collected and data analysis need to be improved. The project has
supported the establishment of MoE MIS infrastructure at the new MoE building and linking the MIS
center with the four Governorates. They include provision and installation of cables, routers, switches,
servers, PCs and other necessary equipments as well as basic software and training of the IT staff.

Involvement of Governorate Education Offices in the implementation of BEEP activities were significant
on the job training which helped in building their staff capacity in planning, finance, procurement and
monitoring and evaluation. The annually designed BEEP work plans were implemented with a
satisfactory performance.

The Main impacts of this component are:

        Introduction of community participation concept to all education projects.
        Community involvement in school site selection and their contribution with land and stones.
        Satisfactory annual plans and follow up reports.
        Laying down foundation for MoE EMIS and linking the MIS center with the four Governorates.
        Building GEO capacities in the project Governorates.
        Improved project management.

Annex (1) shows the monitoring key performance indicators for development objective and outputs, as
well as baseline, target for different BEEP activities and actual achieved outputs by the end of the project
(June 2006).

In general it can be concluded that targeted BEEP's outcomes have been satisfactorily achieved and
development objective has been fulfilled. Nevertheless, number of measures such as high rates of
population growth and inadequate number of available classrooms for the age group 1-6 need to be


                                                     41

reconsidered. Moreover, one should make it clear that improvement in this regard is a long-term process
and can not be easily achieved without MoE exerting continuous efforts and donors continues support and
cooperation.

3. Government Performance and lessons learned
3.1 Government performance

The main risks associated with education projects in Yemen relate to the potential project implementation
delays caused by: changes in the political and administrative leaderships, lack of incentives among MoE
staff related to low ownership of the project, cumbersome bureaucratic procedures among ministries
involved with project implementation, weak institutional and organizational capacity at all levels of
education management, and complicated designs of education projects.
This set of risks has been reduced by involving the MoE staff and other stakeholders in project
preparation, giving high priority to capacity building in the project design, making the project concept
simple, and keeping the implementation plan flexible. Involving MoE and other stakeholders in project
preparation has been realized by building the project concept on the ongoing efforts of MoE and other
concerned government agencies and donors, in particular, MoE staff have actively been involved in
designing program elements and were committed to preparation activities. Giving high priority to
capacity building in the project design, project preparation has helped MoE to clarify the organizational
framework, establish a policy framework for the next five years, and elaborate basic requirements for a
modernized education and financial management information system at central MoE and in some pilot
Governorates. The capacity building component of the project has further helped the MoE to utilize the
core capacity for annual education planning, budgeting, and monitoring. The project implementation plan
was developed in such a way to specify roles and functions in detail and drawing key stakeholders into
the implementation process. A Credit Administration Unit (CAU) has been established with limited core
functions, thus making the project concept simple to maximize ownership and participation at all levels.
The objectives of the project were kept simple and were accepted by all stakeholders as the highest sector
priority.

The Credit Administration Unit invited all targeted Governorates Education Officers to attend an
inception workshop held in the capital (Sana'a) to disseminate the BEEP activities and providing them
with copies of the Project Operating Manuals, including procedures and preconditions for financing
activities requested by local communities. This resulted in better cooperation with district officials,
particularly for the introduction of demand-driven approach. Stronger engagement of these key local
officials from the early stage of the project implementation has helped in smoother implementation.

It should be admitted that CAU and the Governorates Implementation Teams functioned well throughout
the project cycle because of the effective and responsive cooperation by the MoE staff at central, regional
and local levels on the one side and the procedural and political support of the Project Steering
Committee (PSC) (Chaired by H. E. the Minister) on the other. Management structure used by the project
has allowed successful operations, locating the CAU within MoE. This increased the participatory
interests of the MoE staff, created stronger ownership over the project and established a solid base for
cooperation with all the stakeholders. The CAU leadership, in closer coordination with MoE, was
committed and competent in implementing the project. The definition of the unit's roles and
responsibilities and the clarity of the relationship and tasks to be performed by the Education Offices
successfully contributed to the revitalization of project implementation.

Considering the limited current institutional and management capacity of MoE, the initial Geographic
target of the project has been the under-served districts in the five target Governorates with low
enrolments of girls in basic education. BEEP was designed to deal with three major constraints
contributing to the deprivation of thousands of school age children, mainly girls of receiving adequate


                                                      42

formal basic education in rural areas, and thereby negatively affecting the perspective of the young
generation in rural areas and the nation as a whole. The main criteria for selecting those Governorates as
target areas for the project intervention are the low enrolment rate of girls as indicated by educational
surveys and by the school mapping data.

Because of the successful implementation of the three project components and the positive impacts on
improvement of basic education in the target areas, in August 24, 2004; the International Development
Agency (IDA) signed a new credit agreement to co-finance the Basic Education Development Project that
started in 2005 and covers ten Governorates in the country.

Time Schedule: In June 2005 it was realized that there is a need for extending the Project closing date for
the following main reasons:

-        Completing of some ongoing or under processing activities especially in training.
-        The cut down in the implementation cost of some activities, particularly construction and
         training, and the change of the XDR exchange rate resulted in availability of some extra amounts.
-        Implementing of some additional activities to enhance the quality component. Those activities
         include: (i) provision of various learning recourses (such as libraries, labs and demonstration
         posters) to about 500 schools (ii) the provision of audiovisual aids to a number of cluster schools
         to support training activities (iii) implementing additional rehabilitation and extension of schools
         in the targeted Governorates.
-
As a result IDA agreed to extend the project closing date from June 30, 2006 to June 30, 2007.

3.2 Lessons learned

BEEP experience suggests that a simplified implementation arrangement is essential for smooth
implementation.

The new approach of implementing IDA project by which the line ministry, MoE, is the implementing
agency and PAU runs the accounts and provide technical assistant was a successful exercise and
increased the ownership remarkably. However it caused some delay and confusion in the first year,
especially for training activities.

Limiting the implementation to one Governorate in the first year of the project helped recognizing unseen
constrains and developing smother implementation mechanism. The gained experience during the first
year was a measure factor in improving the implementation mechanism and made the expansion to the
remaining Governorates much easier.

The strategy of involving MoE at center, Governorates and districts levels in implementing all aspects of
the Project has been a critical factor in assuring the success of the Project.

Involving targeted communities in school site selection and sharing part of the cost have a positive effect
on school operation and enrolment.

Advertising construction works locally and implementing new schools through GEOs reduced the
construction costs significantly and developed GEOs staff capacity in procurement, contract management
and works supervision.

BEEP could have achieved a greater impact than it was at present if (i) BEEP annual work plans were
developed within a more integrative approach into MoE Plans; (ii) wider role for MoE technical office in


                                                       43

monitoring and evaluation of the project.

4. Assessment of Bank Performance

The World Bank has contributed effectively in the preparation and identification period. IDA's visiting
and resident missions in collaboration with leading figures of concerned ministries have helped the
government in the implementation of BEEP. Those efforts contributed to the achievement of BEEP main
objectives in quite a satisfactory degree of performance, which ultimately resulted in notable impact on
current and future educational and development policies. However the appointment of a leading resident
mission member with little experience caused minor delays and confusion in the implementation of this
project and other education projects.

Through regular annual and mid-term reviews, IDA missions made their valuable contributions that eased
the implementation procedures and submitted important consultancies and advice to activate
implementation and improve performance. Decisions made by IDA missions as well as consultants were
positive and adequate and made good contributions to satisfactory achievements.

Support to Education Sector by Leading World Bank visiting officials in the last few years was decreased.
Education issues used to be on the top of the agenda of any Senior World Bank official visiting the
country. It helped MoE a lot in gaining more governmental and donors support.
