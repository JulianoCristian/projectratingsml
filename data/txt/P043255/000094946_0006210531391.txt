Basic Education Expansion Protect. (BEEP)
Environmental Management Plan (EMP)
This project involves the construction and rehabilitation of small rural schools (3-6 classrooms, with no laboratories); major negative
environmental impacts are not anticipated; therefore, the project is under category "B". Minor issues are expected and would be
monitored and mitigated from three project processes: (a) site selection; (b) standard design and specifications; and (c) construction. All
are under the Expansion of Access Component of the Project.
The site selection process itself would include criteria that would minimize some of the issues identified in the plan. Other issues in
connection with construction activities are treated with more detail in the plan. These relate to safety, proper disposal of debris from
construction sites, proper sewage, drainage, and sanitation services at the sites.

C. INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING
All the necessary precautions to avoid negative environmental impacts from the items identified are to be taken by the architects and
engineers in charge of building design and specifications. Site engineers would be employed to supervise the execution of the works and
ensure that they are in accordance with the designs developed and the specifications prescribed in the construction documents. These site
engineers would also ensure that contractors observe safe and environmentally sound practices in their execution of the contract,
including appropriate disposal of debris. Execution would be the responsibility of the contractors, who would be governed by the
Conditions of Contract (and the Building Code) which include many provisions dealing with safety and the environment. Therefore, no
institutional capacity building or training for MOE staff would be needed. However, environmental sensitization, particularly in regard
to health and hygiene, would be proposed whenever practical and feasible, through public awareness campaigns and training of teachers.
Page 9 of 10



D. SCHEDULE
Construction activities would be defined annually through the Annual Workplans. The school mapping process would be used for
selecting schools in accordance with the agreed criteria. Specific site characteristics and environmental issues would be identified in the
school mapping database and by the architectural consultants during the design stages of each plan. Therefore, activities on mitigation
and monitoring would be carried out throughout the project implementation period. Awareness raising would be undertaken by MOE
staff that would be involved in community participation activities, and school administrators to ensure that waste generated in schools is
properly controlled and disposed of in an environmentally acceptable manner.
