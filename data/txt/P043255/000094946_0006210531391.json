This environmental management\n            plan (EMP) addresses the processes criteria, and outlines\n            the following mitigation plan. Sites selection would avoid\n            natural vegetation areas, as well as flooding, and/or\n            earthquake prone sites. The standard school designs address\n            sanitation in particular, to include toilets, and\n            appropriate sanitary measures. Furthermore, the use of\n            asbestos would be barred, and, although the current scale of\n            asbestos use is unknown, existing buildings will be surveyed\n            in accordance with applicable laws for safety, and\n            environmental risks. Construction contracts would be\n            supervised by site engineers, to ensure adequate disposal of\n            debris, including toxic residues, oil spillage, and\n            hazardous chemicals. Existing lead-based paints will be\n            handled in an environmentally safe manner, and, in the\n            future, the use of lead-based paints will be discontinued.\n            Public awareness campaigns will address health, and hygiene issues."}, "docdt": "2000-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
