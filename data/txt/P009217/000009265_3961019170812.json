Some lessons learned\n            included:  the loan was successful in financing subprojects\n            for the purposes set out in the loan agreement relating to\n            energy conservation, environmental improvement and flood\n            damage repair. It was successful mainly because of the\n            commitment of the borrower to succeeding at its inherent\n            specialty of making and monitoring loans to industrial\n            borrowers. Giving eligibility to process change subprojects\n            as well as those limited solely to energy conservation,\n            substitution or environmental improvements also contributed\n            greatly to the project's success. As a commercial bank,\n            the borrower had the adaptability to adjust readily to\n            making sub loans for environmental improvements and flood\n            repairs after the demand for energy conservation loans fell."}, "docdt": "1995-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
