this Energy\n            Conservation and Substitution Project are: 1) to promote\n            energy efficiency in Yugoslavia's industry; 2) to\n            support the development of technical capabilities for energy\n            audit work in Yugoslavia; and, 3) to strengthen the\n            financial and institutional aspects of Ljubljanska Banka,\n            Ljubljana (LBL).  To this end, the project consists of a\n            line of credit to LBL to finance subprojects for (a) energy\n            conservation and substitution in industry; (b) energy\n            audits; (c) the domestic production of energy-saving\n            material or equipment; and the (d) development or expansion\n            of proven substitute local energy resources.  As part of the\n            project, technical assistance is  provided to: (a) technical\n            enterprises to promote the domestic capability in energy\n            auditing techniques and for consultancy services for energy\n            audits of more complex subprojects; and (b) to assist LBL in\n            upgrading its capabilities, with emphasis on investment\n            analyses, management information systems and supervision.\n            The  project will make a direct contribution towards\n            reducing energy imports in Yugoslavia, as well as improving\n            the competitiveness of the exporting beneficiary enterprises."}, "docdt": "1987-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
