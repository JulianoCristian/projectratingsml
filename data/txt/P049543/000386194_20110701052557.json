Ratings for the First Phase Road\n            Development Project for Uganda were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory, risk to development outcome\n            was high, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and\n            borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Ratings\n            for the Second Phase Road Development Project for Uganda\n            were as follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, risk\n            to development outcome was high, Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and borrower performance was\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: The\n            road agency model has provided sufficient institutional\n            capacity in low income countries such as Tanzania and Uganda\n            to improve the delivery of new main roads and their\n            maintenance. Supporting road funds can further enhance road\n            sub-sector reform provided they are properly designed and\n            adequately resourced. During road reform initiatives, the\n            borrower's absorptive capacity, the degree of\n            opposition to change and the time it takes to prepare and\n            adopt new legislation, have often been miscalculated by the\n            Bank and other development partners. The Bank thus needs to\n            ensure appropriate training and skills deployment to i)\n            assess and address the borrower's institutional and\n            absorptive capacity limitations; ii) gauge the degree of\n            resistance to change and make a plan to deal with it, and\n            iii) realistically estimate the time it takes to prepare,\n            adopt and apply new legislation. An annual assessment of the\n            condition and traffic usage of the roads in the network\n            enables the decision makers and the public to understand the\n            implications of greater or lesser funding."}, "docdt": "2011-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
