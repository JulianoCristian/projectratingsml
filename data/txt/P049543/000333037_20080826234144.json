Sector\n            Institutional Support Technical Assistance Project for\n            Uganda were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: Road Agency Formation Unit (RAFU)\n            was created as a default Project Implementation Unit (PIU)\n            and as a nucleus for the establishment of an autonomous road\n            authority and most of its salary and operational costs were\n            funded by the project. This was to mitigate the risks\n            related to sustainable government financing and to ensure\n            that the staff was well motivated to implement the costly\n            projects. However, it took long for government to prepare a\n            realistic budget to meet the requirements of Uganda National\n            Road Authority (UNRA) as the extended credit continued to\n            finance the salaries of RAFU. As such, this became a\n            disincentive for moving rapidly toward a government financed\n            road authority. The lesson is that the putting in place of a\n            PIU may be a disincentive for the implementation of\n            institutional reform. At project preparation, a set of good\n            outcome and impact indicators were designed, but no\n            framework was agreed to monitor project performance and as a\n            result no effective monitoring was carried out during\n            project implementation. Therefore to only design performance\n            indicators may not be enough unless a comprehensive\n            monitoring and assessment framework has been agreed upon\n            with all stakeholders at the project design stage. The\n            monitoring and assessment framework should include a time\n            based action plan to carry out baseline studies, regular\n            reviews of interim benchmarks, and a well coordinated\n            mechanism for evaluation and reporting of the project\n            performance at least biannually."}, "docdt": "2008-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
