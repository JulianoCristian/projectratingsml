need for ongoing road\n            maintenance, the environmental assessment considers the\n            potential environmental effects of the project on social,\n            cultural, and economic resources, in a two-volume report\n            covering the Katunguru - Kasese - Fort Portal Road, and\n            Kasese - Kilembe Road - Equator Road segments. Measures to\n            mitigate adversity are: To reduce the effects of road\n            widening, those works within road reserves, should be\n            conducted after harvest period, and, for those outside road\n            reserve, compensation should be granted to affected\n            landowners. As a result of earthworks, borrow pits will be\n            available for waste, and spoil disposal, in an effort to\n            reduce hydrological damage. Noise, dust, and safety risks\n            will be minimized by limiting working hours to daytime\n            schedules, enforcing control measures to reduce traffic\n            speed, and, securing access to pedestrians, and cyclists\n            through adequate traffic signals, and temporary diversions.\n            During construction, health facilities will be available\n            on-site, to ensure the well-being of local workforce, and\n            communities. Maintenance of drainage infrastructure will be\n            pursued, to avoid potential flooding of adjacent properties."}, "docdt": "2000-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
