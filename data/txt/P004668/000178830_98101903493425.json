Both highways form part of the arterial links\n            between Bangkok and the northern and northwestern regions of\n            Thailand and cross some of the most fertile agricultural\n            lands of the Central Plain. The project also includes the\n            detailed engineering of about 635 km of feeder roads\n            selected on the basis of the potential for agricultural\n            development in the service areas. Consulting services for\n            construction supervision and overseas training of Thai\n            technical staff from the Department of Highway are also\n            provided for in the project."}, "docdt": "1968-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
