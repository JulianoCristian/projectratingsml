These plants would be equipped for weighing,\n            receiving, drying, conditioning, cleaning, grading,\n            treating, bagging, labeling, quality control testing, and\n            storing seeds; (b) the expansion of storage facilities at\n            the four research stations responsible for providing breeder\n            seed and for producing basic and registered seed, to handle\n            an additional 500 tons. In addition, the Boliche,\n            Pichilingue, Portoviejo and Santa Catalina stations would\n            receive basic testing equipment; (c) the construction and/or\n            improvement of seed warehouses; (d) the provision of\n            additional personal, equipment and training; (e) the\n            establishment of a National Seeds Council (NSC) for national\n            policy regulation and coordination; and (f) the training of\n            personnel in different aspects of the industry, plus related\n            technical assistance."}, "docdt": "1976-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
