BOTSWANA
SECOND URBAN PROJECT
I. SECTOR BACKGROUND
Urban Growth and Distribution
1.01      Although Botswana's urban population remains small--94,000 in 1975--
its rate of urbanization has been one of the highest in the world. Before
independence in 1966, there were only two towns and a number of large vil-
lages. 1/ Since then the old towns have grown rapidly, a capital city has
been founded, and two other towns have been established at new mining sites.
In 1964, only 4% or 21,000 of Botswana's population lived in urban areas;
by 1971, the proportion was 9.5% (59,000) and by 1975, 14% (94,000). By
1986, under normal conditions, the urban population should have doubled
again to 186,000. If drought strikes the countryside, urban migration and
growth would exceed predictions.
1.02      Government policy recognizes that urbanization is a natural part
of development and could easily absorb most of the country's resources. The
Fourth National Development Plan states that the benefits of development
should be shared by all Batswana--the rural as well as the urban; the poor
as well as the rich; the northern region as well as the southern. To achieve
this balance, it has been decided that:
(a)  unlike rural development, urban housing and infrastruc-
ture will not be subsidized;
(b)  there will be an equivalency of urban and rural standards
in housing, infrastructure and community facilities; and
(c)  there will be a fair distribution of new industrial and
commercial development among the towns.
1.03      Achieving a distribution of new development among the towns should
be easier in Botswana than in many other countries. As shown in Table I-1,
the urban population has been fairly evenly distributed among four urban
towns. It is only recently that one center, Gaborone, has emerged as a
dominant focus of urban concentration and growth.
1/   Some villages have larger populations than the towns, but because they
have been oriented toward subsistence agriculture, they are officially
defined as rural. In recent years, some of these large villages have
gained a certain amount of formal industry and modern housing and infra-
structure; they are becoming more and more like the towns.

1.04      Each of Botswana's towns is oriented toward modern sector industry,
government or commerce. Two towns, Gaborone and Lobatse, are in southeast-
ern Botswana. Gaborone was established in the 1960s as the nation's capital.
Lobatse, a much older town, is the location of the Botswana Meat Commission.
Botswana's remaining three towns are in the northern region and have partici-
pated in the rapid expansion of its mining industry. Francistown has long
served as a center of communications and trade in the region. Selebi Phikwe
and Orapa 1/ were established to service the new copper-nickel and diamond
mines. Two World Bank Group projects, the Francistown Urban Development
Project (Credit 471-BT) and the Shashe Infrastructure Project (Loan 776-BT)
have assisted northern Botswana's major towns to establish, expand or improve
their urban services.
Urban Poverty
1.05      The chance of securing employment and a cash income is much better
in urban areas and acts as a strong attraction to the poorest rural dwellers,
particularly those with few or no cattle. Formal job creation cannot keep
pace with urban population increases, and greater numbers of urban residents
will be forced into unemployment or reliance on low-paying informal sector
jobs. Unemployment is high in urban areas: an estimated 18% of the male
and 55% of the female periurban 2/ area labor force are without work. In
comparison with many other developing countries, the informal sector is
small--less than 10% of the urban population engages in informal activity.
Several factors limit the viability of informal sector industries: Botswana's
long established dependence on South African imports, its membership in the
1/   Orapa has a population of 2,000.
2/   "Periurban" is a term used by the Government to refer to squatter settle-
ments or to planned areas in which traditional mud-and-thatch housing
predominates.

Southern Africa Customs Union, and the lack of a commercial tradition among
Batswana. However, studies have noted an upsurge of business aspiration
in the urban areas, and substantial growth potential exists in service and
repair industries, handicrafts, backyard manufacturing and vegetable gar-
dening.
1.06      Incomes are skewed in both rural and urban areas.  Botswana's
rapid economic growth has depended almost entirely on good beef prices and
the exploitation of mineral wealth, consequently cattle owners, miners, and
other employees in the formal sector have benefited most. This has tended
to widen the already large gap between rich and poor in both the towns and
rural areas. In 1976 the average annual income for citizen households in
urban areas ranged from P 1,140 ($1,368) in Lobatse to P 1,790 (US$2,148)
in Gaborone. The majority, however, earned much less. Median periurban
household income was P 550 (US$660) per year, less than 40% of the average,
and periurban households headed by women fared even worse. In Botswana
47,000 persons or 45% of the urban population fall in the category below
the urban poverty threshold of P 215 (US$258) per capita per annum. In
Francistown and Selebi Phikwe, of the estimated 46,000 population in 1977,
an estimated 21,000 were below the urban poverty threshold.
Government Response
1.07      In the early years of rapid urban migration, the Government assumed
that migrants would either become affluent enough to afford modern housing, 1/
or would return to rural villages. As no provision was made for housing the
urban poor, people constructed low quality mud-and-thatch huts in unplanned
and unserviced areas. By the early 1970s, the proliferation and size of
squatter settlements had become the biggest urban problem in Botswana. In
1975 they accommodated 27% of the population in Gaborone, 23% in Lobatse,
60% in Francistown and 40% in Selebi Phikwe.
1.08      In response, the Government started its first self-help housing
schemes during the 1973-78 planning period. Designed to a lower standard
than previous urban housing estates, these schemes catered to the growth of
lower income groups and were heavily subsidized, partly through concurrent
construction and sales of more expensive plots to higher income urban dwellers.
The Bank Group's First Urban Project, the Francistown Urban Development Proj-
ect financed in 1974, helped implement the new self-help housing program in
Francistown.
1.09      The Fourth National Development Plan, published in 1976, acknowl-
edges that, with little cross-subsidy available in the future, residents of
self-help areas will have to pay the full cost of developing and operating
such housing schemes. To enable the provision of services to the urban
poor, standards have been revised downward still further, and emphasis has
been placed on provision of the lowest standard settlement plot.
1/   Most modern houses are constructed by the Botswana Housing Corporation
(BHC), a parastatal affiliated with the Ministry of Local Government and
Lands (MLGL).



1.10      The Government recently conducted growth studies for each urban
center (except Orapa) in order to set five- and ten-year targets for new
housing development and upgrading of existing areas. These studies determined
that approximately 14,000 plots should be developed and upgraded within the
next five years, half of them to accommodate new growth. If the established
targets are met, all expected urban growth would be accommodated, and tenure
and upgrading to minimum standards would be provided to virtually all peri-
urban households.
1.11      Projects based on these requirements have been formulated for
British Overseas Development Ministry (ODM) financing in Lobatse, and United
States Agency for International Development (USAID) and Canadian International
Development Agency (CIDA) financing in Gaborone. The World Bank Second Urban
Project would be located in the two remaining towns. Both have large require-
ments for expansion and upgrading. By continuing to finance urban development
activities in these two towns, the Bank will reinforce its assistance for the
economic development of northern Botswana.
Francistown and the Francistown Urban Project
1.12      Francistown was established in the 1890s by a mining and trading
company (Tati Concession Mining and Exploration Ltd.) which owned most of the
land in and around the town until the early 1970s. Equipped with an airport
and located on the country's single rail line, Francistown is a natural growth
point for the mineral rich northern region. When the Government purchased
the land from the mining company, however, the town's structure was racially
segregated, its population poorly serviced, its potential commercial and
industrial employment limited by monopoly power. To improve conditions in
Francistown, substantial infrastructure had to be provided and a plan for
socially integrating the town had to be adopted. In 1973, an investment pro-
gram based on a town planning study was formulated. Under the first phase
(costing US$1.1 million), the ODM financed sewerage stabilization ponds, about
1,000 housing plots and some building materials loans and sanitation units.
The ODM project has been completed. The second phase (costing US$4.4 million)
was financed by IDA (Credit No. 471-BT) and included infrastructure to commer-
cial and industrial areas, to 1,800 site and services and traditional housing
plots, and to squatter areas affecting 1,000 households. In addition, it
improved the Central Business District (CBD) and provided primary infrastruc-
ture, community facilities, building materials loans and technical assistance.
The IDA project, now being successfully implemented, should be completed by
June 1979. Most of the IDA project plots have been allocated, and with the
help of building materials loans and informal sector craftsmen, many occupants
have built substantial, high quality houses in the site and service areas.
More important, the project represents the first successful efforts in con-
ducting extensive upgrading of squatter settlements in Botswana. An efficient
local housing department has been developed in Francistown, which has been
used to help train other town councils in self-help housing implementation.

1.13      Some problems arose during implementation of the Francistown Project.
All have been resolved or steps taken to prevent their recurrence, as follows:
(a) the issuance of the instrument of legal tenure had been delayed
in traditional and upgrading areas. This in turn hindered
the collection of monthly service charges in these areas.
Temporary occupancy permits have now been issued and collec-
tions recently begun. The Francistown Town Council (FTC) is
expected to collect monthly charges from at least 50% of the
households in these areas before the loan becomes effective
(para 8.03(b)). During negotiations the Government undertook to
cause FTC and Selebi Phikwe Town Council (SPTC) to ensure that
households in arrears in the project areas and the previous
project areas are reduced to 30% and 15% by March 1979 and
March 1980, respectively (para 8.02(f));
(b) the FTC failed to keep current financial records. Accounts were
recently brought up to date, and steps are being taken to assure
better record keeping in the future (para 6.01);
(c) income levels for beneficiaries were too narrowly defined.
As a result, a substantial group of people (those earning
between P 1,500 and P 2,500 per year) were excluded from
site and service housing because their incomes were too high
and from conventional housing because their incomes were too
low. In addition, traditional housing areas and site and
service areas tended to become segregated by income. This is
not in keeping with Government policy encouraging non-polarized
residential development. Beneficiary income requirements will
be modified in the second project (para 3.24);
(d) the aqua privy, a sanitation unit designed under the ODM project
and provided in the IDA project, proved to be socially unaccept-
able. Finding an acceptable alternative has not been easy.
A waterborne sewerage system is too expensive to install and uses
too much water to be practical in Botswana. Pit latrines cannot
be safely used over the long term on many sites due to poor
soakage conditions and the existence of rock near the surface.
Government has therefore decided to use a dry system in future
projects. The exact system to be used will be decided on the
basis of tests being carried out in a research project funded
by International Development Research Center of Canada (IDRC).
Research should be complete and a Government decision made by
December 1978 (para 4.15).
1.14      The Government has also decided that, although there has been no
community opposition to the Francistown project, future projects would be
improved by a greater degree of community participation. More communication,
feedback, and participation could lead to community improvements not possible
otherwise (para. 3.19). In addition, the Francistown project attempted to
recover only part of the costs of urban development. To assure the replic-
ability of future projects, Government has decided to eliminate housing
subsidies to beneficiaries (paras 3.23 and 8.02(b)). The forthcoming project
will reflect these improvements.



Selebi Phikwe and the Shashe Infrastructure Project
1.15      The Bank loan (Loan 776-BT) for the Shashe Infrastructure Project
co-financed infrastructure to support a copper-nickel mining complex at Selebi
Phikwe, a previously vacant site about 160 km from Francistown. The loan also
included funds for the construction of local government offices, commercial
and industrial sites, housing for Government and mine employees, roads, water
and electricity supply and reticulation, and community facilities. Although
housing estates were a part of the Shashe project, housing and services were
planned only for those in formal employment. No provision was made for the
many others who would be attracted by Selebi Phikwe's potential--those hope-
ful of finding formal employment or expecting to earn income in the informal
sector. As a result, an unplanned squatter settlement of 10,000 (40% of the
town's population) grew near the mine shaft about 4 km from the town proper.
This large squatter settlement, called Botshabelo (meaning "place of refuge"),
was legally incorporated into the town in 1975. While the Government and
the town council provided some bush-cleared tracks and a few standpipes to
the settlement and, with the assistance of the United Kingdom, supplied rudi-
mentary services to a large extension of the town proper, much of the work was
temporary and requires immediate upgrading. With an expected annual growth
rate of 9% through 1981, Selebi Phikwe has large requirements for expansion
of urban services, especially to the poor. Employment in Selebi Phikwe, par-
ticularly among women, is also a problem. The mine is the town's only major
employer; little other formal industry has chosen to settle there. Future
programs must seek to diversify its employment base, and encourage informal
manufacturing and trading.
II. PROJECT COMPONENTS, COST AND FINANCING
A. The Project
2.01      The proposed project is designed to increase the participation of
low-income people in the economic growth centered in the urban areas of north-
east Botswana. In accomplishing this task, it would reinforce and expand
the institutional arrangements of the Francistown project, and extend low-cost
residential development and upgrading to a second town, Selebi Phikwe. As
a result of experience gained in the first urban project, several important
changes would be introduced: (a) cost recovery of all allocable investment;
(b) concentration on existing squatter areas; (c) provision of settlement
plots rather than the more expensive site and services plots; (d) extension of
home improvement loans (building materials and sanitation units) to upgrading
and settlement areas; (e) stimulation of the use and development of indigenous
home construction techniques and materials; (f) special attention to the role
of women in development; and (g) fuller town council and community partici-
pation in planning and implementation.
2.02      In conjunction with this project, the Botswana Development Corpora-
tion (BDC) will on-lend to commercial banks US$1 million of an existing World
Bank loan (Loan 1019-BT) and provide a 50% credit risk guarantee to stimulate
lending to small-scale enterprises (Annex 1). While the program will have



7
no geographic restriction, some emphasis will be placed on assisting small-
scale enterprises located in Francistown and Selebi Phikwe. An estimated 150
loans in the two towns, averaging P 2,700 (US$3,240) each, will generate
approximately 375 permanent jobs. 1/
2.03      The proposed project will consist of the items in Table II-1.
Settlement Plots
2.04      Settlement plots are minimally serviced areas (Table IV-1) for very
low-income households, some newly arrived in town. Residents will be given
security of tenure. Water will be provided in advance of settlement with
other services to be provided as settlement occurs. With advance planning,
implementation of this approach could be phased to accommodate sudden, per-
haps unexpected influxes of people in the urban areas.
2.05      The settlement areas in Francistown will be in the Somerset East
Extension and in the Donga areas identified in the Francistown Growth Study,
published in 1977, as the most acceptable for future development of this
type. The sites are about 1.5 km from the CBD and Central Industrial Area.
The sites in Selebi Phikwe are on opposite sides of town. The Western Exten-
sion Area (areas S, T, U) has already been laid out and partly serviced. Bank
financing would permit its completion. The Southeastern Extension is a new
area between the main part of town and Botshabelo. Convenient to both the
CBD and the mine, the Southeastern Extension is virtually the only remaining
development area in Selebi Phikwe unaffected by air pollution from the mine
and by potential subsidence due to underground mine works. A typical settle-
ment plan is shown in Map IBRD 13216.
Squatter Upgrading
2.06      Security of tenure and physical upgrading (Table IV-1) will be
provided for all existing periurban areas of the two towns, with the excep-
tion of those parts of Francistown which were upgraded during the first Bank
Group urban project and given security of tenure, and plots which are flood
prone or otherwise unsuitable for upgrading. Households living on plots
unsuitable for upgrading will be encouraged to voluntarily resettle. Suf-
ficient settlement plots will be available for this purpose.
2.07      In Francistown the areas to be upgraded are known as Surveyed
Tati Town 2/, Tati West, Blue Town, Somerset East and Somerset West (1,948
plots in all); in Selebi Phikwe upgrading will encompass Botshabelo (2,000
plots). Planning of upgrading works will be done by town planners/engineers
working in cooperation with area residents elected by each community to serve
in its ward association. A typical upgrading plan is shown in Map IBRD 13217.
1/   The cost per job would be P 1,170 (US$1,400).  The target maximum invest-
ment for urban poverty group jobs is US$2,588 in 1977 prices.
2/   This is not a squatter area.

Low-Cost Sewered Plots
2.08      Low-cost sewered plots will be located in the Southeastern Exten-
sion of Selebi Phikwe. These plots will be smaller with narrower frontages
to allow connections at a moderate cost. Since primary infrastructure for
sewerage exists, the marginal cost of providing sewered plots is low. Low-
cost sewered plots have not been provided in Francistown because adequate
sewerage treatment capacity and off-site infrastructure are not in place.
Home Improvement Loans
2.09      Loans ranging from P 100 to P 670 (US$120-804) will be available
for the purchase of building materials for home improvement/construction and
sanitation units to about 5,000 households. A loan of P 100 will permit the
improvement of a traditional dwelling including good quality thatching.
A loan of P 600 will furnish materials for a three-room concrete block house,
or a complete traditional homesite with large good quality thatched dwellings,
patio and fencing. The additional P 70 loan will purchase materials necessary
for a sanitation unit (para 4.15). A loan will be available to all first and
second project beneficiaries who earn less than P 2,500 per year. 1/ The
amount of the loan will be determined after appraisal of the resident's
ability to repay.
2.10      Although an individual will be free to use the materials loan
to construct or improve a house of his own design, a variety of standard
plans will be available. An extensive opinion survey has already been done
in the two towns, and designs will be prepared reflecting local preferences.
A number of demonstration houses will be built, and plans will be further
modified on the basis of reactions from residents. Materials and plans for
good quality round huts as well as concrete block houses will be available.
Residents can choose to build in either style on all types of plots or in
the upgraded areas. Demonstration houses will be financed by the Government.
Community Facilities
2.11      Primary schools, clinics, health posts, and multipurpose community
centers, along with necessary furniture and equipment, will be provided in
the periurban and self-help housing areas to bring them to minimum national
standards. A determination of the number and placement of schools has been
based on an analysis of existing facilities and enrollment ratios in or near
periurban and self-help housing areas. In line with current national guide-
lines, each school will include 2 streams or 14-20 classrooms for standards
I-VII. Planned initially for 35 children per class, each classroom could
eventually service 45 children in one session or 90 children per day in two
sessions. The construction, placement and physical design of all primary
schools in Botswana are the responsibility of the Ministry of Local Govern-
1/   Residents of the first project site and services area would be eligible
for loans for sanitation units only as they have already received loans
for house construction.

ment and Lands (MLGL). In urban areas, maintenance and administration are
performed by town councils. Teachers are hired, paid and supervised by the
Ministry of Education.
2.12      Botswana has developed a low-cost health care system which empha-
sizes preventive health. The smallest units in the system, the health posts
and clinics, are located at the neighborhood level and run by town councils
in urban areas. Health posts are two-room buildings (para. 4.26) staffed on
a full-time basis by a family welfare educator (a low level health promoter
engaged in outreach activities), and visited regularly by clinic-based health
teams.  Health clinics are somewhat larger buildings (para 4.26) permanently
staffed by several nurses and family welfare educators. The regional medical
officer and other doctors attached to the hospital visit to supervise staff
and see a few patients. Clinics hold sessions for family planning, well-baby,
antenatal, postnatal, nutritional and curative health activities. Project
health clinics and health posts will be placed so that all periurban and
self-help housing scheme residents in the two towns will be within 2 km
walking distance.
2.13      Three multipurpose community centers, staffed by community and
social workers, will be used for a variety of activities including day care
centers, local meetings, extension courses, and recreational activities.
Local women are organizing inexpensive day care centers for children of
working mothers. They will use one or two rooms of each facility on a
regular basis.
Primary Infrastructure
2.14      Essential primary infrastructure will be included to meet the needs
of project beneficiaries in settlement and upgrading areas. In Francistown,
boreholes with associated mains and storage tanks will be constructed, and
electrical reticulation and roads will be extended to project areas. Only
minor extensions of infrastructure are required in Selebi Phikwe.
Low-Cost and Conventional Industrial and Commercial Sites
2.15      The project will include a new market, vending shelters, infrastruc-
ture for local and district commercial centers, and low-cost industrial areas
for small-scale entrepreneurs. It will service parts of the extensions to the
CBD and Central Industrial Area in Francistown, 1/ allowing business expansion
which should give employment to about 250 persons as well as revenue to the
Government and FTC. Adequate commercial and industrial sites already exist in
Selebi Phikwe.
1/   Land serviced under the first project has been taken up; the second
project's servicing of conventional commercial and industrial facilities
provides for 60% of the expected five-year demand.



- 11 -
2.16      Horticultural areas in the two towns will be provided to improve
nutritional food supplies. The Ministry of Agriculture will provide technical
assistance to plot holders.
2.17      Although designed to raise incomes and generate new employment
among the poor in general, these measures will be of special benefit to
women, the group which suffers from the highest urban unemployment rate.
They predominate among traders who will want to rent low-cost commercial
sites. Some preference will also be given to women and the poor in making
loans under the small-scale enterprise credit scheme (Annex 1, para 10).
Studies
2.18      Several studies will provide the basis for innovations and new
institutions in the urban sector:
2.19      Project studies are as follows:  (a) The Ministry of Finance and
Development Planning will oversee a study to assist the Government in adopting
a coherent strategy and policies for the development of small-scale enter-
prises; (b) The Ministry of Health would carry out a simple base line and
follow up survey and analysis of health/nutrition status among periurban
residents. Periurban dwellers have less access than rural residents to the
proper quantity and quality of food, and there is evidence from analysis of
clinic statistics that a large number of periurban children are undernourished.
The study will provide a basis for evaluating the project's health impact and
could provide information for the design of new health/nutritional initiatives
and program modifications. These studies will be financed wholly by the
Government (para 8.01(c)).
2.20      Two other studies are being undertaken outside the project by the
Ministry of Finance and Development Planning: (a) a review of housing policy
throughout Botswana, including design standards, implementation procedures,
financing for community facilities and services (including the feasibility
of imposing rates in periurban areas), and the level of Government involvement;
and (b) a review of the potential role of financial institutions in providing
housing loans to all income groups. The Ministry is keeping the Bank informed
on the progress of these studies.

B. Cost Estimates
2.21      The total project cost excluding land acquisition 1/ is estimated
at P 10.43 million (US$12.52 million) of which 55% is in foreign exchange
cost. A summary of the cost of the project is given in Table II-2. Francis-
town and Selebi Phikwe cost estimates are given in Table II-3. These costs
include taxes and duties estimated at P 0.98 million (US$1.18 million).

urban project adjusted for inflation and local conditions. The costs of
primary schools reflect a reduction in standard from facilities provided in
the Francistown project. The design and costs of primary schools may be
further modified on completion of the national needs assessment (para. 4.25).
The Housing Department costs are based on an estimate of manpower and facili-
ties needed to implement the project. Physical contingencies are estimated at
15% for all items except home improvement loans, materials stores, vehicles,
and technical assistance. Price contingencies are based on an inflation rate
of 12% in 1978, 11% in 1979, 10% for 1980-82. These are based on estimates of
inflation in Botswana and its neighboring countries, particularly South Africa
from which it imports most goods and services. Price contingencies come to
16.3% of the project cost.
C. Financing
Financing Plan
2.23      The proposed Bank loan of US$8 million will finance the full foreign
exchange cost of US$6.9 million of the proposed project, as well as US$1.1
million in local costs, and will have a term of 20 years, including 5 years
of grace, at an interest rate of 7.5% per annum. The Government will assume
the foreign exchange risk on the proposed loan, and will make the Pula equi-
valent available to the town councils and participating agencies. Looking
forward, the financing requirements of the town councils and utilities during
the 1978-82 period total US$16.6 million. This amount includes the investment
costs of the proposed project of US$12.5 million, current expenditures of
US$0.5 million and debt service of US$1.3 million. Other works in addition
to the proposed project total US$1 million, while debt service applicable to
investments in prior years equal US$1.2 million.
2.24      About 14% of the financing requirements will be met from the general
revenues of the towns, 10% will be financed by the ultimate beneficiary in the
form of cost recovery, while 18% will be contributed as a grant from the
Central Government. In addition, 10% will be loaned by the Central Government
under terms and conditions as described in paras 6.09-6.18, and 48% will be
financed out of the proceeds of the Bank loan. Table II-4 summarizes the cost
of the proposed project, the additional funds required during the period of
execution, and the sources of the funds.

III.  EXECUTING AGENCIES AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT
A. The Ministry of Local Government and Lands (MLGL)
3.01      In accordance with practices in the first urban project, the prin-
cipal executing agency will be the MLGL. Organized to oversee urban and
rural physical and community development and to supervise the activities of
town and district councils, the MLGL has a professional staff of approximately
50 persons divided among 6 divisions and several supporting units.
3.02      The most important project role will be played by the Division of
Urban Affairs and Housing, established under the first urban project and
headed by the Undersecretary of Urban Affairs and Housing. The Division's
regular program includes four major responsibilities: urban development,
coordination of self-help housing schemes, development and administration of



- 16 -
town councils, and urban land allocation. Day-to-day implementation of the
first urban project is done by a project coordinator attached to this division.
3.03      For the second urban project a Project Coordination Unit (PCU) has
been established to represent the Ministry in the day-to-day implementation of
the project. It will be staffed by an urban development coordinator and one
assistant and further supported part time by the Division of Urban Affairs'
Low Cost Housing Officer, the Town and Regional Planning Department, and the
Division of Social and Community Development. Secretarial and accounting help
will be provided as needed. During negotiations assurances were obtained that
the procedures, powers and responsibilities of the PCU shall be satisfactory
to the Bank (para 8.01(a)).
3.04      The PCU's specific responsibilities will be as follows:  (a) liaison
and coordination with other Government departments, parastatals, town councils,
consultants and contractors; (b) tendering, evaluation of bids, award of
contracts, and management and control of project funds; 1/ and (c) progress
reports and project monitoring. A unit representative will keep town councils
fully informed on all technical, financial and administrative matters pertain-
ing to the project.
3.05      Due to severe shortages of suitably qualified and experienced man-
power, the project coordinator, who has already been appointed, is an expa-
triate. His qualifications and experience are satisfactory to the Bank. The
assistant coordinator, however, will be a Botswana national, and one of the
functions of the project coordinator will be to train the assistant in all
aspects of implementation. Staff for the PCU will be appointed by the MLGL.
During negotiations assurances were obtained that the qualifications and
experience of the project coordinator will continue to be satisfactory to
the Bank.
3.06      The Low-Cost Housing Officer will have special project functions
in three areas: the demonstration house study (para 2.10); the design of
community facilities (in conjunction with the architectural staff of the two
town councils) and the oversight of technical assistance in construction
of houses under the project. In the demonstration house project he will
organize, oversee, and evaluate the construction of about 20 prototype basic
houses in the two towns. As a part of this exercise, he will, with assistance
of town councils, train a team of workers from the squatter communities in
labor-intensive construction techniques using both traditional and modern
materials. 2/ At the end of the demonstration project, he will evaluate the
prototype house experience and recommend house building techniques, design
standards, and approaches to small-scale entrepreneurship for informal sector
contractors. An ongoing training program would be established. The prototype
houses are being financed by Government, outside the project.
1/   Except for water and power infrastructure (para 3.16).
2/   At least 30% of the trainees for construction in modern materials will
be women.



- 17 -
3.07      The Division of Social and Community Development will provide tech-
nical assistance for the training and oversight of a group of urban extension
workers concerned with promoting community participation and self-help in the
second project's periurban settlements. They will also assist in monitoring
the project.
3.08      The Town and Regional Planning Department will approve the over-
all planning of all areas under the project.
3.09      The Unified Local Government Service, a department of MLGL, in line
with its regular responsibilities will assign implementation and maintenance
staff to the local councils and will assure that all staff are properly
trained (para 8.01 (b)).
B. Francistown and Selebi Phikwe Town Councils
3.10      Local government functions are performed in urban areas by town coun-
cils, acting under the administrative supervision of a town clerk appointed
by Central Government. Although some policy guidelines are initiated through
town councilors, a majority of whom are elected by neighborhood constituen-
cies, Central Government circumscribes council functions, approves council
budgets, and requires an audit of annual accounts by a government-appointed
auditor.
Housing Departments
3.11      In the first urban project, a Self-Help Housing Agency (SHHA) was
established in Francistown to receive applications for plots, manage building
materials loans, and assist plot holders in house construction. The SHHA now
has efficient teams in project areas, its staff has been completely localized,
and its relations with councilors and the community have been good. SHHA has
recently been merged with several other entities and renamed the "Housing
Department." Its role under the second project will be reinforced and expanded.
3.12      The Selebi Phikwe Housing Department is much smaller.  To date its
efforts have been directed toward developing temporary emergency services to
a rapidly growing urban population. Because of its large role and its small
staff, it has not been able to assist with house construction or liaise with
community residents. Under the second project, the Central Government will
be held responsible for the construction of infrastructure, and the Selebi
Phikwe Housing Department will concentrate on plot and loan allocations,
community liaison, and house construction assistance.
3.13      Under the second project, teams with two types of skill--community
development and construction--will be assigned on a rotating basis to settle-
ment, upgrading and low-cost sewered areas. Each project area team will
be headed by a ward officer who will report to the director of the Housing
Department. Contact with the Central Government will be maintained by the
coordinator and the assistant coordinator resident in the two towns.



- 18 -
3.14      Responsible for most non-engineering aspects of the housing program,
the Housing Departments' teams will: (a) provide full information on the
program to residents of upgrading areas and applicants for new plots; (b)
liaise with ward associations to promote community participation in upgrading;
(c) resettle households displaced from upgrading areas; (d) advise the town
management board on the allocation of housing plots and low cost commercial/
industrial sites in project areas (para 3.21); (e) administer the building
materials loan program; (f) provide technical advice for housing construction;
and (g) collect information on problems encountered by area residents and act
to provide remedies and/or recommend program improvements.
Other Departments
3.15      Several other council departments will be involved in implementa-
tion, operation or maintenance of project facilities as part of their normal
responsibilities. Their role is summarized in Table III-1.

C. Botswana Power Corporation (BPC) and Water Utilities Corporation (WUC)
3.16      The WUC and BPC, parastatal agencies of Government, will supervise
the installation of all water and electrical infrastructure. In addition they
will maintain and operate all facilities. During project implementation, these
parastatals will manage their own consultants and contractors, but will
provide regular progress reports and accounts to the PCU.



- 19 -
3.17      The WUC and BPC are already legally designated authorities for the
supply and sales of water and electricity in Selebi Phikwe. The FTC, however,
now manages operation and maintenance for water and electricity supply within
its boundaries. The BPC and WUC are scheduled to take over these operations
in April 1, 1979, and October 1, 1979, respectively (para 8.01(g)) Negoti-
ations are under way between the FTC and the utilities corporations for the
takeover, and the BPC has begun to study the Francistown network in order to
assess revenue losses and recommend improvements in the maintenance of the
utility.
D. Details of Project Management
Community Participation
3.18      A recent sociological survey conducted in the two towns indicated
that many participants were not aware of implementation procedures and
specific design features in advance. Government and town council staff
have not concentrated on community participation in planning, and neighbor-
hoods have generally not organized themselves. Most people in town are still
loyal primarily to their home villages and have not developed strong ties to
their urban neighborhoods. There are traditional institutions for democratic
decision-making in the villages, but the urban ward associations, elected
at meetings modeled after traditional village meetings, have not usually
been very active.
3.19      More effort will be focused on community participation in this
project.  Although preliminary layouts and engineering designs for upgrading
areas have already been prepared from aerial photographs, the final placement
of roads, standpipes and other facilities can only be decided after on-site
consultation between the residents and members of the Housing Department's
ward staff. Basic options for providing services will be explained--both
orally and by staking--well in advance of construction. Residents and members
of Ward Associations will then be asked for their suggestions concerning the
placement of physical facilities and other aspects of the upgrading process.
In order to facilitate self-help improvements, information about the exact
placement of public facilities will be disseminated to all households involved
as soon as the final decisions are made.
Resettlement
3.20      Only 200 households in Francistown and 250 in Selebi Phikwe will
have to be resettled (11% of the households to be upgraded), the minimum
necessary to allow for infrastructure and other facilities. These households
will be given a choice of new plots, most of them in the same neighborhood
as their existing house. Compensation will be paid to households so dis-
placed and the Housing Department will provide free transportation of house-
hold effects and materials salvaged from vacated homes (para 8.02(d)). A
greater community voice in the placement of improvements should help minimize
individual and community resistance to essential resettlement.



- 20 -
Allocation Procedures
3.21       Plots and house improvement loans in both towns will be allocated
according to the procedures established during the Francistown project.
Applications for loans will usually be made at the same time as applications
for plots. Applications will be accepted by ward officers and assistants
in the Housing Department of each town. The Housing Department will review
applications and forward its recommendations to the management board of
the town for final decision. Each town's management board will consist of
councilors, members of the town council's staff, and a representative of the
PCU.
3.22       Allocation criteria are different from those developed during the
first project. In the first project households with annual income below
P 300 were allocated traditional plots while households with an income of
P 300-P 1,500 were allocated site and services plots. Since residential
development was subsidized, especially for traditional plots, these means
tests had to be enforced to make sure that the subsidies went to the target
income group. Further, it was expected that households in the site and
services area would build concrete houses using building materials loans,
while households in the traditional area would build traditional houses.
An undesirable effect of this division of applicants into two groups was a
segregation of housing areas by income and type.
3.23       In this project housing subsidies will be eliminated, house improve-
ment loans will be available to upgrading, settlement and low-cost sewered
plots and traditional-style house construction will be encouraged in all
project areas.
3.24       To qualify for a plot and/or a home improvement loan, an applicant
should have a household income at least five 1/ times the amount of the
monthly charge for which he will be liable, but less than P 3,500 2/ per year
(para 1.13 (c)). He will have to be registered for local government tax,
be at least 18 years old, and if he is not a Motswana, show proof of being
legally resident in the country. There will be no minimum residency require-
ment in either town. Among applicants who meet these minimum criteria,
priority will be given to households displaced by project infrastructure or
which live in squatter areas that cannot be upgraded. Households with annual
income of less than P 1,500 will have higher priority than those with higher
incomes. Households with incomes of P 2,500-P 3,500 will be given lowest
priority and will be further limited to a maximum number of 250 plots (10% of
new plots being developed). The inclusion of this higher income group is a
pilot program which Government specifically requested for this project.
During negotiations GOB undertook that it would cause FTC and SPTC to esta-
blish beneficiary selection criteria satisfactory to the Bank (para 8.02(a)).
1/   This would be flexibly applied to take account of special circumstances.
2/   Households with income between P 2,500 - 3,500 per year will not be
eligible for home improvement loans as they have access to other sources
of finance.



- 21 -
3.25      The extension of the income limits for beneficiaries will assure
that all households in the two towns will qualify for some type of housing --
either conventional or self-help. In addition, the inclusion of the P 2,500-
P 3,500 income category will (a) provide an overlap between self-help housing
and conventional housing schemes, (b) encourage people to move toward self-
help site and service type of housing, (c) encourage social and economic
integration in the towns (para 1.13(c)), and (d) facilitate the Government's
decision to phase out its program of providing subsidized housing for higher
income families.
Technical Advice
3.26      The recent survey of self-help housing residents found that very
few houses are actually built by the owners. Most householders hire small
contractors. Housing Department construction experts will advise owners
and contractors on building techniques and might suggest alternative designs
or features for various housing types. The Housing Department will also
help occupants manage hired contractors and provide sample contract forms
(as requested) which protect the interests of both parties.
3.27      Building control regulations which have been applied to site and
services, settlement, and periurban areas, are more appropriate to European
cities than to conditions in Botswana. To promote local solutions to local
conditions, and preserve the architectural heritage of rural and established
periurban areas, building regulations will be amended for the second project
(para 4.28). These amended regulations should be much easier to enforce. In
line with their regular implementation responsibilities, construction foremen
attached to field teams will assure that all construction in project areas
is in accordance with amended regulations.
Tenure
3.28      Tenure in upgrading and settlement areas will be initially granted
to the occupant by a renewable Temporary Occupancy Permit guaranteeing occu-
pancy for an indefinite period provided monthly charges are paid and the land
is not required for public purposes. This permit will be replaced by a
Certificate of Rights, once plots have been formally demarcated and drawings
approved by the Department of Surveys and Lands. Both the permit and certi-
ficate give the council power to enforce all conditions of occupancy. They
have been accepted as adequate security by periurban and site and services
residents and have been shown to stimulate investment. Improvements may be
sub-letted or sold with council approval to families meeting income and other
requirements of the development areas (para 8.02(c)). The Temporary Occupancy
Permit will be issued as part of the upgrading process in upgrading areas and
provided at the time of settlement in new development areas.
3.29      Land tenure on low-cost sewered plots in Selebi Phikwe will also
be granted by a Certificate of Rights, but occupants will have the option of
purchasing fixed period grant titles from the Government.

IV.  DESIGN STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS
A. Planning Background
Francist own
4.01      The planning for Francistown is based on the assumption that the
town will grow from 23,221 in 1975 to 44,300-54,400 in 1986. The variation
of 10,000 population in the target year allows for a variable rate of growth
depending on employment opportunities and the future role of the town as a
major rail head.
4.02      Existing major constraints are the railway and its surrounding
areas, the airport, and the sewerage ponds. Flood prone areas, quarry work-
ings and poor soil conditions (black cotton) present further constraints.
4.03      Future development areas for the short- and long-term lie in the
southeast sector--Donga, Somerset Extension, Golf Course, Satellite and
Satellite Extension and South of the River (Map IBRD 13214). These areas
have sufficient land to meet the demands of the next ten years.
Selebi Phikwe
4.04      The town is expected to grow from 20,572 in 1975 to 46,000 by 1986.
The long-term growth strategy despite specific constraints permitted three
possible development thrusts east, west and to the south. However, the
feasibility of the first two was conditional on a change in the restrictions
imposed by the ore body and the pollution from the ore smelting plant of the
mine. The third constraint was the proposed ore haulage route which would
limit the eastern expansion of the town and would effectively further isolate
the squatter settlement of Botshabelo from the town proper. Although this
would be against Government's stated planning policy of integrating the low-
income areas with the overall urban structure it could not be avoided. The
strategy now adopted is to develop Botshabelo as a somewhat independent
settlement.
4.05      These constraints left areas to the south and southeast where
development in the next ten years could be realistically considered and
accommodated. (Map IBRD 13215).
B. Planning Standards
4.06      The National Development Plan recommends a plot size of 500-800 m
for settlement plots and 300-500 m  for low-cost sewered plots.  In early



- 23 -
1977, a rigorous appraisal of development costs and affordability resulted
in reduction of plot sizes. Settlement plots were reduced to 420 m2 and
low-cost sewered plots to 330 m2. As a consequence, long-term land require-
ments were considerably reduced. The guidelines for planning were to insure
maximum efficiency of land use, yielding approximately 60% of the site for
residential use.
C. Project Sites
Francistown
4.07       Upgrading will affect the existing squatter settlement of Somerset
East and Somerset West, Tati West, Blue Town and the existing planned area of
surveyed Tati Town. New settlement plots will be provided in the Somerset East
Extension and in the Donga area (Map IBRD 13214). Existing areas have plot
sizes ranging from 350-600 m2, but new areas are designed to have plots of 420 m2.
Selebi Phikwe
4.08       Upgrading will affect the existing settlement of Botshabelo, and
existing surveyed and partly settled areas S, T and U. A new development
area, South East Extension, will provide 446 non-settlement plots and 287 low-
cost on sewered plots. Existing areas have plots varying from 500-600 m2.
New development will have plot sizes of 420 m2 for settlement areas and
330 m2 for the low-cost sewered areas.
D. Infrastructure Standards
4.09       The second urban project implements part of the requirements recom-
mended in the five- and ten-year growth studies for Francistown and Selebi
Phikwe. Within the growth studies, standards proposed for the towns vary in
density and income groups served by residential areas, and meet industrial
and commercial requirements as needed. Table IV-1 summarizes infrastructure
standards within different areas. Items marked with footnote /a will be
included in the second urban project.
4.10       In designing the project, present conditions and capacity of the
urban services were assessed and engineering works required to meet the
additional requirements worked out. The problem was to provide shelter and
services to households with incomes of less than P 200 (US$240) per month,
comprising 60% of the total population, at affordable cost and to assure full
cost recovery of allocable investment. Therefore, most of the designs are low
cost, but upgradable in the future.
Roads and Surface Water Drainage
4.11       Each site will have a network of major urban road (external access),
distributor road, local (collector) access roads, culs-de-sac and pedestrian
paths.

4.12      Road Widths.  Standards are minimal to accommodate expected traffic
volumes, composition and speed. Road widths range from 4 m for culs-de-sac
to 7 m for distributor roads. Footpaths are 2 m wide.
4.13      Draiiiage.  The drainage system integrated with the roads is designed
to carry storm water and domestic waste water other than sewage. The system
is designed to cater for a 15-year storm frequency for major urban and dis-
tributor roads and 5-year for local (collector), access and culs-de-sac.
Water Supply
4.14      Potable water will be supplied for all households.  Settlement and
upgrading plots will be served through a system of standpipes. The system
allows 50% upgrading to individual connections. Fully serviced low-cost plots
will have individual connections. Based on an examination of actual water
consumption in different housing areas, water systems have been designed for
22 liters per capita per day in the settlement and upgraded areas, and 84
liters per capita per day in the low-cost areas.
Sanitation System
4.15      The Government with the assistance of International Development
Research Center of Canada (IDRC) has been carrying out research into a system
of domestic sanitation which is inexpensive and affordable by the majority
of the population, efficient in operation, hygienic and socially acceptable.
This research is almost complete and prototypes are being built and moni-
tored. Preliminary conclusions to date are that two types of latrine are
likely to be used in the upgrading and settlement areas: (a) pit latrines,
and (b) the Reed's Odorless Earth Closet (ROEC). Although these conclusions
can be challenged because of the short period of monitoring, they have been
used to cost the project. Final Government decision on the type/types of
sanitation system to be used is expected by December 1978. In Selebi Phikwe,
287 low-cost sewered plots will be provided, since excess capacity exists.
4.16      Solid Waste Disposal.  In accordance with the usual practice, each
town council will be responsible for providing the necessary dustbins and
collection services which are paid for through service charges.
Power Supply
4.17      Initially, street lighting will be confined to distributor and
local (collector) roads in the upgrading and settlement areas, except S, T
and U areas of Selebi Phikwe as off-site power supply is not available.
Primary Infrastructure
4.18      Francistown Water.  At present water is provided from3nine bore-
holes. The total capacity of the existing boreholes is 3,530 m /day. In
1976 th5 estimated total average demand (including losses) was estimated at
2,252 m /day with peik demand at 4,054. T8e demand for 1981 and i986 is
estimated at 4,01 m /day average (7,220 m /day peak) and 5,675 m /day
average (10,215 m /day peak), respectively.



- 26 -
4.19      To meet the additional requirement, four unused boreholes were
investigated. Three boreholes showed positive results. With additional
water from these boreholes requirements up to 1984 would be met. The cost
of tapping these boreholes, including pumping, associated mains and storage,
has been included in this project. However, the Government, with the assis-
tance of the African Development Bank, is currently carrying out a study
for the overall water requirements of the north-eastern region, with special
reference to Francistown. If the result of the study shows that it is more
economical to provide water from other sources before 1984, this would be
accomplished by the Government outside the project. During negotiations, the
Government agreed to furnish to the Bank, by June 1, 1979, a plan of action
to ensure that an adequate long-term water supply is made available to
Francistown (para 8.01 (f)).
4.20      Francistown Electricity.  The main supply line is from Selebi Phikwe.
An analysis of the present consumption and future demand gives the following
conclusions: (a) the present supply line from Selebi Phikwe should be ade-
quate until at least 1983. Duplication of the line or an alternative supply
line will be required sometime between 1983-1990; (b) the high voltage
(11 Kv) feeder to Francistown will need to be duplicated before 1981 to meet
increasing demand. Cost of this work has been included in the project and
will cater for future maximum demand up to 1986.
4.21      Francistown Roads.  The existing road system is generally adequate.
However, short links will be provided to Donga, Somerset West and Somerset
East to connect these areas to major urban and trunk roads.
4.22      Selebi Phikwe Primary Infrastructure.  This town is about ten years
old and has more than adequate capacity to meet the requirements of the next
five years for roads, water, sewerage and electricity. Minor extension of
water supply infrastructure is required to meet the needs of settlement areas
of S, T and U, the Southeast Extension and Botshabelo.
E. Community Facilities
Primary Schools
4.23      The number of primary schools to be constructed in the project is
based on national planning standards, adjusted to reflect realistic enroll-
ment ratios of 80-90%.
4.24      Children in the upgrading areas of Francistown are well served
by existing primary schools. Planning for new primary schools, therefore,
focused on the first and second project new development areas. In Selebi
Phikwe, there are only two existing standard primary schools, both in the
center of town, and one under construction in Botshabelo. The project's
primary schools will correct the deficiencies in the upgrading and S, T,
and U areas, and provide a standard school in the Southeastern Extension.
4.25      Project schools will be equivalent in standard to those recently
provided in the rural and other urban areas of Botswana. Costs have been



- 27 -
based on the average costs of constructing schools in other areas, adjusted
for local conditions. Should Botswana decide to establish a nine-year basic
education cycle, 1/ project school design will be modified to accommodate
more classes. The anticipated additional costs have been included in the
project.
Health Facilities
4.26      Health posts, in line with national prototypes, will be two-room
buildings (examination room and waiting room), with a cover d waiting area
outside.  The total size of the building will be under 59 m . Health clinics
will be somewhat lar er buildings of approximately 120 m  with a covered
waiting area of 95 m . The first project's health clinics had five rooms,
including a rather large waiting area permitting health education activities,
one or two examination/treatment rooms, a kitchen, and small storeroom/dis-
pensary. In the second project there will be only minor changes in the
design of clinics, perhaps to provide an office for the staff and a bigger
storeroom for World Food Program stores. These changes will not substan-
tially affect costs. Preliminary designs should be completed by late-1978.
F. Housing Design
4.27      During preparation of this project an evaluation of the self-help
housing program financed under the first project was carried out. 2/ As a
result, recommendations were made for improving the quality and responsive-
ness of the housing design and shelter program to meet specific social needs
of the lower income group. As well constructed traditional housing can be
built for about 50% of the cost of modern housing, distinct advantages were
to be gained for the urban poor in improving access to affordable and appro-
priate shelters.
4.28      The issues identified in the Housing Study are currently being
investigated as part of the demonstration housing project in each town.
Feedback would be used in designing appropriate plans for the second urban
project. Residents, however, will be free to build in any style they choose.
This demonstration project will also review building and development codes
as an input to the new codes now under review. Prototype designs under
consideration are shown in Drawings 18630-18631.
4.29      The preservation and development of traditional construction tech-
niques, the encouragement of use of local materials, and assistance to the
informal sector construction industry will result in substantial economies.
1/   Currently Botswana has a seven-year basic education cycle.  The GOB is,
however, studying the feasibility of establishing a nine-year cycle.
A decision will be made after a national needs assessment study is
completed in 1978.
2/   Housing study prepared for the Ministry of Local Government and Lands,
September 1977.



- 28 -
Reliance on informal sector contractors and traditional materials will also
reduce the capital/labor ratio for housing construction, providing jobs for
more low-income workers. The project will improve local technologies, demon-
strate the viability of local materials, and upgrade local skills.
V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Implementation
5.01      The project will take about four years to complete including con-
struction of self-help housing with the aid of materials loans. Consequently,
the project closing date will be December 1982. The implementation schedule
is shown in Chart V-1.
B. Procurement
5.02      The Division of Urban Affairs and Housing in the MLGL, through the
Project Coordinator, will invite and evaluate bids and award contracts in
accordance with Bank Guidelines for Procurement. 1/ Contracts for civil works
totaling P 3.1 (US$3.7) million and building works totaling P 1.7 (US$2.0)
million including contingencies will be awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding.  To the extent possible, contracts will be grouped in
such a way that a contractor can bid for each group separately or for the
total package. Because of the relatively small size and staging of the
contracts, they will be advertised locally with notification to the embassies
of Bank member countries and Switzerland. Advertisement will also be placed
in the Development Forum. These works are not likely to attract any foreign
contractors, particularly as the domestic contracting industry has adequate
capacity to efficiently execute similar works. Evaluation of the building
and construction industry in Botswana shows that it has adequate capacity to
meet all planned construction works, both Government and private.2/
5.03      Works amounting to P 0.25 (US$0.3) million including contingencies
consisting mainly of road construction in some squatter areas will be carried
out by councils by force account. Upgrading works have to accommodate com-
munity participation and resettlement of families displaced by infrastructure.
Because they are subject to intermittent stoppages, they can be carried out
more economically by councils. Selebi Phikwe has an efficient roads depart-
ment and in the past carried out similar works satisfactorily. Francistown
has ordered new equipment recently for maintenance and wishes to build capac-
ity for carrying out small improvement works by force account. Councils will
be allowed to construct these roads only if they have adequate staff and
1/   Except for water and power infrastructure (para 3.16).

equipment to do the work economically and without detriment to their normal
work and maintenance. Consultants will supervise force account construction.
In Selebi Phikwe, water infrastructure amounting to P 0.7 (US$0.84) million
will be designed and constructed by the WUC. WUC has the necessary capacity
and has carried out similar works in the past satisfactorily. Cost estimates
for force account work are based on contract prices. Equipment amounting
to P 146,000 (US$175,000) will be procured after local competitive bidding.
5.04      Home improvement loans for self-help housing and sanitation units
are valued at P 3.3 (US$4.0) million including contingencies, over 50% of
which is for bricks, cement, sand and roofing thatch. The delivery rate for
these materials must be closely coordinated with the rate of construction of
self-help houses in approximately 15 locations over a period of three years.
To avoid storing materials for long periods with resultant cost and problems
of pilferage, it is proposed to procure these materials from local sources
after competitive bidding. Local bidding and procurement procedures are
satisfactory to the Bank. Procurement procedures to be employed in this
project are similar to those being used satisfactorily in the Francistown
project.
C. Disbursement
5.05      The Bank will disburse:  64% of the total cost of civil works, com-
munity facilities and building materials; 100% of the foreign cost or 75%
the total cost of equipment and vehicles; 100% of the foreign cost or 64% of
the total cost of technical assistance including consultancy services. Dis-
bursements will be fully documented. However, disbursements for civil works
carried out by force account and for project unit operations, will be made
against certificates of expenditure certified by the Project Coordinator. The
documentation for these items will not be submitted to the Bank for review
but will be retained by the Borrower and made available for inspection by
the Bank during the course of project supervision. An estimated schedule of
disbursement is shown in Table V-I. Any undisbursed funds at the closing date
of December 31, 1982)will be canceled unless the Bank agrees to reallocation
for additional project-related expenditure.
D. Monitoring and Evaluation
5.06      The Project Coordinator, assisted by staff in the PCU and town
councils, will have overall responsibility for monitoring and evaluation.
Monitoring and evaluation includes the observation, analysis, and reporting
of project implementation tasks and effects. Within this broad definition,
the project will contain three levels of monitoring/evaluation.
5.07      The first level will involve the collection of modest statistical
data on routine implementation tasks including design, tendering, costs, con-
struction, allocations, housing consolidation and occupancy and cost recovery.
This data, along with a short description, will be provided in quarterly
reports.



- 30 -
5.08      The second level will provide information and analyses on aspects
of the project which are relatively new to Botswana, as follows:
(a) the degree of community participation in planning and
implementing upgrading schemes;
(b) the adequacy of training and overall contribution of
community development workers to the upgrading process;
(c) the changing position of opportunities for women under
the project vis-a-vis formal and informal employment;
(d) the acceptance, output, nutritional value and income
enhancement of the horticultural areas;
(e) the quality, quantity, construction method and design of
houses within project areas;
(f) the demand for, adequacy, administration and collection
of house improvement loans;
(g) the acceptability of and demand for different types of
sanitation units provided in the project; and
(h) progress on training staff, and filling management posi-
tions with qualified Batswana.
5.09      The third level of monitoring/evaluation will go beyond the obser-
vation of project effects to analyses and consideration of matters of national
policy. These aspects are treated as "studies" (paras 2.18 to 2.20) on hous-
ing policy, finance, health/nutrition and small business. These studies will
be carried out by the appropriate agencies, but the Project Coordinator will
briefly describe their progress in quarterly reports.
E. Supervision
5.10      Overall supervision of the project on behalf of the Government will
be the responsibility of the PCU in the MLGL. Consultants will be appointed
to design and supervise the construction of all infrastructure works. 1/ Con-
struction of house improvements will be supervised by the PCU with the assis-
tance of the Low-Cost Housing Officer and the Housing Departments of the two
town councils. Monitoring of these components will be carried out by the PCU.
5.11      Supervision of all studies will be the responsibility of the Minis-
try of Finance. The Ministry of Health will supervise the base line survey
and analysis of health and nutritional status in the periurban area.
1/   Except water infrastructure in Selebi Phikwe, which will be designed
and constructed by WUC (para 5.03).

VI. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Municipal Finance
Administrative Capacity
6.01      The accounting practices and procedures for both town councils,
Francistown and Selebi Phikwe, are considered inadequate and need to be
strengthened. Timely information through the accounting system is almost
nonexistent, budget controls are weak, and there is no reliable analysis
of the data. The Government recognizes this problem, and together with the
United Nations Development Program (UNDP), has completed a national study of
accounting and secretarial staff. This study will form the basis of a train-
ing program aimed at upgrading the administrative capacity of the towns. The
program will consist of upgrading the accounting system to provide for the
separation of costs by department and by specific work functions within each
department. Budget controls and financial forecasting will be introduced,
so that the councils will be able to evaluate more effectively the various
financial alternatives available to them. The program will be accomplished by
more effective utilization of existing expertise available within the country,
and will be implemented simultaneously during the execution of the project.
Assurances were obtained during loan negotiations that the town councils will
institute a management information and budgetary control system satisfactory
to the Bank, and will provide adequate staff to operate the system, and submit
unaudited financial statements within 6 months and audited within 12 months of
the end of each fiscal year (para 8.02 (e)).
Past Finances - Consolidated Overview
6.02      The town councils over the last few years have always achieved a
cash operating surplus, although more recently these surpluses have been
diminishing. The cash surpluses have resulted in a comfortable liquidity
position, and as shown in Table VI-1, as of March 31, 1977, Francistown had
P 245,000, or about 11% of total assets in cash and investments. Selebi
Phikwe, on the other hand, had over 50% of its total assets, or about
P 743,000, invested in cash and investments.
6.03      Unlike Selebi Phikwe, Francistown owns and operates the water and
power utilities. Both undertakings have sustained poor financial performance
in the past, and, in fact, water and power lost P 51,000 and P 115,000, respec-
tively, during 1977. The combined loss for 1978 is expected to be P 112,000.
The poor financial performance mainly resulted from a failure to implement
timely and adequate tariff increases. The town council recognized this and
has already implemented, effective April 30, 1978, a 50% increase for water
and 65% for electricity. The Government has indicated that both undertakings
will be transferred to the national utility companies in 1979 (para 8.01 (g)).
The terms and conditions of the transfer are currently being negotiated, and
it is expected that they will be finalized in late 1978. The utility com-
panies have a competent management team and a track record of profitability.

Future Finances--Consolidated Overview
6.04      The rate of urban growth during the past ten years has been rapid,
averaging nearly 12% per year. This rapid development has been accompanied
by a real increase in the services provided to the total population, but more
particularly to the lower-income groups. The increase in public expenditure
generated by this development is beginning to erode the financial viability
of the towns. As shown in Table VI-2, which is an extract from Annex 2, both
Francistown and Selebi Phikwe are forecasting an accumulated deficit during
the 1979-82 commitment period of P 673,000 and P 969,000, respectively.

6.05      The sharpest increase in public expenditure is likely to occur
during the 1978/79 fiscal year. This year coincides with the commencement
of a major portion of the debt service on the loans used to finance previous
expansions, as well as general salary increases which are scheduled to go
into effect throughout the country. Also included in the estimated deficits
for the commitment period are net expenditures as a result of the proposed
project. These total P 63,000 and P 27,000 respectively for Francistown and
Selebi Phikwe. Annual net recurrent expenditures subsequent to the commitment
period 1983 and therafter would be about P 40,000 for Francistown and P 14,000
for Selebi-Phikwe. It is unlikely, however, that a liquidity crisis would
occur before 1980, since both towns have accumulated substantial cash re-
serves.
6.06      Originally, the town councils had thought that the additional costs
associated with the increased levels of service could be cross-subsidized by
the higher income groups. The effect of the cross-subsidy through property
taxes paid is, however, diminishing as a result of the increasing proportion
of low-cost plots to the high- and medium-cost plots. Charges in the self-
help housing areas are being more than doubled in real terms when compared
to what others are now paying for similar services. That alone leaves little
scope for additional charges to improve the financial prospects of the town
councils.



- 36 -
6.07      The town councils have three major sources of revenue:  (a) property
rates; (b) local government taxes; and (c) miscellaneous service charges. In
the case of Francistown ratable property values are depressed mostly because
of the political situation in neighboring countries. In Selebi Phikwe the
future level of mine production is uncertain. About 67% of the town's prop-
erty rates are obtained from properties owned by the mining company. There-
fore, it appears that apart from small increases in the property rates of
the two towns to offset inflation, there is little possibility for increases
in real terms. Local government taxes function in much the same way as the
old colonial poll tax, where each head of household pays a maximum of P 84 per
year. The tax is deducted at source by the employer and remitted to the town
councils, but since most workers are already paying the legal maximum, there
is little scope for additional revenues.
6.08      Clearly the problem is structural, and given that in the near future
the towns will require increased resources from higher government levels,
either through expanded revenue authority or expanded transfers, it is obvious
that urban fiscal reform is needed. In this connection, several discussions
were held with the appropriate officials. The Government adopted several re-
form proposals which it submitted to the Bank prior to loan negotiations and
agreement was reached on the particular policy packages that will be imple-
mented simultaneously with the project. These include:
(a)  that the local government tax deducted from all Central
Government employees and Botswana nationals working in South
Africa be pooled, and that part of these funds be distributed
to the councils when there is reasonable cause to believe
that recurrent revenues would be inadequate to meet budget
expenditures. The Government has reached agreement with the
appropriate agencies in South Africa to deduct the tax at
source and remit it directly to the Government. The total
amount of these additional revenues is expected to exceed
P 1.5 million per annum, which would be more than adequate to
offset the annual deficits of the town councils. Assurances
were also obtained during loan negotiations that in light of
the councils overall financial situation, the Government will
take or cause to be taken whatever other steps are necessary
to ensure the financial viability of the councils (para 8.01
(e));
(b)  that (i) property taxes and (ii) capital development levies in
lieu of property taxes, be adjusted on an annual basis by an
amount at least equal to the rate of inflation;
(c)  that local government tax be increased by an amount at least equal
to the rate of inflation; and
(d)  that cost sharing formulas for specific social programs such
as health, community and educational services be modified so
that the Central Government would finance a larger proportion
of the costs.

B. Cost Recovery
Introduction
6.09       In the past, the Government has subsidized housing and services to
low-income urban households. Former self-help housing schemes recovered only
a small part of costs at interest rates of 3-4% per year. The Francistown
Urban Development Project was an improvement in this regard, recovering
building materials loans at an interest rate of 8% and operating and main-
tenance costs of urban infrastructure. This project would be the first in
Botswana to recover all allocable investment costs for housing and
infrastructure from thie ultimate beneficiaries.
6.10       A substantial portion of the total project investment costs of
P 10.4 million would be recovered from the ultimate beneficiary. As shown by
the figures in Table VI-3, these components will total P 7.6 million or 73%
of the total costs while P 0.8 million or 8% will be recovered through the
general revenues of the town and P 2.0 million or 19% will be financed by the
Central Government on a non-reimbursable basis.

6.11      The local share of recurrent expenditures associated with collec-
tions, operation of the schools, clinics, health posts and community centers
will be financed from the general revenues of the towns (para 6.05). The
current expenditures of operating the housing department will be recovered
from the ultimate beneficiary as part of the service charge.
6.12      The Government will assume the foreign exchange risk on the pro-
posed Bank loan, and will make the pula equivalent available to the town
councils. Details of the cost recovery mechanisms are outlined below.
Site Preparation
6.13      The component will cost about P 1.7 million including contingencies
of which 81% or P 1.4 million represents the allocable investment costs, all of
which would be recovered from the ultimate beneficiary. The component will be
financed and the costs recovered in the following manner:
(a) P 1.7 million will be on-lent by the Government to the
town councils to cover 100% of the investments, which
are estimated to be P 0.9 million in on-site water
infrastructure, P 0.4 million in on-site power infra-
structure and P 0.4 million in roads and earthworks.
These loans will have a term of 25 years including
2 years of grace at an annual interest rate of 8%:
(b) the design and construction of water and power infra-
structure will be carried out through the utility cor-
poration (paras 5.02-5.03).
(c) 81% of the cost of the component represents the allocable
investment costs, all of which will be recovered from the
ultimate beneficiary by the town council in the form of
a capital development levy, amortized over 25 years with
no grace period at 8.25%; while 19% of the cost of the
component will be recovered from the general revenues
of the town councils in the form of debt service on the
government loan.
Home Improvement Loans
6.14      The component will cost about P 3.5 million in credits for home
improvement loans, materials stores and equipment, and will be financed and
the costs recovered in the following manner:
(a) P 3.5 million will be on-lent by the Government to the
town councils, in pulas, to cover 100% of the invest-
ment in loans, and will have a term of 15 years with
no grace period at an annual interest rate of 8%; and
(b) the investment cost of P 3.5 million will be recovered
from the ultimate beneficiaries over 15 years with no
grace period at a slightly higher interest rate of 9%
which is required to cover handling costs.



- 39 -
Primary Infrastructure
6.15      The component will cost about P 1.5 million, of which investment
in off-site water and electricity infrastructure will account for P 1.1 mil-
lion. Primary roads and refuse vehicles will account for the balance of
P 0.4 million. The component will be financed and the costs recovered in
the following manner:
(a)  P 0.9 million will be on-lent by the Government to the WUC and
P 0.2 million to the BPC, to cover 100% of the investments in
off-site water and electricity infrastructure, while P 0.4
million will be on-lent by the Government to the town councils,
to cover 100% of the investments in the primary roads and
refuse vehicles. The off-site infrastructure loans will have
a term of 25 years including 2 years of grace at an annual
interest rate of 8%. The loan for primary roads will have the
same terms except for an interest rate of 1%, while the loan
for refuse vehicles will have a term of ten years with no grace
period and an annual interest rate of 8%;
(b)  the investment cost of P 1.1 million in off-site water and
power infrastructure will be amortized with the same interest
rate and repayment terms as the government loan and will be
recovered through tariffs, except in the case of water sold
in bulk to the town councils for redistribution to standpipe
users, the cost of which will be recovered from the ultimate
beneficiary through a service charge; and
(c)  the investment cost of P 0.4 million in roads and refuse
vehicle investment costs will be recovered from the
general revenues of the towns in the form of debt service,
and will be amortized with the same interest rates and
repayment terms as the loan to the councils.
Community Facilities
6.16      The component will cost about P 1.7 million and will be financed on
a non-reimbursable basis through the national budget.
Commercial and Industrial Facilities
6.17      The component will cost about P 0.9 million, and will consist of
P 0.4 million in investments for salable fixed period grants and P 0.5 million
in investments for rentals. The component will be financed and the costs
recovered in the following manner:
(a)  P 0.4 million will be retained at the national level to cover
100% of the cost of extensions to the CBD and Central Industrial
Area of Francistown, while P 0.5 million will be on-lent to the
town councils, with a term of 25 years including 2 years of
grace and an annual interest rate of 8%;



- 40 -
(b) the Department of Survey and Lands will recover the investment
cost in the CBD and Central Industrial Area of Francistown
through the sale of 50-year fixed period grant titles for cash
at cost plus 25%, the profits on which would be retained by the
Central Government;
(c) the town councils will rent the low-cost commercial, industrial,
and horticultural areas, recovering 125% of costs, amortized
over ten years at 8.25% interest, through rental payments.
Technical Assistance Subproject
6.18      The component will cost about P 1.1 million to meet the cost of
housing departments, engineering and the PCU. The component will be financed
and the costs recovered in the following manner:
(a) P 0.4 million will be on-lent by the Government to the town
councils, to cover 100% of the engineering costs during the
1979/82 commitment period, and will have a term of 25 years
including 2 years of grace at an annual interest rate of
8% while the balance, P 0.7 million, will be financed by
a Government grant; and
(b) the engineering costs will be recovered from the ultimate
beneficiaries as part of development levy, and will be amor-
tized over 25 years with no grace period at an annual interest
rate of 8.25%.
C. Affordability
6.19      The design standards of the proposed project are quite modest,
and this has been reflected in the relatively low unit costs of various
plots. In Francistown, the average cost of a settlement/upgraded plot is
estimated at P 211 (US$253) and in Selebi Phikwe it is estimated at P 171
(US$205). The cost of a low-cost sewered plot is estimated at P 824 (US$989).
All costs are as of 1980 and include contingencies, engineering and super-
vision. Monthly charges reflect these low costs and are given in Table
VI-4.

/b   Includes expenditure for water, electricity, roads, current Housing Department
costs, and refuse collection.
/c   Assumes P 200 for settlement plots and P 600 for low-cost sewered plots.
6.20      Household budget data supplied by the Government indicates that
households with incomes below P 60 per month are willing to pay 15% of their
income for shelter and services and those with incomes above P 60 per month
20%. Based on this information, which is considered reasonable, the minimum
charge for upgraded and settlement plots are affordable by approximately 90%
of the residents of the two towns. In the case of Francistown, the maximum
monthly charge will be affordable to all residents except those in the low-
est three deciles, while the minimum monthly charge will be affordable to
all except those in the bottom two. On the other hand, in Selebi Phikwe,
the maximum monthly charge for upgraded and settlement plots will be afford-
able to all residents except those in the bottom decile, while the minimum
monthly charge will be affordable to nearly everyone. The low-cost sewered
plots will be affordable to all residents except those in the bottom four
deciles. Incomes are higher in Selebi Phikwe because it is a relatively new
mining town, the population consists mostly of people in their prime earning
years, and the miners earn above average salaries. The estimated monthly
household income and the average affordable monthly payment for each decile
are shown in the figures below:

D. Replicability
6.21      The proposed project will service all upgradable periurban settle-
ments in Francistown and Selebi Phikwe. The Government also plans to upgrade
2,780 periurban plots in the other two towns, Gaborone and Lobatse, during
the next five years. This will, as much as possible, eliminate the backlog
of unserviced squatter settlements. An estimated 1,160 urban plots throughout
Botswana will still be unserviced, nearly all of them flood-prone or other-
wise unsuitable for further investment. These households will be encouraged
to relocate in newly developed settlement areas.
6.22      The proposed project will provide settlement plots adequate to
cater for 60% of the estimated requirements of Francistown and Selebi Phikwe
over a five-year period. The Government intends to provide for the remainder
from its own resources and to accommodate the requirements of the other towns
with assistance from bilateral aid programs. Adequate housing for the upper
income levels is also planned. Further, the Ministry of Finance is undertaking
studies to rationalize housing policy nationwide and to investigate the pos-
sibility of establishing a housing credit institution that would service all
income groups. The project will demonstrate the feasibility of providing
affordable services to low-income neighborhoods and recovering costs.
VII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. Economic Benefits
7.01      The project will provide for the expansion of Botswana's major
mining and commercial towns, redirecting public investment to the greater
benefit of low-income people. The project will benefit about 7,700 house-
holds, 60% of the 1980 population of both towns. The impact of major com-
ponents will be as follows:



- 43 -

and community facilities    6,500 /a                   51

/a   All unimproved periurban neighborhoods and about 60% of the expected
growth in low- and middle-income population.
/b   Includes approximately 1,200 households which are not being provided
with basic urban services in this project.
/c   A rough estimate including project administration and construction,
self-help housing, the small-scale enterprise credit program, and
employment at work sites to be serviced in the project. A job is
defined as 15 man-years of employment. Nearly all these jobs would
benefit households served by the housing components of the project.
7.02      The policy improvements which the project will introduce--cost
recovery, the beginnings of a mortgage system for all income groups, and the
encouragement of indigenous building materials and techniques in urban areas--
will outlast the project itself and help Botswana cope with its exceptionally
rapid rate of urbanization.
B. Rates of Return
7.03      The issuance of security of tenure is expected to release consider-
able pent-up demand for self-help investment in housing. Households have
demonstrated their willingness to resettle in planned areas voluntarily and
without compensation in order to get more security of tenure. The minimum
cost of resettlement is P 200, so the value of security of tenure for 6,500
plots is estimated at at least P 1.3 (US$1.6) million.
7.04      Benefits from investment in residential development have been esti-
mated on the basis of rental values. Botswana's economy is not fully mone-
tized, renting an entire plot is uncommon, and government and mine housing
is heavily subsidized. Market values for housing and environmental improve-
ments have been imputed from rents paid by single lodgers and information on
the BHC rents and waiting lists. The expected average rental increase on
unimproved dwellings in areas to be upgraded is P 5 per month per plot. The
imputed monthly rental value of the average traditional dwelling is P 10, of
a concrete house P 32, and of the same type of house on a low-cost sewered
plot P 38. Since water tariffs have been taken as an indication of benefits
from water infrastructure they were subtracted from rents in calculating the
return on residential development to avoid double counting.



- 44 -
7.05      In calculating rates of return all economic costs (the opportunity,
cost of land, engineering, construction, administration, physical contingen-
cies, private investment, and maintenance) have been included. Estimates of
private house construction costs were based on the Housing Survey of the first
project and data collected at appraisal. Price contingencies, capitalized
interest, and taxes have not been included and all water infrastructure has
been evaluated separately.
7.06      The resulting rate of return on the residential component is 18%.
Rates of return on each of the residential areas to be developed range from
15-22%. If the costs of housing construction have been underestimated 20%,
the rate of return on residential development would be 16%. If benefits have
been overestimated 20%, the rate of return would be 14%.
7.07      The rate of return on commercial, industrial, and horticultural
work sites, based on the expected prices and rentals, would be 15%. If sale
of the plots in the Central Business District and Central Industrial Area is
lagged two years because of slack demand, the rate of return on the work site
component would still be 13%.
7.08      The water infrastructure to be provided is essential to allow in-
creased supplies to low-income areas, including those being developed in this
project, and to allow for continued town growth. Substantial investment in
primary infrastructure is necessary in Francistown, because peak day demand
already exceeds capacity and average demand will exceed present capacity in
about 1979. Based on estimates of present capacity, capacity after this in-
vestment, and future demand valued at the average tariff, the rate of return
on all water infrastructure would be 11%.
7.09      Primary infrastructure for electricity is also required in Francis-
town. Without a second high voltage feeder into Francistown, maximum demand
will exceed capacity in 1980 or 1981. If the only benefits were the additional
maximum demand which will be supplied because of the feeder, the rate of re-
turn on primary electrical infrastructure would be 16%. In addition, a ring
main which passes through the growing southeast part of Francistown has been
designed to serve as part of the feeder. This ring main and other unallo-
cable electrical infrastructure will make street lights and connections to
community and commercial facilities possible. The value of these benefits
cannot be measured separately; some of it is included in the imputed rental
value of project housing development.
7.10      The overall rate of return for project components for which bene-
fits can be quantified (79% of project investment) is 18%. Details of cost
and benefit streams are given in Annex 3.
7.11      The health, education, and social integration which clinics, schools,
and community centers should encourage, cannot be quantified. The facilities
will be provided on a least-cost basis in accordance with minimal national
standards. The schools to be built and equipped will provide one classroom
for each 35 students at a cost of US$528 per student place. By the time of



- 45 -
project completion there will be one health post for every 2,000 inhabitants
in the two towns, a clinic for every 6,000, at an average capital cost of
US$4.80 per capita for health posts and US$12 per capita for clinics.
Risk
7.12      The major risk involved in the investment is the economic uncertainty
surrounding the two towns. Francistown might be adversely affected by politi-
cal complications in Rhodesia. The major effect to the project in that case
will be delays in selling commercial and industrial plots.
7.13      There is no immediate threat to Selebi Phikwe's economic base, but
the mine is not yet profitable, and it is conceivable that it could close
before the infrastructure now being provided has come to the end of its
working life. However, project investment in the town will have earned a
14% rate of return within the first 10 years, and in all probability the mine
operation will continue much longer.
C. Urban Poverty Impact
7.14      At the end of 1981, when the project will have been completed, an
estimated 26,000 people (40% of the population of the two towns) will be below
the urban poverty threshold. Project residential development will have a
broad impact on the towns, benefiting about 60% of their population, including
the vast majority of the poverty group. Of the 1,250 jobs generated by
the project, about 800 are likely to go to the urban poor. The low-cost
commercial and industrial facilities (60% of investment in work sites) and the
small-scale enterprise (SSE) credit scheme associated with the project are
poverty-oriented job-creation components; the cost per job will be much less
than $2,588, which is the Bank's estimate of the national average for capital
per job.
7.15      An estim  ed 73% of project investment will be affordable by the
urban poor and not less than 47% will actually benefit this group. Thus, of
the total project cost of $12.5 million, $9.1 million is attributable to the
urban poverty group. Of the $8.0 million loan amount, $5.8 million is urban
poverty lending.
7.16      The project will also address the particular needs of women in
Botswana. Unemployment, estimated at 55% among periurban women, is the
most severe problem of women in towns. About 35% of the 1,250 jobs created
or upgraded by the project and by the modifications in Loan 1019-BT will
probably be taken by women. Employment of women and the poor will be a major
criterion by which loan applications will be judged (Annex 1, para 10).
In addition, women heads of households tend to be enthusiastic town dwellers,
and based on experience of the previous project, a third of the households
in the settlement areas are likely to be headed by women.

8.01      Assurances were obtained during negotiations, that GOB will:
(a) maintain, within the Division of Urban Affairs and Housing
of the MLGL, a Project Coordination Unit (PCU) in order to
carry out the project. The PCU's procedures, powers and
responsibilities shall be satisfactory to the Bank (para 3.03).
(b) provide adequate staff to FTC and SPTC to implement the
project and operate and maintain project facilities and
assure that staff are properly trained (para 3.09).
(c) formulate a strategy and policy for the promotion of small-
scale businesses and carry out a survey and analysis of health
and nutrition among periurban residents (para 2.19).
(d) relend the proceeds of the loan to the two Councils and to
the Botswana Power Corporation and the Water Utilities Corpora-
tion under subsidiary loan agreements approved by the Bank
(paras 6.13 to 6.18).
(e) take whatever steps are necessary to secure the financial
viability of FTC and SPTC (para 6.08 (a)).
(f) furnish to the Bank, by January 1, 1979, a plan of action
to ensure that an adequate long-term water supply is made
available to Francistown (para 4.19).
(g) transfer power and water utilities in Francistown to the
Botswana Power Cororation and Water Utilities Corporation by
April 1 and October 1, 1979, respectively (para 3.17).
8.02      GOB further undertook that it would cause FTC and SPTC to:
(a) establish beneficiary selection criteria satisfactory to
the Bank for the allocation of plots (para 3.24).
(b) establish and collect monthly charges from beneficiaries
sufficient to recover capital and recurrent costs of alloc-
able infrastructure and home improvement loans. These
charges will be calculated in accordance with paras 6.13
to 6.19 and must be acceptable to the Bank.
(c) use a standard agreement for beneficiaries that specifies that
plots may not be sub-letted or transferred without the approval
of the relevant council (para 3.28).
(d) relocate and compensate, as may be appropriate, residents who
are required to move as a result of the project (para 3.20).



- 47 -
(e) establish, by January 1, 1979,' adequate management information
and budgetary control systems, including separate accounts for
the Project and submit unaudited financial statements within 6
months and audited within 12 months of the end of each fiscal
year (para 6.01).
(f) ensure that the percentage of beneficiaries in project areas and
prior project areas who are in arrears with payments due by them
to FTC and SPTC is reduced by March 31, 1979, and March 31, 1980,
to 30% and 15%, respectively (para 1.13(a)).
8.03      The following will be conditions of effectiveness:
(a) that the Subsidiary Loan Agreements between GOB and FTC, SPTC,
BPC, and WUC have been executed and ratified.
(b) that the percentage of beneficiaries in prior project areas who
are in arrears with payments to FTC has been reduced to 50% of
the total number of such beneficiaries (para 1.13(a)).
8.04      With the assurances and conditions indicated above, the Project
is suitable for a Bank loan of US$8.0 million equivalent.

ANNEX 1
BOTSWANA
Proposed Small-Scale Enterprises (SSE) Pilot Credit Scheme
A. Background
1.        During the last year, IBRD has discussed with the Botswana Devel-
opment Corporation (BDC) the feasibility of using some of its funds available
under Loan 1019-BT to channel resources to the small-scale enterprises (SSEs)
on an experimental basis, using the commercial banking system as an interme-
diary. While the program would have no geographic restriction, some emphasis
will be placed on assisting SSEs located in Francistown and Selebi Phikwe to
take advantage of assistance provided through the proposed Second Urban Project.
The proposal outlined below stresses flexibility to enable this experimental
program to be launched as quickly as possible so that lessons can be drawn in
the near future. As envisaged, the scheme could generate about 390 loans and
create about 975 jobs at an investment cost per job of $1,400 each.
B. Proposal
Description
2.         For administrative simplicity, Barclays Bank (Botswana), which has
had experience in running its own Development Fund Guarantee Scheme, will be
designated as the commercial bank for the project. Depending on the progress
of the scheme and the interest of Standard Bank and the National Development
Bank, participation can be expanded at a later stage. The commercial bank, at
its discretion, will lend to SSEs based on the following criteria:
(a) long-term commercial viability following development phase;
(b) production-oriented (viz., not charitable, service or social);
(c) employment creating;
(d) import substituting/export promoting; and
(e) locally owned--either by an individual, company, cooperative
or other corporate body.
3.        BDC will reimburse the commercial bank for 70% of all their dis-
bursements to eligible projects. The 70% represents the estimated foreign
exchange content of the "mix" of projects to be financed in the project. In
addition, BDC will provide a guarantee of 50% for any loss incurred on each



- 49 -
ANNEX 1
loan subject to b maximum aggregate guarantee of P 200,000 (i.e., actual
claims on BDC by \Barclays Bank of Botswana, Ltd. will not exceed P 100,000).
These figures will be reviewed annually between Barclays Bank of Botswana,
Ltd. and BDC.
Amount
4.        BDC will commit up to US$1 million (P 833,000) from Loan 1019-BT
for this project.
Foreign Exchange Risk
5.        The foreign exchange risk associated with funds drawn down from
Loan 1019-BT will be assumed by the Government at no cost to the SSE bor-
rower.
Lending Rates
6.        IBRD to BDC                      7.25% (Loan 1019-BT)
BDC to Commercial Bank          9.50%
Commercial Bank to SSEs        13.50% (This is 2.5% above the
prevailing prime rate in
Botswana)
Commitment Period
7.        The funds will be available to BDC for 24 months starting from the
first drawdown of the scheme which is expected to start in September 1978.
Period of Subloans
8.        The BDC loans to the commercial bank will for a minimum of three
years related to an estimated average life of the underlying subloans. The
actual reimbursement from BDC to the commercial bank would take place when BDC
itself receives the funds from IBRD.
C. Eligibility/Purposes/Terms of Subloans
Eligibility
9.        In addition to the general criteria outlined under para 2, sub-
borrowers under the pilot scheme must be able to meet the following criteria:
(a) they must be citizens of Botswana;
(b) the total assets employed in the business prior to the
time of borrowing should not normally exceed P 15,000
(the total assets of the business does not mean the assets
of the individual in the case of sole proprietorship); and



- 50 -
ANNEX 1
(c)  the borrower must be engaged in one of the following activities:
(i) manufacturing;
(ii) commerce (retail or wholesale);
(iii) service industries (i.e., repairs and labor services);
(iv) contracting; and
(v) agriculture (excluding cattle and arable farming).
10.       While not strictly a matter of eligibility, it is noted that the
Government of Botswana and IBRD are committing substantial resources to urban
development in Francistown and Selebi-Phikwe, and it is anticipated that funds
from this Credit Scheme will be utilized there and assist entreprenurial develop-
ment, including projects employing women and the urban and peri-urban poor.
Purposes of the Subloans
11.       The subloans must be made for one or more of the following purposes:
(a)  Workshops/Warehouses/  including new buildings and
Business Premises       expansion/renovation of existing
buildings
(b)  Equipment/Machinery/   both new and used, but not as
Small Stock             refinancing
(c)  Working Capital         but not for refinancing
12.       In order to ensure that a proper balance among the three categories
is achieved, BDC will inform IBRD of the estimated amounts disbursed each year
in each of the above three categories.
Terms for Subloans
Indicative   Maximum
Grace Period    Term        Maximum Loan 1/

Maximum Guarantee                                                  P  7,500
Contributions to Project Cost
14.       For an average project, it is expected that the entrepreneur will
contribute at least 10% of the project cost (either in cash or in kind). Of
the loan amount, the commercial bank will contribute 30%, and the BDC (utilizing
Loan 1019-BT) will contribute 70%. Therefore:
1/   In special circumstances, the maximum amounts could be increased upon
agreement between the commercial bank and BDC.

Project Loan: P 3,000
30%       900 - Commercial Bank
70%     2,100 - BDC
D. Procedural Matters
Disbursements
15.       Based on the agreed approval criteria (paras 2, 9 and 10) the
commercial bank will disburse from its own funds against approved SSE subloans
following the effectiveness of this pilot project. To obtain reimbursement,
the commercial bank must submit to BDC the certified form ADV1 for each
project indicating that commitment and/or disbursement have been made.
Reporting Requirements
16.  (a)  a copy of the bank's proposal form (ADVI) will be filed
with the BDC along with the bank's certification of
disbursement;
(b) twice a year the bank will submit to the BDC a copy of an
excess report (F9OA) for any loans in excess of limits or
in arrears on repayments;
(c) if an account is classified, a copy of the bank's classified
debt report (ADV16) will be filed with the BDC; and
(d) twice a year a copy of the bank's Rural Development Officer
Summary of Operations (and Delinquencies) will be filed with
BDC.
E. Technical Assistance
17.       Although no specific technical assistance component to this pilot
scheme is planned, there are sufficient services planned at present to cater
to the needs of the SSEs. First, BEDU's advisers will be available to provide
both on- and off-estate technical and extension advice to the entrepreneurs.
Second, the new Partnership for Productivity (Botswana) Ltd. will provide, in
conjunction with the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, assistance in book-
keeping/accounting to new and expanding businesses.  Third, existing Govern-
ment resources such as the Agricultural Extension Officers will be utilized as



- 52 -
ANNEX 1
needed. For Francistown and Selebi Phikwe, the proposed Second Urban
Project will include provisions for work facilities/trade areas to be
used by new and expanding SSEs in the area. Business advice and control
by experienced commercial bank managers will be automatically secured as
part of this project.
18.       To insure adequate capability in processing the new SSE loans,
Barclays has appointed a full-time Development Officer who is located in
Gaborone but travels as needed to other Barclays branches. In addition,
Barclays will undertake within the constraints of Botswana's manpower situ-
ation, to assign suitable citizen staff support to the Development Officer
as and when deemed necessary by Barclays.
