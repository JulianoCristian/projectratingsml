Urban Project in Botswana was\n            achieved. The Bank's interactions at all times\n            regarding identification, appraisal and implementation of\n            this project were highly valued by the Borrower. The\n            Bank's assistance was appreciated on clarifying policy\n            questions relating to the appropriate urban tenure\n            instruments, cost recovery, pricing and standards. The\n            second urban development project financed by the World Bank\n            in Botswana has successfully provided urban services to\n            approximately 50,000 low to moderate income residents in new\n            and upgraded developments. The institutional problems\n            encountered during the implementation of this project,\n            stemming largely from inadequate arrangements for housing\n            have been fully analyzed and documented in the Housing\n            Sector Review, 1988. Based on the findings and\n            recommendations of this Review, existing agencies would\n            continue to play key roles in the housing development\n            process, but with a more clearly articulated framework, and\n            with areas of responsibility more specifically defined."}, "docdt": "1989-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
