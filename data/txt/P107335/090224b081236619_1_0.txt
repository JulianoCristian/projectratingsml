Program Development Objectives
Program Development Objective (from Program Document)
The project development objectives have been broadly met: (a) as the fiscal space for poverty reduction was preserved and increased (ratio of actual to budgeted
spending on HIPC poverty reduction priorities increased 2009 to 2010); (b) measures to promote efficiency, transparency and accountability in the use of public
resources were taken and upheld; and (iii) provision of electricity improved, albeit many shortcomings remain.
Has the Program Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?
O Yes     o No

share declined relative to the previous year.
