Lesotho were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory; risk to\n            development outcome was moderate; Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory and borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes:\n            Lesotho has demonstrated the ability to build and operate a\n            complex hospital under a PPP agreement in a low income\n            setting. The lessons generated by Lesotho will be valuable\n            to countries seeking to build hospitals using a similar\n            approach. It is however important to know at the outset that\n            these lessons reflect the present phase of implementation of\n            the main PPP hospital project. The relationship between the\n            Global Partnership on Output Based Aid (GPOBA) project and\n            the main PPP hospital project should have been clarified at\n            the outset. Management of proprietary information under a\n            PPP agreement. While it is prudent to restrict proprietary\n            information under a PPP Agreement, for effective\n            collaboration of the different parties involved in the\n            execution of the project, it is pertinent that measures to\n            handle such proprietary information are agreed upon without\n            prejudicing the interests of the main parties. PPP payment\n            mechanisms are based on results/outputs and pose specific\n            challenges for traditional approaches to budgetary\n            appropriation which, if not handled well, can lead to cost escalation."}, "docdt": "2013-09-20T00:00:00Z"}
