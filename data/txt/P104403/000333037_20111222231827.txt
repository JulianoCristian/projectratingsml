                            LESOTHO – Hospital PPP Project
                              P104403, Grant No. TF-91156

                                    Restructuring Memo

1.    The closing date for Lesotho, Hospital PPP Project, Grant No. TF-91156,
P104403 will be extended from the original closing date of December 31, 2011 until
December 31, 2012.

2.       The project, which was signed on February 23, 2009 and declared effective since
September 23, 2009 has achieved notable results as of date and the Grant Objectives
continued to be achievable based on these results despite some delays. The three filter
clinics started providing service in April/May 2010. The clinics continue to function well
providing quality health care to over 335,000 patients at the end of July 2011, which is
more patients than the PPP contract required with respect to the per annum target of
258,000 for the performance indicator in terms of the number of patient visits to both the
clinics and the hospital. Moreover, the main PPP hospital, Queen 'Mamohato Memorial
Hospital opened for business on October 1, 2011, the number of outpatient visits and bed
occupancy rates being higher than anticipated, with 390 of a total of 425 beds being used
at the time of the Bank mission to Lesotho in October 2011. The equipment and services
at the hospital are running smoothly and new services not previously offered in the old
hospital are now provided.

3.     The proposed extension is necessary to enable the Recipient full utilization of the
GPOBA Grant to complete the implementation of service provision of key clinical
services at the main hospital as well as at the three filter clinics, such as doctors’
consultations, dental services, dispensing of medicine, ANC, ART, Family Planning,
Maternity, etc., which were beset by delays due to i) delay in signing of the finance
agreement, ii) the delay in starting construction of the three filter clinics as a result of the
delayed signing of the finance agreement, iii) delay in construction of the main PPP
hospital due to inclement weather, and iv) the delay in the assessment by the Independent
Monitor (IM) of the performance-based targets linked to payment. The respective request
for extension was received on October 24th, 2011 from Tsepong (Pty), Ltd. (the
Recipient), the private healthcare company and the PPP partner of the Government of
Lesotho (GOL) on the project and the recipient of the Grant. The borrower’s attached
Action Plan outlines the plan for the completion of activities during the extension period
and the proposed schedule for disbursement claims for the extension period.

4.     This will be the first extension of the project. All project covenants are in
compliance there are no qualified or outstanding audits. On the basis of the foregoing we
request your approval to extend the closing date until December 31, 2012.
