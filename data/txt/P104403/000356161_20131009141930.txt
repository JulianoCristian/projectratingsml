F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Commitment Document)
The objectives for the $6.25 million in GPOBA funds are to: (i) increase the access,
range and quality of publicly funded healthcare services; (ii) increase the value of
Government's current spending for these services; and (iii) leverage private sector
expertise in the management and operation of medical facilities to introduce more up-to-
date management, clinical procedures in Lesotho's healthcare sector.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country and Sector Background

Lesotho is an emerging middle income country. At appraisal, GDP per capita was estimated at
US$ 570 and average GDP growth rate at 1.2%. Lesotho faces the huge challenge of widespread
poverty with 58% of the estimated population of 2 million living below the poverty line of
US$ 1.50 per day. At appraisal, it was ranked 149th out of 177 countries according to the United
Nations Human Development Index and had large income inequalities, with a Gini coefficient of
0.66, one of the highest in the world. The Government is committed to improving access to health
care and operates a uniform user fee policy both for the both the public and Christian Health
Association of Lesotho (CHAL) facilities, where primary as well as some secondary care services
are exempted from user fees and token co-payments levied on the other services.

HIV/AIDS was identified at appraisal as a major health problem confronting Lesotho. With 29%
- 34% of adults estimated as infected by HIV, the country had the 3rd highest HIV prevalence rate
in the world. The pandemic has caused devastating impact on the health status of the citizens of
Lesotho and reversed the health gains of the 1980s. Life expectancy at birth was reported to have
reduced to 36 years, and infant mortality, under five mortality and maternal mortality rates were
rising. Similarly, morbidity and mortality from tuberculosis (TB) and non-communicable diseases
have been increasing.

In response to the sector challenges, the Government adopted a health sector reform program in
the late 1990s. The first phase of the reform program focused on establishing the institutional
capacity of the Ministry of Health (MoH) to plan, implement and monitor a comprehensive sector
program, and to expand national capacity to respond to HIV/AIDS. In the second phase, the
reform agenda focused on policy and institutional reforms and support to develop, design,
construct and equip a referral hospital through private sector participation to replace the Queen
Elizabeth II Hospital (QE II). The tender for the PPP hospital was one of the main activities under
phase 2 of the reform program. QE II served as the national referral hospital and as the district
hospital for the greater Maseru area. It was plagued by dilapidated infrastructure, poor
management systems and human resource shortages, all of which were contributing to a
significant decline in service quality. Spending was inefficient and escalating at a fast pace: the
operating budget in nominal terms had grown by 50 percent between 1995 and 2000, during the
same period that service volumes and quality were declining, and by 2006/7 the hospital’s budget
accounted for 40 percent of the MOH’s budget. With the economic slowdown and growing
burden of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, such hospital spending was deemed unsustainable. Having
considered other management and financing options, the Government decided to replace QE II
and requested IFC to provide advisory services on the structure, design and implementation of a
new national referral hospital using a Public Private Partnership (PPP) framework. The project
was prepared in partnership with IDA, GPOBA and IFC.




                                                1
Tsepong (Proprietary) Ltd. 1 , the PPP Operator, was selected through a competitive bidding
process to design, build, partially finance, and fully operate the new referral hospital for a period
of eighteen years, as well as to refurbish two filter clinics and construct a new2 filter clinic that,
together with the hospital, would form a health network. The health network is fully public, with
a private operator on behalf of the MOH, and is intended to provide the full range of services to
the catchment population. The Filter Clinics are a key component of this system, designed to
provide ambulatory care to patients who do not need to go to the main hospital. The clinics
mainly offer primary care services and basic secondary care as appropriate. In designing and
operating the hospital and clinics, Tsepong was expected to factor in efficiency and fiscal
sustainability in order to stay within the Government’s available budget. The annual operating
budget for QE II at the time was estimated at US$ 19 million. The preliminary total capital cost
before the PPP hospital tender was estimated at US$ 50 million. The unitary payment3 for the
new hospital was estimated at US$ 25 million (including VAT) and US$ 22 million (excluding
VAT) annually for the entire duration of the concession (18 years), allowing only for annual
adjustments for inflation. The unitary payment of US$ 22 million excluding VAT demonstrated a
funding gap of US$ 3 million. In the project design, the GPOBA Grant of US$ 6.25 million was
meant to provide viable gap funding that would cover 40 percent of the additional costs over the
proposed five-year project duration, leaving Government to assume 60 percent of the additional
costs from the start, so that the phase out of the GPOBA Grant would be less disruptive. The
services under the GPOBA Grant would be provided based on the service standards defined in the
main PPP Agreement derived from Government guidelines. Their achievement would be
measured against a list of 7 performance indicators.4 These indicators would be verified by an
Independent Monitor (IM) jointly contracted by the GoL and Tsepong to monitor the PPP
agreement and form the basis for disbursing GPOBA funds. The filter clinics were commissioned
in May 2010 and the new hospital, Queen ’Mamohato Memorial Hospital (QMMH), in October
2011.

Unitary payments comprise Government’s total annual remuneration to Tsepong for the services
under the PPP Agreement. The Unitary Payments were to commence upon the commissioning of
the new hospital, and GPOBA funding was therefore required by Government in the interim to
finance service delivery in the refurbished filter clinics as well as hospital services. According to
the Project Commitment Paper, GPOBA disbursements would be made on the basis of the
performance bands in the Table 1 below.

Rationale for GPOBA Assistance

According to the Project Commitment Paper, the rationale for GPOBA involvement in the PPP
hospital was underpinned by the fact that investments in health infrastructure and a healthy
population are significant drivers of economic growth. Through GPOBA’s involvement, the
project would leverage Government’s investment in public health infrastructure and promote the
application of management expertise of the private sector in many areas, including: (a) increasing
the accountability of service providers, (b) expanding the range and quality of public services, (c)
efficient use of public resources, and (d) enhancing project sustainability. The GPOBA funds
were expected to assist Government during the first five years to ease the funding gap between
the then current budget at QE II of US$ 19 million and the higher expected Unitary Payment. As
stated in the Commitment Paper, “The objective for the US$6.25 million ($3.44 million towards
the filter clinics and $2.81 million to the hospital) in GPOBA funds was to expand the number
and type of key services available to patients, acting as a top-up payment to allow additional
volume for critical services.”

This project was highly innovative at the time of its preparation in 2006, and GPOBA entered
into it recognizing the ‘high risk – high reward’ nature of this operation. Moreover, there was a
clear acknowledgement that this project was only a very small part of and would end more than a
decade ahead of the bigger PPP Agreement (end date is October 2026). Hence, this ICR should be
viewed more as an interim evaluation that provides a snap-shot of the bigger PPP Agreement and
the lessons emerging from this evaluation will be informative for the continuing implementation
phase of the PPP Agreement.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

According to the GPOBA Grant Agreement, the objectives of the project are to: (i) increase the
access and range of quality of publicly funded healthcare services delivered in the Kingdom of
Lesotho through the replacement of the existing main public hospital, the Queen Elizabeth II
Hospital; and (ii) leverage private sector expertise in the management and operation of medical
facilities to introduce more up-to-date management, equipment, and clinical procedures in the
Kingdom of Lesotho’s healthcare sector.5

From the list of 35 performance indicators for monitoring the PPP Agreement, the following
seven indicators together with the targets were selected to monitor the GPOBA project and
provide the basis for disbursement:

     1. Rate of post-operative infection amongst all patients with clean surgery wounds (8%)
     2. Percentage measure of the accessibility, accuracy and completeness for random samples
        of medical records examined (90%)
     3. Total minimum annual visits made to the Hospital and Filter Clinics (258,000 per annum)
     4. Minimum annual patient admissions (16,500 per annum)




5
 According to the Project Commitment Document, the project objectives are to: (i) increase the access, range and
quality of publicly funded healthcare services; (ii) increase the value of Government’s current spending for these
services; and (iii) leverage private sector expertise in the management and operation of medical facilities to introduce
more up-to-date management, clinical procedures in Lesotho’s healthcare sector. The Project Commitment Paper, page
4, on rationale for Bank involvement also notes that the project objective is to expand the number and types of key
services available to patients, acting as a top-up payment to allow additional volume for critical services.


                                                           3
       5. Rate of satisfaction measured by periodic patient and family surveys (85%)6
       6. Hospital equipment compliance with service standards (95%)
       7. Cleaning compliance with service standards (85%)

Quarterly payments for provision of health services at the PPP hospital and filter clinics, as
verified by the IM, would be based on meeting the performance targets for that quarter as
deduced from the specified annual targets. The quarterly payments would be 100% of the subsidy
when 6 of the 7 quarterly targets were met, 75% when 5 of the quarterly targets were met, and no
subsidy payment when 4 or less quarterly targets were met.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

The PDOs remained the same during the project’s lifespan. The performance indicators were
revised to reduce their number from 7 to 3 on the recommendation of the GPOBA Panel of
Experts7 on July 3, 2012; namely, (a) total annual visits made to the Hospital and Filter Clinics;
(b) total annual patient admissions; and (c) patient satisfaction. According to the submission made
to the Panel of Experts (Annex 2), the IM did not systematically analyze the other four
performance indicators and as such was not reporting on their achievement. In addition, the
indicators on post-operative infections and admissions were not relevant to the operations of the
filter clinics. Hence, only the three indicators stated above were used for disbursement purposes.
It is important to realize that the project did not go through a formal restructuring process in
accordance with IDA procedures.


1.4 Main Beneficiaries

According to the Project Commitment Paper, the project would serve the hospital’s catchment
area, Maseru District, with primary, secondary and tertiary services for a population of almost
500,000 people or one third of the country’s population. Furthermore, the new hospital would
continue to serve as the nation’s referral hospital for secondary and limited tertiary care services
not offered or available at the country’s district hospitals.

1.5 Original Components

The Original project components in the Grant agreement are:8

a) Outpatient services at the Filter Clinics. The project under this component would provide
   subsidies for medical services delivered at the refurbished clinics as measured against the
   performance indicators;
b) Inpatient services at the new Referral Hospital. The project under this component would
   provide subsidies for medical services delivered to inpatients at the hospital as measured
   against the performance indicators.




6
    The revised Operational Manual referred to 75%, which apparently was used by the IM for the project.

  The Panel of Experts evaluates and endorses projects for subsidy funding recommended by the GPOBA Program Manager. GPOBA
partners approve each member of the Panel of Experts.

1.6 Revised Components

The project components were not revised during the project lifespan.

1.7 Other significant changes

a) The project closing date was extended from December 31, 2011 to December 31, 2012 on
   December 28, 2011 to: (a) compensate for delayed disbursements, and (b) allow for full
   absorption of the Grant proceeds.
b) The number of the performance indicators was reduced from seven to three as explained
   above in Section 1.3. Only one withdrawal application, for the equivalent of US$ 521,061
   (less than one-tenth of the grant proceeds) had been disbursed to the project by the time (July
   3, 2012) the project indicators were revised.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The GPOBA project and the main PPP hospital project were intricately linked together in their
design and implementation arrangements. With the exception of civil works activities, the
GPOBA project was designed and implemented as an integral part of the main PPP hospital
project and some of the main issues and lessons are broadly similar for the two projects.

The project was designed as a PPP/GPOBA pilot to provide an alternative to financing of health
expenditures using IDA. This is the first and largest PPP in the sector and region. It not only
targeted the volume of services but was also designed to improve the quality of care, leveraging
partnerships both within the Bank (IDA/IFC/GPOBA), Government and private sector at the
country level. The focus of the project in supporting the replacement of QE II hospital was
consistent with Government priorities as outlined in the health sector reform plan. The association
with the main PPP project facilitated the preparation of the GPOBA project, especially in
securing high level Government support towards the project. Additionally, the preparation of the
GPOBA project relied heavily upon the feasibility and analytical studies that underpinned the
main PPP project.

The design of the GPOBA project tied it to the main PPP hospital project and gave overall
responsibility for executing the project to the PPP operator. In the design, both projects shared
common implementation arrangements including a monitoring framework, payment mechanisms
and verification processes, agreed upon with the intention of fostering better coordination of
implementation. Likewise, subsidy payments would only commence after the completion and
commissioning of the filter clinics and the main hospital.

The Lesotho PPP hospital project is an innovative, ambitious and complex project that
encompasses design, build, partial financing, and full operation of the concession by the private
operator. The Project Commitment Paper did not fully consider lessons on PPPs in general nor
the implications for the GPOBA project to co-finance such a complex PPP project. According to
the literature, PPPs in general share four main categories of risks: (a) cost related risks associated




                                                  5
with the financing model adopted; (b) issues of risk sharing; (c) complex financing models; and
(d) very limited publicly available financial information.9

The GPOBA project design was completed prior to the tender of the main hospital PPP project.
As a condition precedent to effectiveness, the GPOBA project had in place an Operational
Manual. However, for various reasons that remain unclear, the design of the GPOBA project and
the operational manual were not updated when the PPP Agreement between the GoL and
Tsepong was signed. This contributed to significant gaps especially in the design of the GPOBA
project’s payment mechanisms. The shared payment mechanism, though outlined in the PPP
Agreement, was not clear regarding the GPOBA project. The IM came to know about the
GPOBA project in the 2nd quarter of 2011 and received copies of the Grant Agreement and
operational manual later. The agreement of the IM omitted mentioning the GPOBA Grant, yet the
IM would be responsible for assessing Tsepong’s performance and recommending the GPOBA
disbursements. This lack of coordination and clarity in the GPOBA project’s operational manual
with regard to disbursement mechanisms was to seriously undermine disbursements for a large
part of the original project period.

2.2 Implementation

The project experienced significant delays in disbursements prior to extension of the project
Closing date for a variety of factors, but mainly due to misunderstanding on the payment
mechanisms for the GPOBA project arising from failure to update the project design after the
signing of the PPP Agreement as cited above. Of the six withdrawal applications drawn under the
project, only one (submitted in June 2011) was processed during the original project period
ending December 31, 2011, though it is not clear on what basis this application was approved,
given that the seven indicators had not been reported on. The Bank task team rejected the second
withdrawal application submitted on November 8, 2011 due to inconsistencies between the IM
report and the Withdrawal Application. These inconsistencies could have been avoided with
better initial coordination by the Bank team amongst key stakeholders in the project. As a result
of the initial disbursement delays, Netcare had to advance a loan to support Tsepong’s operational
costs. The second opportunity to address the disbursement challenges were missed at midterm, as
the project did not conduct a midterm review. There was also a gap in implementation support for
quite a significant part of the initial project period. Furthermore, some critical officers with the
project’s institutional memory left Tsepong’s and the Government’s employment, which led to a
reopening of discussions on matters previously concluded and agreed upon, leading to further loss
of time.

The main PPP hospital project as explained above is a highly complex and ambitious project. Its
implementation brought with it several challenges. Although clear joint PPP monitoring and
management structures are in place (Liaison Committee, Joint Services Committee, and others),
the Government and Tsepong focused on addressing the day to day challenges of the PPP
Agreement and paid less attention to disbursement of the “small” GPOBA Grant. One example of
the larger PPP challenges includes a disagreement between Tsepong and Government on the
interpretation of the PPP Agreement with regard to the index for inflation adjustment in
calculating the Unitary Payment. One of the indices in the inflation adjustment was discontinued
by the Central Bank of Lesotho and considerable time and effort was expended to agree on a
replacement. In another example of challenges facing the larger project, the IM felt that the

payment mechanism for the main PPP hospital project was too complicated to be implemented in
the manner it was originally designed. The monitoring framework still had areas of disagreement
to be resolved by the Government and Tsepong. It has been agreed between the Government and
Tsepong to refer a number of areas of disagreement for arbitration.

In spite of disagreements between the Government and Tsepong over the implementation of the
PPP Agreement, with time the parties, especially the Operations Director of Tsepong and the
officials of the MoH have continued to work in a cordial and collaborative manner without
further escalating the disagreements. This partnership approach in managing the relationship and
PPP Agreement has ensured that all services continue uninterrupted throughout the health
network, at the hospital and filter clinics, and that the parties are able to continue discussions
despite the differences. It was noted that variations have been made to the PPP Agreement. For
example, Tsepong has had to provide housing for its senior staff and to accommodate patients
referred to South Africa as “lodgers.”

Nevertheless, it is important to note that with a change of task team leader (TTL) in November
2011, there was a strong effort to address the flawed withdrawal application process and simplify
the procedural requirements to disburse funds under the GPOBA project. This dramatically
improved project performance, resulting in the project completely disbursing prior to the revised
Closing date of December 31, 2012. Moreover, the larger World Bank Group team (IDA,
GPOBA and IFC) regularly collaborated with Government and Tsepong to troubleshoot
implementation bottlenecks during this period, which was very helpful in completing this
operation. As a result, the project disbursed the remaining Grant proceeds in five withdrawal
applications within a period of less than one year, with the last withdrawal application
representing 60% (US$ 3,735,604) of the Grant value. The delay in disbursements meant that
project funds were unavailable when they were most needed before the commencement of the
Unitary Payments.

The commissioning of the QMMH generated quite considerable public expectations and negative
media coverage as well. In the absence of proactive public relations management by the
Government and Tsepong, implementation issues at the new hospital and clinics were
misrepresented to the public. While Tsepong has since put in place a public relations team and the
MOH is adding to its own capacity, through assistance from IFC and donors, the high patient
volumes and unmanaged public expectations have created a sometimes difficult operating
environment for both parties. The change of Government in Lesotho has also meant that the MoH
has had to ensure that the new leadership fully understands the PPP Agreement. The process of
strengthening the MoH’s PPP Unit with additional staff dedicated to supporting the PPP
Agreement has been delayed while resources were sought to fund the staff positions. In addition,
key staff working on the project at the MoH PPP Unit left before the hospital opened.


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

For the purposes of assessing the GPOBA project’s performance, a list of seven indicators were
selected from the list of indicators for the main hospital PPP project before the Government and
Tsepong, the PPP Operator and Grant Recipient, finalized and signed the PPP Agreement. Once
the PPP Agreement was signed, the indicators and targets were not adjusted to reflect the specific
GPOBA project requirements and outputs. The indicators did not adequately differentiate
between types and levels of services provided at the facilities. For example, the tertiary
orientation of the hospital and some of the indicators, such as post-operative infection rate and



                                                7
patient admissions, were not relevant to the operation of the filter clinics, yet it was a requirement
that quarterly reports covering all indicators were provided as a condition for GPOBA payments,
even when only the filter clinics were operating before the commissioning of the hospital. The
GPOBA project only reported on three indicators, namely; out patients, admissions and patient
satisfaction. While data was collected on the PPP project’s 35 indicators, the data on the selected
qualitative indicators were not systematically evaluated by the IM (accessibility, accuracy and
completeness of medical records; hospital equipment compliance with service standards; and
cleaning compliance with service standards), and as a result, the project could not meet the
requirements for GPOBA disbursements. Both the IM and Tsepong complained about the
complex verification process of the main PPP hospital project, which remained tied to the
GPOBA project even after revision of the indicators. Project payments were based on a global
budget instead of patient diagnoses/cases and were not designed to drive the achievement of
clinical outcomes. This was partially rectified by reducing the number of indicators to three. The
rationale for a separate list of indicators for the GPOBA project was not quite clear, as the IM
continued to monitor and use the 35 indicators in determining payments under the PPP
Agreement. The end-line study revealed many inconsistencies with the quality of data, especially
qualitative data as explained above. Another problem noted was the small sample size used by the
IM in the collection of data for analysis given the large volume of patients. The sample sizes used
by the IM had been recommended by Government and Tsepong.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

The GPOBA Project Commitment Paper states that the project does not trigger the World Bank’s
social safeguard policies (OP 4.10 and OP 4.12). In addition, the Commitment paper states that a
compliance note was to be obtained from IFC attesting that the project complies with all
applicable IFC safeguard policies and standards. However, the PPP hospital project involved the
provision of medical care and generation of medical waste and at the least ought to have triggered
OP 4.10 on environmental assessment. Lesotho already had a health care waste management plan
(adopted in 2010) that was disclosed under the other health projects and could have been used for
the GPOBA project. According to the PPP Agreement, Tsepong was required to ensure that the
design adheres to IFC’s Environmental Guidelines for Health Care Facilities (April 30, 2007).
Tsepong was also expected to ensure that the design and operation of the facility complies with
IFC’s Sustainability Policy and the Performance Standards on social and environmental
sustainability of the project. In this regard, IFC provided documentation of a Social and
Environmental Review, which was consistent with the GPOBA Guidance Note on the
Application of Bank Safeguard Policies in GPOBA projects. The necessary supporting
documentation is available in the GPOBA project’s file.

According to the ISRs, FM assessments were rated satisfactory with the exception of the last two
ISRs which were rated moderately satisfactory. The ISRs reported IFRs were submitted quarterly
and that the project was found compliant with respect to the audits, except for the closing audit.
The draft 2012 annual financial statements (with unqualified draft audit report), approved by the
audit committee, were submitted to the Bank but the Tsepong Board is yet to approve them. A
key challenge noted above relates to the delay in disbursements which was attributable to the
ambiguity in performance indicators that triggered disbursements.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The main hospital PPP concession spans a period of 18 years. The contribution of the GPOBA
project is quite small in comparison to the total contribution of the main hospital PPP project



                                                  8
(both in terms of the amount of funding and time period), and no post-completion GPOBA
transition arrangements are envisaged. There are also no plans for any follow on support of a
similar nature; however, IFC has donor funding and a Cooperation Agreement in place with the
Government to provide “contract management capacity building support” to the PPP Unit at the
MoH, as well as to assist the Government in developing and implementing a relevant proactive
communications strategy and capacity. The World Bank approved a US$ 16 million four-year
Maternal and Newborn Health Performance-Based Financing (PBF) project on April 11, 2013
with the Project Development Objective to improve the utilization and quality of maternal and
newborn health services in selected districts. A PBF Unit has been established to coordinate the
roll-out of the project and potentially provides an avenue for future coordination with the PPP
Unit.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation. (Significant)

The relevance of the project objectives is rated as high. The GPOBA project objectives were and
remain consistent with the country’s development goals and the agenda of the second phase of the
health sector reform program. The Government had struggled for many years to replace QE II,
which had become a drain to national resources, yet the quality of services continued
deteriorating. The inefficient spending was observed as unsustainable in the face of the high
disease burden, especially due to HIV/AIDS, and the need for improved tertiary services in terms
of both access and quality of care. Management of QE II had been problematic; in replacing the
hospital, the Government also needed to improve its overall management by leveraging private
sector expertise. The objectives were equally relevant to the Bank’s support in contributing to the
goals of Lesotho’s Poverty Reduction Strategy of improving public service delivery, meeting the
health related MDGs, and building human capital. The project provided a unique opportunity for
IDA/GPOBA and IFC to collaborate together and leverage their different expertise in its
preparation. Given the limited scope of this project, both in terms of size of funding and period of
implementation, the PDO and rationale for the OBA project were quite ambitious.

The relevance of project design is rated as significant. The project was unique and innovative in
the Bank but at the same time high risk. Its design and implementation arrangements were
anchored within the main PPP hospital project and premised on the GPOBA principles of: (a)
reimbursement for services provided upon satisfactory verification of outputs; (b) service
contracts; and (c) allocation of risks to participating entities. The GPOBA project essentially
shared the same PDO, rationale and implementation arrangements with the main PPP project,
and thereby avoided the need for setting up separate implementation arrangements. However, the
actual scope of the project in relation to the PPP Agreement and the GPOBA project’s payment
mechanisms needed to have been properly defined since the project was meant to finance
additional volume of services. In hindsight, the project design would have benefitted greatly from
giving consideration to the complexity of the main PPP hospital project and anticipating capacity
building actions needed within the MoH to oversee the project as well as likely areas for variation.
The Government announced plans in April 2013 to significantly increase the salaries of health
workers, and according to Tsepong, it would need to substantially increase the salaries of its staff
in order to retain them, which currently is not provided for in the Unitary Payment.

The relevance of implementation is rated as moderate. The project experienced significant
disbursement delays, which persisted for the entire duration of the original project period due to
the lack of clarity around the project’s payment mechanisms. The delays meant that the project


                                                 9
could not provide necessary funding for the operation of the filter clinics as earlier envisaged
before commencement of the Unitary Payments. Owing to the disbursement delays, Netcare had
to advance a loan to Tsepong. With the change in the project task team, revision of the project
indicators and clarification on the payment mechanisms (aide memoire, April 16 – 20, 2012
Mission), disbursements improved dramatically, and as a result, the project disbursed the entire
Grant proceeds before the revised Closing date. The disbursements, however, came quite late. For
instance, disbursement for the second withdrawal application covering the period October to
December, 2010 was made on June 18, 2012.

In response to inadequate capacity in Government, the Government has recruited a firm to build
MoH capacity for contract management of PPP initiatives within the sector including the hospital.
The findings of the end-line survey will be valuable in informing the larger PPP agenda,
particularly in the areas of efficiency and sustainability, early in the implementation cycle of the
PPP Agreement.

In view of the high relevance of the project objectives, significant rating of relevance for design
and moderate rating for implementation, overall relevance of project objectives, design and
implementation is rated as significant.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives (High)

The assessment of achievement of the project development objectives reviews the project
indicators and targets drawing on the findings of the baseline study (2007) for QE II and the end-
line study (2012) for the QMMH Public Partnership prepared by Lesotho-Boston Health Alliance
on behalf of Boston University.10 This assessment looks at qualitative findings to explain how
QMMH increased the access and range of quality healthcare services and benefitted from private
sector expertise in the management and operation of the facility; and in addition, attempts to
explain the effectiveness of the GPOBA project in providing partial funding to Tsepong prior to
commencement of the Unitary Payments. The PDO achievement analysis was not split since the
project did not undergo formal restructuring.

In view of the deliberate effort during the design period to integrate the GPOBA assistance within
the main PPP hospital project, it is difficult to evaluate the GPOBA project separate from the
overall PPP project given the overlapping PDOs and rationale. However, this ICR attempts to
separate the evaluation from the larger PPP for the following reasons: (a) the larger PPP runs for
a period of eighteen years and is currently only in its fifth year of implementation; and (b) the
GPOBA Grant was viewed as a top-up payment to cover part of the additional volume of critical
services and therefore did not support the large capital costs associated with the PPP Agreement.
The analysis on efficiency and sustainability of the GPOBA project is extremely challenging,
since the PPP is early in its implementation, and much of the PPP cost information was not made
available due to proprietary considerations.

Assessment of patient volumes between QE II and QMMH. In 2012, QMMH (including the
filter clinics) recorded dramatic increases in the number of ambulatory visits and patients
admissions compared to QE II at baseline, surpassing the agreed targets. Overall, QMMH
recorded 374,669 ambulatory visits against a target of 258,000 outpatient visits, more than double
the number of outpatient visits at QE II (180,000 visits). The filter clinics; in particular, have


10
  The structure and services provided by the two hospitals are quite different and the data, the best at the moment,
ought to be interpreted with caution.


                                                           10
recorded dramatic increases in the number of ambulatory patients. In terms of admissions,
QMMH had 23,341 admissions against a target of 16,500, compared to 15,465 at QE II, an
increase of 51%. Similarly, QMMH had higher numbers of inpatient days (116,658) compared to
QE II (91,808), which shows higher efficiency and throughput of patients, and is reflected in the
lower average length of stay11 (5.0 days) at QMMH compared to 5.8 for QE II. The overall bed
occupancy rate12 for QMMH was 82% compared to 61% at QE II. C-sections recorded a dramatic
increase. The high C-section rates are reported to be related to a policy to perform C-sections in
all mothers who have had previous C-sections. In addition, the high rates may be related to the
interpretation of results from cardiotocography studies and the focus on improving newborn
survival rates. Cardiotocography studies are done to monitor fetal heartbeat and uterine
contractions. If fetal distress or any other complication is identified, a C-section may be
considered. Initially, in 2012, it was reported that clinicians were conservative in their
cardiotocography interpretations, which may have increased C-section rates inappropriately. As
the year progressed and clinicians gained confidence in cardiotocography interpretations, fewer
C-sections were performed. With improved services at QMMH, pregnant mothers scheduled for
elective C-sections may be opting to deliver in QMMH instead of the up-country hospitals.
Another possibility is that more mothers are being referred to QMMH by up-country hospitals
given the low quality of health services. The results of the key hospital statistics and annual
inpatient admissions for the QMMH and QE II are summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2 adopted
from the end-line study report.

QMMH added new services and improved the range and quality of services previously
provided by QE II and the filter clinics. The new services include: (a) Intensive Care Unit, (b)
Neonatal Intensive Care Unit; and (c) diagnostic equipment including MRI and computerized
tomography. Compared to QE II, QMMH has additional labor rooms for maternity patients;
additional operating theatre capacity; greater access to pharmacy and laboratory services;
improved facilities at bed-side such as oxygen hook up, automatic suction, emergency alarm; and
emergency power back up systems. The introduction of the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit has
increased the survival rates for very low birth weight babies with 70% of these infants surviving;
unlike before when virtually all babies weighing less than 1.5 kilos would likely have died.
Additional changes which distinguish QMMH from QE II include patient-friendly signage,
handicapped access throughout the hospital, on-call rooms for doctors, and state-of-the-art
training and conference facilities. As a result of the improved diagnostics and quality of care,
there has been an increase in patient referrals to Bloemfontein contrary to the earlier expectations
of reduced referrals. QMMH in 2012 referred 2,173 patients to Bloemfontein compared to 1,353
in 2006-7 by QE II. All the filter clinics are equipped with x-ray machines and ultra sound
equipment and serve as the major centers for initiating patients on antiretroviral treatment.

Patient and Family Satisfaction. In spite of the large volume of patients and critical media,
especially in the beginning, QMMH has been able to satisfy the majority of patients. In 2012,
QMMH achieved an overall satisfaction rate of 86%, compared with a 71% satisfaction rate at
QE II in 2007. According to the IM reports, patient satisfaction in QMMH ranged from 75% to
89% and in the filter clinics from 69% to 92% in 2012. The QMMH satisfaction rate gradually
improved from 78% during the period October to December 2011 to 89% during the period July
to September 2012 and has remained more or less consistent with an average recommended rate
of 85%.

Accessibility, Accuracy and Completeness of Medical Records. Based on the IM’s reports,
100% of the inpatient medical records sought could be retrieved, compared to 73% of records
which were retrievable at QE II at the baseline. On the other hand, the end-line survey evaluators



                                                    12
were able to retrieve 89% of records sought. Regarding completeness of the record, the IM
reported that 100% of the 134 records they evaluated were complete in 2012, compared to only
3% at QE II in 2007. Neither the IM nor the end-line evaluators reported findings on the accuracy
of the medical records. Although the end-line evaluators noted that the number of records
reviewed by the IM in 2012 appeared to be too low for a 390-bed hospital, the 89% reported by
the endline study is close to the recommended average of 90%.

Infection Control Measures. Neither the IM nor the end-line evaluators reported on post-
operative infection amongst patients with clean surgery wounds, but instead reported on effective
hand washing stations, an internationally recognized indictor. QMMH was found to be 92.5%
compliant with the infection control indicator according to the IM’s reports, and 100% compliant
according to spot checks conducted by the end-line evaluators.

Compliance with Equipment and Cleaning Service Standards. The two indicators on
compliance with equipment and cleaning service standards were not assessed and reported on in
terms of quantitative targets as agreed at appraisal. Qualitative findings from the IM and the end-
line evaluation reported major improvements in hospital cleanliness and the status of equipment
in the QMMH compared to QE II. The necessary medical equipment is available and better
maintained, and cleanliness in terms of infection control has improved markedly.

There is overall improvement in hospital management. QMMH is truly an innovative
investment and one of a few similar hospitals in the developing world. It stands out as a state of
the art hospital in terms of infrastructure and equipment and its management systems and
processes are much more advanced compared to QE II. This is reflected in compliance with
clinical policies and protocols, medical recordkeeping, availability of emergency equipment,
performance of the pharmacy system and hospital cleanliness. This is attributed to the existence
and implementation of hospital-level policies and guidelines that strengthen hospital operations
and accountability. The hospital is undergoing accreditation by the Council for Health Service
Accreditation of South Africa (COHSASA) to be completed in the last quarter of calendar year
2013. There are also increased opportunities for staff training and development, increased job
responsibilities and authority, and better working conditions. In addition to serving as a secondary
and tertiary care institution, QMMH still serves as a primary care facility through its association
with the filter clinics – the filter clinics13 are also operated by Tsepong. QMMH also operates a
Gateway Clinic for simple ambulatory patients who do not need to go to the main hospital. The
rising trend in the number of ambulatory patients and referrals, some of whom as noted in Section
3.5 are inappropriate, is likely to draw patients and resources away from the other health facilities
and delay QMMH from transitioning to a fully-fledged tertiary facility able to meet the service
demands of Lesotho. For the transition to take place, the Government and Tsepong need to recruit
more specialists to QMMH on top of the 13 currently in post; fix the service delivery deficiencies
facing the up-country hospitals, streamline patient referrals and review the PPP Agreement to
include essential and vital tertiary services currently excluded like dialysis and oncology.

Contribution of the GPOBA Project. QMMH in the one year of full operation has made
significant improvements compared to QE II as described above. The targets for the three key
performance indicators - total outpatient visits, total inpatient admissions, and patient and family
satisfaction - were met and surpassed. However, it is important to explain the counterfactual and


13
  Filter clinics are essentially health centers established in the 1990s to provide mainly primary and some secondary
care to the population within Maseru as a measure to decongest QE II, and have been retained under the new PPP
health network.

determine the contribution of the GPOBA project toward these outcomes. Without specific
(attributable) project targets to assess the contribution of the project, the analysis looks at the
sequencing of the disbursements and what would have happened in the absence of the GPOBA
project. GPOBA project disbursements started one year after the commissioning of the filter
clinics. As a result, Tsepong could not access the resources required in the interim to finance
service delivery in the refurbished filter clinics before commencement of the Unitary Payments,
which were expected to start upon commissioning the new hospital. To meet the shortfall,
Netcare advanced a loan to Tsepong, demonstrating Tsepong’s commitment to the project and its
confidence in the overall relationship with the Government of Lesotho. Following the extension
of the GPOBA project for a year, disbursements improved significantly and helped the
Government meet its payment commitments to Tsepong. Although the project did not directly
support PPP capacity building, the end-line survey collected critical information that will inform
implementation of the PPP project during the next phase.

The objectives of the GPOBA project: (i) increasing the access and range of quality of publicly
funded healthcare services; and (ii) leveraging private sector expertise in the management and
operation of medical facilities, were achieved. Although the GPOBA project’s contribution was
rather small in terms of resources and disbursements started late and considering the timeframe of
the main PPP project, it still contributed towards the achievement of the PPP hospital objectives
above. Thus, the achievement of project objectives is rated high.

3.3 Efficiency (Significant)

QMMH in comparison to QE II demonstrates improved efficiency as explained in section
3.2 above in terms of higher numbers of inpatient days. Average length of stay and bed
occupancy rate at QMMH were much lower and higher respectively compared to QE II, which
demonstrates the quality of care provided, with patients being discharged sooner and more
patients accessing the improved hospital facilities. On the basis of inpatient day equivalents (IDE)
analyses, the estimates show that QHHM is 6% more expensive on a per unit cost basis exclusive
of taxes, while providing a much higher level and quality of service. But, QMMH is more
efficient than QE II, with a 22% lower unit cost when capital costs are excluded (Table 3).14

The findings reveal that the PPP health network is providing more services, and getting
much better quality of care and patient outcomes through the PPP hospital. However, the
findings also reveal that the affordability of the Unitary Payments may be an issue for the future.
The GPOBA project funds were to provide top-up payments in the early years that would be
picked up by the Government at the end of the project. While it may appear too early to start
drawing conclusions, it seems that the Government has been encountering delays in making
payments to Tsepong, which raises concerns about its ability to pay for services in the future. In
2012/13, the first full year for the PPP hospital operation, the unitary fee invoiced by Tsepong on
the basis of the baseline survey findings (when taxes and the costs of amortization of capital are
excluded) was approximately US$ 30 million. This is higher than the amount the Government of
Lesotho had projected during the project’s planning and procurement for the Unitary Payment.
The total GPOBA contribution in 2012 was US$ 5.73 million, representing about 12% of the
annual PPP hospital project costs. The hospital and especially the filter clinics have seen a much
higher than projected volume of patients. It is important to note that while Tsepong and the
Government had a prior agreement on the flat per patient rate to be charged for these additional
patients, they have not yet agreed on the administrative approvals and billing for these and any
other additional services that GoL may be required to cover in addition to the Unitary Payment.
Some of the reasons for the high payments compared to QE II include: (a) the inclusion of the
cost of capital repayment and value added tax16 (VAT) in the Unitary Payment, (b) additional
services offered (e.g. Intensive Care Unit and Neonatal Intensive Care Unit) previously not
offered in QE II, and (c) operation of the gateway clinic at QMMH.

Despite the initial disbursement delays, the GPOBA project as explained above met its objectives
and was implemented using the implementation arrangements of the main PPP project. The
achievement of efficiency is rated as significant.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating (Moderately Satisfactory)

QMMH in the one year of full operation recorded dramatic increases in the volume of patients
compared to QE II at baseline, improved the range and quality of services provided in the hospital
and made significant improvements towards achievement of the key performance indicators.
These results are evident through the study and data provided in this report and are presented in
the initial baseline and subsequent end line survey information. While QMMH in comparison to
QE II demonstrates improved efficiency in terms of patient throughput, the Government is paying
more for services, but getting much better quality of care and patient outcomes through the PPP
hospital. Also, the end line survey that was commissioned as part of this project evaluation has
collected important information that will move the broader PPP agenda forward. However, the
GPOBA project did not provide timely subsidies to the filter clinics and the findings reveal that
affordability is likely to be an issue for the MoH in the future, and that the Unitary Payments need
to be managed closely. In view of the significant rating for overall relevance of project objectives,
design and implementation, high rating for achievement of project objectives, and significant
rating for efficiency, tempered by the cost pressures noted in Section 3.3, overall outcome for the
GPOBA project is rated moderately satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

QMMH serves the catchment area of the Maseru district, and also serves as the nation’s referral
hospital for secondary and tertiary care services. The network is catering to a third of the
population of Lesotho (an IDA country). While no specific assessments on poverty, gender and
social development were undertaken, the improved services in the hospital are likely to have
positive health benefits on the poor. Also, the universal health coverage policy of the Government
has made these services more easily accessible to the poorer segments of the population.
Moreover, the very strong focus on maternal health under this GPOBA project is favorably
impacting on the health of women and children.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

Increased capacity to deliver quality health services. The new PPP hospital as explained above
has improved the range and quality of services previously provided by QE II and added new
services hitherto unavailable. With the improved capacity, QMMH is able to diagnose and
manage more complex cases compared to QE II. The capacity of QMMH to deliver complex
services is expected to improve further as the hospital continues with the transition to a fully-
fledged tertiary care facility. The first case of neuro-surgery was recorded recently and
received positive media coverage.

Capacity for improved management of health care services in Lesotho. QMMH has instituted
various management processes and systems including clinical policies and protocols to strengthen
hospital operations and these are currently being rolled out for implementation. It is anticipated
that some of the processes will be extended to the other health facilities and contribute to the
overall improvement in management of health care delivery in Lesotho. The training facilities in
QMMH are among the best and will increase opportunities for staff training and development
within Lesotho. The training and recruitment of local staff in management positions is expected
to contribute towards institutional strengthening and local empowerment of the Basotho to
eventually take over management of the facility.

Capacity to manage large and complex health PPPs. QMMH is one of the largest PPPs of its
kind. In response, and with the recent assistance of IFC and donor support, the MoH is in the
process of strengthening the PPP Unit to work in collaboration with other departments to oversee
the PPP hospital. With the experience, it is anticipated that the MoH will build its capacity to
manage similar large and complex PPPs. Because of its uniqueness, many countries are keen to
learn about the project and have been visiting Lesotho to learn about the PPP hospital.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

The PPP hospital has generated heightened public interest and expectation. This has led to
the unexpected high volume of patients coming in search of better services, but also unfavorable
media coverage over unsubstantiated claims regarding quality of care provided by the hospital
and the new management systems instituted by the hospital. The high volume of ambulatory
patients in particular is constraining Tsepong from providing tertiary services and driving up the
cost of the Unitary Payments. The poor referral system, poor services in up-country facilities, and
better services at QMMH are among some of the major drivers for high patient volumes. Many
patients express frustration over the perceived long waiting times and prefer to see doctors. To the


                                                16
public, the status (private or public) of QMMH and the role of the MoH regarding QMMH need
to be clarified.

Managing other services previously under QE II but excluded in the PPP Agreement. QE II
previously offered various other services, which are currently excluded in the PPP Agreement
like occupational services, initiation and treatment of HIV/AIDS and TB patients and supporting
Maseru District Health Management Team (DHMT) in the delivery of public health services
including the signing of death certificates, road traffic accidents and police forms. QE II also
mentored interns and newly recruited doctors before posting them to up-country stations. While
QMMH adopted some activities like attending to death certificates, road accidents and police
forms including training of interns and provision of staff housing, cross matching of blood and
transportation of referred patients to Bloemfontein in South Africa, others remain without any
clear systems in place for their provision. The shortcomings have led to variations in the PPP
Agreement. There is a growing perception by some members of Government that a new hospital
ought to be built to serve Maseru district, as there is currently no secondary facility serving
Maseru, so that QMMH concentrates on its tertiary function; and thus ensure that QMMH’s
assets are used more efficiently and effectively.

Increased patient referrals to and from QMMH. With the poor national referral system and
poor quality of services offered by district hospitals, referrals to QMMH, some of which are
inappropriate, have increased dramatically. For example, there are instances where patients are
referred to QMMH for blood transfusion without any justification – “patient dumping”. The
expectation of reduced referrals to South Africa has also not been realized. Due to improved
diagnostics and management of patients at QMMH, more referrals are being made to South
Africa. It is important to note that the GoL/MoH at the time was working on an extensive parallel
program to strengthen the existing health infrastructure and services through the Government’s
compact with the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) funding of over US$ 120 million for
a national network of clinics and equipment. The funding and implementation of this was
significantly delayed from the original 2007 start date. As of May 2013, fewer than 20 of the 168
clinics were completed or equipped and staffing was not in place. Related equipment and
rehabilitation of several health centers included in the project had not yet been completed. The
non-availability of these planned facilities and services has placed an additional burden on the
QMMH network and the entire national health system.

Strike by Tsepong Staff in October 2012. Because of Tsepong’s association with Netcare, the
staff in the hospital went on strike demanding salaries commensurate to Netcare employees in
South Africa. The Government has also proposed to increase salaries for health workers, over and
above the current salaries offered by Tsepong. For QMMH to retain its staff, it will need to
substantially increase salaries for its staff. The financing model for the PPP Agreement did not
consider a significant change in the labor market, and it is unclear how Tsepong would continue
offering services when Government reviews salaries for health workers employed in the public
sector. If Government goes ahead with the proposed salary increase, Tsepong has stated that it is
unlikely to sustain the delivery of services in the intermediate period without compensation.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

There were no beneficiary survey or stakeholder workshops conducted.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Although the GPOBA project is closed, the main PPP project still has several years of
implementation. The entire contract for the remaining period is guaranteed as part of
Government's budget. The risk to development outcome is rated moderate.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry (Moderately Satisfactory)

The GPOBA project was consistent with the overall Government plan and benefitted from its
association with the main PPP hospital project, alongside which it was prepared in terms of the
feasibility and analytical studies and the high level of Government support. The main
consultations that took place focused on the main PPP hospital project and not the GPOBA
project. The project Commitment Paper did not discuss lessons on PPPs. The design tied this
project to the main PPP Hospital project, in that both projects shared common implementation
arrangements including a monitoring framework, payment mechanisms and verification processes.
For proprietary reasons, the PPP Agreement was not made available to the project team, who did
not have the complete understanding of the shared implementation arrangements. The shared
implementation arrangements may have been appropriate for the main PPP hospital project, but
the arrangements were complex and inappropriate for the GPOBA project. For instance, the
monitoring and evaluation framework and payment mechanisms were designed for the main PPP
hospital project and were not customized to the GPOBA project. The shared payment mechanism,
though outlined in the main PPP Agreement, was not clear regarding the GPOBA project, and
likewise, the contract of the Independent Monitor omitted reference to the GPOBA Grant, yet the
IM would be responsible to monitor performance of Tsepong under the project. Bank
performance in ensuring Quality at Entry is rated moderately satisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision (Moderately Unsatisfactory)

Bank supervision of the GPOBA project over the period September 2009 to December 2011 was
weak. There were major disbursement delays with only one withdrawal application processed
during the original project period ending December 31, 2011. With a new task team that took
over from December 2011 and extension of the project Closing date, the Bank intensified
implementation support during the last one year of the project and agreed on disbursement
procedures with Tsepong and IM. As a result, the project disbursed the remaining proceeds of the
grant within a period of less than one year. According to the ISRs, project performance in terms
of achievement of project objectives, implementation progress and FM were rated satisfactory
with the exception of the last two ISRs. The ISRs reported IFRs were submitted quarterly and that
the project was compliant with respect to the audits; these findings are however contradicted by
the disbursement challenges which plagued the project. The unique opportunity for collaboration
between IDA/GPOBA and IFC provided by the project was not fully utilized in the initial stage of
project supervision and implementation; however this was later improved in the subsequent
extended period with good results. Bank performance at supervision is rated moderately
unsatisfactory.




                                               18
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Despite the moderately satisfactory quality at entry, the issues raised during the first phase of the
implementation and the Bank team not conducting a mid-term review were major deficiencies.
Hence, despite the significant efforts made during the last year of implementation to bring the
project to a successful completion, overall Bank performance is rated as moderately
unsatisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance (Moderately Satisfactory)

The Government, through the MoH and MoFP, were closely involved in the preparation of the
PPP hospital project. While not directly involved in the day-to-day running of the PPP hospital
project, the Government served as the main repository of information on the project, supported
the Bank team during the missions and assisted Tsepong in handling implementation bottlenecks
brought to its attention. Given the tension between the IM and Tsepong, the MoH ought to have
played a greater role of an arbiter. Government performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance (Moderately Satisfactory)

Tsepong did not take part in project preparation. It came on board after the key decisions
regarding the project design had been made between the Government and the Bank. Being the
agency responsible for the implementation of the project, it was envisaged that it would reconcile
the PPP Agreement with the GPOBA Operational Manual with respect to the payment
mechanisms and also inform the IM regarding the GPOBA project; however, these did not take
place as envisaged. The change in the critical staff of Tsepong involved in the preparation of the
project together with the inconsistencies between the PPP Agreement and the GPOBA Grant
Agreement led to confusion on the project’s implementation arrangements in the beginning.
Tsepong was instrumental in the delivery of the main PPP hospital project and realization of the
achievements as noted above in section 3.2. In addition, Tsepong (through Netcare) was proactive
in extending a loan to cover GPOBA disbursement delays. Tsepong’s performance is rated
moderately satisfactory.

The IM got to know about the GPOBA project’s disbursement arrangements and their role
regarding the project in mid 2011. When it was provided with relevant documentation, it was able
to prepare the IM reports, although with variable quality. As explained in section 2.3 the end-line
study revealed many inconsistencies with the quality of data. The IM’s performance is rated
moderately satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

In light of the moderately satisfactory rating for Government’s performance, moderately
satisfactory rating for both Tsepong and the IM, overall performance of the borrower is rated
moderately satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

Lesotho has demonstrated the ability to build and operate a complex hospital under a PPP
Agreement in a low income setting. QMMH is possibly the first hospital of its kind in the


                                                 19
developing world built on the PPP model of design, finance, build and operate. The lessons
generated by Lesotho will be valuable to countries seeking to build hospitals using a similar
approach. It is however important to know at the outset that these lessons reflect the present phase
of implementation of the main PPP hospital project.

Preparation and Design

The relationship between the GPOBA project and the main PPP hospital project should
have been clarified at the outset. This should have explained whether or not the GPOBA project
was designed as an integral part of the larger one and elaborated the project’s rationale as well as
scope in terms of objectives and key outputs attributable to the project. Secondly, the design of
the GPOBA project ought to have been revised upon conclusion of the PPP Agreement.

Implementation

Project launch workshop. A project launch workshop could have been organized between the
Bank group and implementing agencies in order for all parties to be on the same page with
respect to implementation arrangement, disbursement procedures and reporting requirements.
Implementation arrangements as well as working relationships between various entities needed to
be clear and accepted by all parties prior to the GPOBA project implementation.

Opportunities for learning and innovation. The project was part of one of the largest health
PPP projects for the Bank in Africa and had a unique collaborative implementation framework
involving the Bank, IFC and GPOBA. This provided opportunities and the environment for
“learning by doing” and innovation.

Collaboration between IFC and IDA/GPOBA. The project demonstrated the potential for
collaboration between IDA/GPOBA and IFC and also highlighted the need for improved
interaction and exchange of information in fostering greater collaboration especially during
project preparation and implementation. The main PPP hospital project was conceived under the
Health Sector Reform Program Phase II (HSRP Phase II) (Cr. 4118-LSO), which then
approached IFC to provide advisory services. In the end, IFC working together with the HRSP
Phase 2 team approached GPOBA for grant funding. As a result of the strong collaboration
between the IDA team, IFC and GPOBA in the last one year of implementation, the project
overcame the disbursement challenges and achieved a 100% disbursement rate.

Managing the Transition Process. In changing to a state of the art hospital built through a PPP
arrangement, a plan is necessary to: (a) manage functions previously performed by the previous
hospital but excluded under the PPP Agreement; (b) strengthen the referral system as well as
performance of up-country hospitals to avoid inappropriate referrals; and (c) implement a robust
public relations program to inform and explain to the public the status and role of the new
hospital as well as its operations to avoid undue expectations. Better management of the transition
process also helps when there is a change in Government as happened in Lesotho.

Importance of Technical Assistance. Given the complexity of the PPP operation, the
Government should have strengthened the PPP unit with a core group of officers competent in
PPPs right from inception of the project. While technical assistance was not provided for in the
beginning, the Government later contracted a firm to provide technical assistance to build the
capacity of the PPP Unit in the MoH to oversee implementation of the main PPP hospital project,




                                                20
through the support of IFC. The complexity of the QMMH PPP should not be under-estimated
and it is essential that the project is monitored for the purposes of learning.

The Government cannot outsource the monitoring function in its entirety to an IM. The
Government needs to build internal capacity to manage changes to contract scope and
specifications. While the IM monitors the PPP Agreement, it is important to put in place a system
to monitor the impact of the new hospital on the national health services and to handle variations
arising from the implementation of the PPP Agreement. For example, management of human
resources for health (HRH) is critical for Lesotho and clear measures need to be put in place so
that national HRH policy actions complement the operations of the new hospital as well as
broader delivery of health services in Lesotho without causing disruptions as is likely when the
proposed hike in the salaries of Government staff comes into effect.

Lessons for PPPs in General

Management of proprietary information under a PPP Agreement. While it is prudent to
restrict proprietary information under a PPP Agreement, for effective collaboration of the
different parties involved in the execution of the project, it is pertinent that measures to handle
such proprietary information are agreed upon without prejudicing the interests of the main parties.
In this particular case, the relevant part of the PPP Agreement could have been availed to the
GPOBA project team under a comprehensive disclosure agreement and/or the relevant additions
made in the Grant Agreement and operational manual without necessarily disclosing the full PPP
Agreement to the GPOBA team.

Verification Processes of Complex PPP Projects. Complex PPP projects usually involve
complex verification processes. To avoid disagreements during project execution, the verification
framework should be piloted and appropriate adjustments made. Agreement on interpretation of
the main elements of the framework and level of discretion by the IM in using the framework
should be agreed at the same time. In addition, the design of the verification process for a tertiary
hospital ought to drive clinical outcomes relevant for such a hospital.

Managing Cost Escalation. PPP payment mechanisms are based on results/outputs and pose
specific challenges for traditional approaches to budgetary appropriation which, if not handled
well, can lead to cost escalation. There is a need to introduce a ceiling cap – a cap on the
proportion of the MOH’s expected future annual revenue that can be used to pay the Unitary
Payment for the project. The budgetary institutions and practices as well as health services
management systems including patient referrals and the monitoring framework should adequately
support the operations of the PPP and mitigate undue cost overruns. Because of their duration,
PPP concessions tend to face uncertainties, and attempts should be made to the extent possible to
address the factors likely to cause variation in the agreement to avoid possible cost escalation.

(a) Grantee/Implementing agencies

Tsepong, the PPP Operator, jointly with the MoH prepared a completion report. The report

Annex 2. Submission to the Panel of Experts

Lesotho PPP Hospital (Queen Mamohato Memorial Hospital) Project (P104403)

Grant recipient: Tsepong Ltd
Grant amount: USD 6,250,000
Signing date: February 23, 2009
Effectiveness date: September 23, 2009
Closing date: December 31, 2012

Project objective. Increase access and quality of healthcare services provided by the new public
hospital and existing filter clinics under a PPP Agreement between GoL and a private operator,
though the use of an OBA approach.

Status (as of August 2008) — Panel of Experts Discussion. Most of the presentation by the
Project Team regarding the Lesotho PPP project to a Panel of Experts (POE), revolved around the
project’s Performance Indicators (PIs.). The POE was apprised of the revisions to the PIs from
the initial proposal. Most remained the same with the exception that they were treated more
specifically. The major change was that the new monitoring system included differentiating
hospitals and filter clinics. According to the meeting minutes: “Each PI has a comprehensive
description and a quarterly key target.” Please see abbreviated PPP Performance Indicator Table
appended to this document with Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) linked to disbursements color
coded.

Status (as of June 2012). Project has a satisfactory implementation rate. Filter clinics started
providing services in May 2010 to 335,000 outpatients by July 2011 vis-à-vis the target of
258,000 patients required by the PPP contract. The PPP hospital, Queen Mamohato Memorial
Hospital, opened in October 2011, and the number of outpatient visits and bed occupancy rates
are higher than anticipated.

Issues. Project shows a low disbursement rate of US $521,061.27 (8%). Disbursements have not
been processed since November 2011, when the second disbursement for US $1,800,000 was
claimed to the Bank for medical services provided by the filter clinics. This claim was rejected by
the Bank due to the following reasons:
1. The recipient did not provide consistent supporting documentation on the achievement of each
of the seven key performance indicators (KPI) required to trigger the expected quarterly
disbursements. The recipient has collected data and reported on only three key performance
indicators. These indicators relate to volume of services provided (outpatient visits and inpatient
admissions) and patient service satisfaction. The other four indicators relate to the quality of
services provided and management, which are already being measured through the PPP
agreement and under the GPOBA project.

2. The recipient’s failure to meet reporting standards and requirements for four indicators, and the
lack of agreement on the recipient’s performance, prevented the Independent Monitor from
conducting the verification and producing the required final report that supports each quarterly
Withdrawal Application, including indication of the disbursement amount. This has resulted in
accumulation of quarterly claims dating back to October 2010.

Proposed solution. On April 16-20 and June 11-26, 2012, the Bank has been on mission to
Lesotho to discuss and agree with the Ministry of Health Social Welfare (MoH), the recipient
(Tsepong), on reducing the KPIs so that disbursements are made upon measurable volume of


                                                23
services, namely: 1) total number of outpatient visits, 2) total number of inpatient admissions; and
3) patient and family satisfaction rate. This solution will facilitate both data collection and
classification in a way that is verifiable by the Independent Monitor (since it is based on patient
files and clinic records), and acceptable to the Bank for disbursements. The other four quality
indicators will remain part of the monitoring and evaluation framework, but delinked from
disbursements. In addition, and delinked from disbursements, Tsepong will also describe the type
of services to clarify the services the Grant is paying for. The missions’ results have been
debriefed with AFR’s sector leader and manager and GPOBA team.

Presentation for POE: Modification of the KPIs, the changed reporting of reduced indicators,
along with the developed rationale for all modifications is being presented for PoE endorsement.

Next steps. After such endorsement, Tsepong will: 1) finalize and submit a revised Operations
Manual for Bank clearance to adjust the required KPIs (no amendment to Grant Agreement is
required); 2) present a second withdrawal claim (covering the quarter October -December 2010)
of about US$ 496,000 with the agreed supporting documents; 3) continue to report, under a new
template, the achievement of the reduced indicators (service volume and satisfaction) in the past
due quarters for independent verification; and 4) submit a disbursement schedule and
corresponding withdrawal application with the respective independent verification reports and the
IFRs.

1.   INTRODUCTION

The Government of Lesotho has entered into an 18 years agreement with Tsepong to design,
build, partially finance, maintain and operate the National Referral Hospital in Maseru as well as
rehabilitate, re-equip and operate 3 filter Clinics (Mabote, Qoaling, Likotsi). Tsepong was
established as a special purpose vehicle for this PPP project and comprises of consortium led by
Netcare and four other shareholders namely Excel Health, Afri’nnai, Women Investment
Company and D10 Investments. The local empowerment requirements of the project are satisfied
by the 40% shareholding held by local companies. The Government of Lesotho experienced early
benefits of this ambitious PPP initiative when construction work was completed on time and
within budget.

The project is financed by the disbursement of a fixed unitary payment by the Government of
Lesotho escalating with inflationary linked increases. The Global Partnership on Output Based
Agreement (GPOBA) was instituted to ease payment responsibility to the government by
financing the services provided by the filter clinics until the hospital was operational. The funds
were also meant to finance initial inpatient service of the hospital in the initial months of the first
year, facilitating partial payment of unitary fees on behalf of the Government of Lesotho.

This document provides a summary of the GPOBA project implementation from the perspective
of the Ministry of Health and Tsepong.

2. OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

2.1 Project Title: Global Partnership on Output Based Aid (GPOBA)

2.2 Project Recipient: Tsepong (Pty) Ltd

2.3 Project Schedule
The agreement was signed in February 2009 with the precondition that the Operational Manual
and the Independent Monitor contract be finalised. The effective date was September 2009 with
closing during December 2011.

2.4 Project schedule variation

In December 2011, the project implementation period was extended to December 2012 due to
delays in the disbursements of funds. The disbursement procedures were clarified and
performance indicators revised.

2.5 Project Objectives

The objectives of the project were to increase access and improve the scope and quality of
healthcare services delivered in the Kingdom of Lesotho through the replacement of the existing
referral hospital, the Queen Elizabeth II Hospital; and to leverage private sector expertise in the
management and operation of the medical facilities through the introduction of current
management practices, high tech medical equipment, and clinical know how.

The objectives would be achieved through subsidy provided for inpatient services at the National
Referral Hospital, and outpatient services at three filter clinics under the management of Tsepong.

2.6 Project Budget: US$ 6.25 million

2.7 Actual Funds Received: US$: 6.25 million.

2.8 Project budget and actual gap

The movement in the exchange rate has however negatively impacted the value to the operator
resulting in a funding gap.

3. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION

The filter clinics became operational from May 2010 onwards following the rehabilitation of
Qoaling and Mabote filter clinics and the construction of Likotsi filter clinic.

The clinics were designed as nurse led facilities but due to demand were staffed with clinicians,
nursing and support staff. From inception, the services included consultations by physicians and
nurse clinicians as well as dental services, ophthalmology, the dispensing of medicine, ante natal
care and family planning. Minor procedures and wound care are also provided. The services
further include the provision of Anti-retroviral and TB treatment as well as the management of
sexually transmitted diseases. The clinics also provide access to basic radiology and ultrasound,
as well as pathology services.

Maternity services were introduced three months after project implementation during September
2010. The service has since been provided on a 24hr basis for uncomplicated deliveries, with
high risk and complicated pregnancies being referred to the hospital. A patient transport service is
provided from the clinics to hospital for all referrals and maternity related complications.

3.1 Patient Activity

A total of 625,672 outpatients received services at the three clinics from May 2010 to December
2012, with a monthly average of 6,517 outpatients per clinic. The clinics recorded 4,937
deliveries during the period September 2010 to December 2012 with an average of 51 deliveries
recorded per clinic per month. No mortality was recorded at any of the clinics during this period.

A total of 26,987 inpatients were admitted at Queen ‘Mamohato Memorial Hospital from October
2011 to December 2012. Both in and out patient activities exceeded the contractual numbers.

3.2 Patient Satisfaction

Patient and family satisfactions rates are measured through the daily collection of survey forms
completed by patients using the services. The collated information is compiled into monthly and
quarterly satisfaction reports. The number of responses per facility however has a significant
impact on the calculated rate with low response rates, potentially skewing satisfaction rates.

During the period from October 2011 to December 2012, a total of 57 605 responses were
collected and analyzed at QMMH. The annual average number of patients who indicated
satisfaction of 75% and above was 85%. During the same period, a total of 20 970 responses
were collected and analyzed at the three filter clinics and 81% of patients indicated satisfaction
rates above 75% with Likotsi, Qoaling and Mabote respectively recording satisfaction rates of
91 %, 79% and 73%.

4   MONITORING

The monitoring process was aligned to the contractual service specifications recorded in the main
PPP agreement as reviewed on site during the Independent Monitor’s quarterly inspections. The
indicators cover wide-ranging service elements throughout the operations. The quarterly scores
are included in the schedule below.

An initial set of key performance indicators was identified specifically for the GPOBA. Lack of
clarity on the collection and verification method let to the inability to monitor the project as
originally intended. The indicators were revised to include three indicators only namely, Number
of Outpatients, Number of Inpatients and Patient satisfaction. Compliance to the indicators was
verified by the Independent Monitor who compiled the relevant reports for the Bank on quarterly
basis post site verification.

A dramatic reduction in penalty values was observed over the period under review indicating
continuous improvement in quality and service compliance.

The facilities are also contractually required to be accredited with the Counsel for Health Service
Accreditation of Southern Africa (COHSASA) within two years of operation. All three clinics
have received full accreditation in May 2013, having attained an overall score of 93%.

4.1 Project reports

Tsepong prepares monthly performance reports for submission to the MOH which were shared
with the World Bank as part of the monitoring requirements.

4.2 Financial management

Tsepong complied with the financial management requirements of the project through the
opening of a designated account. Disbursements were unfortunately delayed due to lack of clarity
on the process to be followed.

5       PROJECT MAIN CHALLENGES

       Finalisation of the implementation manual was only completed after the project
        implementation period, resulting in lack of clear guidance.
             o Upon completion, the project implementation manual did not correlate with the
                 GPOBA agreement which rendered it difficult to implement.
       Funding was not disbursed within the scheduled timeframe. The delays contributed directly
        to the operator’s ability to commission services and systems required for the project
        therefore, the project had to source funding from one of its shareholders, Netcare Ltd, to
        sustain its services.
       Extensive reliance of the bank on the Independent Monitor despite interventions contributed
        to the delays.
       The actual payment was significantly lower than budget due to devaluation in the exchange
        rate, leaving the funding gap for the shareholders.
       The project performance indicators initially identified for monitoring the project were not
        aligned to the main PPP agreement and did not match the elements routinely measured by
        the IM. Data for those indicators was available, but there was no mechanism put in place to
        analyse data to produce the project required information.
