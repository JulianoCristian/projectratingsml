Under the project, the Government\n            of Aceh awarded a sub-project contract to Organization A and\n            another non-governmental organization, Organization B.\n            Shortly thereafter, the Government of Aceh and Organization\n            B concluded a Sub-Grant Agreement (the Sub-Grant Agreement),\n            which contained the implementation details of the\n            Sub-Project. The Sub-Grant Agreement provided a specific\n            procurement plan regarding rental cars needed for the\n            Sub-Project. Organization B\u2019s General Manager was in charge\n            of the procurement process. Evidence indicates that\n            Organization A\u2019s Director repeatedly requested that\n            Organization B\u2019s General Manager rent his personal car and\n            Organization A\u2019s advisor\u2019s car, in violation of the\n            procurement requirements of the Sub-Grant Agreement.\n            Evidence further suggests that, on one occasion,\n            Organization A\u2019s Director threatened Organization B\u2019s\n            General Manager in his attempt to have her rent his personal\n            car. Evidence also indicates that Organization A\u2019s Director\n            submitted a false car registration for his personal car in\n            order to give the appearance that his vehicle complied with\n            the requirements of the Sub-Grant Agreement."}, "docdt": "2016-01-01T23:22:03Z"}
