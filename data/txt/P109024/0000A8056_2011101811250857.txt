                         projects focus on livestock, agriculture (cocoa, coffee, rice, patchouli, etc), fisheries, and small scale enterprise. The second component focuses on capacity building for the provincial
                         government in project management. The project is financed by the Multi-donor Fund for Aceh and Nias (MDF).

                         Although the project has faced substantial implementation days since its inception, it has made recent progress and is accelerating activities at the community level. While the project

                         offers an innovative design, it has met challenges that have affected progress related to procurement, financial management and project management. Despite these challenges, the
                         project has now gained considerable momentum and has begun to achieve its original development objectives. EDFF continues to have strong backing from stakeholders at all
                         levels. The project is a key element of the Government's plans to make the transition from tsunami reconstruction to sustainable economic development.

                         The short remaining implementation timeframe had been a challenge for the problem as it was estimated, that because of the delays, 75% of all production and storage facilities that
                         will be built under EDFF will become operational in the last the months of the project. This leaves extremely little time for correcting defects and coaching of the beneficiaries,
                         producer groups, cooperatives, marketing forums. Despite that the project lags behind its targets in terms of disbursement, many of the sub-projects have made substantial progress
                         on the ground and in the communities, particularly over the last six months. The government is exploring the possibility of an extension to allow the critical time needed to complete
                         physical construction, and many training activities, and increase sustainability of the project's major physical and human capital investments.

                         Project status summary

                         Sub-grant agreements have been signed with eight international and local non-governmental organizations (sub-project implementing entities, or SIEs) for a total value of US$ 42.7
                         million.

                         Component 1:

                         Sub-Project Selection: The Sub-project Selection Committee was set up by a decree of the Governor of Aceh in March 2009. Proposals were scored according to agreed selection
                         criteria and the Committee selected eight proposals, with a total estimated cost of $44.5 million. The eight selected sub-projects include a range of activities covering most of the key
                         agricultural and fishery products of Aceh with a good geographical range across the province.

                         Implementation: All sub-projects are now underway. Beneficiary selection has been completed and capacity building for beneficiaries and government workers is ongoing.
                         Preparation for infrastructure to support processing and other value-added activities has begun. Following is a summary of all the EDFF sub-projects:

                         Component 2: The Project Management Unit (PMU) and Project Secretariat were established in the early stages to foster effective project implementation, and international
                         consultants mobilized to support them in September 2009. To help build capacity to manage similar projects in the future, central and local governments participated in the process
                         for procuring consulting firms, selecting sub-projects, reviewing implementation plans submitted by the SIEs and monitoring implementation progress. The Government of Aceh,
                         which has responsibility for implementing the project, has continuously supported EDFF through co-financing and linking the related technical agencies and districts in order to build
                         project ownership early on, as well as developing an exit strategy. In the recent months, the PMU has focused on helping the SIEs that were approved late last year to get their
                         activities started; improving FM and procurement capacity of SIEs to speed up project implementation; and project monitoring. With all sub-projects selected as of December 2010,
                         the project team was able to finalize indicators of project outcomes and outputs .
