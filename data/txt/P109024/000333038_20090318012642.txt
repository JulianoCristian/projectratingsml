ACEH- ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FINANCING FACILITY PROJECT 
 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
 
1. 
The devastation of the December 2004 Tsunami coupled with the preceding years of civil 
unrest contributed to high unemployment and poverty in Aceh. A large share of the Aceh 
population remains vulnerable with average consumption just above the poverty line, so that a 
small shock such as the end of the reconstruction effort could send some of them back into 
poverty. The Tsunami not only caused tremendous loss of life, but ended the prospects of long 
term employment for many people. Some 80,000 small and medium sized enterprises, providing 
employment to some 140,000 people were destroyed. The reconstruction has created new job 
opportunities in some sectors (construction, transport), but these jobs have been closely linked to 
the availability of reconstruction funds and are not likely to be sustainable in the long run.  
2. 
The Government of Indonesia (GOI) and the provincial Government of Aceh (GoA) have 
committed to building the community of Aceh back to being stronger and better than it was pre-
Tsunami. Both have identified economic growth and development as essential elements of 
recovery from the Tsunami. The GoA, in its Medium Term Development Plan (RPJMD), has 
ide
ntified key factors hampering Aceh’s economic development as weak government 
institutions, damaged infrastructure and low investment levels. It has elaborated its strategic 
framework for economic development which identifies three lead economic sectors-- agriculture, 
trade and services, key because of their contribution to both regional production as well as 
employment.  The GoI, through BAPPENAS has likewise produced a broad blue print for the 
future development of Aceh. 
3. 
The current reconstruction effort, estimated at approximately US$7.7 billion spread over 
a
five years period (2005-2009), is one of the largest such efforts in a developing country. The 
generosity of donors and the reconstruction program have been lifting Aceh’s economy in the 
short run. The reconstruction effort has been creating a construction boom in some parts of the 
province. Aceh’s economy is dominated by oil and gas production, which accounts for 28 
percent of regional GDP (2007) and over 90 percent of the province’s exports. However, the 
mining and related manufacturing sectors have been declining for several years and known gas 
reserves are projected to decline to near zero by 2014. This together with current growth trends, 
concentrated in sectors linked to the availability of large funds for reconstruction reinforces 
concerns regarding Aceh’s economy beyond 2009. Therefore, new efforts are needed to create 
conditions for sustainable long term economic recovery and development in Aceh’s economy in 
order to create jobs and reduce poverty. 
4. 
The proposed Economic Development Financing Facility project (EDFF), a MDF Grant 
consisting of two main components to be implemented during January 2009-June 2012 period, 
will support initiatives to promote sustainable economic growth and job creation in the whole of 
Aceh, in line with the GoA’s RPJMD and BAPPENAS’ blueprint. 
Component One (US$44.5 
million)
 will support sub-projects that address critical issues affecting economic development in 
Aceh by contributing to economic recovery post-tsunami and building a more competitive and 
supportive business environment necessary to create broad based private sector job opportunities 
and growth, targeting the poor and other vulnerable groups. 
Component Two (US$5.5 million) 
Page  8
ii
will fund project management and capacity building including an international consultancy to 
assist the project management.  
5. 
The sub-projects to be supported under the project should contribute to the following 
development objectives identified by the GoA as key for sustainable economic recovery and 
development in Aceh: (i) development of job-creating, market-driven enterprises engaged in 
value-added processing and manufacturing, especially in agriculture and fisheries; (ii) 
sustainable improvement of production quality and value in agriculture, fisheries and estate crops 
that contributes to alleviation of poverty; (iii) increase in international trade, especially direct 
exports; and (iv) increased domestic and foreign investment in Aceh. To achieve these goals, the 
EDFF will support sub-projects in the following broad areas: (i) Improving the business 
environment; (ii) Private Sector Support; and (iii) Public Infrastructure. 
6. 
The State Ministry for Disadvantaged Areas (KPDT) will be the GOI’s lead
 
implementing
 
agency at the central level. The implementation of the project rests with the GoA 
thru BAPPEDA Aceh, which will house the Project Management Unit (PMU) with support by an 
international consultant management firm. The sub-projects will be implemented by different 
entities (such as NGOs (local and international), private sector organizations and international 
aid agencies). They will prepare the sub-project application and be responsible for tracking 
performance of their individual sub-project consistent with the agreed upon milestones and 
performance indicators. The progress in achieving the project's objectives will be measured 
through a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation system. The World Bank will serve as the 
partner agency under the MDF legal framework and will be responsible for EDFF project 
supervision. The World Bank will conduct implementation reviews, as part of its normal 
supervision, on a semi-annual basis, supplemented by more frequent reviews during the initial 
implementation period. 
7. 
The project faces several risks, the most important of which are: that the GoA is not able 
to fulfill its role in overseeing the implementation of the project; weak governance and capacity 
at various levels impact the timely implementation of sub-projects; and the risk that conflict may 
recur. The mitigation measures identified are either currently underway, or are built into the 
project design. An Anti-Corruption Action Plan has been designed for the project, during 
implementation; World Bank team will monitor the elements of this Action Plan. 
8. 
Procurement will be carried out in accordance with the World Bank’s “Guidelines: 
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits” dated May 2004 as amended in October 2006, 
“Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers” dated May 
2004 as amended in October 2006, and the provisions stipulated in the Grant Agreement. The 
accounting policies and procedures will substantially follow GOI’s financial management 
procedures, strengthened where appropriate. Grant expenditures and activities will be reported to 
the World Bank on a quarterly basis. 
9. 
The EDFF is classified as a B category project as defined in the World Bank Operational 
Policy. As such, all sub-projects to be financed by the EDFF must be in compliance with national 
environmental rules and regulations, as well as with environmental policies of the World Bank.  
The sub-projects that will be financed by the EDFF are small and medium scale and as such the 
level of associated social risks is limited. It is anticipated that none of the World Bank social 
Page  9
iii
safeguards policies will be triggered. There is a need to ensure that the project will benefit both 
men and women and takes women’s special needs into account, strengthening their participation 
in the economy and considers constraints to their participation. This will be addressed and 
monitored at the subproject level.

COUNTRY AND SECTOR ISSUES
 
1. 
The devastation of the December 2004 Tsunami coupled with the preceding years of civil 
unrest contributed to high unemployment and poverty in Aceh. A large share of the Aceh 
population remains vulnerable with average consumption just above the poverty line, so that a 
small shock such as the end of the reconstruction effort could send them back into poverty.  The 
Tsunami not only caused tremendous loss of life, but ended the prospects of long term 
employment for many people. It is estimated that 80,000 small and medium sized enterprises 
(SME)
1
,
providing employment to 140,000 people were destroyed. The reconstruction has 
created new job opportunities in some sectors (construction, transport), but these jobs have been 
closely linked to the availability of reconstruction funds and are not likely to be sustainable in the 
long run. Annex 1 provides details on country and sectoral issues. 
2. 
The Government of Indonesia (GOI), through the Agency for Rehabilitation and 
Reconstruction for Aceh and Nias (BRR), and the provincial Government of Aceh (GoA) have 
committed to building the community of Aceh back to being stronger and better than it was pre-
Tsunami. Both have identified economic growth and development as essential elements of 
recovery from the Tsunami. The GoA, in its Medium Term Development Plan (RPJMD), has 
identified
 key factors hampering Aceh’s economic development as weak government 
institutions, damaged infrastructure and low investment levels. The RPJMD also identifies key 
constraints for economic activity for some sectors: in agriculture, availability of land, low 
productivity, low quality of production and lack of access to inputs and markets are identified as 
constraints in manufacturing, weak business environment, low quality of production as well as 
the failure to adopt recent technological changes. Aceh’s economy is dominated by oil and gas 
production, which accounts for 28 percent of regional GDP (2007) and over 90 percent of the 
province’s exports. However, the mining and related manufacturing sectors have been declining 
for several years and known gas reserves are projected to decline to near zero by 2014. This 
together with current growth trends, concentrated in sectors linked to the availability of large 
funds for reconstruction reinforces concerns regarding Aceh’s economy beyond 2009. 
3. 
Aceh’s economy contracted in 2004 (pre-Tsunami) by 10 percent and experienced a 
further 10 percent decline in 2005 (post-Tsunami).
 
The contraction in the economy was the result 
of the declining mining and related manufacturing sectors, and the impact of the Tsunami, which 
caused a decline of the manufacturing and agricultural sectors. The economy grew at a modest 
1.6 percent in 2006, driven mostly by growth in the services sector, related to the reconstruction 
effort. In 2007 Aceh’s economy continued to decline, a result primarily of the decline in the oil 
and gas sectors. Without a significant recovery of the agricultural and manufacturing sectors,

Aceh will be facing a structural downturn as the reconstruction effort winds down in 2009. This 
could have negative implications for employment and poverty alleviation efforts

.
4. 
The current reconstruction effort, estimated at approximately US$7.7 billion spread over 
a
five years period (2005-2009), is one of the largest such efforts in a developing country. The 
generosity of donors and the reconstruction program have been lifting Aceh’s economy in the 
short run. The reconstruction effort commenced in 2005 and by 2006 was the main driver of 
economic growth.  The reconstruction effort has been creating a real construction boom in some 
parts of the province, but since it has not addressed issues related to the competitiveness of 
Aceh’s economy and the sustainability of current growth trends, it is not strictly in line with the 
BAPPENAS Master Plan which foresees the recovery of Aceh’s economy as part of the third 
phase of the province’s reconstruction. In addition, the large aid influx and initial supply side 
constraints have contributed to high inflation levels. Inflation reached over 40 percent year-on-
year in December 2005. The differential between Aceh and the national inflation level has been 
declining since then, but in May 2008 inflation in Aceh, at 15.3 percent, was still significantly 
higher than the national inflation level, at 10.4 percent.  
5. 
In Aceh, investment as a share of GDP was only 7 percent in 2004, well below the levels 
in the rest of Indonesia or other countries in the region. Investment has increased significantly 
since then, a result of the massive reconstruction funds being invested in the province, and by 
2006 it was worth 14 percent of GDP. This is still significantly lower than investment in the rest 
of the country.  A renewed effort is needed to rehabilitate the agricultural sector to improve job 
opportunities in the longer term.  The pre-conditions for economic recovery are in place. There is 
better political stability and greater institutional support for economic growth. Knowledge is 
accumulating as to the realistic possibilities of critical sectors to develop and the framework for a 
coherent economic growth strategy is coming into place. The next phase in providing assistance 
to the communities and rural areas in Aceh should expand upon the past successes.  
6. 
GoA’s Economic Development Strategy. 
Recognizing the extent of the devastation, the 
GOI declared the Tsunami in Aceh a national disaster and formulated a master plan for the 
reconstruction of Aceh. Challenges to the successful recovery of Aceh were identified, which 
included socio-economic needs of all sectors, restoration of local institutions and implementation 
capacity as well as building peace and reconciliation.  One of the key principles of this plan was 
that 
“reconstruction should not rebuild poverty, but ensure that local economies are robust 
enough to prevent poverty over the long term”.
 The GoA through its elected Governor has again 
become the leader in strategic planning and direction for Aceh. Recently, it released its Medium 
Term Development Plan and (details on the RPJMD can be found in Annex 1). The GoA has 
elaborated its strategic framework for economic development based on the Triple-A concept, 
comprising of an 
Atlas
 (compilation of relevant economic data), 
Agenda
 (providing the 
economic development vision and strategies to promote economic development) as well as the 
Aturan-main
,
which explains the institutional mechanisms by which this vision and strategies 
can be implemented. This framework identifies three lead economic sectors for the province 
(agriculture, trade and services), key because of their contribution to both regional production as 
well as employment.

RATIONALE FOR MDF AND BANK INVOLVEMENT
 
7. 
Rationale for MDF Involvement
3
.
The Multi-Donor Fund for Aceh and Nias (MDF) 
brought together a pool of over US$650 million in pledged grant resources, provided by donor 
countries and international organizations to support the implementation of the Government's 
rehabilitation and reconstruction blueprint. The MDF was designed to contribute to the 
reconstruction of Aceh and to fund reconstruction gaps and enable a full rehabilitation of Aceh 
and Nias to at least their pre-disaster condition, while recognizing that more was needed to 
ensure that reconstruction was not simply to rebuild poverty. One of the targets of the 
reconstruction is 
the sustainable recovery of the region’s economy (production, trade, banking, 
etc.).
4
The overall goal of the GoI is to “Build Back Better” the whole of Aceh, which is 
supported by the goals of the MDF: poverty alleviation, livelihoods restarted, community 
infrastructure regenerated, larger infrastructure repaired, governance rebuilt and the environment 
sustained. 
8. 
Rationale for World Bank Involvement.
 The World Bank will serve as the partner agency.  
Its extensive involvement in Aceh as well as its broader developmental work in Indonesia and 
else where in the world provides it with a strong background for the project (Annex 2 provides a 
list of projects supported by the World Bank Group and other agencies). The World Bank has 
responded to the GOI request for assistance across areas where the institution possesses 
comparative advantage, building much on the central directions set out in the Indonesia Country 
Assistance Strategy FY04-07, namely the emphasis on the role of communities and local 
governments in shaping their own development objectives, and on the emphasis of the recently 
approved Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2009-12 for Indonesia on relying and 
strengthening government systems. The CPS also foresees continued World Bank involvement in 
Aceh and Nias for the duration of the CPS (until 2012) and the need for the MDF to support the 
transition from post-Tsunami reconstruction towards sustainable economic development in Aceh. 
9. 
The proposed EDFF project builds upon the networks and work by the World Bank at 
different levels in the province, namely, the Kecamatan Development Program, at the village 
level and the Support for Poor and Disadvantaged Areas at the district level. In addition, the 
World Bank has also been managing a research program on sustainable economic development 
in Aceh since 2006 to guide the dialogue with the regional government authorities preparing this 
project, monitoring macro-indicators in the province and more in-depth analysis on poverty, 
investment climate, sustainable development strategies as well as public finance.  
10. 
The World Bank is well positioned to add value in supporting the Indonesian authorities 
in the development and implementation of their economic development program, including 
providing technical assistance and advice on a broad range of policy issues relating to private 
sector development and job creation. The World Bank has a dedicated team which works closely 
with other teams based in Aceh working on conflict issues, infrastructure, land management and 
community development as well as the local staff of the International Finance Corporation (IFC), 
the private sector arm of the World Bank Group. The Team will supported by a larger team 
3
The rationale for the MDF involvement in funding the EDFF is based upon the March 31, 2005, memorandum 
from the Office of the President of the World Bank proposing its creation.

Darussalam and Nias Islands of the Province of North Sumatra (p. II-13).

based in Jakarta with wide-ranging expertise in economic management, rural and social 
development as well as private and financial sector development. In addition, the team is closely 
linked to the Private and Financial Sector Unit in the East Asia Region, thus will have access to a 
wider range of expertise and knowledge. 
C
.
HIGHER LEVEL OBJECTIVES TO WHICH THE PROJECT CONTRIBUTES
 
11. 
The higher level objectives to which the project contributes are post-tsunami economic 
recovery, sustainable economic development and poverty alleviation. 
In line with GOI’s and 
GoA’s own plans for the reconstruction of Aceh post Tsunami, the EDFF will also contribute to 
rebuilding those areas indirectly affected by the Tsunami. It will provide financing for ongoing 
activities which focus on the promotion of sustainable economic growth and the rehabilitation of 
livelihoods, with proven results to scale up quickly for greater impact on employment and long 
term economic development and will seek to finance new projects designed to fill other 
economic development gaps. 
II.  
PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
 
A
.
LENDING INSTRUMENT
 
12. 
The EDFF project, a US$50 million Facility funded by a grant from the MDF, consists of 
two components-- the first is a financing facility (US$44.5 million) and the second component 
will facilitate and strengthen the operation of the GoA’s and KPDT project management capacity 
(US$5.5 million). 
B
.
PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND KEY INDICATORS
 
13. 
The project will promote post-tsunami economic recovery and foster sustainable 
equitable long-term economic development in Aceh in line with the GoA’s own plans for 
economic development (RPJMD). To achieve this, the project will finance sub-projects that 
contribute toward the following development objectives, identified by the GoA as key for 
sustainable economic development in Aceh: 
(a) 
Development of job-creating, market-driven enterprises engaged in value-
added processing and manufacturing, especially in agriculture and fisheries; 
(b) 
Sustainable improvement of production quality and value in agriculture, 
fisheries and estate crops that contributes to alleviation of poverty; 
(c) 
Increase in international trade, especially direct exports; and 
(d) 
Increase in domestic and foreign investment in Aceh. 
14. 
These development objectives will be achieved through the following intermediate 
outcomes: (i) 
Improving the Business Environment:
 a better enabling environment for private 
sector development and investment; (ii) 
Private Sector Support:
 support to improving the 
productivity of the private sector, farmers and fishermen; and (iii) 
Public Infrastructure:
 
financing of economic infrastructure necessary for business development and job creation. The 
Page  14
5
beneficiaries of sub-projects will be either directly or indirectly the people and communities of 
Aceh. As a result of the defined beneficiary pool, the proponents of sub-projects will not be 
individuals. The focus of the project is on sustainable and equitable economic development. The 
project, while a sizable amount, is very small when measured against the economic development 
challenges and needs of Aceh and as such will serve as a starting point and demonstration of 
what can be done in the Aceh province. 
15. 
An important aspect of the project will be the building of capacity at BAPPEDA, the 
Development and Planning Agency of Aceh. BAPPEDA, with the assistance of an international 
consultant firm, will learn through hands on experience how to evaluate, select and monitor the 
implementation of sub-projects to support long term economic development. This is particularly 
important in light of the large amount of resources available to the provincial government and 
the recent decision to allocate the 
Special Autonomy Fund
 on a programmatic basis between the 
provincial and district governments. The experience gained under the project will better position 
the GoA to further its economic development agenda from its own resources. 
16. 
The following key performance indicators (KPI) will be used to assess progress toward 
achieving results in the development outcomes mentioned above: 
(a) 
Number of business constraints that were successfully alleviated in Aceh 
(b) 
Employment generated in enterprises supported by the project 
(c) 
Number of users of public infrastructure financed by the project 
(d) 
Success rate of sub-projects financed by the project 
 
C
.
PROJECT COMPONENTS
 
17. 
The project consists of two main components that will be implemented during the 
January 2009 
–
June 2012 period. The Facility will closely coordinate with activities related to 
economic development that have been implemented by others since the Tsunami as well as 
addressing some of the identified gaps. Later, it is anticipated that the GoA may supplement the 
Facility’s funds with its own resources in order to further the implementation of its strategy for 
economic development. 
18. 
Component One.
 
This component will support specific activities designed to promote 
economic recovery and development through addressing areas identified as needing further 
efforts, or which have not yet been addressed. It will support sub-projects that address critical 
issues affecting economic development in Aceh by contributing to building a more competitive 
and supportive business environment necessary to create broad based private sector job 
opportunities and growth in Aceh, targeting the poor and other vulnerable groups.  
19. 
The EDFF will support sub-projects which fill-in strategic and financing gaps, based 
upon the vision for economic development explicit in the RPJMD, in the following areas: 
(a) 
Improving the Business Environment 
(b) 
Private Sector Support 
(c) Public 
Infrastructure 
 
Page  15
6
20. 
The EDFF sub-projects will be based upon their ability to contribute to the EDFF 
development objectives and focus on the three areas mentioned above. Special attention will be 
paid to increasing the poor and women’s participation in the economy. A more detailed analysis 
of specific issues to be addressed and results to be accomplished by the individual sub-projects 
will be done at the sub-project level. Analysis of the constraints to sustainable economic growth 
and job creation and evaluation of activities proposed by the sub-project to address those 
constraints will be part of the selection process of any sub-project. In addition, as part of the 
application process, subproject proponents will be asked to discuss relevant activities in their 
sector that have been undertaken in Aceh by themselves or other reconstruction actors, with the 
aim of elaborating on success factors and lessons learned toward ensuring successful 
implementation. The analysis of the constraints for economic growth and job creation and 
possible activities to be financed at the project level is necessarily of a more macro or general 
nature given the fact this is a facility-type project and individual sub-projects and activities will 
only be identified at a later stage (Annex 4 provides a more detailed project description with the 
type of sub-projects that the project could finance to address identified constraints).  
21. 
Component Two
.
This will fund project management and capacity building including an 
international consultancy to assist the GoA in the establishment and management of the Project 
Management Unit (PMU) and the KPDT in the implementation of the project at the central 
government level. This will include 
sub-project assessment and review, procurement, financial 
management, safeguards compliance, implementation, supervision, monitoring, etc
.
In addition, the 
firm will also provide training and skills development to the local staff at PMU and the KPDT.  
D
.
LESSONS LEARNED AND REFLECTED IN THE PROJECT DESIGN
 
22. 
The project builds upon a large body of research and experience in private sector 
development and specifically draws upon the World Bank’s broad experience and specific 
Indonesian experience. A number of lessons have been learned from the review of reconstruction 
related economic development efforts to date. The project design takes into account the 
following lessons: 
(a) 
The project reflects lessons learned 
from analytical work following the Tsunami 
undertaken by the World Bank. The GoA has large resources at its disposal and it 
will continue to have resources for the foreseeable future. An inefficient 
allocation of resources and weak public financial management capacity however, 
is preventing translating such large resources into better public services or a 
stronger economy
5
.
Analysis of economic fundamentals has also identified some 
of the key problems facing Aceh today which this project will try to address. 
(b) 
The need for government commitment and ownership. 
It has been seen in a 
number of projects that without government’s real commitment, the project will 
not maximize the benefit and could fail to be sustainable. The GoA is highly 
committed to this project and has identified job creation, sustainable economic 
development and a viable private sector as essential to addressing post Tsunami 
5
World Bank, 2006, ‘Aceh Public Expenditure Analysis – Spending for Reconstruction and Poverty Reduction’ 
Page  16
7
reconstruction, objectives to be supported by the EDFF. The GoA has also 
committed to assign a team responsible for the EDFF project. 
(c) 
The need for transparency and a clear communications strategy. 
Clear and 
available information about the sub-projects, their successes and failures will help 
to provide valuable lessons to others in the community and may help to lessen 
dist
rust and the suspicion of favoritism. It will also facilitate “managing 
expectations” of citizens which will be critical as people seek jobs and face 
uncertain economic times. 
(d) 
The need to balance reconstruction needs
.
It is critical to design a sub-project 
selection process that originates with the local government so that investments 
financed respond to community needs and at the same time provide added 
capacity to the implementing party if it is the local government. As a result, the 
EDFF is designed to provide coordination and efficient management of available 
resources and sub-projects which reflect the overall economic development needs 
and priorities outlined in the GoA’s own economic development strategy. This 
will be achieved by requiring that EDFF-financed sub-projects be selected by the 
GoA based upon established criteria. 
(e) 
The importance of a strong focus on results
 coupled with achievable realistic 
milestones has been incorporated in project design. 
(f) 
The need for professional assistance 
in setting up and
 
operating the PMU has also 
been incorporated in the EDFF. 
(g) 
Lessons from other projects in the area of economic development being 
implemented in Aceh
.
There have been a series of projects focusing on livelihoods 
and economic recovery in the province. After over 3 years of implementation, 
these projects offer important lessons of what works and what does not and what 
are some of the success factors. The next CFAN meeting end of 2008 will focus 
on lessons learned in the reconstruction effort, including economic development. 
In addition, BRR will lead an exercise to distill lessons learned by agencies 
implementing projects in Aceh in the area of livelihoods and economic 
development and how these can be applied to the design of projects to be financed 
by EDFF.
 
(h) 
The need to ensure that the project will benefit both women and men. 
The project 
recognizes that without particular attention being paid to women’s special needs 
and constraints to increased participation, their ability to benefit from this project 
as well as to contribute to economic development in the province will be reduced. 
Therefore the project will take women’s special needs into account, strive to 
strengthen women’s participation in the economy and consider constraints for 
their participation. This will include measures for ensuring that gender 
considerations are addressed and monitored in the design and implementation of 
subprojects wherever possible. An inception report in the early stages of project 
Page  17
8
implementation will further elaborate on the 
strategy to take women’s special 
needs into account in the preparation of subprojects. 
E
.
ALTERNATIVE DESIGNS CONSIDERED AND REASONS FOR REJECTION
 
23. 
The proposed design was based on proposals of the GoA, BRR and the World Bank, and 
assessments of the best possible solution to begin to address the reconstruction needs for long 
term economic development in Aceh. Options for financing economic development sub-projects 
as envisioned under the EDFF are limited in the context of Aceh. However, the following 
approaches were considered: 
(a) 
Seeking multi-lateral and bi-lateral support
 specifically for economic 
development in Aceh.  Given the Multi Donor Trust Fund for the reconstruction 
of Aceh, this was rejected as duplicative and could result in various competing 
programs which may not necessarily address the gaps identified by the GoA. 
(b) 
Direct financing by the GoA
.
Current capacity constraints limited this option, but 
the project design recognizes that this approach for funding such activities in the 
future and thus the EDFF can serve as a good demonstration example. 
(c) 
Co-financing the EDFF with funds from the GoA
.
It was determined that possible 
misalignment of the budgetary cycles and administrative procedures could create 
undue delays.  The project as designed still provides GoA with a framework to 
build upon for its current and future economic development financing and does 
not foreclose the ability of the GoA to supplement the Facility with additional 
funds should it so desire. This may well be the case if the EDFF identifies a 
number of worthy proposals for which it does not have sufficient funding. 
(d) 
Financing by banks and others in the private sector
.
Discussions were held with 
the banking sector and the local bankers association, and it was determined that it 
would be several years of lost opportunity by waiting for a time when banks were 
ready to proceed. There are several concerns which have delayed lending and 
private sector investment.  
(e) 
Third party implementation
.
Concern over the speed of implementation resulted 
in discussions concerning using a third party to implement the project.  While 
there were considerable advantages to this, it was decided that for the overall long 
term development of Aceh it was important to have the local government in the 
lead role. 
(f) 
Sub-project identification
.
The team (which includes the GoA, BRR and the 
World Bank) considered soliciting sub-projects to fill very narrowly defined areas 
and to address very specifically defined needs. The team however decided that 
pre-determining specific sub-projects in advance and their required financing 
needs during preparation could result in gaps not being addressed in an optimal 
manner since not all information would be available at the time of project 
preparation. The GoA will benefit from a fairly strong PMU to assist in the sub-
projects selection process facilitating the identification of gaps and needs. 
Page  18
9
Furthermore, the team recognized that there is a wealth of information on gaps to 
promote sustainable economic growth and ways to address them by agencies 
currently implementing projects on the ground, and the best way to use that 
information is by soliciting proposals that allow Sub-project Implementing 
Entities (SIEs) maximum flexibility in project design through a guided call for 
proposals as proposed in the EDFF. 
III. IMPLEMENTATION 
 
A
.
PARTNERSHIP ARRANGEMENTS
 
24. 
The EDFF is structured as a programmatic operation with a framework type design in 
that it will fund a number of sub-projects which will be prepared, implemented and supervised 
by others. An agreement will be signed with the GOI and the KPDT which will be GOI
’s 
implementing
 
agency for the project at the central level. The KPDT will delegate the budget to 
the provincial government in Aceh as Dana Tugas Pembantuan and will establish a project 
Sakter, which will also be appointed by the Governor of Aceh as PMU for the project, located in 
BAPPEDA Aceh, and which will be responsible for the overall management of the annual 
budget. The World Bank will serve as the partner agency under the MDF legal framework, 
responsible for project supervision. 
B
.
INSTITUTIONAL AND IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS
 
25. 
Implementation Players and Functions. 
The
 
project will use a management structure 
supportive of local government participation, capacity building and achieving the maximum 
benefits from the EDFF. The implementation of the overall project rests with the GoA thru 
BAPPEDA, which will house the PMU. The PMU will be supported by an international 
consultant management firm. The individual sub-projects will be implemented by third parties as 
specified in this document.  The overall process of evaluating, selecting and monitoring of 
selected sub-projects has been designed to minimize unnecessary interference and duplication. 
Sub-project selection will take place after project approval to ensure transparency and 
consistency in the selection process. The BAPPEDA will manage the PMU and will play a key 
role in the selection process of sub-projects through leadership and participation in the Selection 
Committee. Although BAPPEDA Aceh will be the implementing agency of the EDFF at the 
provincial level, to ensure EDFF supports the implementation of the GoA strategies related to 
economic development in the province, it will be key to ensure the support of the relevant Dinas 
and district governments for activities financed through this project. The EDFF will support 
provincial level programs for the development of economic clusters; as such the fiscal 
responsibility for continuing activities financed through EDFF lies with the provincial 
government. Nonetheless it will be important to ensure the participation of the relevant districts 
and/ or Dinas in the identification of priorities and the design of subprojects. BAPPEDA Aceh 
has initiated discussions with the relevant Dinas which will intensify in the initial phases of 
project implementation. In addition, entities proposing subprojects for EDFF funding will be 
required to consult extensively with the relevant Dinas and district governments and to report 
their consultation efforts in the application. 
Page  19
10
26. The 
BAPPENAS
,
as the 
GoI’s executing agency, will be responsible for EDFF’s overall 
planning and evaluation consistent with the grant agreement between the World Bank and the 
GOI. It will also provide the necessary coordination with the Ministry of Finance (MOF), the 
KPDT and other central government agencies. The BAPPENAS will be responsible for 
counterpart financing (government staff honoraria, taxes and other operational expenses) for 
BAPPENAS and KPDT. The 
KPDT
 will be responsible for overall project implementation and 
budget execution including making an annual budget application to the MOF and establishing a 
project satker (Satuan Kerja) to be located in BAPPEDA Aceh that will be responsible for 
overall management of the annual budget (DIPA). The budget application will be allocated in the 
following manner: (i) payment to the consulting firm assisting BAPPEDA and KPDT, (ii) 
operating costs of BAPPEDA Aceh and KPDT, (iii) block grant for sub-projects at the provincial 
level. Further allocation of the block grants will not be possible at the time of the preparation of 
budget document (DIPA) since projects selection (and allocation of funds to sectors and districts) 
is part of project implementation. Finally, it will be responsible for dealing with withdrawal 
applications by the SIEs after they have been approved by the PMU. 
27. 
Project Management Unit.
 The PMU, to be located in BAPPEDA, will consist of the 
consulting management firm (to be hired with EDFF funding) as well as the GoA staff. The 
consulting firm will have two key interrelated roles. First, the firm will be responsible for the 
effective operation of the PMU and secondly, it will build capacity within the GoA to 
progressively assume the lead managerial role over the PMU. The firm will assist PMU in the 
evaluation of sub-project applications and monitoring. The Consultant firm will also ensure that 
the operation of the PMU with regards to financial management, procurement, communications 
are at an acceptable level to minimize risk and ensure good reporting. The PMU will prepare an 
Operations Manual (OM)
 
that
 
will guide project implementation and will list all project-related 
policies and procedures including details on the sub-project eligibility and monitoring criteria. 
The Operations Manual will be subject to approval by the World Bank. 
28. 
The World Bank.
 The World Bank, as partner agency will oversee the project. Its 
responsibilities, as specified in the Operations Manual for the MDF, will include: appraisal of the 
project, supervision, monitoring and evaluation and administration of the EDFF. The World 
Bank will also have responsibility for reviewing the Selection Committee’s selection of sub-
projects and issuing a No-Objection Letter (NOL) for the selection of each sub-project as well as 
issuing a NOL for each subproject’s detailed plan. In addition, the World Bank will regularly and 
randomly review sub-projects and will monitor results and report to the MDF on an on-going 
basis. 
29. 
Sub-project Eligibility and Selection. 
The sub-projects will be implemented by different 
entities (such as NGOs (local and/or international), private sector associations and international 
aid agencies) which will be responsible for ensuring that the sub-projects remain consistent with 
EDFF goals and are in line with the GoA RPJMD and BAPPENAS’ blueprint for Aceh’s 
recovery. They will prepare the sub-project application and, be responsible for tracking 
performance of their individual sub-project consistent with the agreed upon milestones and 
performance indicators. The sub-projects will be supervised by the PMU with general oversight 
by the KPDT and the World Bank as the partner agency responsible for the EDFF. In order to 
ensure that sub-projects financed under the EDFF project meet the World Bank and international 
standards for quality of investment and are sustainable, investments financed under the EDFF 
Page  20
11
will be evaluated prior to selection based upon eligibility criteria. The eligibility and selection 
criteria are available in Attachment 2 of Annex 7 and will be adopted by the PMU before the call 
for sub-project proposals. They will also be included in the Operations Manual. To keep the 
project manageable and avoid a large number of disintegrated sub-projects, the EDFF will accept 
applications between US$1 million and US$7 million and on an exceptional basis will consider 
sub-project applications larger than this amount, subject to World Bank approval. The EDFF will 
also consider up to three sub-projects between US$500,000 and US$1 million. A 
Selection 
Committee
 will be established to make the final selection of sub-projects. It will review sub-
project applications which have already successfully passed a preliminary screening performed 
by the PMU. The World Bank will review the
 PMU’s evaluation report on all proposals 
submitted to the Selection Committee as well as the Selection Committee’s report on the 
selection process of selected sub-projects to ensure compliance with the EDFF criteria and 
process, and issue No-Objection for each selection. 
C
.
MONITORING AND EVALUATION OF OUTCOMES
/
RESULTS
 
30. 
The progress in achieving the project's objectives will be measured through a 
comprehensive monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system (details are provided in Annex 3). On-
going reviews of sub-project implementation and progress as well as a formal Mid-Term Review 
(MTR, to be held during the second year of project implementation), will include a detailed 
assessment of the progress and achievements. The PMU, supported by its consultants and 
technical assistance (TA) as required, will implement the M&E framework, including the 
monitoring and evaluation of sub-projects. Each Sub-project Implementation Entity will be 
responsible to prepare a monitoring and evaluation plan consistent with the established criteria. 
Monitoring and evaluation at the subproject level will need to work with the beneficiary 
communities to ensure that the impact that the project is having on affected communities is 
adequately monitored. The PMU will evaluate progress on the indicators for each sub-project 
through regular reporting by SIEs. It will submit to the World Bank quarterly and more detailed 
yearly reports including output and outcome indicators for each of the selected sub-projects. The 
World Bank will conduct implementation reviews, as part of its normal supervision, on a semi-
annual basis, supplemented by more frequent reviews during the initial implementation period. 
The World Bank will be responsible for the monitoring and evaluation of the project as a whole 
and will provide reports every six months to the MDF of progress achieved, based on the M&E 
framework detailed in this document. 
D
.
TRANSITION STRATEGY AND SUSTAINABILITY
 
Transition Strategy 
31. 
Re-establishing, rebuilding and commencing businesses as well as the business 
community and business environment is necessary in order to reverse the destruction and impact 
(direct and indirect) caused by the Tsunami.  This is also necessary to compensate for the under-
development caused by years of political strife and to unlock the medium to long term 
development potential of Aceh. This is an enormous task. The risk that the efforts now underway 
might prove unsustainable is real. The EDFF can address but a small portion of the needs for 
achieving real economic development. The expiration of BRR’s mandate scheduled for April 
2009, beyond which local and provincial governments will need to undertake greater 
Page  21
12
responsibility for reconstruction program management, including economic development, are all 
factors to be considered in determining real impact. BRR’s exit and the need for new institutional 
arrangements to facilitate continued progress in economic development and private sector 
reconstruction require a transition strategy to prepare for the post-BRR period. The BRR has 
been the GOI instrument to interact with donors and other reconstruction actors. The EDFF will 
facilitate the transition from the BRR to the GoA by working with both during the early phases 
of project preparation. The KPDT will facilitate the transition of responsibilities from BRR to the 
provincial and district governments. In the meantime, the project will benefit from BRR’s 
experience in the identification and implementation of reconstruction and rehabilitation projects. 
32. 
Building Institutional Capacity:
 
The incentive framework under which the provincial 
government officials will operate in the context of EDFF is geared toward building lasting 
institutional capacity. For example, making EDFF resources available to finance the 
establishment and management of PMU is expected to enhance the ability to select and prepare 
similar economic development sub-projects in the future. Since this project is essentially being 
developed based upon the application of a post BRR process, no stand alone transition strategy is 
included, but will provide for institutional mechanisms aimed at facilitating exchanges of 
experience between the GoA and the BRR. In addition, the consulting firm assisting PMU will 
provide capacity building activities and it will be performing some key functions (financial 
management, procurement, safeguard compliance, monitoring and evaluation) to ensure 
sustainability of the project and a continuation of international best practices after the consulting 
firm has completed its assignment, and after the EDFF has been completed. 
33. 
Post-BRR Arrangements:
 The capacity building measures described above are designed 
to help the GoA work together with the BRR at the preparation and early stages of project 
implementation. The KPDT will continue to assist the GoA to implement this project after the 
BRR has phased out. In addition, the lessons and experience from the use of these measures 
should help to enhance local authorities’ ability to perform similar functions related to economic 
development and project management in the future.  
 
Sustainability 
34. 
A number of steps in the context of the EDFF are being (and will be) undertaken to 
promote the sustainability of economic development based upon the private sector and to 
facilitate the transition of local and provincial governments’ beyond BRR’s mandate. Sub-project 
applications will be evaluated based upon a number of factors, one of those will be (to the extent 
appropriate), the likely sustainability of the impact and results of the sub-project as well as its 
ability to enhance the capacity of those involved in the sub-project as well as those who may 
later have some role in managing to ensuring continued results of the sub-project. To that effect, 
the evaluation of subprojects will pay particular attention to the inclusion of the relevant Dinas 
and/ or District governments in consultations and the design of the subproject as appropriate. To 
the extent that activities will require the relevant Dinas and/ or District Government to assume 
responsibilities related to the subproject after completion, this should be clearly reflected and 
addressed in the application. Project sustainability is further enhanced by the GoA’s commitment 
to improve it business environment and to help facilitate private sector development and 
Page  22
13
resulting job creation.  The EDFF has been under preparation for sometime and, throughout this 
period, the GoA and the BRR have been very active and committed to EDFF objectives. The 
project approach permits attention to be paid initially to sub-projects with the greatest likelihood 
to show immediate results in addition to others that meet the terms and conditions of the facility.  
Support provided under the project also aims to further support sustainability by establishing a 
mechanism within the Facility to enhance GoA capacity to oversee similar activities in the future 
through the use of its own resources. These benefits should continue beyond the end of EDFF. 
35. 
Technical Assistance:
 The 
EDFF and some of the sub-projects will include TA 
components that emphasize hands-on training of those involved (often including beneficiaries) in 
the sub-project as well as GoA staff. Such TA is an important tool that will contribute to 
ensuring quality in the economic development sub-projects and should help to prepare local 
authorities for the post-BRR era. These capacity building efforts will cover a number of aspects 
of sub-project selection and implementation, including sub-project preparing detailed design and 
tender documents, safeguards compliance, procurement, sub-project supervision, and other 
development monitoring tools and anti-corruption measures.  
36. 
Ownership:
 
Steps will be taken to ensure that the GoA and as applicable the local 
communities in which sub-projects are implemented develop a sense of ownership with respect 
to the sub-projects financed by the EDFF. The GoA (thru its PMU) will be selecting all sub-
projects. All sub-project proposals will be required to show endorsement by the beneficiary 
communities or districts. The extent to which the agency proposing a subproject has undertaken 
consultations with the beneficiary communities and the relevant Dinas and/ or District 
Government and the degree of ownership of the project by these will be key selection criteria.  
E
.
CRITICAL RISKS AND POSSIBLE CONTROVERSIAL ASPECTS
 
37. 
The EDFF faces several risks, the most important of which are: that the GoA is not able 
to fulfill its role in overseeing the project implementation; weak governance and capacity at 
various levels impact the timely implementation of sub-projects; and the risk that conflict may 
recur. The team has discussed these risks and concluded that the overall risk assessment is
 
“substantial”
,
after mitigating factors are considered and in place. The mitigation measures 
identified are either currently underway, or are built into the project design. The key areas of risk 
have been identified as 
“General”,
 over which the project and the parties implementing have 
little control, but are nonetheless important factors which could impact negatively on the project; 
“Externalities”
 which are much more specific to the project, but still not totally within the 
control of the project, but must be considered and to the extent possible mitigated; 
“Implementation”
 risks are those risks viewed by the team as being to a much greater extent 
within the control of the project. The implementation risks are addressed through government 
actions currently underway or planned, or through efforts linked to the project itself. The 
potential rewards of the project are seen as sufficient to outweigh the risk in that without efforts 
such as the EDFF the risks in the community will only go higher. See Annex 6 for a listing of 
risks and proposed or existing mitigation steps. 
38. 
The size of the proposed project, the number of sub-projects to be undertaken, and the 
complexity of coordinating the programs to be financed with other programs to support 
economic development in Aceh, tasks assigned to a newly-established PMU, creates financial 
Page  23
14
management challenges. In addition, there are a number of risks associated with sub-project 
implementation. Anticipating and addressing these challenges in advance will significantly 
reduce the overall risk to the project. It is important that financial management processes and 
systems be in place such as an independent financial audit at the end of the fiscal year, the 
participation of Aceh Inspectorate in regular internal audits as well as the hiring of financial 
management experts to assist the implementation agencies (at the provincial and central 
government levels). Additional information on financial management provisions is provided in 
Annex 8.

IV. APPRAISAL 
SUMMARY 
 
A
.
ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
 
42. 
The EDFF is a framework type project and the activities will be selected and be subject to 
analysis only after effectiveness of the Grant. As such, it is not possible at this stage to assess the 
economic benefits of this project through cost-benefit analysis or assessment of the financial 
soundness of SIEs. Therefore, at this stage the analysis will focus on the soundness of the 
approach undertaken, to support the strategies of the provincial authorities to promote 
sustainable economic growth in the province and to improve the capacity of BAPPEDA and 
other relevant agencies to select, implement and monitor sub-projects that support economic 
development in Aceh. 
43. 
As elaborated in other sections of the PAD (see Annex 1) the economy in Aceh pre-
Tsunami was driven by the oil and gas fields in the East Coast, now in decline and with very 
little linkages to the rest of the economy. The reconstruction of the province after the Tsunami, 
with a large influx of funds and the implementation of vast reconstruction activities, has resulted 
in relatively high growth in the construction sector and other sectors closely related to the 
construction sector (trade, utilities, banking). As the bulk of the reconstruction effort comes to an 
end, and bearing in mind a relatively large number of unemployed people and the social unrest 
that may cause, the reconstruction agency, the national and provincial authorities and many 
donors have recognized the need to focus on putting Ac
eh’s economy on a more sustained and 
longer-term growth path with an effort to create more jobs at the center of this growth path. 
44. 
The provincial authorities, led by BAPPEDA, and with the assistance of several donors, 
have invested significant resources in identifying areas in which public funds can support 
economic growth in the province and address existing constraints to growth (see Attachments 1 
and 2 of Annex 1), such as improving the security condition in the province, investing in human 
capital, a focus on sectors where Aceh has a comparative advantage, such as agriculture, 
fisheries and agro-industry, infrastructure and the need to open the province to trade and 
investment. This project seeks to support the GoA’s own strategies to support economic growth. 
The GoA is likely to have the best information as to what are the key constraints for growth in 
the province and what sectors have the greatest potential. Technical assistance will be provided 
through this project to leverage that information and select a number of sub-projects to be 
Page  25
16
financed by the EDFF to provide the greatest benefits in terms of sustainable economic growth 
and the creation of jobs. Supporting the GoA’s own initiatives and priorities also increases the 
likelihood of the ownership and endorsement of financed activities by the local authorities and 
through that their sustainability. The project will also finance a consulting firm to support the 
government implementing agencies in managing this project. A key responsibility of this 
consulting firm will be to assist BAPPEDA in the evaluation of sub-projects, guided by a 
selection criteria spelled out in this project document and that will be further elaborated in the 
Operations Manual, to ensure that individual activities being financed have the highest pay off. 
B
.
TECHNICAL
 
45. 
The proposed approach, putting the provincial authorities, particularly BAPPEDA, in the 
driver’s seat, in designing and implementing the EDFF, will be important in improving the 
allocation of significant public resources in Aceh. The GoA will have significant public 
resources for the foreseeable future. As identified in the Aceh Public Expenditure Analysis 
(World Bank 2006), the key constraint regarding public spending in Aceh is not the availability 
of resources but how to spend these effectively. The provincial authorities, led by BAPPEDA, 
will be responsible for the allocation and joint implementation of the Special Autonomy Fund, 
worth Rp. 3.5 trillion in 2008. This project, by assisting BAPPEDA in the allocation of resources 
to support economic development according to an agreed set of priorities and criteria, will assist 
the agency in the management of the Special Autonomy Fund in the future, key in the 
development of the province over the next 20 years. 
C
.
FIDUCIARY
 
Procurement Arrangements 
46. 
Procurement for the project will be carried out in accordance with the World Bank’s 
“Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits” dated May 2004 as amended in 
October 2006, “Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank 
Borrowers” dated May 2004 as amended in October 2006, and the provisions stipulated in the 
Grant Agreement. International Competitive Bidding (ICB) will be used for all works packages 
estimated to be equivalent to or cost more than US$5 million each and goods packages estimated 
to be equivalent to or cost more than US$200,000 each. National Competitive Bidding (NCB) 
will be used for all works packages estimated to cost less than US$5 million each and goods 
packages estimated to cost less than US$200,000 each. Shopping will be used for all works and 
goods packages estimated to cost less than US$50,000 each. At the project appraisal, it was 
identified that a contract of consulting services for project management will be procured 
following QCBS method. Other consulting contracts will be included in the procurement plan of 
each sub-project. The procurement plans will be reviewed by the PMU and afterwards by the 
World Bank team. Details of the Procurement Plan and procurement capacity assessment are 
presented in Annex 9. 
47. 
The Government of Aceh has expressed concern on the capacity, timeliness and quality 
of procurement of the potential sub-project implementation entities. As a result, it was agreed 
with BAPPEDA that, in the sub-project selection process, the capacities of SIEs will be assessed; 
and for those lacking procurement skills and capacities, PMU will provide necessary support for 
Page  26
17
conducting procurement. The PMU and its consultant team will also have full-time experienced 
staff to supervise how the SIEs are conducting procurement. 
Financial Management  
48. 
Accounting and Reporting.
 
The accounting policies and procedures of EDFF will 
substantially follow government financial management procedures, with strengthened procedures 
where appropriate. These government procedures include, for instance, government budgeting 
procedures, accounting standards (PP no. 24, 2005) and government accounting systems 
(PerMenKeu no. 59/PMK.o6/2005), which have all been issued following the enactment of the 
Finance and Treasury Laws. All project activities and expenditures will be included in the 
respective KPA (Budget Holder) budget and administrative and accountability procedures for 
approving expenditures and disbursing funds to beneficiaries will follow government procedures. 
49. 
To have better project information, grant expenditures and activities will be separately 
reported to the World Bank under project financial report on a quarterly basis through Interim 
Financial Reports (IFRs). This would include information on procurement progress, physical 
progress of budgeted activities and financial source and use of funds. A reconciliation of the 
special account transactions with the financial statements will also be prepared. Formats for these 
would be agreed at appraisal and confirmed during negotiations. Quarterly project financial 
report should be received at the Bank no later than 45 days after each quarter end. The quarterly 
reports will be collated annually for annual financial audit purposes. The KPDT Secretariat will 
ensure that IFRs will be submitted to the World Bank on timely basis. Details of these 
procedures will be included in the Operations Manual. All financial transactions should be 
recorded properly supported with adequate evidence that the recipient is as intended according to 
the Grant objectives and the record should be publicly available to ensure transparency. 
50. 
Internal Controls and Internal Audit.
 For sub-projects, payment verification will rely on 
the sub-
grantees’ financial management system. The PMU will assess adequacy of internal 
control of SIEs. Payment verification at PMU level will rely on the government system, applying 
segregation of duties between technical and financial aspects. The Operations Manual will 
document the financial management systems and procedures to be followed to ensure that the 
project has sound financial management practices. KPDT has agreed to include the project in 
their routine annual audit program and they will include sub-projects to their sample, preparing a 
separate report for the project to be submitted to the World Bank. In addition, they will also have 
a
special team to respond any complaints received in regards to the project. 
51. 
External Audit
.
The project financial statements prepared by the project executing agency 
will be based on the compiled project Interim Un-audited Financial Reports (IFR). The annual 
IFR will be subject to a financial audit by an auditor acceptable to the Bank. The Terms of 
Reference (TOR) for the project audit will be agreed by the Bank. A copy of the project audited 
financial statements, along with the management letters issued by the auditors, if any, will be 
submitted to the Bank no later than 6 months after the end of each fiscal year. The audit will 
include audit of sub-projects below US$1 million. Sub-projects above US$1 million will also be 
audited separately by auditors acceptable to the Bank, and the audit reports will be submitted to 
the Bank no later than 6 months after the end of each fiscal year. 
Page  27
18
52. 
Disbursement Arrangements.
 
The 
disbursement method will be “Advance”. In order to 
facilitate the disbursement, a Designated (Special) Account (DA) denominated in US dollars will 
be opened by Director General Treasury in the Central Bank or a commercial bank acceptable to 
the Bank under the name of the Ministry of Finance. The Director General Treasury will 
authorize its relevant Treasury Offices (KPPNs) located in Banda Aceh and Jakarta to authorize 
payments of eligible project expenditures and provide guidelines regarding eligible project 
expenditures in accordance with the Grant Agreement. Applications for reporting of the use of 
DA funds will be supported by the necessary documentation (see Annex 8 for details).  
53. 
The KPDT Secretariat will be responsible for reconciling the DA and preparing 
applications for withdrawal of advances and reporting the use of the DA, duly approved by 
Director General Treasury before their submissions to the Bank. All documentation for 
expenditures submitted for disbursement will be retained at the implementing unit and shall be 
made available to the auditors for the annual audit and to the Bank and its representatives if 
requested. For selected sub-projects proposals, Sub-Grant Agreement/Contract will be signed 
between the PMU and the SIE. The document will include budget and procurement plan. After 
signing the Sub-Grant Agreement, SIEs will receive an advance adequate to cover three months 
expenditure plan. Details of flow of fund mechanism will be described in the Sub-grant OM. 
D
.
ANTI
-
CORRUPTION ACTION PLAN
 
54. 
The implementation of an Anti-Corruption Action Plan (ACAP) for the EDFF depends 
on the strong support from the GoA through its PMU. The Action Plan (Annex 12) will be part 
of the Operations Manual. During implementation, World Bank staff will monitor the elements 
of this Action Plan and Aide Memoirs will clearly state progress in relation to the Action Plan. 
Any changes to the Action Plan will be made in agreement with the World Bank. The Bank 
supervision may be enhanced by support from an External Supervision Team (EST), which 
advises the Bank’s internal Anti-Corruption Committee for Indonesia to help identify the risks of 
fraud and corruption at an early stage, and bring these to the attention of the Bank and 
Government institutions for further action. In particular, the EST may aid Bank supervision by 
identifying and tracking indicators of corruption, and carrying out sub-project site checks at 
strategic times between formal supervision missions. The EST may also assist the Bank’s 
supervision team in designing complaint handling processes as well as mechanisms for 
coordination with other institutions. These inputs do not reduce the need for the GoA to monitor 
the project implementation through the agreed mechanisms. The GoA will regularly share with 
the Bank the findings of technical and financial audits, to be held during (interim audits) and 
after (post audits) each year for a significant sample of sub-projects. The GoA and the PMU 
consultant will also ensure that any suspected cases of corruption related to this project be 
reported immediately to the Bank. 
55. 
Disclosure of Information
.
To encourage a healthy sharing of information concerning 
sub-project selection and implementation, the PMU will ensure that information concerning the 
EDFF will be made publicly accessible, including the procurement plans and schedules, contract 
information for large contracts, a Mid Term Review report as well as audit reports and formal 
responses from the government to these reports. This will be done using established procedures 
(e.g. advertisements in newspapers, government websites (
www.nad.go.id
), etc. In addition, SIE 
through the PMU will also respond to individual requests of the public for information (as 
Page  28
19
elaborated upon in Annex 13 and OM). To avoid misinformation circulating about the project, 
the PMU will ensure that groups interested in individual sub-projects are able to obtain data 
concerning progress during the procurement and implementation phases through various 
methods. The PMU will also ensure that lessons learned from the implementation of sub-projects 
is widely shared and specifically shared with those who have indicated an interest.   
56. 
Collusion Mitigation
.
Special attention will be given to the planning and preparation of 
procurement processes in general and more specifically at the sub-project level, as this may 
entail very different package types and sizes, different levels of responsibility, and different 
capacities in terms of process management and oversight (internal and external). The Operations 
Manual will provide guidelines on this. The measures outlined in the procurement and financial 
management sections of the Operations Manual must be closely followed at each stage and any 
deviation from the agreed rules must be carefully investigated with appropriate sanctions strictly 
applied. The 
PMU’s consulting firm will assign enough procurement experts to assist PMU in 
the selection of proposals and build capacity of the GoA. The consulting firm will also support 
PMU in overseeing procurement at the sub-project level. In those instances where the sub-project 
implementing entities do not have the required procurement capacity or when procurement 
involves large and highly complex packages, the PMU may take over the procurement role. 
57. 
Mitigation of Forgery and Fraud:
 Forgery and fraud risks will be minimized by 
adherence to fiduciary management practices. The Operations Manual will outline measures such 
as payment validation procedures, documentation and reporting mechanism and internal and 
external audits. Measures undertaken will include strict payment validation procedures that will 
be rigorously enforced. Project/sub-project filing/bookkeeping will be tightly controlled and 
subject to strict reviews. Internal and external audits will be held to ensure that fiduciary 
management is in accordance with the agreed procedures. Special attention will be given to 
aspects that have proven vulnerable in previous projects, such as “soft” categories like working 
capital, training, workshops and information dissemination. The firm supporting PMU will 
provide the necessary financial management expertise to ensure that PMU can perform its duties 
in this area. Financial management reports of PMU and the sub-projects will be subject to 
internal audits by the Inspektorat Daerah (Aceh). The State Development and Financial 
Supervisory Board (BPKP) or the BPK will perform regular external audits. All final audit 
reports and the government’s responses will be disclosed in the project’s website.  
58. 
Complaint Handling. 
The EDFF, as a project being funded by the MDF, will also be 
subject to the complaint handling mechanisms of the MDF. As such, there is no need to create a 
new system to handle complaints. In addition, as a project implemented through the GoA, the 
normal government procedures to handle complaints, particularly the Inspektorat Daerah which 
receives and follows up complains from various sources, will apply. The GoA and the PMU will 
also use its communications strategy to avoid many of the complaints that misunderstandings or 
poor communications may cause. The overall approach of the project is to ensure fairness and 
transparency in the selection and management of sub-projects
.
Depending on the gravity of the 
complaints, Inspektorat Daerah may decide to refer the complaints to the relevant agencies/ 
individuals or law enforcement agencies. The Inspektorat Daerah has signed agreements with the 
BPKP and the Anti Corruption Commission (KPK) for referral of corruption findings.  
Page  29
20
59. 
Remedies and Sanctions
:
To the extent this project will finance several individual 
economic development sub-projects in an environment of weak institutions and local 
government capacity, there may be cases of abuse during the implementation phase. The PMU 
and the GoA will follow up on each reported or discovered case appropriately, taking into 
consideration the size and nature of the case as well as the level of evidence available. The PMU 
will activate and monitor referrals to Inspektorat Daerah and external authorities to gauge if legal 
and/ or administrative sanctions (administrative sections against public officials, sanctions and 
remedies governed under Keppres 80/2003) as envisioned by GoA/GOI are being effectively 
applied. The PMU will ensure that proven cases of corruption get high publicity so that they will 
act as a social (“name and shame”) deterrent. The World Bank may also suspend disbursement to 
the project or sub-projects until issues are resolved. Misprocurement and cancellation of grants 
may be declared when there are evidences of corrupt practices committed. 
E
.
SOCIAL
 
60. 
In general, the economic development sub-projects will entail public goods/enabling 
environment and other areas in support of long term job creation and economic development. As 
a
result, the level of associated social risks is likely to be limited. However, it is important for 
planning purposes associated with sub-project selection that the PMU ensure that sub-projects 
reflect community needs - specifically those of vulnerable groups, such as women, children, 
those directly impacted by the Tsunami and the poorest in society. The focus of the project on 
agriculture and fisheries will benefit primarily rural areas, where a majority of the poor live in 
Aceh. A requirement for entities presenting proposals for financing will be endorsement of key 
government entities for the implementation of the project. The EDFF will be guided by the 
blueprint prepared by BAPPENAS, RPJMD and the provincial authorities’ own economic 
development strategies, focused on poverty alleviation and with rural communities at the center. 
The EDFF design recognizes the importance of empowering women and anticipates that some of 
the sub-projects will contain components to enhance the role of women in economic 
development and employment. Proposals will be screened with regards to main beneficiaries of 
sub-projects being proposed, ensuring that the poor and vulnerable groups are the main 
beneficiaries of the EDFF..  
F
.
ENVIRONMENT
 
61. 
The sub-projects are small and medium scale and as such the level of associated 
environmental risks is limited. EDFF subprojects may entail financing of projects which could 
involve environmental issues associated with agriculture, fisheries and other economic 
development and job creation projects.  Under EDFF it is expected that most of the investment 
will contribute to improving environmental conditions.  Any adverse environmental impacts 
under this project are therefore expected to be limited and highly localized, and these can be 
readily mitigated through the project’s negative list or through environmental management plans. 
62. 
The GOI’s environmental review procedures, which include specific procedures for 
Aceh
6
,
are broadly consistent with those of the World Bank, and will form the framework for the 
6
Ministry of Environment Decree No. 308/2005 on Implementation of Environmental Impact Assessment, 
Environmental Management Measures and Environmental Controlling Measures for Rehabilitation and 
Reconstruction Activities of Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam and Nias Islands of North Sumatra. 
Page  30
21
project’s approach to environmental screening and mitigation (Annex 11 and the comparison of 
the procedures in the Operations Manual). Part of the PMU sub-project application evaluation 
process will be an environmental screening to identify the environmental category. Each sub-
project application will include a mandatory environmental screening form. It is expected that all 
sub-projects will fall into category B and C. For category B sub-projects, the PMU will 
determine the extent of the environmental assessment that is necessary and clear any mitigation 
measures that are required for each sub-project. Although not expected due to limitations placed 
on applicants, if a sub-project is categorized as a category A sub-project, special mitigation 
measures will be required under OP 4.01 and require SIE to retain independent environmental 
assessment experts not affiliated with the project to carry out the environmental assessment, 
normally a full environmental impact assessment.  
63. 
The PMU will be required to review the required environmental management plans (EMP 
or UKL/UPLs) during sub-project preparation and will ensure integration of EMP results into 
design documents or contracts prior to approval of the detailed sub-project appraisal documents.  
Further, the PMU will provide The Bank with copies of the EMP or UKL/UPLs of projects 
requiring same prior to giving the subprojects final approval. During supervision, the Bank will 
receive bi-annual monitoring reports covering environmental safeguards issues. 
G
.
SAFEGUARD POLICIES
 
64. 
It is anticipated that none of the World Bank social safeguard policies will be triggered 
by the EDFF. It may be that some of the sub-projects, after careful screening, need mitigation 
measures as foreseen by the World Bank. A range of safeguards specialists will be retained by 
the PMU (funded by the EDFF) as needed.  All sub-projects will be screened for compliance 
with environmental and social safeguards policies. The Operations Manual for the project entails 
an Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework with detailed social and environmental 
management procedures. The Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework is outlined in 
Annex 11 primarily as a screening tool for environmental and social impact. This framework 
provides guidance to the PMU as well as SIEs to determine to what extent the sub-projects will 
affect the environment and communities and will ensure that environmental and social concerns 
are duly incorporated in the sub-project design. The EDFF does not trigger any policies related to 
land acquisition. No land acquisition will be financed by the EDFF and no Sub-project will be 
approved that would result in Displaced Persons. Sub-project implementation will be through 
non-government entities all of which do not have the power of imminent domain and thus have 
no ability to force relocations or land sales.  Given the short implementation period for the 
project, sub-projects which would involve involuntary relocation will not be funded; only those 
with voluntary relocation will be considered subject to verification as required in the Operations 
Manual.  
65. 
EDFF sub-projects may entail financing of activities which could involve environmental

Operational Policy. As such, all sub-projects that will be financed by the EDFF must be in 
compliance with national (GOI) environmental rules and regulations, as well as with 
environmental policies of the Bank. The direct environmental impact of sub-projects that will be 
funded under the project is expected to be small i.e., potential impacts are site-specific; few if

and its consultant will need to have a good understanding of sub-project proposal related 
environmental impacts and how such impacts can be mitigated as they evaluate sub-projects for 
approval.

ANNEX 1:  COUNTRY AND SECTOR BACKGROUND 
 
1. 
The devastation of the December 2004 Tsunami coupled with the preceding years 
of civil unrest contributed to high unemployment and poverty in Aceh. BPS data reports 
that 28.4 percent of the population in Aceh was living below the poverty line in 2004, 
almost double the national poverty level of 16.7 percent in 2004. The World Bank 
estimates that poverty went up slightly after the Tsunami (to 32.6 percent). This increase 
masks much larger increases in areas badly affected by the Tsunami and the conflict as 
well as higher poverty levels in rural areas. By 2006 the poverty rate had fallen slightly 
to 26.5 percent, below pre-Tsunami levels, attributable in large part to the sizable 
reconstruction effort and the end of the conflict. Poverty has continued to decline and 
BPS estimates that 23.5% of the population in Aceh was below the poverty line in 2008. 
However, a large share of the population remains vulnerable with average consumption 
just above the poverty line, so that a small shock such as the end of the reconstruction 
effort could send them back into poverty.  
Creating sustainable employment remains a challenge. Unemployment has been 
increasing for several years (see Figure 1).  Much of the unemployment during the 
period can be attributed to civil unrest and weak security, but the impact of the 
Tsunami, aside from the short term reconstruction efforts, has also had an impact. The 
Tsunami not only caused tremendous loss of life, but ended the prospects of long 
term employment for many people.  It is estimated that 80,000 small and medium 
sized enterprises, providing employment to 140,000 people were destroyed.

Unemployment
Unemployment was growing as a result of some shedding of labor in the agricultural 
sector and there has been a lack of private sector investment coupled with the failure 
of other sectors (services, manufacturing) to create new job opportunities, when the 
devastation of the Tsunami hit Aceh. Although there was a slight decrease in 
unemployment in 2007, it is primarily attributable to reconstruction.  The 
Page  34
25 
 
reconstruction has created new job opportunities in some sectors (construction, 
transport), but these jobs have been closely linked to the availability of reconstruction 
funds, are not likely to be sustainable in the long run.  
The GoI, through the BRR, and the GoA have committed to building the community of 
Aceh back to being stronger and better than it was pre-Tsunami. Both have identified 
economic growth and development as essential elements of recovery from the 
Tsunami. The GoA in its Medium Term Development Plan (RPJMD), the GOI in 
BAPPENAS Master Plan for the reconstruction of Aceh after the Tsunami and BRR 
at its Coordination Forum for Aceh and Nias (CFAN) meeting with development 
partners in April 2007, all identify Aceh’s reconstruction phases, starting with the 
emergency phase of relief work followed by a second phase dealing primarily with 
rehabilitation and physical reconstruction and noted as crucial, the third phase of 
long-term economic development. The GoA, in its Vision for Aceh, published in 
2007, identified key directives for the development of the region’s economy (see 
Attachment 1 for details), such as a new focus on private sector development and the 
need to recognize entrepreneurs as development actors, the need to address Aceh’s 
competitiveness challenges, starting by the high costs of doing business in the 
province as well as the promotion of trade with countries in the region and reaching 
international markets as a way of increasing demand for Acehnese agricultural 
products. In addition, the Government Vision also mentions the need for equitable 
and sustainable growth that respects the environment.  
The GoA, in the RPJMD identifies key factors hampering Aceh’s economic 
development. As a result of the 30 year conflict, at the time of the Tsunami, there 
were weak government institutions, damaged infrastructure and low investment 
levels. The Tsunami brought further interruption of normal economic activities. The 
RPJMD identifies key constraints for economic activity for some sectors: in 
agriculture, availability of land, low productivity, low quality of production and lack 
of access to inputs and markets are identified as constraints. In manufacturing, the 
RPJMD mentions the weak business environment, low quality of production as well 
as the failure to adopt recent technological changes as key constraints for the 
development of the sector. These deficiencies together with the impact of the 
Tsunami have led to potential imbalances in Aceh’s economy. Aceh’s economy is 
dominated by oil and gas production, which accounts for 28 percent of regional GDP 
(2007) and over 90 percent of the province’s exports. Known gas reserves are 
projected to decline to near zero by 2014 and the mining and related manufacturing 
sector have been declining for several years in a row. This together with current 
growth trends, concentrated in sectors linked to the availability of large funds for 
reconstruction reinforces concerns regarding Aceh’s economy beyond 2009. 
Aceh’s economy contracted in 2004 (pre-Tsunami) by 10 percent and experienced a 
further 10 percent decline in 2005 (post-Tsunami).
 
The contraction in the economy 
was the result of the declining mining and related manufacturing sectors, and the 
impact of the Tsunami, which caused a decline of the manufacturing and agricultural 
sectors. The economy grew at a modest 1.6 percent in 2006, driven mostly by growth 
in the services sector, related to the reconstruction effort. In 2007 Aceh’s economy 
Page  35
26 
 
continued to decline, a result primarily of the decline in the oil and gas sectors. 
Without a significant recovery of the agricultural and manufacturing sectors, Aceh 
will be facing a structural downturn as the reconstruction effort winds down in 2009. 
This could have negative implications for employment and poverty alleviation efforts.   
Table 1:  Economic Growth in Aceh 2003-07 (percent) 
 
Agriculture and fisheries are key sectors for any efforts to promote sustainable economic 
growth and the creation of sustainable jobs in the province. It still accounts for 23 
percent of Aceh’s economy (or 32 percent if oil and gas are excluded) and provide 
employment to 57 percent of the population. However, growth in the agricultural 
sector has been fairly week in the immediate aftermath of the Tsunami, and 
production has only returned to pre-Tsunami levels in 2007, led by growth in estate 
crops, up by 15 percent since the Tsunami, followed by food crops and the fisheries 
sectors.

economy in the short run. The reconstruction effort commenced in 2005 and by 2006 
was the main driver of economic growth. The reconstruction effort has been creating 
a
real construction boom in some parts of the province, but since it has not addressed 
issues related to the competitiveness of Aceh’s economy and the sustainability of 
current growth trends, it is not strictly in line with the BAPPENAS Master Plan 
which foresees the recovery of Aceh’s economy as part of the third phase of the 
province’s reconstruction.  
In addition, the large aid influx and initial supply side constraints have contributed to 
high inflation levels, at over 40 percent year-on-year in December 2005. The 
differential between Aceh and the national inflation level has been declining since 
then, but in May 2008 inflation in Aceh, at 15.3 percent, was still significantly higher 
than the national inflation level, at 10.4 percent. Three years of high inflation mean 
that Aceh’s consumer price index (CPI) has risen well above the national average 
(Figure 2).

Nominal wages have also been increasing rapidly since the Tsunami, partly to maintain 
purchasing power of the population. Aceh’s monthly minimum provincial wage is 
Rp. 1 million, the second highest in the country and 1/3 higher than the national 
average. The increase in prices of goods and labor has contributed to the lack of 
competitiveness of Aceh’s economy and will make the sustainability of current 
growth rates more difficult.

The share of consumption (private and public) and domestic investment in the economy 
have increased significantly post-Tsunami. The reconstruction effort is driving both 
consumption and domestic investment, while trade (both domestic and international) 
continue to decline. Although reconstruction will continue to fuel the economy for a 
few more years, and the public sector is likely to continue being a source of strong 
demand for the local economy,
7
the continuing decline in exports is a cause for 
concern and may signal a lack of competitiveness in Aceh’s economy.

The decline of Aceh’s economy pre- and post-Tsunami has contributed to the growing 
unemployment problem. Limited growth in some sectors has not translated into 
significant employment generation. Unemployment increased from about 6 percent in 
2000 to 10 percent in 2007
8
,
despite the large reconstruction effort post-Tsunami 
which created significant job opportunities. The agricultural sector remains stagnant 
three years after the Tsunami, even though it is the single largest employer in Aceh, 
estimated at 57 percent of the workforce in 2007
9
.
Agricultural production just 
recovered and gone back to pre-Tsunami levels in 2007 and is of concern to the GoA. 
Most of the recent employment creation (2/3) appears to have been linked to the 
reconstruction program and thus, is not likely to be sustainable. Therefore, a renewed 
effort is needed to rehabilitate the agricultural sector to improve job opportunities in 
the longer term.

There are two seemingly contradictory trends in Aceh’s labor market, where both unemployment and 
nominal wages are increasing. This could be the result of (i) supply shortages for particular labor categories 
in high demand (such as semi-skilled construction workers), (ii) lack of population mobility, creating labor 
shortages in some areas; and (iii) wide availability of safety nets from NGOs and donors reducing 
incentives for many people to actively seek low-paying employment.
 
9
The increase in employment in agriculture in 2007 is primarily the result of the timing of the Sakernas 
survey, at the time of a late harvest. Therefore the ‘real’ increase in agricultural employment is probably 
smaller than that suggested by the data published by BPS. 
Page  39
30 
 
This concern with the sustainability of current growth trends are also in line with popular 
sentiment. A post-
election survey of Aceh’s citizens by the International Foundation 
for Election Systems  (IFES) conducted in February 2007 identified their concerns 
across a number of socio-economic conditions which seem to support the broader 
view of the need for more to be done to sustain economic development. Further, in 
the same survey, citizens registered their priorities as to the most important issues the 
new Governor should address, with 74 percent identifying economic development as 
the most important.

The pre-conditions for economic recovery are in place. There is more political stability 
and greater institutional support for economic growth. Knowledge is accumulating as 
to the realistic possibilities of critical sectors to develop and the framework for a 
coherent economic growth strategy is coming into place. The GoA will add resources 
to support growth and economic development initiatives in the future, at least in part 
funded through central government transfers which began in 2008 as a result of the 
LOGA
10
.
One key challenge facing the GoA will be the quality of spending and 
choice of projects. The EDFF is designed to begin to fill the long term development 
gaps by seeking to build capacity within the GoA to select, evaluate and supervise 
projects which promote economic development and job creation, based upon a model 
10
 For a full analysis of public finances in Aceh see World Bank, 2006, “Aceh Public Expenditure Analysis 
–
Spending for Reconstruction and Poverty Reduction”. 
Page  40
31 
 
that can be easily continued with government resources after the EDFF has 
terminated. 
The report ‘Aceh and Nias – Two Years after the Tsunami’ prepared by BRR in 
collaboration with donor agencies at the end of 2006, elaborates on the reconstruction 
work done.  It highlights successes, like the rehabilitation of fields for food crops as 
well as major gaps (e.g., fisheries infrastructure) and some failures (e.g., replacement 
of small vessels for fisheries). The BRR report also highlights two areas, key for 
economic recovery in the province that did not receive attention during the initial 
stages of reconstruction, private sector development and the improvement of the 
investment climate.   
Livelihoods programs implemented after the Tsunami primarily targeted household 
income recovery. They were designed in the aftermath of a disaster for which the 
major feature of these programs were cash-for-work components designed to inject 
liquidity quickly into the households and to some extent the rehabilitation of 
community livelihoods assets. The goal of many of the livelihoods projects was to 
restore activities in the communities as they were before the Tsunami by replacing 
lost assets, enhancing skills and providing finance (often grants or small loans). As 
such many of the smaller initiatives have been successful and can show good results 
in rehabilitating the livelihoods of small scale farmers or fishermen.  On the other 
hand, some of the larger scale projects involving distribution of specialized inputs and 
services, such as the reconstruction of boats, the purchasing of industrial equipment 
or ridding agricultural land of diseases have not shown the same degree of success. 
(See Annex 2 for a listing of some of the livelihoods programs implemented since the 
Tsunami). The programs were for the most part very targeted to narrow and specific 
post Tsunami needs. They were not designed to and overall did not result in an 
increase in the general competitiveness or long term sustainability of economic 
development of Aceh.  They also were not directed toward correcting many of the 
long standing structural issues hampering or in some cases, preventing long term 
sustainable economic growth and job creation. 
The next phase in providing assistance to the communities and rural areas in Aceh should 
expand upon the past successes, the lessons learned, and the availability of GoA 
guidance on economic development and help to address those areas not previously 
targeted. This is in part, what EDFF will do. New efforts will, in some instances build 
upon what others have done, and in others take a new direction, but all will be in line 
with stated GoA priorities for economic development in the province, focusing on 
increasing the productivity of Aceh’s private sector and agricultural and fisheries 
sectors, improving the quality and quantity of production (directly or indirectly) to 
make Aceh private sector and its economy more competitive.  It will also help Aceh 
move beyond subsistence farming or selling to local markets and introduce more 
value added production to the community.  
GoA’s Economic Development Strategy.
 Recognizing the extent of the devastation, the 
GoI declared the Tsunami in Aceh a national disaster. It appointed the National 
Coordinating Board for Disaster Management (BAKORNAS PBP) to implement its 
Page  41
32 
 
emergency response. The Minister for Social Welfare was appointed the coordinator 
of the emergency response phase and an operations centre was established in Banda 
Aceh. Following the initial emergency response phase, in April 2005 the GoI 
assigned the BRR to execute and coordinate the reconstruction effort in Aceh and 
Nias.   
The GOI formulated a master plan for the reconstruction of Aceh.  The plan focused on 
three key stages of recovery and reconstruction.  The first stage was to recognize the 
immediate needs by addressing emergency measures (3-6 months), the second stage 
was to focus on rehabilitation needs (up to 2 years) and finally, the third stage which 
was to focus on reconstruction 
11
(4-5 years). Challenges to the successful recovery of 
Aceh were identified, which included socio-economic needs of all sectors, restoration 
of local institutions and implementation capacity as well as building peace and 
reconciliation.  One of the key principles of this plan was that “reconstruction should 
not rebuild poverty, but ensure that local economies are robust enough to prevent 
poverty over the long term”. 
During the initial stage of addressing recovery and rehabilitation, it was the central 
government which was taking the lead and there was little involvement of the local 
Aceh government. It was only recently with the release of RPJMD or Medium Term 
Development Plan for Aceh that the GoA through its elected Governor has again 
become the leader in strategic planning and direction for Aceh.  This plan and its 
relation to post-Tsunami reconstruction and the GoA will play a central role in the 
EDFF and its selection of sub-projects. 
The RPJMD describes to an extent a measurable development and budgeting plan for use 
in the next 5 years (2007 to 2012). The document provides direction, but will also be 
used as the basis for monitoring the progress of development in Aceh province.  The 
RPJMD identifies two key issues confronting the economy of Aceh: a high level of 
poverty and unemployment compared to other provinces and developmental gaps 
between Kabupaten/Kota (districts) resulting in unwelcome disparities. It addresses 
additional concerns such as unfavorable economic and social conditions, human 
resources limitations and the impact of many years of conflict. It reflects generally the 
concern that unless the earlier relief and reconstruction phases are adequately 
followed by this next phase that the improved economic conditions currently 
experienced could potentially be followed by a period of economic slowdown and 
resulting rising unemployment. A discussion of the content of the RPJMD can be 
found at Attachments 1 and 2 of Annex 1.  
The GoA has further elaborated its strategic framework for economic development based 
on the Triple-A concept, comprising of an 
Atlas
 (compilation of relevant economic 
data), 
Agenda
 (providing the economic development vision and strategies to promote 
economic development) as well as the 
Aturan-main
,
which explains the institutional 
mechanisms by which this vision and strategies can be implemented. This framework 
11
 The objective is stated as rebuilding the region. This includes the economy as a whole, transportation 
system, telecommunications, social and cultural system, etc. 
Page  42

identifies three lead economic sectors for the province (agriculture, trade and 
services), key because of their contribution to both regional production as well as 
employment. The EDFF, through its focus on improving the business environment, 
support to the private sector (in particular in agriculture and fisheries) and the 
financing of public infrastructure needed for economic development, will contribute 
to the development of all three lead sectors identified by the provincial authorities.

Attachment 1:  RPJMD (Rencana Pembangunan Jangka Menengah) 
Medium Term Development Plan Aceh and the Government of Aceh Vision 
2. 
The RPJMD describes a measurable development and budgeting plan for use in 
the next 5 years, (2007-2012). The document provides direction, but will also be used as 
the basis for monitoring the progress of economic development in Aceh province.  The 
RPJMD identifies two key issues confronting the economy of Aceh: a high level of 
poverty and unemployment compared to other provinces and developmental gaps 
between Kabupaten/Kota (districts) which often results in unwelcome disparities. It 
addresses additional concerns such as unfavorable economic and social conditions, 
human resources limitations and the impact of many years of conflict.    
A. 
The RPJMD also addresses several causes of concern such as:
 
3. 
Unfavorable economic and security conditions
.
These conditions are seen to 
have affected almost every aspect of Acehnese society. Economic and social conditions 
have been adversely affected by the weakening of trade between the province and other 
regions.  Local infrastructure, needed to support the economy has been destroyed or left 
dilapidated through neglect, affecting the health and education infrastructure and leading 
to increased poverty and unemployment rates. 
4. 
Human resources limitations
.
Prolonged conflict and limited employment 
opportunities have contributed to a “brain drain” in Aceh, as many left Aceh for better 
opportunities outside the province. The Tsunami, with the loss of life and business has 
further discouraged people and could result in further migration.  If the conditions 
contributing to the brain drain are not addressed, including creating good job 
opportunities in the local Communities, it will further restrict Aceh’ ability to enjoy 
renewed economic growth.  
5. 
Economic expansion and growth
.
The prior hostilities and resulting security 
situation contributed to hampering some of Aceh’s economic sectors, including industry, 
mining and tourism. As Aceh’s economy currently relies heavily on rapidly depleting oil 
and gas production, refocusing its economic on other activity such as agricultural, could 
better enable future economic growth.  The Tsunami helped to highlight this situation as 
well as the need to bring businesses and business networking back to Aceh.  
6. 
Trade and investment. 
 In addition to trade and investment which were affected 
by the prior security conditions, other factors also give raise to concern.  The 
reconstruction efforts following the Tsunami have brought to light several issues: 
notably, trade regulations that remain unclear, and poor infrastructure conditions which 
have added to high costs and are perceived to be a deterrent to many investors. 
7. 
Infrastructure. 
 Pre-Tsunami, Aceh’s infrastructure was not in good condition 
generally, and its irrigation, roads, water and electricity assets were in poor condition. 
During the conflict period, the maintenance of infrastructure was inadequate, contributing 
to a continued decline in conditions which have since been exacerbated by the Tsunami. 
Page  44
35 
 
B
.
The Government of Aceh Vision seeks to bring fundamental changes in Aceh in 
all sectors at both the society as well as government levels, by putting high respect for 
transparency and accountability, establishing a Government of Aceh free of corruption 
and abuse of power. The RPJMD identifies several key actions to assist in economic 
development, which also reflect the Government of Aceh Vision on Economic 
Development:
 
7. 
Rebuilding Aceh’s fragmented economic infrastructure. 
8.  Embracing economic actors as development partners. 
9.  Ensuring that economic development activities are applicable and open to all to 
ensure fairness and transparency. 
10. Identifying the sources of high costs in the economy and seeking solutions to address 
these. 
11. Encouraging the awakening of an entrepreneurial spirit within the Acehnese people 
and businesses. 
12. Encouraging international trade, especially with Malaysia and Thailand (IMT-GT)
12,
 
particularly in agribusiness through sound research and promotion of investment 
opportunities. 
13. Providing a framework for ex-Combatants and conflict victims to help ensure they are 
given opportunities to benefit from economic growth. 
14. Influencing economic growth based on Community involvement, a sustainable 
environment and better disaster preparedness. 
C
.
The RPJMD also directs attention to important elements to be used as the 
basis for sound economic development in Aceh:
 
15. 
Natural Resources and Environmental Base
.
Aceh is rich in natural resources 
which have yet to be fully utilized in building its economy. Agriculture and fisheries 
could potentially be among alternatives to the depleting oil and natural gas reserves as 
sources of future economic growth. The RPJMD in addressing the need for economic 
growth also recognizes the importance of the environment as a precious asset of Aceh 
and seeks growth with a sustainable natural environment. 
16. 
Community Based
.
The needs and aspirations of the Community must be 
considered when planning future economic development activities. Community 
12
 Established in 1993, its main goal to foster the economic growth among the region. The 2
nd
 summit was 
held in Cebu, Jan 2007 and has prepared a road map of IMT-GT (2007-2012). The IMT-GT has marked 
significant gains in various sector, and Medan (North Sumatera) as the main hub (e.g. tourism, medical 
tourism, etc). 
Page  45
36 
 
participation at every stage of Aceh’s economic development is viewed as essential in 
order to eradicate poverty and provide a sustainable economy to the province. 
17. 
Value Added and Open Market.  
Economic development should focus on value 
added activities in addition to improving the quality and quantity of production. The 
business environment should allow for open and fair Competition, and restrict monopoly 
and oligopoly business opportunities 
D. 
The RPJMD also identifies examples to support sustainable economic 
growth: 
Example of activities identified to support the revitalization of agriculture and 
fisheries
:
(a) 
Strengthening of farmers’ cooperatives; 
(b) 
Improvement of available data on agricultural production;

Attachment 2:  Identification of Priorities for EDFF from RPJMD and other GoA 
Plans 
 
1. 
The earlier stages of the post-Tsunami reconstruction effort focused primarily on 
humanitarian aid and physical rehabilitation of housing and infrastructure. There is now a 
broad consensus among GoA, the BRR and the donor community that the emphasis must 
shift to sustainable economic development and creation of jobs and incomes. To better 
address the priorities and gaps in the GoA
’s economic development plans and to be able 
to play a better role as a partner agency in this project, the World Bank commissioned a 
study that identified priorities and gaps based upon the GoA’s own plans.  
 
2. 
Multiple sources were used as references in preparing this report. On the one 
hand, planning documents of GoA and BRR, and on the other hand, reference documents 
prepared by experts, donors and NGOs. Among the documents that were reviewed were 
the provincial Medium-term Development Program, or RPJMD, and the Triple-A 
documents, Comprising an Atlas, an Agenda, and 
Aturan-main
 (=Rules-of-the-game). 
The identification of priorities focused on agriculture and fisheries, which complies with 
sectors identified by GoA as lead sectors. In addition, these are the sectors where a 
majority of the population works and which has a disproportionate number of the poor 
and vulnerable. The agriculture and fisheries sectors also have numerous backward and 
forward linkages with the rest of the economy, which warrants this focusing. 
 
3. 
The study looked at the economy of the individual districts in Aceh, since each 
district has its own specific economic potential and constraints based upon its location, 
assets and resources. Some districts act as engines of growth in a region, while some 
others are lagging behind. Through synergistic urban-rural linkages and inter-municipal 
cooperation economic growth poles can serve as engines of balanced regional economic 
development, another key priority of the GoA.  
 
4. 
The methodology used for the preparation of this report was based on a 
systematic analysis of readily available data. In logical steps, the development programs 
are distilled from existing Planning Documents and Sectoral Documents. These programs 
were then prioritized based on the following ranking criteria:  
 
(a) Sustainable economic growth 
(i) 
Expansion of economic sectors (GDP and growth) 
(ii) 
Stimulating business investment (domestic and foreign investors) 
(iii) 
Environmentally sound (natural resources, environmental impacts) 
(b) Generation of jobs and incomes 
(i) 
Incomes in formal sector (through jobs and entrepreneurship) 
(ii) 
Incomes in informal sector (through self-employment and livelihood 
(iii) 
Poverty reduction (education, health care, access to basic needs) 
(c) Post-Tsunami and post-conflict recovery  
(i) 
Rehabilitation of Tsunami survivors (and affected areas) 
(ii) 
Reintegration of ex-GAM Combatants (and affected areas) 
(iii) 
Balanced regional economic growth (reducing gaps among districts) 
 
Page  48
39 
 
5. 
The report then presents a short-list of activities identifying those activities for 
which there is a financing gap. The methodology is depicted in the figure below. 
 
Figure 5:  Overview of the Methodology 
6. 
The report also identifies strengths and weaknesses in key sectors (agriculture, 
value added manufacturing, trade and investment promotion) which then guide the 
identification of gaps and priorities: 
 
Agriculture 
 
Page  49
40 
 
Strengths 
(a) Availability of vast natural resources for agriculture (land, climate, soil) and fisheries 
(extensive coastline, Exclusive Economic Zone, potential for mangrove forests 
and coral reefs) as well as forestry (potential, previous use of forestry resources 
and conservation). 
(b) Government com
mitment (identification of priorities, ‘Green Aceh’ strategy) and 
institutions (Technical Service Implementation Units (UPTD), BPP, BBI). 
(c) Strong role for the private sector (e.g. farmers’ associations, although limited ole), 
partnership with entrepreneurs (ALSINTAN) 
(d) High external demand for both agriculture and fisheries (commodities prices high, 
potential for import substitution) as well as forestry products, including higher 
value added markets in which Aceh has a comparative advantage (eco-labeling, 
organic products) 
(e) Linkages between sectors (e.g. sources of livestock feed from agro-industry waste, 
e.g. from food crops and plantations) 
(f)  Technological developments in maritime and fishery sectors that increases 
productivity in the sector 
(g) Improved infrastructure (transportation, distribution) as a result of the reconstruction 
and end the of conflict 
(h) High awareness of sustainability concerns and the importance to conserve biological 
resources and ecosystems 
Weaknesses 
(a) 
The sector lacks competitiveness (infrastructure, transport, low productivity 
(b) 
Low human capital in the agricultural sector (education levels of farmers, limited 
number of extension personnel in the agriculture sector)  
(c) 
Most farmers are working only small plots of land (average <1ha, which does not 
allow for economies of scale and investments to improve productivity – linked to this 
is tenure of land, difficult to achieve necessary quantity (e.g. as inputs for agro-
industry) 
(d) 
Limited capital for farmers and agriculture in general (only 4 percent of Commercial 
bank credit allocated to the agricultural sector) 
(e) 
Weak marketing systems (information, access to markets, technology) 
(f) 
Lack of good quality inputs in the desired quantities  
(g) 
Quality issues, especially for exports, pest control (particularly in fisheries, use of 
antibiotics),  
(h) 
Disputes over farmers’ land with business operators and government 
(i) 
Unsustainable level of resources use (e.g. illegal fishing, illegal logging and 
smuggling) 
(j) 
Tsunami damage and its impact on fisheries level (mangroves, coral reefs) 
(k) 
Redesign of Forest Concession Rights still incomplete 
(l) 
Forest management practices are not in accordance with forest conservation 
principles

Great potential in agro-industry (linked to natural resources availability in the 
province) 
(e) 
Demand for agro-industry products steadily rising in line with population growth, 
economy, social/ cultural factors, both domestic and abroad 
(f) 
Based on export values of 15 world exporting nations, Indonesia has strong 
competitiveness vis-
à-vis processed products based on local resources, especially 
agro-industry and foods, compared with Thailand, Malaysia and Philippines; the 
region will have a positive impact from this phenomenon 
(g) 
Integrated in regional and world markets (e.g. the IMT-Triangle) 
 
Weaknesses 
(a) 
Lack of supporting infrastructure and services 
(b) 
Limited working capital, obsolete technologies, lack of investment, business 
development services, etc. 
(c) 
Human resources to support industry sector still limited, especially mastery of IT and 
marketing 
(d) 
Continuing weakness in linkages and partnerships between primary sector and 
processing industries 
(e) 
Lack of use of technological innovations (Shortage of R&D in process technologies 
among industry, research institutes, and universities in the region, dependence on 
licenses for products and technology from abroad) 
(f) 
Lack of GoA support for industrial development 
(g) 
Negative impact of the disaster both on operations and key personnel from several 
large companies 
(h) 
Fair and unfair competition (dumping) by trading partners

and cement as prime export Commodities 
(d) Sabang as a Free Trade and Port Zone pursuant to Law No. 37/2000 to promote 
export and import activities 
Page  51
42 
 
(e) Geographical location (India, China, South East Asia, one of the fastest growing 
regions in the world, close to trading nations such as Malaysia and Singapore, 
trade with rest of Indonesia)  
(f)  Trading with foreign countries is well ingrained in local tradition as substantiated by 
the province
’s history 
(g) The province is rich in natural resources on which to build a strong export base 
(h) Strong demand for some of the province’s commodities (coffee, rubber) 
 
Weaknesses 
(a) 
Institutional setting not optimal (e.g. Sabang, as a Free Trade and Port Zone, not 
functioning properly) 
(b) 
Supporting infrastructure and services for trade sector are still limited, particularly sea 
transport 
(c) 
Trade from the province (rather than transshipment) conditional on current production 
volumes significantly increasing

countries in the region 
(g) 
The province’s imports are heavily skewed in favor of consumption rather than 
investment 
 
Investment 
 
Strengths 
(a) There is ample idle capacity for production; unexploited land, natural resources, 
and labor is abundant 
(b) Favorable disposition of many investors toward emerging economies (such as 
Indonesia) 
(c) Neighboring countries (Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand) are net foreign 
investing countries. Large domestic firms may also be interested in investing in 
Aceh 
 
Weaknesses 
(a) Past public investments had been focused mostly on government apparatus and not on 
catalyzing economic growth 
(b) Low levels of technology diffusion and absorption, partly because of the prolonged 
conflict 
(c) Low rate of investment may have rendered existing production facilities obsolete 
(d) Human capital has not been sufficiently developed 
(e) Image of Aceh in the world is still linked to the Tsunami and to a certain extent the 
conflict, not to a province with a booming economy, rich in natural resources and 
a
large amount of available financial resources 
(f)  New government, lack of clear strategy to attract investment and develop the 
economy 
Page  52
43

ANNEX 3:  RESULTS FRAMEWORK AND MONITORING 
 
1. Objective 
1. 
The purpose of the overall monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system is to provide 
all interested parties with timely information on how the EDFF project progresses relative 
to its plans and schedules and on how its activities affect both its implementing agencies 
and its intended beneficiaries (the target group). The system is designed to provide 
information to guide decision-makers on plans and operations for the project itself and to 
assist in the design of future projects and programs and on strategies and policies for 
development in Aceh. 
2. 
The major users of the M&E system will be: 
(a) 
PMU, to check project performance against plans, to prepare annual work 
plans, to identify strengths and weaknesses in implementation and to 
assess the outcomes and their impacts (real, perceived and potential) on 
beneficiaries, using the information to discuss subproject review and 
adjustment as necessary; 
(b) 
Sub-project implementing entities, to assess performance towards 
improving their sub-projects using EDFF funds and their other operations 
(c) 
GoA, primarily BAPPEDA, to incorporate lessons learnt from project 
experience into its policies and design of future programs and projects 
(d) 
GoA and the World Bank jointly, to assess project performance, impacts 
and outcomes against agreed criteria 
(e) 
The GOI (KPDT, BAPPENAS), to assess the success of the model and the 
possibility of replicating it in other provinces to support sustainable 
private sector development and economic growth 
(f) 
The World Bank, to formulate its policies and program/project design 
principles for future support to Aceh. The World Bank will also use the 
M&E system to identify bottlenecks and assess to what extent 
adjustments, at the project or subproject level, are necessary, and in 
discussion with MDF decide on course of action. 
(g) 
MDF and its donors to assess the success of the project 
3. 
The nature of the project precludes the specification at this stage of all inputs and 
outputs and the likely outcomes as these will be determined by the number and nature of 
the sub-projects approved. The M&E framework and procedures must therefore reflect 
the needs of very diverse sub-projects to be incorporated into the overall system and 
allow for elaboration of the system as sub-projects are prepared and implemented. The 
M&E Framework will be revised once subprojects to be financed have been selected and 
will be further revised during project implementation as needed.

4. 
Each approved applicant seeking EDFF support will be required to submit 
detailed plans for M&E 
consistent with the overall project’s M&E framework which 
should include:  
(a) 
a logical framework matrix with clear specification of goal, objectives, 
outputs and expected outcomes and impacts. To the extent possible these 
should be gender-disaggregated 
(b) 
detailed quantities of inputs in the sub-project costing. 
(c) 
procedures for collecting and analyzing data required. 
(d) staff 
responsibilities. 
(e) 
elaboration on the degree and modality of beneficiary communities 
involvement in the M&E of the subproject 
2. 
Results Monitoring Framework 
5. 
The results monitoring framework (table in the next page) sets out what the 
project aims to achieve and how it intends to do so. The sub-projects to be supported 
under the project should contribute to one or more of the following development 
objectives identified by the GoA as key for sustainable economic recovery and 
development in Aceh: (i) development of job-creating, market-driven enterprises engaged 
in value-added processing and manufacturing, especially in agriculture and fisheries; (ii) 
sustainable improvement of production quality and value in agriculture, fisheries and 
estate crops that contributes to alleviation of poverty; (iii) increase in international trade, 
especially direct exports; and (iv) increased domestic and foreign investment in Aceh. To 
achieve these goals, the EDFF will support sub-projects in the following areas: (i) 
Improving the Business Environment; (ii) Private Sector Support; and (iii) Public 
Infrastructure.  
6. 
The EDFF will be judged by its ability to show results in the following outcomes: 
(a) 
Improving the business environment. Outcome Indicator: Number of 
clearly identified business constraints that were successfully alleviated in 
Aceh; 
(b) 
Private Sector Support. Outcome Indicator: Employment generated in 
enterprises supported by the project (in man-day per year); 
(c) 
Private Sector Support: Outcome Indicator: Farmers and fishermen 
communities supported (in total number of beneficiaries) 
(d) Public
 Infrastructure
.
Outcome Indicator: Number of users of public 
infrastructure financed by the project

7. 
Performance indicators in the results monitoring framework will give early and 
continuing notice of whether the most important parts of the project are leading towards 
results in the three key outcomes. The Results Framework will be revised when all the 
sub-projects are documented and approved. Not all the outcome indicators shown in the 
results monitoring framework will apply to all sub-projects; implementing entities will be 
required to specify how their sub-projects will lead to outcomes and to select appropriate 
key performance indicators..  
8. 
Timeliness of reporting on performance indicators will be critical for the success 
of this element of the M&E system. Values for some of the indicators will come from 
routine reports of implementing entities at short intervals. Other indicator values will 
come from reports of those (such as consultants and NGOs) providing technical 
assistance to implementing entities and beneficiaries. Some data 
–
primarily for 
production, profitability, value added and exports - will be available only from sample 
surveys at the mid-term review and completion. The reporting periods and sources of data 
for performance indicators will be set out in the agreements between PMU and the sub-
projects implementing entities, who will be provided with clear guidelines and templates 
to collect required data. In addition, independent verification of some data will be done as 
and when considered appropriate. The results monitoring element places reporting at 
quarterly, six-monthly and annual intervals. 
9. 
To the extent possible, sub-project implementing entities will disaggregate 
reporting of results by gender, to assess to what extent subprojects are contributing to 
more equitable outcomes. The reporting of gender-disaggregated outputs and outcomes 
often informs about the effectiveness of the subproject, since often activities are 
performed by one or the other gender (e.g. in rice production) and as such the gender of 
direct beneficiaries becomes relevant.

Impact Evaluation and Project Completion Report
 
10. 
The objective of impact evaluation is to determine how the intended beneficiaries have 
responded to and benefitted from the activities of the project.  This will look at both the intended 
and unintended consequences of project activities. The Impact evaluation will assist in the 
judgment of the adequacy and aptness of the project’s concepts and designs.  It will facilitate the 
completion report to address the lessons learned for design of future projects and programs. 
Procedures for Evaluation 
11. 
It is recognized that undertaking such an evaluation may be hampered by the brevity of 
the sub-projects.  Delays in implementation may prevent a full impact evaluation by the time the 
project is scheduled to close. The results monitoring framework will provide an initial set of 
outputs and impacts for sub-projects, which form the base for evaluation. It will be amended 
once all of the sub-projects have been selected.   
12. 
Establishing baselines from which to judge performance will commence during Sub-
project preparation by reviewing official data sources, secondary sources such as NGOs, and to 
the extent available, survey data.  Following sub-project preparation, Implementing Entities will 
attempt to build further data based upon various means, including contact with the intended 
beneficiaries. 
13. 
It is anticipated that formal evaluation will come as part of the mid term review (MTR), 
which will be conducted toward the middle of the project’s second year. The MTR will help to 
serve as a source of information necessary to make judgments on how the project’s activities 
facilitate favorable changes in the productive lives of the beneficiaries and whether any activities 
are giving less than expected benefits to the target groups and should be revised. The second 
evaluation will be at the end of the project and will feed into the completion report. Its results 
will expand upon and be similarly used as those of the MTR. 
4. Management 
Arrangements 
14. 
Responsibilities are spread among a number of parties, but the overall responsibility of 
the M&E at the project level rests with the World Bank, which will report to the MDF on a six-
monthly basis on physical and financial progress as well as in achieving results. The PMU will 
take the lead in the final design of the M&E system, assessing proposals in light of the M&E 
framework, assisting SIEs and preparing on-going assessment reports and providing the World 
Bank with timely reports to enable the World Bank to fulfill its M&E responsibilities. Progress 
reports of the project as a whole and the individual subprojects will also be used by the World 
Bank to identify bottlenecks and assess to what extent adjustments, at the project or subproject 
level, are necessary, and in discussion with MDF decide on a course of action.

ANNEX 4:  DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
 
The proposed EDFF project consists of two main components that will be implemented during 
the January 2009 
–
June 2012 period. The 
first Component
 covers the key objectives of the 
EDFF and relates to supporting initiatives which will implement specific sub-projects 
designed to promote post-tsunami economic recovery and sustainable and equitable long-
term development through addressing areas identified by the GoA as needing further efforts, 
or which have not yet been addressed. The 
second Component 
funds capacity building 
including an international consultancy to assist the GoA in the establishment and 
management of the Project Management Unit and to assist KPDT in the implementation of 
the project at the central government level through a project Secretariat. 
Component One.
 
The first component will support sub-projects that address critical issues 
affecting economic development in Aceh by contributing to building a more competitive and 
supportive business environment necessary to create broad based private sector job 
opportunities and growth in Aceh, targeting the poor and other vulnerable groups.  
Component Two
.
This component
aims to ensure strong project management. 
An international 
consulting firm will be contracted to work along side the GoA and KPDT and will assist with 
the setting up and operation of the PMU in BAPPEDA Aceh and a project Secretariat in 
KPDT to assist implementation of the project at the central government level. This will 
include 
sub-project assessment and review, procurement, financial management, safeguards 
compliance, implementation, supervision, and monitoring
.
In addition to assisting the GoA and 
KPDT with these important areas, the consulting firm will provide training and skills 
development to the local staff of the PMU and the KPDT. It is expected that through the 
working relationship, the GoA and KPDT staff will enhance their skills in managing project 
design and management.  This is an important aspect of the component given the longer term 
needs of Aceh for economic development which will not be addressed through the EDFF.  In 
this way the EDFF will help to build capacity within the GoA and others closely involved in 
the project, to plan, identify development gaps, evaluate and select sub-projects to address 
identified gaps, to prioritize competing proposals as well as to monitor, evaluate and 
supervise the implementation of sub-projects. The capacity building will primarily be the 
result of hands on experience by working in this project alongside an experienced team of 
consultants hired to support PMU. The main beneficiary of this capacity building will be 
BAPPEDA, the agency tasked with coordinating development in the province, but other 
institutions which might be involved in the implementation of sub-projects (such as dinas 
agriculture, BKPMD – the investment board, district governments) will also benefit, although 
that will depend on the nature of individual sub-projects. In addition, the selection criteria for 
the EDFF sub-projects also reflect the focus on capacity building and sustainability, 
including the ability of the sub-project to improve the capacity of government agencies 
involved in sub-project implementation. 
The EDFF,will support sub-projects proposals which fill-in strategic and financing gaps based 
upon the vision for economic development explicit in the master plan prepared by 
BAPPENAS as well as the RPJMD, within the broader focus outlined below for poverty 
alleviation, equitable and sustainable long term economic development and job creation, in 
the following areas:  
Page  65
56 
 
Improving the Business Environment 
(i) 
Reform of regulations and procedures related to investment, business 
formation, land use, etc to improve the business environment; 
(ii) 
Promotion of Aceh to domestic and foreign investors; 
(iii) 
Building capacity of government to promote private sector development. 
Private Sector Support 
(i) 
Improvement to access to finance to small and medium enterprises 
–
beyond the current focus on micro-finance by many donors; 
(ii) 
Developing capacities and competitiveness of local entrepreneurs – 
stimulating innovation, providing world class training, facilitating access to 
business development services; 
(iii) 
Assistance to local entrepreneurs, especially in productive and export 
sectors, to gain better access to markets (focus on packaging, branding and 
marketing, improve access to information); 
(iv) 
Scalable, market-oriented programs that improve productivity and quality 
in agriculture and fisheries. 
Public Infrastructure  
(i) 
Strategic, complementary economic infrastructure activities, to be 
provided by the public sector (alone or in partnership with the privates sector) that 
enable access to market for Aceh producers and enterprises. Infrastructure to be 
provided under this component should not duplicate with what is being provided 
by the local governments or Dinas.  
(a) Improving the Business Environment 
A
better enabling business and investment environment is key factor to the creation of jobs and 
market driven enterprises. Given that approximately 80,000 SMEs were destroyed during the 
Tsunami, it is important to bring back business to Aceh.  The Doing Business Report (2008) 
of the World Bank ranks Indonesia in place 123 out of 178 countries considered and 
identifies areas where reforms are most urgently needed, such as the procedures to start a 
business or the labor laws. Recent research has shown that improving the regulatory 
environment has a significant and positive impact on growth (Djankov et al, 2006). Much of 
the regulatory environment has to be improved at the national level, and Aceh has limited 
influence on that. But many regulations are local, and the implementation is often the 
responsibility of local institutions, in that sense, there is much that Aceh can do to improve 
the business environment and through that improve the prospects for the creation of 
enterprises and jobs. 
An improved business environment will result in a larger number of firms being willing to invest 
in productive capacities in Aceh – both already located in the province and new potential 
Page  66
57 
 
investors. One of the keys
 to “Building Aceh Back Better” for long-term sustainable 
economic development is business and capital investment: private investment that can 
modernize and add value to Aceh’s products and services, and public investment that can 
provide for the infrastructure needed for a growing economy. The RPJMD identifies the need 
to attract both domestic and foreign investment as key to fostering long term economic 
growth in Aceh.  The EDFF seeks to support this important area.  
There are no disaggregated data on investment in the province, but as mentioned above, 
investment as a share of GDP was only 7 percent in 2004, between 1/3 and ¼ of investment 
levels in the rest of the country. The lack of investment has resulted in obsolete technologies 
being used, low levels of training and human capital development and deteriorated capital 
stocks. There are a number of reasons for the lack of investment in the province. Potential 
investors have identified several factors in Aceh’s business environment as problematic
13
 
which require government attention:  
There are difficulties in accessing or leasing land, there are multiple departments to deal 
with, different maps in different departments and it is difficult to obtain clear 
information on zoning and land ownership and  title; 
Investors are encouraged by reforms at the national level (BKPM, the OSS, changes to 
Investment and Tax Laws and changes in the pipeline for companies Law and 
Labor Law), but perceive the uncertainty in Aceh as well as the potential time it 
may take local authorities to actually implement the national changes  as a 
disadvantage compared to other Indonesian provinces; 
Aceh’s Special Autonomy is perceived to add some extra financial burdens (e.g. extra 
charges for palm oil production) and uncertainty in terms of roles and 
responsibilities between the different government levels; 
Safety/ security is still a concern for many potential investors, citing ‘special taxes’ being 
asked from the business community; 
Economic and political security is a concern, e.g. rule of law, predictability of the local 
economy are also often difficult to determine. 
The GoA has identified investment goals for the next 5 years to ensure a supportive investment 
climate and to target an investment growth of at least 5 percent per year. The GoA also seeks 
to improve competitiveness of the investment climate through clear and effective use of 
Qanun
14
 and improved regulations, to reduce the bureaucratic requirements that currently 
delay the timely introduction of new investments, to support the continuation of the regional 
economic cooperation (IMT –GT) and to improve exports through building capacity of local 
governments to facilitate trade and exports and promoting local economic resources through 
information dissemination.

Access to finance also has been identified by the GoA in the RPJMD as one of the key 
constraints for both agriculture and manufacturing. While banks are collecting deposits 
locally, they are reluctant to lend locally. They have taken a “wait and see” position until 
they are satisfied that sustainable reconstruction is well underway, there is political stability, 
private and public investment has returned and there is a manageable process for addressing 
non-performing loans. Increasing the opportunities for financing of business development 
consistent with good lending practices, increasing long term employment and wage 
generation of potential borrowers would help to address some of bank’s concerns. Though 
there is micro finance capacity in Aceh, these address mostly the demand for very small 
loans, and gaps in accessing finance for SMEs remain. Although credit has increased 
significantly in Aceh since the Tsunami, credit for consumption and working capital 
accounted for approximately 88 percent of all credit in 2007, leaving only 12 percent for 
investment purposes. Of all credit going to businesses (working capital and investment), over 
50 percent goes to the trade and hospitality sector, with less than 6 percent going to the 
agriculture and fisheries sectors. 
Foreign direct investment in Aceh has been lacking. Such investment could help to provide 
needed capital and job generation, improved linkages with global markets, technology 
spillovers and international best practices, all of which are needed to help turn around the 
economy. The challenge is to reshape disparate elements of government policy into an 
effective package that encourages good investment. A variety of technical assistance may be 
required to build the capacity to attract investment, and to manage outside investment such 
that there is a transfer of knowledge and technology to improve the productivity of Aceh’s 
businesses and workforce.  
Key initiatives identified by the team preparing this project
15
 that the EDFF could support to 
improve the enabling environment would be: 
(a) 
To change investor perceptions of political risk, the GoA could consider providing, 
on an assisted basis, insurance against physical/property losses attributable to conflict. 
(b) 
To address the perception of corruption and added fees attributed to “rent seeking”. 
To that end, (i) the Governor and district heads sign joint security guarantees; (ii) 
adopt reform framework for Aceh district revenue administration to minimize 
arbitrary fees and other charges; and (iii) create a fast track response system to 
address investor complaints about illegal treatment/ extortion. 
(c) 
To reduce administrative costs and uncertainties in establishing a business, the GoA 
should minimize regulatory and licensing complexity and provide clear guidance to 
investors on required clearances. To that end, the GoA should (i) establish and 
publish clear rules for issuing licenses, publish license/permit costs, set maximum 
time limits for issuance of provincial/local clearances; (ii) identify and act on 
opportunities to bundle/eliminate license steps once national investment regulations 
have been clarified; (iii) construct a publicly available ‘road-map to registration and 
15
 Recommendations based on research commissioned by the World Bank: CSIRO 2008 and IFC 2008. 
Page  68
59 
 
approval; and (iv) create a reliable record of business registrations and actual 
investments. 
(d) 
To facilitate access to land, the GoA should coordinate land use and titling 
information by establishing a single ‘available plantation/industrial land’ register. To 
that end, it should identify provincial and district owned lands immediately to 
determine what land might be available for plantation and industrial lease purposes. It 
should also adopt a competitive tendering approach for the allocation of government 
owned land for plantation and other purposes. To that end, it should (i) seek 
agreement at the district/kota level to a standard and transparent tendering approach, 
(ii) make available to potential investors information concerning the tendering 
process through the appropriate mechanisms (BKPMD, Investment Outreach Office). 
(e) 
 To improve access to market price information for agribusiness suppliers, the GoA 
should strengthen grower bargaining power with traders through better price 
information. To that end, it should determine (i) price information gaps (shrimp 
industry pilot), (ii) best model for continued information gathering and distribution, 
and commit funding to do it. 
(f) 
To develop culturally based market niches and improve market access, the GoA 
should develop direct ties with Malaysian halal standards authorities. To that end, the 
GoA should (i) conduct ‘Standards’ mission to Malaysian Accreditation Council and 
NCER Implementation Authority, and (ii) prepare a subsequent implementation plan 
for 5 year convergence with Malaysia. 
(g) 
To improve agricultural productivity growth and efficient scale operations in key 
sectors the GoA should develop effective extension services training, staff retention 
and a strong implementation
 
program. To that end, it should (i) review extension 
services budgets, (ii) set minimum extension budget shares for staff training and 
service implementation at provincial and district levels, and (iii) identify potential 
private suppliers of extension services. 
(b) Private Sector Support 
The private sector in Aceh is dominated by micro and small enterprises, which account for over 
99 percent of formal sector businesses in Aceh. There are only 36 large and medium 
enterprises in Aceh according to the 2006 BPS industrial survey, down from 52 large and 
medium enterprises in 2002. These enterprises employ approximately 5,500 workers, less 
than 4 percent of Aceh’s total work force, illustrating the dominance of small enterprises in 
Aceh’s business landscape. A large majority of the labor force works in the informal sector
16
,
again highlighting the relative weakness of Aceh’s private sector and the need to support it 
and addressing key constraints for private sector development, particularly in those sectors 
where Aceh has a comparative advantage and where a large percentage of the population 
works, agriculture and fisheries.  
16
 BPS and Dinas Industry estimated in 2004 total formal sector employment below 50,000 people, which would be 
less than 3 percent of Aceh’s labor force. 
Page  69
60 
 
Almost 60 percent of the labor force in Aceh works in agriculture and fisheries. Prior to the 
Tsunami, agriculture, which today is relatively stagnant, was a significant driver of the local 
economy, constituting about 25 percent of the economy and a growth rate of 3.5 percent 
between 2000 and 2004. Poverty in Aceh is predominantly a rural phenomenon. Before the 
Tsunami, 33 percent
17
 of rural households lived below the poverty line, compared to 18 
percent in urban areas. In Aceh, alleviating poverty will require the recovery and scaling up 
of those sectors that provide livelihoods for the poor 
–
particularly agriculture and fisheries 
and position Aceh to more fully participate in the value chain associated with its local 
products. The RPJMD identifies revitalization of agriculture and fisheries as two of its key 
strategies in alleviating poverty in Aceh, but points to the following constraints: weak or 
damaged rural infrastructure, low productivity and quality of agricultural production, the lack 
of available land for agricultural purposes, access to finance and markets fragmentation.  
In the RPJMD, the GoA has defined its goal for the agriculture sector, which is to have it grow 
by 3.16 percent per annum.  It projects that by 2010 the sector will have grown by 16.8 
percent compared to 2006 and will employ an estimated 950,000 people. It expects to 
achieve this by improving infrastructure, empowering farmers, enhancing supervision of the 
agriculture sector, ensuring that relevant and timely agriculture market information is 
available and generally accessible to communities and encouraging farmers to adapt and use 
new farming technology.  
The RPJMD identifies the promotion of trade and diversification of exports toward non-oil and 
gas exports as key for the longer term development of Aceh’s economy.
18
 Given the 
projected decline in production it is crucial to diversify the base of Aceh’s economy. Aceh’s 
non oil and gas exports, for a variety of reasons (the Tsunami, low productivity, conflict-
related security issues, and infrastructure problems) have been progressively decreasing
19
.
Non-oil and gas exports from Acehnese ports were worth US$84.3 million in 2007, less than 
2
percent of non oil and gas GDP. That compares with 31 percent for the whole of Indonesia, 
46 percent for the Philippines or 74 percent for Thailand. Additional revenue from export 
earnings could spur investment, increase employment, and increase both household incomes 
and domestic spending while also contributing to the adoption of international export 
standards, better technology, and increased productivity and improved management 
practices.
20
 
The GoA is concerned about the lowering levels of exports coupled with its 
depleting oil and gas reserves and seeks a growth in other activities. 
Both fisheries and agriculture will be key sectors for the success of the GoA’s efforts to diversify 
the export base. The fisheries sector contributes significantly to Aceh’s total exports, 
although this has been declining since 2000. Previously Aceh had a vibrant fisheries industry 
17
 World Bank,
 2008,  “Aceh Poverty Assessment 2008”. 
18
 Currently, oil and gas account for over 90 percent of Aceh’s exports. 
19
 Trade data used in this analysis primarily capture trade going through Acehnese ports. A large percentage of 
Aceh’s products are sold to other provinces or uses Medan for shipment and are therefore not captured by these data. 
Therefore, these data are likely to underestimate trade in Aceh, particularly exports of non-fuel commodities such as 
coffee and palm oil.

producing a total of 140,000 tonnages of both marine and inland fish harvested in 2004.  This 
declined to 109,000 ton in 2005
21
.
Although the sector accounts for only 5 percent of GDP, it 
is estimated to employ over 100,000 people, ranging from fisherman to sellers. The Tsunami 
had a direct impact on the fishing industry where it is estimated that the total indirect loss 
was about US$ 414
22
 million. A similar trend can be seen in the export of agricultural 
commodities, such as coffee, where exports fell from US$12.7 million in 2000 to below 
US$5 million in 2006. This decline is also reflected in the number of people working in 
agriculture, which fell from over one million people in 2003 to less than 900,000 three years 
later. Preliminary 2007 data show a significant increase in non oil and gas exports, signaling 
a
recovery both from the destruction of the Tsunami and the end of the conflict in 2005. 
Identifying and developing Aceh’s comparative advantages and encouraging private sector 
investment will help to facilitate economic recovery and growth. To access regional and 
global markets, Aceh will need to become more competitive. The GoA has identified several 
opportunities in a range of commodities which Aceh could produce. These areas are for the 
most, part consistent with those identified post Tsunami by the BRR and donors. The EDFF 
will consider funding proposals to support technical assistance to build the capacities of 
public institutions to facilitate trade as well as public-private alliances which support exports 
and regional trade initiatives. 
Provincial government policies to better manage the natural resources of Aceh are needed to help 
slow and stop their current over exploitation. Forestry areas are being poorly managed and 
some marine resources are being over harvested as a result of the movement of people 
following the Tsunami. The GoA is interested in having local communities become more 
involved in the management of these resources.  The EDFF will consider sub-projects which 
facilitate the development of such resource management policies and regulations by 
strengthening capacity of local governments and working with communities to develop 
appropriate resource management plans that provide for greater opportunities for 
communities to benefit from the harvesting of these resources and downstream processing 
opportunities.  
Little processing is at the moment done in Aceh, with most of the excess production being sold 
as commodities to traders or processors in other provinces or exported. Much of the poverty 
alleviation that occurred in Indonesia in the 70s and 80s was actually through the creation of 
off-farm labor opportunities, in agro-industry and labor intensive industries. Given Aceh’s 
comparative advantage in agriculture and strategic geographical position, it would not be 
difficult, if constraints to investment and private sector development are addressed, to attract 
investment into agribusiness. A strong local agro-processing industry would also increase 
demand for Acehnese agricultural products, create sustainable jobs absorbing some of the 
excess labor in rural areas. Limited processing of some commodities such as coffee is already 
taking place. The EDFF could address constraints along value chains of key commodities to 
facilitate processing of agricultural production in the province.

The role of women in economic activities is of special concerns in the agricultural sector, where 
female farmers are dominant in the production and processing of key commodities, but lack 
equitable access and control over productive resources (land as assets and collateral), lack 
access to information and newer technologies, lack access to capital and lack an equitable 
voice in decision making at all levels. Lack of women’s recognition as farmers means that 
support services for women farmers are generally inadequate and misdirected and often do 
not benefit from capacity building and training programs. There is a growing ‘feminization’ 
of agriculture in Aceh, as men leave the agricultural sector for employment outside the 
sector. With peace, women are moving out of their homes and villages to engage in 
enterprises linked to production, processing, marketing and services. As such, it is important 
that EDFF recognizes this and subprojects to be financed address the issue of gender inequity 
and where feasible contain components to enhance the role of women in economic 
development and employment. 
Key initiatives identified to support the private sector (primarily in the agriculture and fisheries 
sectors) that the EDFF could support would include: 
(a) 
To promote development in the agricultural sector, (i) promote modernization and 
technology up-take for increased productivity in the agricultural sector, (ii) facilitate 
market-based mechanisms that enhance access to capital for  entrepreneurs, (iii) 
provide cooperative frameworks for shared capital and market access combined with 
individual land tenure rights, (iv) improve the provision of agricultural inputs 
(fertilizer, seeds) and pest control, (v) develop a facility for integrated agro-tourism 
and agri-business (support to product manufacturers and marketing), and (iv) analyze 
value chains of key commodities, identifying constraints and ways to address them 
through market oriented interventions, attracting private investment as well as public 
interventions to address any market failures.  
(b) 
To promote development in the livestock sector, the GoA could support cooperatives 
that are being established in the (semi-)intensive beef cattle, dairy cattle and poultry 
farmers businesses. Cooperatives will need support in terms of setting up costs, 
establishing partnerships with processing industries, training as well as access to 
finance. 
(c) 
To promote development in the fisheries sector, the GoA could  (i) prepare and 
integrated coastal spatial plan, (ii) improve the coordination of different development 
activities, (iii) promote investment in post-harvest facilities, (iv) improve human 
capacity, access to information, technology in-take as well as access to finance, (v) 
promote the formation of joint ventures with national or international investors to 
establish fish processing industries, (vi) rehabilitate brackish water ponds and shrimp 
hatcheries, (vii) Operationalization of pilot projects for vannamei cultivation, 
extensive windu lobster cultivation and grouper fish hatcheries, (viii) rebuilding 
hatcheries to certification standards, including training and establishing systems of 
quality control, and (ix) restoration of fish cages. In addition, the GoA could facilitate 
private sector investments in fisheries related industries such as seaweed factories and 
animal food factories.

(d) 
To better manage natural resources for sustainable economic development, the GoA 
should (i) increase the efficiency of timber utilization, (ii) improve data and 
information availability, (iii) provide disincentive regulations, (iv) Increase the 
potential of non-timber products, (v) audit of exiting laws and regulations regarding 
environmental management, (vi) develop natural resources laws and regulations, 
taking into consideration customary and traditional practices, and (vii) establish 
courts and tribunals to deal exclusively with land and the environment. 
(c)  Public Infrastructure 
The EDFF may support strategic, complementary economic infrastructure sub-projects, but will 
not fund general infrastructure sub-projects, an area currently being addressed by other 
sources of funding.  Infrastructure to be financed should be public or have a ‘public good 
character’, meaning that there will be positive externalities (e.g., cold storage, irrigation, 
fishing port facilities, product testing and certification facilities, etc.). To the extent that the 
private sector can become involved, the GoA should encourage private sector participation, 
on its own or in partnership with the government and market based solutions will be 
preferable. The EDFF should not duplicate or substitute for what is already being financed by 
the local governments. In that sense, it will be important for SIE to coordinate with local 
governments and ensure that EDFF is complementary to LG efforts to provide the necessary 
infrastructure for economic development. 
Key initiatives identified to invest in public infrastructure (or provide incentives for private 
sector involvement) that the EDFF could support would include: 
(a) 
For aquaculture, improve facilities such as laboratory and hatcheries. 
(b) 
For fish capture, improve facilities for small ports (in a very limited way) and boat 
yards, fish auction facilities, cold storage, ice factories, etc. 
(c) 
For marine culture, improve facilities such as hatchery and fish feed industry. 
(d) 
For agriculture, support the rehabilitation of cultivation land damaged by the Tsunami 
or that had been abandoned, supporting it with irrigation infrastructure, improve and 
upgrade local roads, extend power supply network in rural areas.  
(d)  Capacity Building 
Capacity building linked to job creation, employment and sustainable economic growth will be a 
part of the project and through the sub-projects it is anticipated that it may be addressed at 
various levels. Capacity building is anticipated at the local community, both for individuals 
and groups of individuals. Local community organizations and community leaders may need 
assistance to better understand needed local regulatory changes and other steps that can be 
taken to support job growth and sustainable economic development. The extent to which 
proposed sub-projects will build local capacity by working with local communities, district 
governments, academia and civil society in general will be given weight in the sub-project 
selection process.

ANNEX 6:  CRITICAL RISKS, MITIGATION MEASURES AND RATING 
 
1. 
Risks and mitigation measures are divided into risks at the project level, which can be 
mitigated at this stage through project design, and risks at the sub-project level, that can be 
mitigated at this stage through careful definition of sub-project selection criteria and later 
through sub-project selection as shown below.

Mitigation 
RISKS AT THE PROJECT LEVEL  
General 
Currency fluctuations 
and the potential negative 
impact just as Aceh 
pushed for more exports 
M
Aceh accounts for only 2 percent of national GDP. So a 
strong increase in Aceh’s exports is unlikely to result in a 
strong appreciation of the nominal exchange rate. On the 
other hand, the real exchange rate might appreciate 
slightly as prices of those factors of production use more 
intensively in the exports sector increases.  
M
Macroeconomic 
framework:  Slow growth 
in Aceh related to the 
decline of gas production 
and weak business 
environment.  
Unemployment is high 
and reconstruction jobs  
are not sustainable.  
Traditional sectors not 
linked to reconstruction 
show low or negative 
growth rates. 
M
Reforms have been underway to reduce the country’s 
macroeconomic risks. Aceh has prepared its strategy for 
developing its economy as a means to addressing its 
specific macroeconomic risks.  These will help to address 
the needs for economic development and job creation.  In 
addition, The GoA hopes to use the EDFF as a pilot for 
what it can do to further sustainable economic 
development in the future using funds transferred from 
the central government. 
 
The transfer of substantial public funds in the form of the 
Special Autonomy Fund until 2028 (embedded in Law on 
Government of Aceh 11/2006) should mitigate the risk of 
a
hard landing after the reconstruction effort slows down 
in mid 2009.

Mitigation 
Security and conflict, a 
Peace Agreement signed 
in 2005. The ex-
Combatants have not 
seen the jobs and 
prosperity they were 
promised.  Unless 
economic conditions can 
be changed, there is a 
chance that unrest will 
return. 
 
Provincial and local 
elections in the next few 
years might heighten 
tensions. A different 
provincial administration 
may not support the 
EDFF in the way the 
current administration 
does. 
 
There is a slight chance 
that national elections in 
2009 pick up on the 
different regional issues. 
A
different central 
administration may try to 
roll back some of the 
concessions given to 
Aceh. 
 
Further separation of 
administrative units 
involved in the 
implementation of the 
project.  
S
The Government is very much aware of the potential and 
its economic development strategy addresses the issue. 
The EDFF, although specifically designed to address 
Tsunami related reconstruction needs related to economic 
development will directly impact job creation and it is 
expected that the jobs created will serve the greater Aceh.  
Further separation of administrative units seems to have 
been stopped at the highest level, at least until after the 
national election in 2009. This would ensure that at least 
the selection of projects is undertaken with a single 
provincial administration as the counterpart, although 
separation during project implementation would need 
readjustment of implementation modalities foreseen in 
the project. 
M
Externalities 
Political interference in 
funds flow process 
S
The establishment of PMU with consultants as well as the 
sub-project selection process coupled with an 
independent financial management team will be supplied 
as part of the consultant team to monitor fiduciary 
arrangements.

M
Consultant teams do not 
meet performance 
requirements 
S
The Bank will support GoA in closely monitoring 
performance of consultants through intensive supervision. 
The TORs of the consultants have clauses included that 
mandate replacement of underperforming staff; also as 
part of the contract, consultants must sign an integrity 
clause.  
 
GoA has hired a procurement advisor to assist GoA in the 
selection of the consultant’s team. World Bank has 
extensive experience of assisting government 
(particularly in Aceh) in setting up such TA, most 
recently the TA provided to BRR for implementation of 
the Infrastructure Reconstruction Financing Facility in 
Aceh.  
M
Fiduciary Risks 
H 
Involvement of key government counterparts in the 
design of the project to increase ownership and apply 
local knowledge to mitigation measures. 
 
Operations Manual that sets clear rules understood by all 
stakeholders. 
 
Use of on-budget mechanism, allowing the local 
government to use its own institutions to supervise the 
allocation and use of funds. 
 
Inclusion of an agreed upon anti-corruption plan 
throughout the live of the project 
S
Capacity of the Bank to 
meet its responsibilities 
with respect to review 
and supervision of sub-
projects  
S
Although theoretically the EDFF could finance a 
substantial number of sub-projects across several 
economic development areas, each of which would 
require Bank review, the selection process should ensure 
a
fewer number. The Bank will assess its staffing needs 
and allocate adequate resources to ensure the constitution 
of a strong team that can shoulder its responsibilities 
towards sub-projects financed as sub-projects are actually 
selected.  
M
RISKS AT THE SUB-PROJECT LEVEL 
Externalities 
Lack of involvement and 
support of key 
government agencies 
M
The selected sub-projects must have prior government 
endorsement and will be selected by the government 
itself. The GoA, BAPPEDA and BRR have been actively 
involved.  Continued involvement will be encouraged

Systemic corruption: - 
Petty corruption is 
Common. Historically, 
“Rent Seekers” have 
attempted to interfere 
with other projects   
 
H
Project design, through the selection criteria and the 
selection process (3-tiered approval process), will 
minimize the likelihood of unworthy projects being 
selected. 
 
Implementation of sub-projects may still be subject to 
petty corruption. The EDFF will be owned by GoA and 
BAPPEDA, which may reduce the likelihoods of projects 
being subject to such petty corruption or increase the 
likelihood of remedial action. 
 
In most cases, implementing entities have already been 
implementing projects in Aceh for the last 3 years. Most 
will have developed their own strategies and ways in 
dealing with petty corruption. 
S
Implementation
 
Technical/design: delays 
in sub-project 
implementation, overly 
optimistic estimates of 
outcomes, 
underestimation of time 
to implement 
 
M
Most entities implementing sub-projects are likely to 
have already gained experience in implementing sub-
projects in Aceh, which should make their 
implementation plans more realistic. 
 
The team preparing the EDFF project is well aware of the 
need to monitor the projected outcomes and timelines, 
and will liaise with entities implementing sub-projects 
accordingly, managing also expectations from the 
government and donors’ sides. 
M
Failure of sub-project 
implementation to have 
adequately addressed 
Social and environmental 
safeguards
 
M
Addressing safeguards will be reviewed at sub-project 
application review and again after project selection and

with sub-project as part of its monitoring program 
 
N
Ability or willingness of 
entities implementing 
subprojects to implement 
according to World Bank 
policies and guidelines 
H
Many entities have approached the World Bank enquiring 
about EDFF financing, therefore the interest is high. 
PMU will have expertise to assist entities to implement 
according to World Bank guidelines. Initial discussions 
with some entities that have different policies and 
guidelines took place, indicating the willingness of these 
entitites to adopt World Bank guidelines for the purpose 
of implementing activities financed through EDFF

To ensure transparency in the procurement process, 
enhanced procurement procedures are included in the 
Anti-Corruption Action Plan. Procurement training 
activities and a capacity assessment will also be 
conducted with consultant’s assistance if needed.  
 
Early on, PMU will rely on international consultants’ 
expertise on procurement issues to assess the 
procurement capacity of entities implementing sub-
projects as well as monitoring procurement processes. 
 
The procurement ability of the sub-project proponent will 
be considered as one of the sub-project selection criteria
.
S
Sub-project contracts 
will not be executed to 
standards and costs as 
designed 
S
Most entities implementing sub-projects are likely to 
have entities gained experience in implementing sub-
projects in Aceh. Many entities have learned important 
lessons over the last three years both in terms of realistic 
planning (timelines, costs as well as outputs) and how to 
improve their ability to implement projects
.
In addition, 
improved bid documents and tight control by PMU are 
expected.
 
M
All sub-projects financed 
by EDFF will not be 
fully implemented by the 
time the project closes in 
June 2012 
S
Selection of sub-projects will be undertaken early in 
implementation and will strive to identify projects with 
the greatest likelihood of completion within the 
timeframe. 
N
Weak Monitoring and 
Evaluation: 
-
Lack of realistic 
benchmarks in sub-
project design 
-
Low capacity to 
conduct monitoring and 
evaluation of the sub-
projects 
 
S
Selection evaluation will include looking at the ability to 
benchmark and track performance.  When the subproject 
documents are prepared they will be reviewed by the 
PMU for benchmarks as well as ME capacity.  Outside 
consultants will be extensively involved and Bank will 
spot check as part of project supervision.   
 
Most entities implementing sub-projects are likely to 
have already gained experience in implementing sub-
projects in Aceh, which should make their benchmarks 
more realistic. 
 
The project design foresees a relatively strong presence 
of M&E staffing at PMU level, showing the focus of the 
design on being able to demonstrate results
.
M
Lack of sustainability of 
sub-projects financed by 
EDFF 
S
Selection evaluation will require sub-projects to address 
sustainability of investments (e.g. through Commitment 
of local governments to provide funds for operations and 
maintenance as necessary or design exit strategy for the 
implementing party).

ANNEX 7:  IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS 
 
1. 
The EDFF project is structured as a programmatic operation with a framework type 
design in that it will fund a number of sub-projects which will be prepared, implemented and 
supervised over the next 3.5 years by others (Attachment 3 includes a Gantt Chart with the 
project’s timeline). An agreement will be signed with GOI’s State Ministry for Disadvantaged 
Areas (KPDT) which will be GOI’s lead
 
implementing agency for the project.  The KPDT in 
turn will simultaneously enter into a similar agreement referencing the primary agreement, with 
the GoA, who will be the implementing agency of the EDFF. The World Bank serves as the 
partner agency under the Multi Donor Fund for Aceh and Nias legal framework and will be 
responsible for EDFF project supervision. The individual sub-projects will be implemented by 
third parties. Sub-project selection will take place after project approval to ensure transparency 
and consistency in the selection process.  Following this solicitation for proposals, the selection 
process will commence. If sufficient acceptable applications are not received, the first round 
selections will be made so that their implementation will not be delayed and a second more 
narrow solicitation will follow. 
2. 
Operations Manual (OM) 
will guide project implementation and will list all project-
related policies and procedures. This Manual will contain, among other things, specific 
accounting and reporting procedures for all organizations involved in project implementation, 
preparation of Interim Financial Reports (IFRs), and details of procurement, environmental and 
safeguards compliance procedures. It will contain a detailed anti-corruption action plan as well 
as the evaluation and monitoring that will be undertaken by project management and audit 
requirement by different government institutions. In addition, the document will include details 
of the sub-project application eligibility criteria. The Manual will provide detailed guidelines as 
well as templates which sub-project proponents that have been selected will have to follow to 
prepare and present a final sub-project document. A draft Manual has been prepared and will be 
finalized by the PMU (assisted by the consulting firm) during the early stages of project 
implementation. Any subsequent changes to the Manual will be done by the PMU subject to 
approval by the World Bank.

INSTITUTIONAL AND IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS
 
3. 
Implementation, Players and Functions. 
The
 
EDFF project will use a management 
structure (Figure 6) supportive of local government participation, capacity building and 
achieving the maximum benefit of the EDFF project. The project will be driven by the GoA and 
assisted in implementation by both the BRR (until its sunset date) and the KPDT, be responsive 
to local needs while striving to be responsive and timely in the review, selection and funding of 
sub-projects. The implementation of the overall facility rests heavily with the GoA thru 
BAPPEDA, which will house PMU. The GoA and its PMU will be supported by an international 
consultant management firm. The KPDT will be the GOI’s implementing agency. The BRR will 
continue to be engaged and will help to provide advice to the GoA and PMU based upon their 
past experience in selecting and overseeing similar projects during their term in Aceh. The 
overall process of evaluating, selecting and monitoring of selected sub-projects has been 
designed to minimize unnecessary interference and duplication. In addition to these parties 
which are involved in the implementation of the facility, third parties will manage and 
implement selected sub-projects. 
4. 
Government of Aceh - 
Government institutions in Aceh and Jakarta have provided the 
overall operational and strategic guidance necessary to ensure the sub-projects selected are in 
line with regional development priorities as specified by the GoA generally and specifically in its 
economic development strategy (RPJMD) and triple A project. The GoA will ensure that the 
investments and activities of the sub-projects are consistent with its priorities.  
Page  82

5. 
Office of the Governor of Aceh. 
 The office of the Governor of Aceh will be a part of 
the Selection Com
mittee. It will ensure that the Governor’s views are represented in the 
Selection Committee and the implementation of the project. 
6. 
BAPPEDA
 will manage the PMU and will be key factor in the selection of sub-projects 
through leadership and participation in the Selection Committee. It will monitor the progress of 
the sub-projects primarily through the PMU and be responsible for progress reports and 
monitoring and evaluation of Sub-projects Implementing Entities. Further, the PMU will review 
requests for payment from the sub-projects and will follow the disbursement mechanism through 
the KPPN (Treasury Office). Although BAPPEDA Aceh will be the implementing agency of the 
EDFF at the provincial level, to ensure EDFF supports the implementation of the GoA strategies 
related to economic development in the province, it will be key to ensure the support of the 
relevant Dinas and district governments for activities financed through this project. The EDFF 
will support provincial level programs for the development of economic clusters; as such the 
fiscal responsibility for continuing activities financed through EDFF lies with the provincial 
government. Nonetheless it will be important to ensure the participation of the relevant districts 
and/ or Dinas in the identification of priorities and the design of subprojects. BAPPEDA Aceh 
has initiated discussions with the relevant Dinas which will intensify in the initial phases of 
project implementation. In addition, entities proposing subprojects for EDFF funding will be 
required to consult extensively with the relevant Dinas and district governments. 
7. 
BRR.
 The BRR, due to its experience in reconstruction in Aceh, will until it phases out, 
play an advisory role to BAPPEDA and the GoA in project implementation. It will also facilitate, 
as it has done until now, the interaction between the provincial and central government.  
8. 
BAPPENAS
,
as the GOI’s executing agency, will be responsible for the overall planning 
and evaluation of the project consistent with the Grant agreement between the World Bank and 
GOI. It will also provide the necessary coordination with the MOF, the KPDT and other central 
government agencies. It will also facilitate the smooth exit of the BRR from the project as BRR 
phases out in early 2009. The BAPPENAS also will be responsible for setting up a Project 
Steering Committee at the central government level that will provide policy guidance to the 
KPDT and the GoA on project implementation, to ensure all administrative procedures are in 
accordance with GOI laws and regulations, as well as the adherence of the project as a whole to 
BAPPENAS blueprint for Aceh’s reconstruction. The BAPPENAS will be responsible for 
counterpart financing (government staff honoraria, taxes and other operational expenses) for 
BAPPENAS and KPDT. The preparation of the budget document (DIPA) will reflect the funds 
allocation in the following manner: (i) payment to the consulting firm assisting BAPPEDA and 
KPDT, (ii) operating costs of KPDT, (iii) block grant for subprojects at the provincial level. 
Further allocation of the block grants will not be possible at the time of the preparation of the 
DIPA since projects selection (and allocation of funds to sectors and districts) is part of project 
implementation. The BAPPENAS will provide staff sufficient to fulfill these responsibilities, the 
cost of which will be borne by BAPPENAS. 
9. 
The KPDT
,
as the implementing agency at the central level, will be responsible for 
overall implementation of the project. KPDT will be a member of the Selection Committee, it 
will also provide operational guidance to facilitate as well as monitor and evaluate project 
implementation. It will be responsible for budget execution, including making an annual budget 
Page  83
74 
 
application to the Ministry of Finance and setting up a project satker (Satuan Kerja), to be 
located in Aceh, which will be responsible for overall management of the annual budget (DIPA). 
KPDT will delegate the budget to the provincial government in Aceh as Dana Tugas 
Pembantuan. It will be responsible for dealing with withdrawal applications by the sub-project 
implementing entities (SIEs), after they have been reviewed and approved by the PMU. The 
KPDT will establish a Secretariat to assist with project implementation at the central government 
level as well as study project implementation to possibly replicate in other provinces. Finally, 
KPDT wil also be responsible for the internal audits of the project as well as overseeing the 
external audit to be conducted by BPKP. The operational costs to finance Satker, Secretariat and 
staff sufficient to fulfill these responsibilities are taken from counterpart financing allocated by 
BAPPENAS to the KPDT. 
10. 
Sub-project Selection Committee
.
A
Selection Committee, consisting of four persons 
will be established to make the final selection of sub-projects. The Committee, which will be 
composed of a representative of the Office of the Governor of Aceh, the Head of BAPPEDA 
Aceh, a representative of KPDT and a member selected from the academic community in Aceh, 
will review sub-project applications which have already successfully passed a preliminary 
screening performed by the outside consultant team with the PMU. The selection of the member 
of the Selection Committee from the academic community in Aceh will be open and transparent. 
The person should have thorough knowledge of local economic development issues in Aceh and 
have a high standing in the academic community and civil society in general. The selections 
made by the Committee will then be provided to the World Bank for its No-objection. The 
Selection Committee will have a relatively short duration, as it is expected that the totality of 
sub-projects will be selected in the initial stages of the project. Following formal selections and 
approval of the selections, the PMU assisted by its consulting firm will assume management of 
the project.  
11. 
Project Management Unit.
 The PMU, to be located in BAPPEDA, will consist of the 
consulting management firm as well as the GoA staff
23
.
It is expected that rotation of GoA staff 
assigned to PMU will be minimal, to allow for capacity building and a functioning of PMU as 
the consulting firm phases out in later stages of the project. A project management consulting 
firm will be hired by the GoA utilizing EDFF project funding. Staffing will be required for both 
core and support functions. 
12. 
Consultant Management Firm.
 The consulting firm will have two key interrelated 
roles. First, the firm will be responsible for the effective operation of the PMU and secondly, it 
will build capacity within the GoA to progressively assume the lead managerial role over PMU 
and build the capacity of the KPDT to implement similar projects in other provinces if the 
approach proves successful. The firm will oversee and work with the PMU and a project 
Secretariat in the KPDT. It is envisioned that the PMU will be staffed by the management firm 
along with GoA staff. The management firm will be responsible for assisting the GoA to 
establish PMU and for preparing a transition strategy (along with a training plan) to build 
capacity of GoA staff at PMU so PMU can function effectively without the need for extensive 
outside assistance by the end of the consultancy. The firm will assist PMU in the evaluation of 
23
 The GoA will assign staff on a full time basis to the PMU.  Initially this staffing will be small, but may grow as 
functions are being transferred to the PMU and GoA from the consultant management firm. 
Page  84
75 
 
sub-project applications and in the preparation of recommendations to the Selection Committee, 
the drafting of sub-grant agreements between the PMU and entities selected to implement sub-
projects, as well as in the monitoring and evaluation of sub-projects. The Consultant firm will 
also ensure that the operation of PMU with regards to financial management, procurement, 
communications are at an acceptable level to minimize risk and ensure good reporting. The 
consulting firm will also provide limited assistance to the Secretariat being established by the 
KPDT in the implementation of the project at the central level, in particular in solving any 
administrative issues that may arise, dealing with withdrawal applications in a timely manner to 
facilitate project implementation, facilitating the communication between the implementation 
agencies at the central and provincial level as well as assisting KPDT in its role of monitoring 
project implementation. Assistance will also be provided to the KPDT to assess whether the 
EDFF is a model that can be replicated in other provinces in Indonesia and build their capacity to 
implement similar projects in the future.  
13. 
The World Bank.
 The World Bank as partner agency will oversee the project. Its 
responsibilities will include: (i) appraisal; (ii) supervision of the project; (iii) will review the 
PMU’s evaluation report on each of the proposals submitted to the Selection Committee as well 
as the Selection Committee’s report on the selection process of selected sub-projects and issue 
No-Objection for each selection. (iv) will review all completed sub-project packages before they 
are commenced and issue an NOL to each, (v) will monitor results and report to the MDF on a 
six-monthly basis and (vi) administer the grant.  
14. 
Sub-project Management
.
The sub-projects will be implemented by different entities 
groups (such as NGOs (domestic and international), private sector organizations and 
international aid organizations). The SIEs will prepare the sub-project application and be 
responsible for tracking performance of their individual sub-project consistent with the agreed 
upon milestones and performance indicators.  They will also be responsible for ensuring that the 
sub-projects remain consistent with EDFF goals. The sub-projects will be supervised by the GoA 
through its PMU with general oversight by the KPDT and the World Bank as the partner agency 
responsible for the EDFF. 
15. 
Private Sector.
 
Ultimately, businesses together with individuals will be the beneficiaries 
of the EDFF project, and therefore will be ineligible to submit applications for sub-projects. The 
private sector will however be the primary beneficiary of the EDFF, having been identified by 
the RPJMD as a key partner of the GoA in the development of Aceh.  It is anticipated and will be 
encouraged that the private sector as well as local communities and local governments be 
consulted at various stages during the life of the EDFF. The private sector was consulted during 
project preparation to help identify key constraints and opportunities in brining about economic 
growth. At a minimum, the GoA/PMU will organize consultations with representatives of the 
private sector before launching a call for proposals to present the priorities for economic 
development identified by the project that is likely to receive financing and seek opinions of the 
Acehnese business community. Beneficiary communities will be involved primarily at the sub-
project level. Sub-project proposals should elaborate on the type of consultations that have 
already taken place as well as the type of involvement foreseen to discuss subproject design, 
implementation as well as to include the opinion of beneficiary communities in the monitoring 
and evaluation of subprojects. The extent to which the entity proposing a subproject has 
undertaken consultations with the beneficiary communities and the relevant Dinas and/ or 
Page  85
76 
 
District Government and the degree of ownership of the project by these will be key selection 
criteria.  
 
SUB
-
PROJECT ELIGIBILITY AND SELECTION
 
16. 
In order to ensure sub-projects financed under the EDFF meet the World Bank and 
international standards for quality of investment and are sustainable, investments financed under 
the project will be evaluated prior to selection based upon eligibility criteria. These eligibility 
criteria aim to ensure that sub-projects submitted for final approval by the PMU to the Selection 
Committee meet simple requirements for (i) inclusion in the proposed project; (ii) appropriate 
design of technical solutions; (iii) economic and financial viability, including ensuring that 
mechanisms are in place for operation and maintenance of EDFF-financed investments (to the 
extent applicable); (iv) analysis of relevant activities already implemented in the relevant sectors, 
including a focus on success factors and lessons learned that can improve the subproject 
implementation; (v) consultation with appropriate groups; (vi) compliance with the agreed-upon 
approach on environmental, social, and fiduciary safeguards, and (vii) capacity to fulfill 
appropriate procurement, FM requirements and M&E tracking. Details of these eligibility and 
selection criteria are available in Attachment 2 to this Annex. Eligibility and selection criteria 
will be adopted by the PMU prior to the evaluation and selection of subprojects. In addition, each 
selected sub-project will have its individual components reviewed for consistency with the 
overall objectives of the EDFF project. To keep the project manageable and avoid a large 
number of disintegrated sub-projects, the EDFF will accept applications between US$1 million 
and US$7 million and on an exceptional basis will consider sub-project applications larger than 
this amount, subject to World Bank approval. The EDFF will also consider up to three sub-
projects between US$500,000 and US$1 million. 
17. 
As discussed above, applications will be received and reviewed against defined criteria. 
The sub-project applications will first be reviewed against essential pre-selection criteria. Those 
projects applications that meet the first tier of essential criteria will be looked at in greater detail 
to ensure they meet the technical and implementation capacity criteria contained in phase two 
and three of the review process. All sub-projects meeting the criteria will be sent to the Selection 
Committee for consideration based upon the needs and priorities outlined by the GoA.  The 
World Bank will then review the selected sub-project to ensure it meets the EDFF criteria and 
issue a No-objection Letter (NOL). Selected entities should only be contacted by the PMU after 
issuance of NOL by the World Bank. 
18. 
Preparation and Approval of Individual Sub-project
:
All selected sub-projects 
receiving an NOL will be notified by the PMU.  Once the selection has been finalized a subgrant 
agreement between the PMU and the SIEs will be agreed to and will include a clear statement of 
the approved sub-project to be financed by EDFF.  Those selected for sub-project financing will 
be responsible for detailed sub-project preparation, including preliminary design, analysis of 
alternatives, conducting feasibility studies (including required safeguard assessments, 
environmental and social studies), followed by detailed design, budgets, procurement plan, 
Page  86

bidding documents
24
,
monitoring, evaluating and supervision plans. Final sub-project designs 
and tender documents will be submitted to the PMU for review. They will be reviewed to ensure 
they meet the technical, economic, financial and environmental and safeguards compliance 
criteria developed at the outset of the project. The final approved (by the PMU) sub-project 
document of each sub-project will then be submitted to the World Bank for issuance of an NOL. 
Upon issuance of NOL to the final sub-project document and signing of the subproject 
agreement, implementing entities may request reimbursement of up to US$100,000 toward 
financing the preparation of the project. This reimbursement is subject to approval of the sub-
project document by the World Bank (through NOL) and eligibility of expenses so entities which 
have sub-projects that have not received an NOL from the World Bank or that have not signed a 
sub-project grant agreement are not eligible for reimbursement for project preparation. 
19. 
Monitoring and Evaluation of Sub-project Outcomes/Results.
 The PMU will evaluate 
progress on the proposed indicators for each sub-project through regular reporting by the SIEs 
and will submit to the World Bank quarterly and more detailed yearly reports including output 
and outcome indicators for each sub-project. Each SIE will be responsible to prepare a 
monitoring and evaluation plan consistent with the agreed criteria (see Annex 3). The World 
Bank will be responsible for the monitoring and evaluation of the project itself, preparing reports 
every six months on physical and financial progress as well as the achievement of results. 
20. 
Sub-project Financing and Disbursement Procedures.
 The KPDT will follow the 
regular procedures for payment by a government entity. The KPDT will set up a project satker 
(Satuan Kerja) to be responsible for the overall management of the annual budget to be located in 
BAPPEDA Aceh.  The GoA and KPPN (Regional Treasury Office) will establish an effective 
means of confirming eligibility of sub-project bills for payment to contractors, other suppliers, 
and to cover pre-approved day-to-day operating expenses. The EDFF will disburse funds directly 
to the contractors or consultants providing goods or services for the implementation of sub-
projects; it will replenish the project accounts of SIEs. 
21. 
Each sub-project will be reviewed based upon its unique characteristics to determine the 
appropriate disbursement stream for it. When some sub-projects come on stream, contractors will 
be paid a percentage of the contract price (as stipulated in the contract) directly into their 
designated account on signing the contract.  The advance will be secured by a bank guarantee as 
stipulated in the contract. To process the balance of the payments, the contractor will submit 
invoices, along with supporting documents, to PMU according to payment provisions included in 
the contract. The invoices submitted will be verified by, and bear the signatures of, PMU and its 
Lead Consultant. Verification by PMU and consultant will require review and confirmation that 
the progress of the work defined in the sub-project is in accordance with the contract and the 
contractor’s invoice, and that all required supporting documentation is complete. The GoA PMU 
will not process invoices that do not have the Manager of PMU and PMU’s Lead Consultant’s 
signatures attesting to his/her verification of the invoice. When all documentation is complete, 
PMU will prepare SPP-LS, which will be signed and stamped by both PMU Manager and the 
Lead Consultant to PMU. The KPA will prepare SPM-LS by which KPPN will issue instruction 
24
 Environmental studies (AMDAL, UKL/UPL) will be carried out in such a way as to inform the completed 
detailed designs. Therefore environmental mitigation should be integrated, as necessary, into finalized technical 
drawings and in the bill of quantities (as appropriate). 
Page  87
78 
 
for payment (SP2D) to a designated account of third party implementing subprojects less any 
retention for guarantees or advances provided for in the contract and for any taxation obligations. 
Invoices verified by PMU will then be forwarded to the KPDT. After checking that all 
supporting documents are in order and that the claim has been correctly authorized by both PMU 
Manager and PMU’s Lead consultant, KPDT will forward the withdrawal application to the 
World Bank after being approved by the Director General, Treasury, who will proceed for 
payment according to the agreed contract terms (see Annex 8 for further details on disbursement 
mechanism). 
22. 
The focus of EDFF is on bringing back lost jobs and businesses and improving the 
business environment to facilitate a smoother process for the development of the private sector. 
A
number of proposed projects have been identified covering many different areas, agricultural, 
livestock and fisheries, SME development, export promotion and value added enhancements 
along with improving the business environment. Some of the prior economic development 
projects
25
 due to their proven results and ability to expand or continue to show positive results (in 
line with EDFF) may be potential candidates for funding under EDFF and thus they will be 
targeted.  A public solicitation for sub-projects will be made shortly after the EDFF is approved, 
focusing on the scaling up or continuation of projects that can show results as well as other 
proposals for innovative sub-projects that demonstrate clear objectives in line with the EDFF.  
Transparent selection criteria and selection will be applied to all project proponents. Should a 
second round of solicitation be necessary, it will be based on an on-going assessment of 
remaining gaps in the economic development strategy outlined in the RPJMD and BAPPENAS 
blueprint.  
25
 Those on-going projects identified as meeting all of the EDFF selection criteria and which can demonstrate 
proven results which require additional funding to scale up.

Attachment 1:  Project Management Unit Staffing and Assistance to KPDT 
 
1. 
The PMU will have core and support functions that will need to be covered through (a) 
GOI/GoA staff seconded full time to PMU and the Secretariat in KPDT, (b) staff of the 
consulting firm that will assist in the management of the EDFF and (c) support provided of the 
consulting firm for some of the support functions. The consulting firm will have two key 
interrelated roles. First, the firm will be responsible for the effective operation of the PMU and 
effective implementation of the EDFF at the central government level by the KPDT, and 
secondly, it will build capacity within the GoA to progressively assume the lead managerial role 
over PMU and in the KPDT to implement a similar approach in other provinces in the country. 
The firm will assist PMU in the evaluation of sub-project applications and monitoring. The firm 
will provide assistance to the PMU to draft subgrant agreements between the PMU and sub-
project implementing entities. The Consultant firm will also ensure that the operation of PMU 
with regards to financial management, procurement, communications are at an acceptable level 
to minimize risk and ensure good reporting. The PMU will prepare an 
Operations Manual
 
that
 
will guide project implementation and will list all project-related policies and procedures 
including details of the sub-project eligibility and monitoring criteria. The consulting firm will 
also assist the KPDT to fulfill their role in the monitoring and processing of expenses and 
withdrawal applications. 
 
Core Functions:
(a) Project 
Management 
(b)  Project Evaluation (includes technical expertise, safeguards specialists, financial 
management and procurement specialists, etc.) 
(c) Project 
Monitoring 
(d) Reporting 
 
Support Functions:
(a) Logistics 
(b) Human 
Resources 
(c) Legal 
Advice 
(d) IT 
(website) 
(e) 
Communications/ Public Relations 
(f) 
Financial Management of PMU 
(g) Administration 
 
2. 
The timing and staffing of PMU and the EDFF Secretariat in the KPDT will depend 
mostly on work load being frontloaded to the first two years, where sub-project selection and the 
start of implementation takes place (and most bottlenecks will have to be addressed) and the 
GoA, the KPDT and the firm should plan accordingly. Years 2-3 1/2 will be heavier on the 
monitoring and evaluation of sub-project implementation, with less staff required for M&E as 
the sub-projects are finalized toward the end of the EDFF and more are needed for reporting and 
auditing as the project comes to a close in year four. 
 
3. 
There might be need to retain staff for only part time work, as the work becomes less 
intense in the final years of the project. The firm could then assign different responsibilities to 
Page  89
80 
 
available staff (e.g. the same person could be working on procurement and financial 
management) and some of the government staff assigned to work in PMU could start working on 
different projects.   
 
4. 
The ToR for the consultant firm will specify that: 
(a) 
Some of the people working in the PMU (e.g. the Manager) will have to be long 
term employees of the firm and not consultants hired for this project only; 
(b) 
The contract will have a clause that commits the firm to providing at least 40 
weeks of technical expertise as needed and on a short term notice, based on the 
need to evaluate project proposals in the different calls for proposals; 
(c) 
The ToR will specify that the contract is subject to performance review, the ToR 
will also specify how the firm’s performance will be evaluated; 
(d) 
The ToR will specify the type of functions (and maybe one or two key staff) that 
PMU in BAPPEDA and the EDFF Secretariat in the KPDT will have to perform, 
but it will let firms doing proposals tell the GoA what their ideas of staffing and 
contribution would be, to allow also for more creativity and to make full use of 
experience that many firms may have on managing such units. 
5. 
The consulting firm will place consultants in the KPDT to assist the KPDT with the 
implementation of the project and build its capacity to implement similar projects in the future 
through ‘on-the-job’ training. The consulting firm will assist the KPDT in its role as the 
implementing agency at the central government level, including, but not limited to: (i) liaison 
with BAPPENAS, the executing agency, as well as other central government agencies to 
facilitate implementation of the project at the central level and solve any administrative problems 
and bottlenecks, (ii) making annual budget application to the Ministry of Finance, (iii) dealing 
with withdrawal applications by the entities implementing sub-projects, after they have been 
reviewed and approved by the PMU, (iv) monitor and evaluate project implementation. To this 
end, the KPDT will establish a small Secretariat to facilitate coordination of the EDFF at the 
central government level. 
6. 
The scope of work of the consulting firm can be summarized as follows: 
(a) 
Assist the GoA to establish the PMU and for preparing a transition strategy (along 
with a training plan) to build capacity of GoA staff at the PMU so the PMU can 
function effectively without the need for extensive outside assistance by the end 
of the consultancy; 
(b) 
In the first year of operation, assist the PMU in the evaluation of sub-project 
applications and in the preparation of recommendations to the Selection 
Committee – this means that a relatively large number of technical and sectoral 
experts will be needed to evaluate project applications and make 
recommendations;   
Page  90
81 
 
(c) 
Assist the PMU with the drafting of subgrant agreements between the PMU and 
entities selected to implement sub-projects 
(d) 
Assist GoA with a communications strategy of the project, including the 
production up of a project website that provides a platform for all required public 
announcements (e.g. regarding procurement, audits, etc.), the sharing of 
information related to project implementation, public relations and a general 
platform to interact with the public and other stakeholders. 
(e) 
Assist GoA/KPDT in the preparation of all reports necessary for the project and 
the oversight of the project and sub-projects. 
(f) 
In the subsequent years of operation, assist the PMU to monitor and evaluate the 
sub-projects on an on-going basis 
–
the type of expertise is likely to be different 
after the first year, with greater emphasis on the monitoring of projects, 
transactions as well as the achievement of results; 
(g) 
Ensure that the operation of the PMU with regards to financial management, 
procurement, reporting and communications are at an acceptable level and in 
accordance to World Bank guidelines to minimize risk and ensure good reporting. 
When entities implementing sub-projects do not have the capacity to follow 
World Bank procurement guidelines, as indicated by the assessments undertaken 
by the PMU, the PMU might in that case provide procurement services to sub-
projects implementing entities; 
(h) 
Provide limited assistance to the Secretariat being set up by the KPDT in the 
implementation of the project at the central level, in particular in solving any 
administrative issues that may arise, facilitating the communication between the 
implementation entities at the central and provincial level as well as assisting the 
KPDT in their role of monitoring project implementation; 
(i) 
Assist the KPDT to assess whether the EDFF project is a model to promote 
economic and private sector development that can be replicated in other provinces 
in Indonesia and assist in the design of the replication of the model as deemed 
appropriate by KPDT; 
(j) 
Design, coordinate and implement capacity building training programs to increase 
the capacity of BAPPEDA and GoA staff to implement similar projects in the 
future. Programs should start within 6 months of the Consultants mobilization; 
(k) 
Develop partnerships with NGOs and donors already involved in local 
government capacity building.

Attachment 2:  EDFF Sub-project Application Eligibility Criteria 
 
1. 
The EDFF sub-projects can be primarily grouped into three program areas: (a) Improving 
the Business Environment; (b) Private Sector Support; and (c) Public Infrastructure
26
.
Depending 
on the type of project, the application of the selection criteria may vary.  But there are some 
aspects of the selection criteria which apply to all and are “Pre-Selection” criteria
.
It is possible 
that applications for the use of the EDFF grant facility will be a combination of more than one of 
the three areas listed above. The Selection Criteria and Process have been designed to minimize 
subjectivity in sub-project selection. To better ensure strong projects consistent with both the 
economic development strategy of the GoA and the principles of EDFF the evaluation process 
has been divided into three phases: 
(a) 
Phase One
:
Pre-selection evaluation to ensure in the most basic of terms that the 
proposals are designed to meet the principles of economic and private sector 
development set by the GoA and the requirements of the facility and the basic goals 
of EDFF. Those meeting these standards will receive further consideration under 
Phase Two of the evaluation process.  Those that do not meet the standards will be 
rejected. 
(b) 
Phase Two
:
At this stage the proposal is assessed in more depth; focusing on the 
technical criteria, project design and application of lessons learned and economic 
justification and will be rated quantitatively. Those projects passing this phase of the 
evaluation with a minimum average score above 70
27
 percent will receive further 
consideration under Phase Three.  Those not meeting the minimum score will be 
rejected. 
(c) 
Phase Three
:
This phase focuses on assessing the proposed arrangements for 
implementation as well as the ability of the proponents to implement the sub-project. 
Only those projects passing this evaluation with a minimum average score above 70 
percent will be presented to the Selection Committee (although not necessarily 
recommended for funding).  
(d) 
Selection of Proposals
:
Only those proposals which have successfully advanced 
through the three phase process will be sent to the Selection Committee for 
consideration. 
(e) 
No Objection
:
The World Bank will review the PMU’s evaluation report on each of 
the proposals submitted to the Selection Committee as well as the Selection 
Committee’s report on the selection process of selected sub-projects to ensure 
compliance with the EDFF criteria and process, and issue No-Objection for each 
selection. 
26
 These are wholesale operations.  Any on-lending of funds to final beneficiaries should be through a financial 
intermediary. 
27
 Guidelines for scoring will be produced by the PMU for the Selection Committee. In principle, a rating above 70 
will only be awarded for projects that meet minimum requirements in that selection criterion. Scoring above 70 
should reflect to what extent the criterion is met and the quality of the proposal.

Component One (US$44.5 million).  Financing of Economic Development sub-
projects, this component will fund sub-projects that address critical issues affecting 
economic development in Aceh by contributing to building a more competitive and 
sustainable economy. The EDFF will seek proposals to fill-in strategic and financing 
gaps based upon the vision for economic development explicit in the RPJMD 
(Medium Term Development Plan of the GoA) and BAPPENAS blueprint. 
(b) 
Component Two (US$5.5 million). Targeted support for planning, design, 
selection of sub-projects, supervision and implementation oversight, this component 
addresses project management and aims to ensure strong project management 
through strengthening the ability of the GoA and KPDT, the project foresees the 
hiring of international and national expertise to work alongside the government 
officials in charge of the project. 
3. 
The purpose of the project’s financial management assessment is to determine whether 
the financial management system of the grant implementing agencies, the KPDT and BAPPEDA 
of NAD province, have capacity to produce timely, relevant and reliable financial information on 
the project activities, and if the accounting systems for the project expenditures and underlying 
internal controls are adequate to meet fiduciary objectives and allow the Bank to monitor 
compliance with agreed implementation procedures and appraise progress towards its objectives. 
 
4. 
Risks will arise from some factors: (i) the project might be influenced by the weak 
overall fiduciary environment in the country. In such an environment, a set of fiduciary policies 
and procedures are needed to ensure that proceeds of the grant are used only for the purposes 
intended, with due regard to economy and efficiency. It is also important to have a system to 
ensure that these policies and procedures were complied, (ii) sub-grants will be provided to 
entities which will not be identified until project implementation and sub-projects (activity that 
will be funded) will be identified later after proposals selection process (submitted by 
prospective organizations), (iii) PMU has no experience in managing the Bank’s project, and (iv) 
inadequate capacity of FM consultant.  
 
5. 
Some measures have been proposed to mitigate the risks arising from these factors. An 
independent financial audit will be carried at the end of fiscal year, together with a review of 
Page  100
91 
 
internal controls over project implementation. Regular internal audit will be conducted by KPDT 
to assure achievement of effectiveness and efficiency of operations and reliability of financial 
data and report. KPDT will include an internal audit activity of the grant in their annual work 
plan. Sufficient segregation of duties between technical and financial/administration aspects will 
be applied. To assist the PMU which has no prior experience in managing Bank projects, a 
consultant firm will be hired under the project including FM consultants. FM consultants will 
assist PMU in reporting and monitoring of project and sub-projects. FM consultants will also be 
responsible to conduct FM assessment to prospective sub grant recipients to ensure that they 
have adequate financial management system in place. To ensure that the FM consultants have 
adequate capacity and skills, their selection process will be subject to Bank’s prior review 
(included in the procurement plan).  
 
6. 
Taking into account the risk mitigation measures proposed, overall, the financial 
management risks for this financing are assessed as “High” before mitigation, and “Substantial” 
after mitigation. This assessment has concluded that with the implementation of the action plan, 
the proposed financial management arrangements will satisfy the Bank’s minimum requirements 
under OP/BP10.02 and are adequate to provide, with reasonable assurance, accurate and timely 
information on the status of the grant required by the Bank. More details of the financial 
management assessment are given below.

timely availability of budget funds 
may arise due to possible delays in 
APBN issuance and Satuan Kerja/ 
Satker (Working Unit) appointments. 
The Bank has experienced in other

Project Financial Management & Disbursement Arrangement  
 
8. 
Based on the project design features and the risk analysis summarized above, the 
following arrangements are proposed for financial management and disbursements;  these 
include measures to mitigate risks identified above: 
 
Institutional and staffing arrangements
9. 
The KPDT will take role as implementing agency at the central government level. It will 
be responsible for budget execution, including preparing an annual budget application to the 
MOF, preparing a budget execution report to MoF and setting up a project Satker located in 
Bappeda Aceh that will be responsible for overall management of the annual budget and 
submission of withdrawal application after being reviewed and approved by the PMU. The 
budget for this project will be classified into three categories, (i) payment to the consulting firm 
assisting BAPPEDA Aceh and KPDT, (ii) operating costs of KPDT and BAPPEDA Aceh, (iii) 
block grants for subprojects at the provincial level. The block grants cannot be further specified 
in the DIPA, in terms of sectoral or district allocation, since the selection of sub-projects and 
what exactly will be financed will only be known after the project has started and the call for 
proposals and evaluation of proposals has taken place. The budget will be delegated to the 
provincial government in Aceh as Dana Tugas Pembantuan (supporting fund). KPDT will be 
responsible for setting up a project Sakter, to be located in Bappeda Aceh, and GoA will appoint 
the same people in the Project Management Unit (PMU). KPDT will provide staff and establish a 
Secretariat to assist the project implementation at central level.  
 
10. 
The implementation of the project will rest heavily with the Government of Aceh 
(GoA)/BAPPEDA, which is to be supported by an international consultant management firm and 
the establishment of a PMU. The GoA will manage the PMU and will be integral in the selection 
process of sub-projects through participation in the selection committee. The BRR, with its 
experience in similar projects, will, until it is phased out, support the Government of Aceh 
through its advice both on the selection of sub-projects and implementation of the project itself. 
The progress of the sub-projects will be monitored primarily by the GoA through the PMU. 
 
11. 
During the assessment, project management (Satker) at BAPPEDA has not been 
assigned. However, the head of finance in BAPPEDA has two years experience as part of Satker 
in BRR before residing in his position now. BAPPEDA has applied new finance law; hence 
segregation of duty between the payment verification function, procurement and project 
management will be in place. BAPPEDA will assign staff on a full time basis to the PMU. Satker 
at BAPPEDA will be appointed by GoA, but the decree will be signed by Minister of KPDT. 
 
12. 
A project management consultant firm will be hired by the GoA under the project to 
oversee and work with the PMU (BAPPEDA) and the Secretariat (KPDT). The project 
management firm will locate a number of consultants (part time and full time) in Aceh to assist 
the PMU and a small number of consultants will assist Secretariat at KPDT. The project manager 
will be located in Aceh and a deputy project manager will be located in or readily available to 
KPDT.  
 
Page  105
96 
 
13. 
The firm and the PMU will be responsible for the review of sub-projects applications, 
making recommendations to the Selection Committee, monitoring and evaluating the sub-
projects on an on-going basis, financial management and procurement, and facilitate 
communications among the different government levels. Three financial management specialists 
(FMS) will be available to the PMU in Aceh, two FMS hired by the PMU Consultant firm and 
one provided full time by BAPPEDA.  They as well as the PMU will be responsible for (among 
other items) conducting FM assessments of the selected subproject proponents and for reviewing 
cost estimates submitted by the selected entities.  An FMS hired by the PMU Consultant firm 
will also be placed full time with KPDT who will be primarily responsible for IFR/FMR 
preparation and submission of withdrawal application. 
 
14. 
A Selection Committee will be established to make the final selection of sub-projects. 
The committee will be comprised of a representative of the Office of the Governor of Aceh, the 
Head of BAPPEDA Aceh, a representative of KPDT and a representative of the academic 
community in Aceh. This Committee will review sub-project applications which have already 
successfully passed a preliminary screening performed by the outside consultant team and a 
review by the PMU. 
 
15. 
The sub-projects will be implemented by different entities (such as NGOs (domestic and 
international), private sector organizations and international aid organizations) who will be 
responsible for ensuring that the sub-projects remain consistent with project goals. They will 
prepare the sub-project proposals and be responsible for tracking performance if their individual 
sub-projects consistent with the agreed upon milestones and performance indicators. 
 
16. 
From US$44.5 million budgeted for sub-projects (component 1), it is expected there will 
be 7 to 8 high valued sub-projects (US$1-7 million each). The rest of the allocation will be 
divided to not more than three sub-projects with much lower allocation (not less than 
US$500,000 each). Since implementing entities for these sub-projects have not yet been 
identified, there will be FM assessment of the candidate recipients. The candidate should meet 
minimum FM requirement. The PMU FM consultant will be responsible to conduct the FM 
Assessment.  
 
17. 
Pre-selection criteria for sub-projects will include minimum FM requirements that need 
to be fulfilled by the applicants.  The minimum FM requirements for the entities are as follows: 
 
(a) 
Legal basis to operate in Indonesia (supported by notary deed) and to receive 
Grant funds 
(b) 
The last two years of audit report with preferably Unqualified opinion; however, 
Qualified opinion with non-significant findings will also be considered 
(c) 
The entity has developed and implemented a Standard Operation Procedures, 
included FM manual 
18. 
The Bank will provide approval to the selected entities. The Bank approval included FM 
clearance on the FM assessment result done by the PMU FM consultants. 
 
Page  106
97 
 
Accounting and Reporting 
 
19. 
The accounting policies and procedures of this project will substantially follow 
government financial management procedures, with strengthened procedures where appropriate. 
These government procedures include, for instance, government budgeting procedures, 
accounting standards (PP no. 24, 2005) and government accounting systems (PerMenKeu no. 
59/PMK.o6/2005), which have all been issued following the enactment of the Finance and 
Treasury Laws. All project activities and expenditures will be included in the respective KPA 
(Budget Holder) budget and administrative and accountability procedures for approving 
expenditures and disbursing funds to beneficiaries will follow government procedures.  
 
20. 
To have better project information, grant expenditures and activities will be separately 
reported to the Bank under project financial report on a quarterly basis through Interim Financial 
Reports (IFRs). This would include information on procurement progress, physical progress of 
budgeted activities and financial source and use of funds. A reconciliation of the special account 
transactions with the financial statements will also be prepared. Formats for these would be 
agreed at appraisal and confirmed during negotiation. Quarterly project financial report should 
be received at the Bank no later than 45 days after each quarter end. The quarterly reports will be 
collated annually for annual financial audit purposes. Secretariat at KPDT will be responsible to 
ensure that IFR will be submitted to the Bank on timely basis. Details of these procedures will be 
included in the Operations Manual.  
 
21. 
All financial transaction should be recorded properly supported with adequate evidence 
that the recipient is as intended according to the Grant objectives and the record should publicly 
available to ensure transparency. 
 
Internal control 
 
22. 
For sub-projects, payment verification will rely on the sub-
grantees’ financial 
management system. At this point, the Bank could not assess adequacy of internal control of sub-
grantee, since they have not been selected yet. Therefore, there will be a requirement of FM 
assessment that will be performed by FM Consultant to assess financial management system of 
the proposed sub-project implementing entities. 
 
23. 
Payment verification at PMU level will rely on the government system. Segregation of 
duties between technical and financial aspects will be applied to ensure adequate internal control. 
The Operations Manual will document the financial management systems and procedures to be 
followed to ensure that the project has sound financial management practices. The Manual will 
include: organization structure, job descriptions, budgeting, procurement, record management for 
finance unit, asset management, flow of funds, payment verification, accounting (including use 
of government chart of account for the project), reporting (IFR format, IFR preparation and time 
line), annual audit arrangements, supervision plans, monitoring and evaluation mechanisms for 
project implementation, and inspectorate review of project implementation (internal audit). 
 
Page  107
98 
 
24. 
KPDT has agreed to include the project in their routine annual audit program and they 
will include sub projects to their sample. To this end they will collaborate with Aceh Inspectorate 
They will prepare a separate report for the project to be submitted to the Governor, PMU and the 
Bank. The report will consist of findings, recommendations and status of follow up actions. In 
addition, they will also have special team to respond any complaints received in regards to the 
project. 
 
Disbursement Arrangements  
 
25. 
The disbursement method will be “Advance”.  In order to facilitate the disbursement, a 
Designated (Special) Account (DA) denominated in US dollars will be opened by Director 
General Treasury in the Central Bank (BI) or a commercial bank acceptable to the Bank under 
the name of the Ministry of Finance. The Director General Treasury will authorize its relevant 
Treasury Offices (KPPNs) located in Banda Aceh and Jakarta to authorize payments of eligible 
project expenditures by issuance of SP2D (remittance orders) charging the DA.  For this purpose, 
Director General Treasury shall issue a circular letter to the relevant KPPN Offices providing 
guidelines and criteria for eligible project expenditures in accordance with the Grant Agreement. 
 
26. 
The ceiling of the advance provided to the DA is US$5 million.  Applications for 
reporting of the use of DA funds will be supported by: (i) list of payments together with records 
evidencing such expenditures, against contracts for goods, consultants that are subject to the 
Bank’s prior-review; or (ii) statement of expenditures (SOEs) for all other expenses. In addition, 
a
DA reconciliation statement is required for applications for reporting of use of the DA funds. 
Reporting of use of DA funds and application for an advance to DA may be submitted in a single 
application on monthly basis. 
 
27. 
The DA will be solely used to finance eligible project expenditures.  Although 
management of the DA will be under the responsibility of Director General Treasury MOF, 
KPDT Secretariat will be responsible for reconciling the DA and preparing applications for 
withdrawal of advances and reporting the use of the DA, duly approved by Director General 
Treasury before their submissions to the Bank. 
 
28. 
The PMU in Banda Aceh will be responsible for authorizing payments for the sub-
projects and consultant services in which the DIPA budget is entrusted to them.  
 
29. 
All documentation for expenditures submitted for disbursement will be retained at the 
implementing unit and shall be made available to the auditors for the annual audit and to the 
Bank and its representatives if requested.

30. 
For selected sub-projects proposals, Sub-Grant Agreements will be signed between the 
project Satker and the implementing entities. The document will include budget and procurement 
plan. After signing the Sub-Grant Agreement/Contract, implementing entities will receive an 
advance which adequate to cover three months expenditure plan. The implementing entity will 
report the use of advance on quarterly basis supported by financial and technical reports. 
Financial and technical reports from these implementing entities will be verified by PMU, before 
processing the next payments. Sub-Grant Agreements will clearly define output and documents 
to be submitted to the PMU for verification purposes. Further detail of flow of fund mechanism 
will be described in the Sub-grant operational manual.  
 
Remedies 
 
31. 
If ineligible expenditures are found to have been made from the grant, or if expenditures 
are made from the Grant and Sub-Grant without adequate supporting documentation to validate 
these, the Recipient will be obligated to refund the same amount to the Bank.  
 
32. 
The Bank will have the right to suspend disbursement of the funds if significant terms of 
the Grant agreements, including reporting requirements, are not complied with. This will be 
reflected in the Grant agreement. 
 
Audit Arrangement 
 
33. 
The project financial statements prepared by the project executing agency will be based 
on the compiled project Interim Un-audited Financial Reports (IFR). The annual IFR will be 
subject to a financial audit by an auditor acceptable to the Bank. The Terms of Reference (TOR) 
for the project audit will be agreed by the Bank. A copy of the project audited financial 
statements, along with the management letters issued by the auditors, if any, will be submitted to 
the World Bank no later than 6 months after the end of each fiscal year. The audit will cover a 
sample of sub-projects. 
 
34. 
Sub-projects above US$1 million will also be audited separately by BPKP, and the audit 
reports will be submitted to the Bank no later than 6 months after the end of each fiscal year. 
 
Supervision Plan 
 
35. 
Supervision of project financial management will be performed on a risk-based approach 
at least twice a year. The supervision will review the project’s financial management system, 
28
 Incremental operating costs include additional costs that government agencies will incur as a result of 
implementing the project, e.g. monitoring and supervision trips, secretariat expenses, transport costs, dissemination, 
etc. It includes travel and office costs, but excludes government salaries and honoraria.  
Page  109
100 
 
including but not limited to accounting, reporting and internal control. Supervision will also 
cover sub project on random sample basis. As part of supervision, the Bank will also review all 
FM assessment done by the project’s FM consultant to prospective sub grantees. The financial 
management supervision will be conducted by financial management specialist and Bank 
consultants.

ANNEX 9:  PROCUREMENT ARRANGEMENTS 
A.  General 
 
1. 
Procurement for the proposed project would be carried out in accordance with the World 
Bank’s "Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004 as 
amended in October 2006 and "Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World 
Bank Borrowers" dated May 2004 as amended in October 2006, and the provisions stipulated in 
the Legal Agreement. The various items under different expenditure categories are described in 
general below. For each contract to be financed by the Grant, the different procurement methods 
or consultant selection methods, the need for pre-qualification, estimated costs, prior review 
requirements, and time frame are agreed between the Recipient and the Bank in the Procurement 
Plans. The Procurement Plan of the project management consultant will be prepared by the 
PMU. The procurement plan of each sub-project will be proposed by each sub-project 
implementation entity and will be reviewed by PMU and afterwards subject to approval by the 
Bank task team. 
2. 
Procurement of Works: 
Works procured under this project would be identified in selection 
of sub-projects. International Competitive Bidding (ICB) will be used for all works packages 
estimated to be equivalent to or cost more than US$5 million each. National Competitive 
Bidding (NCB) will be used for all works packages estimated to cost less than US$5 million 
each. Shopping will be used for all works packages estimated to cost less than US$50,000 each.  
The procurement will be done using the Bank’s Standard Bidding Documents (SBD) for all ICB, 
and Model Bidding Documents (MBD) agreed with or satisfactory to the Bank for all NCB. For 
procurement of smaller works through shopping, the PMU should prepare a model quotation 
document which should be agreed with the World Bank team before implementing related 
procurement.  
3. 
Procurement of Goods:
 Goods procured under this project would be identified in the 
selection of sub-projects. International Competitive Bidding (ICB) will be used for all goods 
packages estimated to be equivalent to or cost more than US$200,000 each. National 
Competitive Bidding (NCB) will be used for all goods packages estimated to cost less than 
US$200,000 each. Shopping will be used for all goods packages estimated to cost less than 
US$50,000 each.  The procurement will be done using the Bank’s Standard Bidding Documents 
(SBD) for all ICB, and Model Bidding Documents agreed with or satisfactory to the Bank for all 
NCB. For procurement of goods through shopping, PMU should prepare a model quotation 
document which should be agreed with the World Bank team before implementing related 
procurement.  
4. 
Selection of Consultants:
 At project appraisal, it was identified that a consulting service 
contract of project management will be procured using Quality and Cost-based Selection 
(QCBS) with the contract estimate of US$5 million. Besides, consulting firms will also be 
employed for external auditing and impact evaluation study; and an individual consultant (a 
professor) will be employed as a member of the selection committee of sub-projects. More 
consulting services may be identified in selection of sub-projects. In addition to QCBS, Quality-
based Selection; Least Cost Selection; Selection Based on Consultants’ Qualifications; Single-
source Selection; Selection of Individual Consultants; and Sole Source Procedures for the 
Page  111
102 
 
Selection of Individual Consultants may be used. Short lists of consultants for services estimated 
to cost less than US$400,000 or equivalent per contract may be composed entirely of national 
consultants in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2.7 of the Consultant Guidelines. 
5. 
The procurement procedures and SBD/MBD to be used for each procurement method, as 
well as model contracts for works and goods procured, will be specified in the Operations 
Manual  prepared by the PMU which be finalized before procurement at sub-project level starts.  
B.  Assessment of A
gency’s Capacity to Implement Procurement 
 
6. 
Procurement activities will be carried out by sub-project implementation entities or, in case 
the implementation entities do not have the necessary capacities, by the PMU of BAPPEDA with 
assistance from 
PMU’s the project management consultant. 
 
7. 
An assessment of the BAPPEDA to implement procurement actions for the project was 
conducted by the Bank project team on May 13-14, 2008. The assessment reviewed the 
organizational structure for implementing the project, experience, expected working procedures 
and other related aspects of BAPPEDA.   
8. 
The key issues and risks concerning procurement for implementation of the project have 
been identified and include:  
(b) Corruptive and collusive environment and practices 
(c) Weak capacity of the Project Management Unit 
(d) Uncertainties of sub-projects  
9. 
The corrective measures which have been agreed are (i) at least one staff with primary 
responsibility for procurement of EDFF project either part-time or full-time in the PMU, (ii) 
appointment of an Individual Procurement Advisor to assist BAPPEDA in the selection of the 
Project Management Consultant (firm), (iii) appointment of a Project Management Consultant to 
assist in the implementation of the Project, including capacity building and training of 
BAPPEDA for procurement; procurement support will be one of the assignment and the 
consultant should also provide necessary assistance to sub-projects when necessary; (iv) 
adoption of a Project Operations Manual, and (v) review of Procurement Plan and Capacity 
Assessment for each Sub-Project 
10. 
In the implementation process, PMU will be responsible for monitoring overall 
progress of project procurement and all procurement documents will be submitted to the Bank 
through PMU when requested by the World Bank. 
11. 
The overall project risk for procurement is 
high
.
C.  Procurement Plan 
 
12. 
BAPPEDA will develop a procurement plan for selection of the project management 
consultant by the time of project negotiations.  The Sub-project applications will contain basic 
information on expected procurement for the application screening process.  A procurement plan 
Page  112
103 
 
will be included in the approved final sub-project documents.  Following PMU review of the 
sub-project document, the Bank team will review and clear the sub-project proposal including 
approving the procurement plan.  This review and approval will be required prior to procurement 
activity commencing. 
D.  Frequency of Procurement Supervision 
 
13. 
In addition to the prior review to be carried out by the World Bank, the capacity 
assessment of the implementing agency resulted in a recommendation that one supervision 
mission every 12 months (including special procurement supervision for post review/audits) be 
conducted.  
E.  Details of the Procurement Arrangements Involving International Competition 
 
1.  Goods, Works, and Non-Consulting Services 
 
14. 
At the project appraisal, no sub-projects have been identified. A detailed procurement 
plan will be included in the sub-project appraisal document of each sub-project which will be 
reviewed by the PMU and the Bank team. It is expected that the following contracts will be 
subject to prior review by the Bank team: 
·
Goods contracts: equivalent to or above US$200,000; 
·
Civil works contracts: equivalent to or above US$1 million; and 
·
The first two NCB contracts and first two shopping contracts shall be subject to prior 
review, regardless the value. 
2.  Consulting Services
 
At appraisal, it was identified that a project management consultant (firm) will be selected 
following QCBS procedure and with participation of international firms. The estimated 
cost is about US$5 million. Besides, consulting firms will also be employed for external 
auditing and impact evaluation study; and an individual consultant (a professor) will be 
employed as a member of the selection committee of sub-projects. More consulting 
services may be identified in selection of sub-projects. 
Consultancy services estimated to cost above US$200,000 per contract, the first contract using 
selection method other than QCBS, regardless the value and single source selection of 
consultants (firms/individual) will be subject to prior review by the Bank. 
Short lists composed entirely of national consultants: Short lists of consultants for services 
estimated to cost less than US$400,000 or equivalent per contract may be composed 
entirely of national consultants in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2.7 of the 
Consultant Guidelines.

BACKGROUND 
2. 
The World Bank Office in Jakarta carried out a Procurement Capacity Assessment (PCA) 
of BAPPEDA of Aceh Province for the EDFF.  The PCA took place in May 2008 and was 
conducted in accordance with the instructions from OPCPR.  The objective of the PCA is to 
assess the capabilities of the project implementation units to do procurement and the adequacy of 
the procurement systems in place, to assess the potential risks in project’s procurement, to 
develop an action plan to enhance procurement capacities and minimize procurement risks, and 
to propose a suitable procurement supervision plan.  
 
3. 
The assessment refers to the Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) for 
Indonesia
which was issued in February 2001.  In this respect, the CPAR already includes 
general assessment of adequacy of the procurement systems, the procurement environment, the 
risks and suggested actions to mitigate these risks. These risks apply to all implementing entities 
operating within this environment, including the project implementation units under this project. 
 
PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
 
4. 
The EDFF is a US$50 million umbrella project that will finance a set of sub-programs 
and sub-projects to support post-tsunami economic recovery and equitable and sustainable long-
term economic development in Aceh Province. It will support a Comprehensive approach that 
focuses on improving the investment climate and removing barriers to private sector 
Page  114
105 
 
development, in addition to improving existing initiatives addressing supply side constrains that 
is necessary to ensure the sustainability of the economic recovery.  It will support the 
Government of Aceh Province (GoA)’s efforts to bring about a viable and sustainable economy; 
an economy which universally supports business development and job creation.     
 
5. 
Component One (approximately US$44.5 million) – The first component will fund sub-
projects that address critical issues affecting economic development in Aceh Province by 
contributing to building a more competitive and sustainable economy. The project will promote 
broad based private sector job opportunities and growth in Aceh Province, targeting the poor and 
other vulnerable groups.  
 
6. 
The focus of component one is to promote the development objectives described in the 
paragraph above and will comply with priorities as outlined in the Medium-term Development 
Plan of the Government of Aceh Province (RPJMD) and BAPPENAS blueprint for Aceh’s 
recovery. The EDFF will seek sub-projects where implementing entities are contributing toward 
three different areas: 
 
(a) 
Improving the business environment 
(ii) 
Reform of regulations and procedures related to investment, business 
formation, land use, etc., to improve the business environment; 
(iii) 
Promotion of Aceh Province to domestic and foreign investors; 
(iv) 
Building capacity of government to promote private sector development. 
(b) 
Private Sector Support 
(i) 
Improvement to access to finance to small and medium enterprises – 
beyond the current focus on micro-finance by many donors; 
(ii) 
Developing capacities and competitiveness of local entrepreneurs – 
stimulating innovation, providing world class training, facilitating access to 
business development services; 
(iii) 
Assistance to local entrepreneurs, especially in productive and export 
sectors, to gain better access to markets (focus on packaging, branding and 
marketing, improve access to information); 
(iv) 
Scalable, market-oriented programs that improve productivity and quality 
in agriculture and fisheries. 
(c) Public 
Infrastructure 
(i) 
Strategic, complementary economic infrastructure projects, to be provided 
by the government (alone or in partnership with the private sector) that enable 
access to market for Aceh producers and enterprises. 
 
7. 
The PMU will select sub-projects for this component by assessing proposals from 
international organizations and NGOs, etc. 
8. 
Component Two (US$5.5 million) - This component addresses project management and 
incremental operating costs and aims to ensure strong project management through strengthening 
Page  115
106 
 
the ability of the GoA and KPDT-- the project foresees the hiring of international and national 
experts to work alongside the government officials in charge of the project.  A firm will be 
contracted to assist with the setting up and operation of PMU, this will include sub-project 
assessment and review, procurement, safeguards compliance, implementation, supervision, and 
monitoring. The presence of the firm also will help to build capacity within the GoA to manage 
similar work in the future. Besides, consulting firms will also be employed for an impact 
evaluation study; and an individual consultant (a professor) will be employed as a member of the 
selection committee of sub-projects. 
 
Figure 7: BAPPEDA Organization Structure and Procuring Units 
 
9. 
The institutional structure of BAPPEDA of Aceh Province can be found in Figure 7 
above. The head of BAPPEDA is chairing the project preparation and will be responsible for the 
implementation of the project. The BAPPEDA has experience with selecting consultants for the 
emergent reconstruction of Aceh after the disasters of Tsunami and earthquake in 2004. But that 
procurement followed the government rules and procedures. BAPPEDA has no experience in 
implementing projects financed by the World Bank. 
 
10. 
The BAPPEDA will set up a Project Management Unit which will coordinate project 
implementation at the provincial level. The PMU will comprise of full time staff in adequate 
number, which include a designated team of procurement specialists. As described above, a 
component of the project is to employ a consulting firm for project management. The consultants 
will work together with PMU for selecting and managing implementation of sub-projects. In 
selecting sub-projects, The PMU and project management consultant will assess procurement

11. 
Procurement activities in this project will consist of selection of a consulting firm for 
project management, and procurement of goods, works, services and consulting services for sub-
projects. 
PROCUREMENT OF GOODS AND WORKS 
 
12. 
Procurement plan will be included in the sub-project appraisal document for each sub-
project. After PMU review, the Bank team will review and clear the sub-project proposal 
including approving the procurement plan. Goods and works to be procured under the sub-
project should be properly grouped into contracts in the procurement plan
.

13. 
A consulting firm will be employed for project management. The cost is estimated as 
US$5 million. Besides, consulting firms will also be employed for external auditing and impact 
evaluation study; and an individual consultant (a professor) will be employed as a member of the 
selection committee of sub-projects. Further consulting services may be identified in sub-project 
selection process and included in the procurement plans of sub-projects. 
 
LEGAL ASPECTS  
 
14. 
The last Country Procurement Assessment Report, issued in February 2001
,
has 
identified inconsistencies between the previous Government’s public procurement regulation, 
Keppres 18/2000 and the Bank Procurement Guidelines, particularly on the National 
Competitive Bidding (NCB) process. Among these inconsistencies are: restrictive bidding, 
inadequate advertising, no post qualification, bracketing and automatic re-bidding if the number 
of responsive bidders is less than three or contract price is above the budget allocation.  
 
15. 
The Government of Indonesia issued Public Procurement Regulations in the form of 
Presidential Decree no. 80 year 2003, or Keppres 80/2003
,
to replace the Keppres 18/2000. 
Subsequently, the Government has made up to four revisions to Keppres 80/2003
.
The most 
recent one is the Presidential Regulation no. 8 year 2006, or Perpres 8/2006.  Keppres 80/2003 
includes modifications and improvements below: 
(a) 
Requirements to encourage professional bidders. 
(b) 
Requirements for procurement certification for staffs assigned to project 
procurement. 
(c) 
Procurement procedures which provides a closer link to international practices 
on procurement planning, standard bidding documents, post-qualification, etc. 
(d) 
Revision to the existing procedures for self managed activities using SOE. 
(e) 
Disclosure and transparency mechanism for contract awards and evaluation. 
(f) 
Mechanism of sanctions and Complaint handling. 
(g) 
Definition of conflict of interest. 
Page  117
108 
 
(h) 
Handling of fraud, corruption, and collusive practices. 
(i) 
Description and foundation for the national procurement policy formulating 
body called Lembaga Pengembangan Kebijakan Pengadaan Pemerintah 
(LKPP) 
(j) 
Provisions on e-procurement. 
 
Further elaboration on the above is provided in the attachment to this Annex. 
 
16. 
The PCA recommends that the clarifications on NCB as the result of the 2001 CPAR be 
included as part of the Procurement Section of the Grant Agreement to provide clarifications and 
legal basis needed for conducting NCB that is acceptable to the Bank.  Keppres 80/2003 includes 
improvements that eliminate differences with Bank’s Procurement Guidelines.  To take into 
account these improvements, the NCB clarifications attached to this report include some 
modifications to refer to Keppres 80/2003. 
 
17. 
Similar to its predecessor, Keppres 80/2003 clearly provides that the Donor procurement 
procedures shall apply in Donor funded projects in case of conflicts with the government 
procedures. The Operations Manual should clearly state that Bank rules shall apply in the case of 
conflicts with local rules and regulations. 
 
18. 
Keppres 80/2003 treats selection of consultants with the same philosophy as for 
procurement of Goods or Works. For example, Keppres uses the term prequalification and treat 
consultant’s proposals to be similar as bids. 
 
19. 
This assessment anticipates the risk of confusion between shopping method in Bank’s 
Guidelines and “Direct Selection” or “Pemilihan Langsung” procedure as defined in the
 
Keppres 
80/2003. Attached is a comparison and clarification of two methods. The clarification should be 
a
part of Manual. 
 
20. 
Keppres 80/2003 has introduced a provision in which only staff members who holds a 
procurement certificate can be a member of the procurement Committee. The certification 
program is developed by the State Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS).  The 
assessment found that the program has a low rate of passing. Currently, BAPPEDA has three 
procurement certified staff (L2 certificate), and some staff are taking trainings on procurement 
and will be certified in the near future. The procurement committee of this project may include 
members of certified procurement staff from outside BAPPEDA. 
 
21. 
The following misunderstanding are quite common with respect to applicability of 
Bank’s Guidelines vis-à-vis Keppres 80/2003: 
 
(a) 
The implementing unit interprets that the applicability of NCB in the 
Financing Agreement extends to shopping and selection of consultants. 
Sometimes Keppres 80/2003 is applied in shopping procedure and 
procurement of consulting services. 
Page  118
109 
 
(b) 
As mentioned in paragraph 21 above, shopping method is sometimes confused 
with direct contracting method.  One of the major differences between the two 
methods is the fact that negotiation is allowed under direct contracting. 
PROCUREMENT CYCLE MANAGEMENT 
 
22. 
It was clarified to and agreed with BAPPEDA that the procurement of the proposed 
project should follow the procedures of the World Bank Procurement/Consulting Guidelines. 
P
ROCUREMENT 
P
LANNING
 
23. 
The PMU will prepare a procurement plan for selecting the project management 
consultant.  
24. 
A summary procurement plan of sub-projects will be included in each sub-project 
proposal.  These will be reviewed by the PMU prior to selection and by the World Bank team 
prior to issuing NOL to the selection.  Approved sub-projects must include a detailed 
procurement plan in their sub-project appraisal document which will be reviewed by the PMU 
and its project management consultants. The appraisal document will be sent to the Bank team 
for review and NOL.  As a part of this review process, the Bank team will review and approve 
the detailed procurement plan. 
25. 
There is a tendency in the Government to treat a Procurement Plan similar to and as rigid 
as a budgeting plan with restricted possibility for revisions. Once approved, the use of the 
procurement plan emphasizes on the requirement to fulfill administrative conditions.  Under the 
Government’s regulations, the Procurement Plan cannot provide flexibilities in case the bid price 
is above the allocated budget. The PMU was reminded of this and will take measures to ensure 
consistency between the latest contract estimate and allocated budget. 
P
REPARATION OF 
P
ROCUREMENT 
D
OCUMENTS
 
26. 
During the assessment, it was agreed with BAPPEDA that the World Bank Standard 
Bidding Documents and Request for Proposals will be used for all ICB procurement or selection 
of consultants with participation of international firms. The GOI does not have an official NCB 
Documents for Goods and Works.  For NCB contracts, the PMU and project management 
consultants should develop model bidding documents based on the World Bank SBD which 
should be agreed with the Bank team before procurement starts. 
 
27. 
The NCB bidding document for Goods and Works should include a provision that 
requires suppliers and contractors to permit the Bank to inspect their accounts and records 
relating to the performance of the contract and to have them audited by auditors appointed by the 
Bank. 
 
Page  119
110 
 
MANAGEMENT OF BIDDING PROCESS
,
BID EVALUATION
,
CONTRACT AWARD AND CONTRACT 
ADMINISTRATION
 
28. 
The Law No.1/2004 defines that the main responsibility of a contract, from its 
procurement to its execution, rests with the Budget Holder (Kuasa Pengguna Anggaran 
–
KPA).  
The Budget Holder may delegate its authority to Officers in charge to make commitments 
(Pejabat Pembuat KOMitmen – PPK). In this project, the Ministry of Poor and Disadvantaged 
Areas (KPDT) will be the budget holder (PA) and BAPPEDA or sub-projects will be authorized 
as the implementation entities. All the procurement of this project will be conducted by either 
PMU or sub-project implementation entities with support from PMU. BAPPENAS will not 
conduct procurement directly. 
 
29. 
The PMU or the sub-project implementation entities will initiate a procurement process 
by setting up a procurement committee and going through the required procurement steps up to 
contract award. Procurement committee members may come from within or outside the 
implementation entities.   
 
30. 
The assessment identifies that the implementation entity of a sub-project may not have 
the required capacity to conduct procurement. In this case, the PMU will provide necessary 
support and assistance for conducting procurement by the sub-project implementation entity. In 
other cases, the PMU will review all the procurement documents and monitor procurement 
process. 
 
SUPPORT AND CONTROL 
 
31. 
Within the GoA, the Inspectorate General (IG), see (Figure 7) carries out internal audit of 
BAPPEDA.  The IG establishes regular internal control mechanisms which also oversees the 
implementation of project’s procurement. Inspectorate General Aceh will work together with 
KPDT to conduct internal audits of the project. 
 
32. 
Externally, the audit is carried out by the Financial and Development Supervisory Board 
(Badan Pengawasan Keuangan dan Pembangunan – BPKP, Government’s Audit).  BPKP has 
extensive experience in both financial and procurement audit of the World Bank funded projects. 
 
33. 
The Bank Team requires that a specific Anti Corruption Action Plan (ACAP) is defined 
and included in the PAD.  In the ACAP, BAPPEDA should include in the Operations Manual 
steps to report and investigate all cases of collusion, fraudulent, corrupt and coercive practices, 
and take remedial actions. This should also include automatic referrals to BPKP and KPK (the 
national Corruption Eradication Commission) to conduct investigative audits in the case of 
strong indication of fraud, corruption, collusion and coercive practices in the procurement 
processes. 
 
RECORD-KEEPING 
 
34. 
It was agreed that both BAPPEDA and sub-project implementation entities should 
maintain written records of procurement. Such records should include advertisement for bidding, 
bidding documents and addenda/clarifications if any, minutes of bid opening, bids submitted by 
Page  120
111 
 
bidders, bid evaluation report, contract, implementation records, etc., which should be subject to 
auditing or ex-post review. All the above documents should be kept for at least one year after 
closing of the project. 
 
STAFFING
 
35. 
At least one staff of BAPPEDA will be working on procurement as procurement 
specialist in the PMU, with support from other technical experts. The project management 
consultants will also include at least one procurement expert. These procurement specialists will 
be responsible for quality control of all the sub-projects. In each of the sub-project 
implementation entities, at least one procurement specialist should be designated, who should 
have adequate qualifications and experience. 
GENERAL PROCUREMENT ENVIRONMENT 
36. 
The general procurement environment is weak as detailed in the CPAR.  There are cases 
of collusive practices and corruptions in previous Bank financed projects. The culture among the 
government officials is changing to be more open and transparent. However, since this is a 
cultural change, it will take time.  
 
37. 
Culture of accountability
.
There is increased awareness of this issue but effective 
accountability is still lacking and violations by staff are rarely investigated. 
 
38. 
Salary structure
.
Private sector offers much higher salaries.  However, most public 
officials do not leave to work in the private sector. Keppres 80/2003 provides that some special 
allowances should be budgeted for Project Managers and Procurement Committees.  It is unclear 
whether the rate for these allowances will be sufficient to provide the required incentives. 
 
39. 
Political or other interference
.
It is possible in a decentralized environment to have 
pressure on project officials to favor local firms and individuals even though these are expressly 
forbidden by Keppres 80/2003. The project officials may also face pressure from political 
groups, professional associations, local media and non governmental organizations that may 
negatively influence procurement. 
 
40. 
Ethics
.
The Keppres 80/2003 notably introduces ‘Integrity Pact’ which aims to ensure 
high ethics of officials involved in procurement.  However, favoritism and accepting attitude 
towards kickback are still common.  The prevailing environment poses strong challenges for 
officials to maintain integrity. 
 
41. 
System.
 
The current standards and procedures are quite extensive and detailed.  The 
main challenge is consistent implementation of these regulations. 
 
GENERAL RISK ASSESSMENT 
 
42. 
As explained above, the assessment of procurement risk of this project recommends a 
‘High’
.
Such rating is due to the following aspects: 
 
Page  121
112 
 
(d) 
General findings including corruption and collusion environment in public 
procurement in Indonesia. This has been a nationwide issue, which involves both 
the government officials and bidders/consultants. The general procurement 
environment is weak; 
(e) 
Weak capacity of BAPPEDA and its PMU. BAPPEDA does not have experience 
with World Bank financed project. Without outside assistance, it would be 
difficult for PMU to implement or coordinate the procurement of this project; and 
(f) 
Uncertainties of sub-projects. Before the project appraisal, no sub-project had been 
selected. It is difficult to predict the capacities of the sub-project implementation 
entities.  
ACTION PLAN 
43. 
The following action plan is proposed to mitigate the high risk assessment.

CLARIFICATION OF SHOPPING PROCEDURES
 
Issue Bank 
Guidelines 
(National Shopping) 
Keppres 80/2003 
“Pemilihan Langsung” 
(Direct Selection) 
1. 
Applicability 
Simple and rapid procurement 
normally for off the shelf items and 
small work contracts 
Does not specify the types of goods or 
works, as long as the contract amount is less 
than Rp. 50 million (US$5,000 equivalent) 
2. Advertisement 
Not required 
Not required 
3. Principles 
Comparing at least three quotations 
from reputable suppliers
Comparing prices from three invited
firms. If 
any of the invited firms does not submit 
quotations, and it turns out that there are less 
than three suppliers interested, then re-
invitation shall be sought. If after second 
trial, the procurement team fails to Come up 
with at least three firms, than the use of
Direct Contract is allowed
.
4. Registration 
(erroneously called pre 
qualification) 
Not required 
Required
as part of the shopping process 
prior to evaluation of quotations. It is 
required that all national firms have the 
certificate of pre qualification from the 
respective local government stating in which 
kind of business areas that the firms are 
eligible to do business 
5. Firms to be invited 
Reputable, well established, and are 
suppliers of the goods or services 
being purchased as part of their 
normal business 
No specific requirements
for the firms to be 
invited, as long as the certificate of pre 
qualification of the invited firms is in the 
supply of the goods or services being 
purchased. It is normal that firms are 
certified for various lines of business but in 
reality do not actually engage in such kind of 
business. Also there is a requirement to give 
priority to invite firms within the respective 
districts where the procurement process takes 
place before seeking firms from outside 
those districts. 
6. Form of requests 
By means of a simple Request of 
Quotation including the description 
and quantity of the goods, as well as 
the required delivery time and place 
for the goods or services, including 
any installation requirements, as 
appropriate. The request indicates 
the date by which the quotations are 
needed. 
By means of a standard bidding documents
which are normally used for national 
competitive bidding process 
7. Bid and/or performance 
securities 
Not required 
Required
8. 
Prices 
and 
currencies 
Prices for goods supplied from 
within the country (including 
previously imported items) are 
requested to be quoted EXW (ex 
works, ex factory, ex warehouse ex 
show room or off-the-shelf, as 
applicable), including all custom 
duties and sale and other taxes 
No specific requirement on prices and 
currencies. As normal practice, since 
shopping is intended for small contracts 
(below US$5,000 equivalent) then off the 
shelf prices in local currency are used.

already paid or payable on the raw 
materials and components. For 
goods offered from abroad (i.e., not 
previously imported), prices are 
requested CIF or CIP. Prices can be 
quoted in any currency of the Bank-
member countries. 
9. Time for submission of 
quotations 
There is no requirement for strict 
time and date for submission of 
quotations, but normally requests 
for quotes indicate the expected date 
of submission of quotes, within one 
or two weeks of the initial request. 
In other cases, if the purchaser has 
not received at least three quotations 
within the time set, it verifies with 
the missing suppliers whether they 
intend to do so and how soon. 
Unless there is extreme urgency or 
there are already three or more 
quotations available, the client may 
give a reasonable amount of 
additional time, say three more 
days, to get additional quotations. 
At this point the client may proceed 
with the comparison of the 
proposals received. 
Deadline for submission of quotations shall 
be specified in the “bidding documents”, and 
if a firm does not submit the quotations by 
the specified date, then its quotations shall be 
rejected
.
No verification process is allowed 
to late quotations.

ANNEX 10:  ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS 
 
1. 
The EDFF is a multisector framework type project and the activities will be selected and 
be subject to analysis only after effectiveness of the Grant. This makes it very difficult to assess 
the economic benefits of this project through a standard cost-benefit analysis. Therefore, at this 
stage the analysis focuses on the soundness of the approach undertaken, to support the strategies 
of the provincial authorities to promote sustainable economic growth in the province and to 
improve the capacity of BAPPEDA and other relevant entities to select, implement and monitor 
sub-projects that support economic development in Aceh. The expected benefits of the project, 
through an improvement of the business environment and the attraction of both domestic and 
foreign investment, the increase in income of beneficiaries (through increased farmers’ or 
fishermen income or the creation of jobs in manufacturing and services), and through capacity 
building of BAPPEDA the expected improvement of public sector spending, are likely to 
outweigh the costs of the project. 
2. 
As elaborated in Annex 1, the economy in Aceh pre-Tsunami was driven by the oil and 
gas fields in the East Coast, now in decline and with very little linkages to the rest of the 
economy. The reconstruction of the province after the Tsunami, with a large influx of funds and 
the implementation of vast reconstruction activities, has resulted in relatively high growth in the 
construction sector and other sectors closely related to the construction sector (trade, utilities, 
banking). As the bulk of the reconstruction effort comes to an end, and bearing in mind a 
relatively large number of unemployed people and the social unrest that may cause, the 
reconstruction agency, the national and provincial authorities and many donors have recognized 
the need to focus on putting Aceh’s economy on a more sustained and longer-term growth path 
with an effort to create more jobs at the center of this new focus. 
3. 
The provincial authorities, led by BAPPEDA, and with the assistance of several donors, 
have invested significant resources in identifying ways to support economic growth in the 
province and address existing constraints to growth (see Attachments 1 and 2 of Annex 1): 
improving the security condition in the province, investing in human capital, a focus on sectors 
where Aceh has a comparative advantage, such as agriculture, fisheries and agro-industry, 
investments in infrastructure and the need to open the province to trade and investment. This 
project seeks to support the GoA’s own strategies to support economic growth. The GoA is 
likely to have the best information as to what are the key constraints for growth in the province 
and what sectors have the greatest potential. Technical assistance will be provided through this 
project to leverage that information and select a number of sub-projects to be financed by the 
EDFF to provide the greatest benefits in terms of sustainable economic growth and the creation 
of jobs. Supporting the GoA’s own initiatives and priorities also increases the likelihood of the 
ownership and endorsement of financed activities by the local authorities and through that their 
sustainability. The project will also finance a consulting firm to support the government 
implementing entities in managing this project. A key responsibility of this consulting firm will 
be to assist BAPPEDA in the evaluation of sub-projects, guided by selection criteria spelled out 
in this project document and that will be further elaborated in the Operations Manual, to ensure 
that individual activities being financed have the highest pay off. Annex 4 provides an 
illustration of the expected results of activities financed through this project and how they will 
have an impact on sustainable economic growth and job creation.

4. 
As mentioned in the first paragraph, it is fairly difficult if not impossible to do the 
standard cost-benefit analysis on this type of project, before the individual subprojects and 
activities that will be financed are known. However, for illustrative purposes the following table 
shows the impact that this project would need to have on economic growth to achieve the 
minimum Economic Rate of Return (ERR) that the World Bank requires in its investment 
projects, which is 10-12%

5. 
The table above assumes that economic growth would grow from 3.24% pre-tsunami to 
3.27% for the duration of the project (or an increase in the growth rate of 0.03 percentage points) 
and an increase in growth to 3.25% (or an increase of 0.01 percentage points) after the project is 
finished until 2020. This increase in growth would fulfill the requirement of an ERR of 11%. It is 
debatable whether this increase in GDP as a result of this project is realistic, bearing in mind the 
project only represents 2% of agricultural GDP or 25% of yearly public spending on agriculture 
by the provincial and district governments. If the project assists in maintaining agricultural 
growth at its current level of 5%, partly the result of the reconstruction effort, that would increase 
total GDP growth to 3.6%, well above the required increase in growth for this project to be 
economically viable. Current growth in agriculture is partly the result of the end of conflict, but 
also the result of a few successful reconstruction projects in the area of livelihoods. With that in 
mind, it seems realistic to assume that the project will assist in maintaining agricultural growth at 
current levels and through that total growth above the pre-tsunami average. The above, given the 
limitations in the ability to do a cost-benefit-analysis, presents a fairly conservative estimate of 
the impact that this project could have, not taken into account the impact it could have on 
increased investment, the improved allocation of resources to support economic growth by 
BAPPEDA Aceh or the longer-term impact that improvements in the uptake of technological 
innovations in agriculture or fisheries could have. 
 
29
 This approach also has some limitations. Given the short duration of the project (3 1/2 years) it is not clear what 
the impact on GDP growth will be or whether this will be observable. In addition, there are issues with 
macroeconomic data at the regional level to undertake this type of analysis. The estimation assumes growth in the 
non oil- and gas sector to be the same as it was pre-tsunami, from 2001-04. It also assumes a discount factor of 11%.

ANNEX 11:  SAFEGUARDS POLICY ISSUES
 
A. Introduction 
 
1. 
The objective of the EDFF project is to assist the GoA and the GOI
 to “Build Back 
Better” the province of Aceh through facilitating bringing back business, business networking, 
the creation of private sector job opportunities and fostering sustainable long-term economic 
development. The identification of EDFF sub-projects will be significantly based upon their 
ability to rehabilitate productive assets of agricultural workers, upgrade skills of laborers, 
promote non-farm employment in rural areas and support micro and small enterprises and as 
necessary address the need for supportive government policies. In addition, the EDFF will look 
to proposals which support key rural infrastructure for increasing productivity, improving access 
to markets by farmers and by selectively targeting and improving specific extension services 
provided by the government to farmers and fishermen to increase productivity and improve 
quality. This may include key economic infrastructure projects to enable communities to sustain 
themselves, such as fishing facilities or processing facilities. Special attention will be paid to 
increasing the poor and women’s participation in the economy through skills enhancement and 
targeted job creation programs. 
 
B. Objectives of the Safeguard Framework 
 
2. 
The social and environmental management framework provides general policies and 
guidelines to serve the following objectives: 
 
(a) 
Protect human health; 
(b) 
Prevent environmental degradation as a result of either individual investments or 
their cumulative effects; 
(c) 
Enhance positive environmental outcomes; 
(d) 
Avoid conflict among Community members and strengthen Community social 
cohesiveness. 
3. 
It will be the responsibility of PMU team and consultants to support the GoA in 
developing detailed social and environmental management procedures for this framework, to be 
integrated into the Operations Manual. Although not triggered, given the uncertainty of the sub-
projects there could be a remote possibility that some could be potentially triggered such as OP 
4.04 on Natural Habitats and OP. 4.09 on Pest Management. 
 
4. 
All sub-projects that will be financed by the EDFF project have to be in compliance with 
GOI environmental rules and regulations, as well as with environmental policies of the World 
Bank. The Bank requires environmental screening and environmental assessment reports (if 
necessary) of sub-projects to help ensure that the sub-projects are environmentally sound and 
sustainable, and thus improve decision making. The environmental assessment runs in parallel 
with the process of designing a sub-project and implementing it, and the type and its detail 
depend on nature, scale and any potential environmental risks. It is the responsibility of the 
Page  129
120 
 
lending institutions and the project implementation unit to ensure that these policies are not 
violated. 
 
C.  Potential Positive and Adverse Environmental and Social Impacts from the Project  
 
5. 
Potential positive and adverse environmental and social impacts envisaged from the 
project are mainly found in the first component.  The first component will fund sub-projects that 
address critical issues affecting economic development in Aceh by contributing to building a 
more competitive and sustainable economy. The EDFF project will promote broad based private 
sector job opportunities and growth in Aceh, targeting the poor and other vulnerable groups. 
 
6. 
Environmental Issues
.
The sub-projects may entail financing of activities which could 
involve environmental issues associated with agriculture, fisheries and other economic 
development and job creation sub-projects. 
 
7. 
The following potential environmental issues may occur during project implementation: 
 
(g) 
Risk of loss of precious ecological values when a sub-projects is located within and 
close to a natural ecosystem such as mangroves, wetland areas, etc;  
(h) 
Soil pollution/health risks due to excessive application of fertilizers and pesticides; 
(i) 
Fishery activities- Risk of overexploitation of fish stocks and long-term 
degradation of resource base, capture of non-target species and habitat damage 
through use of destructive fishing methods and gears; 
(j) 
Downstream water pollution from discharge of pond effluents with drain water, 
potential restriction of water circulation; and 
(k) 
Pollution of nearby aquatic environments by pond drainage water and inadequate 
farm management. 
8. 
Consequently, the consultant teams that will be engaged under the project will need to 
have a good understanding of related environmental and social impacts and how such impacts 
can mitigated via appropriate planning, design, and implementation measures. 
 
Social Issues.
 
The sub-projects may entail financing of activities which could involve social 
issues associated with agriculture, fisheries and other economic development and job creation 
projects. In general, the sub-projects that will be designed and implemented are likely to be of 
small and medium scale. As a result, the level of associated social risks is likely to be limited.  
However, it is important for planning processes, including prioritization of economic 
development needs, to reflect community needs and specifically those of vulnerable groups (such 
as women and the poorest in the society).  
 
Page  130
121 
 
D.  Mitigation Measures 
 
9. 
There are several mitigation measure mechanisms to be taken in terms of mitigating 
impacts of activities proposed by the projects, mainly through (i) a thorough screening using 
Bank and GOI guidelines, and (ii) monitoring efforts. 
 
(a) Screening.
 
The GOI
’s environmental review procedures, which include specific procedures 
for Aceh, are broadly consistent with those of the World Bank, and will form the framework for 
the project’s approach to environmental screening and mitigation. The EDFF is considered to be 
equivalent to World Bank “Category B” recognizing that the safeguard policies triggered is OP 
4.01 on Environmental Assessment,

10. 
In compliance with both Bank’s policies and GOI’s requirements, sub-projects being 
prepared, designed and implemented under EDFF will be subject to eligibility criteria at sub-
project identification stage and further screening during sub-project preparation, which will be 
spelled out in the tender documents and contracts for executing those sub-projects. The following 
is the GOI’s screening mechanism: 
 
(a) Full environmental assessment (AMDAL); or 
(b) Environmental management and monitoring plan (UKL/UPL) required for less 
environmentally significant sub-projects;  
 
11. 
Selected screening criteria for sub-projects that will require full environmental 
assessment or AMDAL, will be drawn from Minister of Environment (MENLH) Decree No. 308 
of 2005. and will be found in the OM. The requirement for an AMDAL may also be triggered if 
a
sub-project is likely to impact on sensitive sites either by being located in close proximity to a 
sensitive site, or if the nature of the sub-projects activity could directly impact on a sensitive site. 
Key sites or areas that will be considered ‘sensitive’ under this framework include: 
 
30
 It is not expected that indigenous or isolated persons will be impacted by any of the sub-projects.  Should such 
persons be discovered in the sub-project areas, then measures to comply with OP 4.10 will be taken by the PMU. 
Page  131
122 
 
Natural Habitats (OP 4.04 
 
12. 
Sub-projects cannot be funded if they involve the significant conversion or degradation of 
natural habitats unless there are no feasible alternatives and the overall benefits from the sub-
projects substantially outweigh the environmental costs. If a sub-projects would significantly 
convert or degrade a natural habitat, the sub-projects needs to incorporate acceptable mitigation 
measures such as minimizing habitat loss and establishing and maintaining an ecologically 
similar area.  These are natural habitats that: 
 
(a) 
are protected by government (e.g. parks, World Heritage Sites) or by tradition; or 
(b) 
have known high suitability for biodiversity conservation; or  
(c) 
are critical for rare, vulnerable, migratory, or endangered species. 
 
Pest Management (OP. 4.09) 
 
13. 
A number of types of sub-projects that may be proposed under the EDFF (e.g. small-scale 
irrigation, tick dips, and livestock market) may results in the introduction or expansion of pest 
management activities in certain areas or villages.  However, it is not anticipated that the Project 
in general will result in the promotion of widespread pesticide use. Sub-projects involving the 
procurement of pesticides or pesticides application equipment, or increased pesticide use, will 
not be funded until experience demonstrates that the local capacity exists adequately manage 
their environmental and social impacts. The ESMF requires the preparation of a Pest 
Management Plan if a sub-project is likely to raise pest management issues as described. 
 
Additional Screening Criteria (Negative List) 
 
(l) 
Ozone-depleting substances. No sub-project using or producing these materials will 
be financed.  
(m)  Pesticides. The project will not finance the procurement or application of 
pesticides. 
(n) Asbestos
.
No asbestos-containing materials will be financed.   
(o) 
Hazardous materials and wastes. No sub-project will be financed that uses, 
produces, stores or transports hazardous materials (toxic, corrosive or explosive) 
or material that classified as "B3" (hazardous wastes) in Indonesian law. 
(p) 
Development in protected areas
.
No sub-project will be financed that would be 
located in a protected area or might change the purpose and/or designation of a 
protected area.  Protected areas are identified in The Decree or the Minister of the 
State for the Environment of the Republic of Indonesia Number KEP-
11/MENLH/2006, entitled C
oncerning the Types of Businesses Activities 
Required Completing an Environmental Impact Assessment.
 
The list includes 
notably: forest protection area; marine/freshwater conservation areas; nature 
tourism park; areas surrounding lakes and reservoirs; coastal mangrove areas; 
Page  132
123 
 
national parks; coastal edges; forest parks; cultural reserves; areas surrounding 
springs; scientific research areas; and nature conservation areas. 
14. 
Monitoring Efforts. 
The third mitigation measure tool is developing and implementing 
monitoring efforts both on environment and social issues. These monitoring efforts will be 
included in the Operations Manual. The results of this monitoring effort will be integrated into 
the overall project M&E reporting. The project will also conduct a social and environmental 
review and assessment after one year of field implementation.  
 
E.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement 
 
15. 
No land acquisition will be financed by the EDFF project.  Further, land acquired for use 
in implementing or necessary to a sub-project must have been acquired through a voluntary land 
acquisition process.  Required land for the sub-projects would be obtained through any one of the 
following options and must be well documented for acceptance by the Bank: 
 
16. 
Direct Purchase.
Where possible the required land will be acquired by the sub-projects 
promoter
 through direct purchase based on ‘willing buyer willing seller’ principle, as the first 
option. Negotiations for direct purchase would be carried-out in a public place and in transparent 
manner. All proceedings will be documented and final agreement would be signed by the 
negotiating parties in the presence of NGOs or civil society and countersigned by the village 
head. The negotiated amount will be paid within three months from the date of final agreement 
of the negotiated settlement by the negotiating parties.   
 
17. 
Voluntary Donation.
The required land for the sub-projects can also be obtained through 
‘voluntary donations’ by the land owners. Voluntary donation of land for a sub-project would be 
an acceptable option where: 
 
(a) 
The land is identified by the beneficiary communities and confirmed by technical 
staff to be suitable for the sub-project and free from any environmental or health 
risks;  
(b) 
the impacts on the land owners are marginal and do not result in displacement of 
households or cause loss of household’s incomes and livelihood; 
(c) 
the households making voluntary donations are direct beneficiary of the sub-
project; 
(d) 
land thus donated is free from any dispute on ownership or any other 
encumbrances;  
(e) 
consultations with the affected households is conducted in a free and transparent 
manner; 
(f) 
land transactions are supported by transfer of titles; and  
Page  133
124 
 
(g) 
proceedings of consultation meetings, grievances and actions taken to address 
such grievances are properly documented. 
18. 
A protocol for direct purchase and voluntary donation of land for sub-projects would be 
included in the Operations Manual. Sub-projects sponsors will be required to submit appropriate 
documents together with the sub-projects proposals to show the process to be used for obtaining 
the required land. Any sub-project without any of the above two options for land acquisition will 
not be accepted.. 
 
F. 
Indigenous Peoples’ Planning Framework. 
It is not expected that indigenous or 
isolated ethnic minority communities will be impacted by any of the EDFF sub-projects. 
 
19. 
Although the people of Aceh are a broadly homogeneous group, some communities in the 
highland areas, particularly in districts Bener Meriah, Aceh Tenggah, Gayo Lues and Aceh 
Tenggara, may retain certain characteristics of indigenous people as defined by the Bank’s OP 
4.10.  These communities are reported to have their own language distinct from the mainstream 
Acehnese/Indonesian language and some of them may also have their customary cultural or 
social informal institutions. Although almost all of these community groups are fully integrated 
with the mainstream population in Aceh province, some isolated groups may still retain 
collective attachment to their ancestral territories. It is not expected that indigenous or isolated 
persons will be impacted by any of the sub-projects. Should such people be discovered in the 
sub-project areas through subproject screening, then this would require that measures be 
undertaken by the sub-project implementing entities to fully comply with OP 4.10 regulations.      
 
20. 
Given the nature of proposed interventions and the potential list of subproject proposals, 
Indigenous people are not expected to be affected or present in the subproject areas

Screening Process.
 
Environmental and social screening of ‘approved’ sub-projects will 
be carried out at this point in order to determine if an Indigenous Peoples Plan, AMDAL or 
UKL/UPL is required.  Screening will be based on completion in advance by local governments 
of a standard screening format for each sub-project, to be developed by PMU team based on 
KepMen 308/2005.  
 
22. 
Based on this information, the PMU team will screen each sub-projects to be funded by 
the EDFF involving: (i) comparison of sub-projects information against Annex 1 of Decree 
308/2005, (ii) assessment of likelihood of impact on sensitive sites, (iii) comparison against 
World Bank criteria for OP 4.04, OP 4.09 and OP 4.10. Further information will be requested of 
the respective local government, as necessary, in order to complete screening.  A representative 
from the relevant local environmental authority will be invited participate in the screening 
process. Screening results will be formally communicated to the respective local governments, to 
the relevant local environmental authority and to WBOJ safeguards staff. 
 
23. 
Review and Approval of Studies.
 
The procedures for preparation and completion of 
AMDALs and UKL/UPLs are set out under Ministerial Decree 308/2005.  For AMDALs, a 
Province or local government ‘Tim Teknis’ prepares and approves the AMDAL TORs, 
consultants carry out the studies and final review and approval is carried out by a Province Level 
AMDAL Commission.  
 
24. 
A basic format for completion of UKL/UPLs is provided in Annex 2 to Decree 308/2005 
(See Attachment 1).  Completed UKL/UPL forms are submitted to the local environmental 
authority for review and approval. Completed environmental and social studies will be reviewed 
by safeguards specialists within PMU team prior to submission to the GoA for secondary review 
and comments. The GoA team will provide consolidated comments to the consultant for 
revisions to be made as necessary.  
 
25. 
Environmental
 studies will be submitted for formal approval to the relevant local 
environmental authority i.e. the Provincial or District Bapedalda. All AMDAL and a sample of 
UKL/UPL for each sub sectors will be submitted to the WBOJ for review and approval.  All 
documents related to acquisition of land, consultations with potentially affected indigenous 
communities and social assessment report, where required, will be submitted to the WBOJ for 
review and approval. 
 
H.  Consultation and Disclosure 
 
26. 
The GoA will disclose the environmental and social management frameworks in Aceh 
Province. The Bank will ensure that the framework is published in Infoshop and the Bank 
Indonesia Public Information Center. The framework will be available also on the E-Aceh 
Page  135
126 
 
website (
http://www.e-aceh.org
).  All Social Assessment and Indigenous Peoples Plan and full 
environmental assessments (AMDAL), where required, and a samples of UKL/UPL will be 
made available in Indonesian language on the e-aceh website, with English language versions of 
Executive Summary published in Infoshop. A sample of UKL UPL for each subsector will be 
translated into English for Bank review. Environmental management plan (UKL UPL) 
documents should be disclosed in-country in accordance with bank disclosure policy. 
 
I.  Reporting 
 
27. 
The implementing entity will aggregate and review environmental reports and flag them 
in their bi-annual reports.  The Operations Manual will include a matrix of likely environmental 
impacts and steps with which to address them. An experienced environmental consultant will be 
hired to summarize progress, monitor and measure the impact of the project on the environment 
as part of the performance evaluation of the project. The Implementing Entity will prepare bi-
annual environmental summary reports to be submitted in English to the World Bank.  This 
report would include: 
 
(q) 
A summary of significant mitigation measures, if any, undertake during the 
previous six months; 
(r) 
A description of any significant problems or successes in environmental mitigation 
during the period; and  
(s) 
Anticipated notable environmental or social events anticipated during the Coming 
six months. 
V.  Environmental Management and Monitoring Program (UKL 
–
UPL Program) 
 
28. 
Substances of the UKL and UPL are the program Management and Monitoring which 
will be done during the duration of the project. For that purpose this parts should explain cleanly 
and completely for all impacts, in accordance test list in the chapter III as follows: 
 
(t) 
Steps which will conduct to prevent and manage the impact, including the effort to 
mitigate the emergency / disaster. 
(u) 
Monitoring activities which will be done to know the affectivity of the 
environmental impact and compliance to the Regulation of Environment. 
(v) 
Standard used to measure the effectiveness of the environmental and the 
compliance to the regulation of environment. 
VI.  Sign and Seal 
 
29. 
After all of the forms about UKL and UPL have been filled completely, the institution(s) 
responsible for the activities should sign and seal the documents.

ANNEX 12: ANTI-CORRUPTION ACTION PLAN 
 
1. 
The EDFF project is designed to assist the Government of Aceh and the Government of 
Indonesia to “Build Back Better” the province of Aceh. The project will seek proposals from 
local and international groups with programs promoting economic development and 
sustainability of Aceh. At the central level, the implementing entity for the project is the GOI’s 
Ministry for Disadvantaged Areas (KPDT), and the provincial level, the implementing agency is 
the BAPPEDA (of GoA). An international consulting firm will be recruited to support the 
implementing entities in managing the project. 
Lessons learned from project 
2. 
Other competitive grant projects such as the Managing Higher Education for Relevance 
and Efficiency (MHERE), and Better Education through Reformed Management and Universal 
Teacher Upgrading (BERMUTU) indicate that there are risks associated with varying capacity of 
individual implementing units and their dispersed locations. The projects find that there are 
issues with capacity, lack of transparency, and delays. 
3. 
Lessons learned from other projects demonstrate that intensive Communications and 
more frequent supervision both from the Bank and PMU; and greater disclosure at local level 
will help address the fore mentioned issues. As additional measure to prevent corruption, some 
of the Japan Social Development Funds (JSDF) projects also require proposals to include 
specific measures to prevent corruption.  
Risks Identified 
 
4. 
Risks associated with procurement of management consulting firm 
A
consulting firm will be contracted to assist with the setting up and operation of PMU. 
There are risks associated with procurement of the consulting firm: lack of prior 
experience and understanding of Bank Guidelines may result in delays and poor selection 
of consultants. Selection of consultants performed in other projects indicates that there is 
also a risk that high level officials may intervene in the deliberations of the procurement 
Committee, as they expect returns from firms awarded the contract.  
 
5. 
Risks associated with selection of proposals 
It is envisaged that there will be 7-8 sub-projects with grant value of US$1-7 million, and 
a
few smaller sub-projects. The sub-project proposals will be selected based on broad 
range of criteria, allowing greater discretion to be exercised in the proposal evaluation. 
Without clear communication of the proposal evaluation process, there is also the risk 
that the process is regarded as unfair. 
 
Page  137
128 
 
6. 
Risks associated with implementation of sub-projects 
Implementation of sub-projects may be subject to corruption. The large number of 
transactions at sub project level and the dispersed location may also stretch PMU’s 
oversight role. There may be capacity issues with some of the sub-project implementation 
entities hence the project is exposed to the risks of delays and collusive practices in 
procurement; fictitious expenditures, poor reporting and the risk that intended objectives 
of the project are not attained. 
 
Objectives of Anti-Corruption Action Plan  
 
7. 
The Anti-Corruption Action Plan (ACAP) of the EDFF project is developed to identify 
risks associated with the project and to propose mitigation measures. The plan will be elaborated 
in the Operational Manual, and status of implementation will be reviewed in supervisions and 
reported in Aide Memoirs, any changes made to the Plan will be subject to the Bank approval. 
8. 
The Plan is designed in recognition that the GoA has taken stronger stance on corruption. 
The GoA has imposed greater scrutiny through its internal auditor, Inspektorat Daerah, and 
establishes working relations with external audit and law enforcement agencies. A Memorandum 
of Understanding (MoU) with the Anti Corruption Commission (KPK) is signed and high profile 
cases have been referred to the Commission for further investigation, reaffirming the 
government’s commitment to combat corruption.  
9. 
In recognition of the high risk involved in the EDFF project, the ACAP has the following 
primary features: 
(w) 
Corruption Prevention Plans at Sub-Project Level 
Proposals will have to include Corruption Prevention Plans – the framework to identify 
risks and sub-projects’ internal mechanism to prevent corrupt practices. The Corruption 
Prevention Plans will be an important consideration in the evaluation process. 
 
(x) Intensive 
Supervision 
With the large number of sub-projects, dispersed location, varying nature and size of sub-
projects, more intensive supervision will be required both from PMU and the Bank to 
anticipate, prevent and address issues. 
 
(y) 
Clearly Defined Measures in the Manual 
The Operations Manual should provide, in details, steps and measures in relation to 
procurement, financial management, disclosure of information (and engagement with 
local media), complaints handling, and sanctions.  
 
Page  138
129 
 
(z) 
Engagement of Stakeholders 
In order to promote transparency in the project, the project will engage stakeholders 
through the participation of a non-government member in the sub-project selection panel 
and to the extent possible for project monitoring and evaluation. 
 
10. 
For the purpose of the EDFF project, an Anti-Corruption Action Plan is developed based 
on the following Components: 
1.  Enhanced Disclosure of Information 
2.  Mitigation of Collusion 
3.  Mitigation of Forgery and Fraud 
4.  External Oversight  
5. Complaints Handling 
6.  Sanctions and Remedies 
 
1. Enhanced Disclosure of Information
(aa) 
Risks of corrupt practices may be prevented by making important information 
easily accessible to the public. In order to promote greater transparency in the project, a 
separate link to the project will be provided at the government website, 
www.nad.go.id
which displays salient information relevant to the project
,
as well as the project’s own 
website.  
(bb) 
Communication of information pertaining selection of sub-projects is also critical 
in ensuring the fairness of the selection. The project should disseminate information, 
through its website, local media and other means: the call for sub-project proposals; 
objectives and criteria for the selection; evaluation method and announcement (names, 
contacts, and value) of selected proposals. Information related to subproject selected 
should be disseminated as soon as agreement is signed between PMU and SIEs.   
(cc) 
To avoid misinformation circulating about the project, the PMU will ensure that 
groups interested in individual sub-projects are able to obtain data concerning progress 
during the procurement and implementation phases through various methods (refer to 
Annex 13 for a Communications Strategy). The PMU will also establish a good 
relationship with the press (particularly local press), explaining results expected by the 
EDFF, and ensuring a fair representation of the progress. Open public meetings will also 
be held at least twice a year to provide updates on progress.  
(dd) 
Information accessibility and transparency will also be made a part of the 
monitoring and evaluation exercise. The PMU will ensure that lessons learned from the 
implementation of sub-projects are widely shared and specifically with those who have 
indicated an interest. 
The World Bank Disclosure Policy 
Page  139
130 
 
(ee) In 
com
pliance with the World Bank’s disclosure policy, the PMU shall make 
publicly accessible on the project website the following documentation: 
(i) 
After finalization, all annual procurement plans and schedules, including 
all updates thereof. 
(ii) 
Contract award information for all contracts for goods above US$500,000 
equivalent and all contracts for consultants above US$400,000 equivalent, 
promptly after such award. 
(iii) 
Promptly after the completion of a mid term review of the project, the mid 
term review report and the aide memoire prepared for this purpose. 
(iv) 
Promptly after receipt all final audit reports, and all formal responses of 
the government. 
(ff) 
Upon request, the implementing agency will: 
(i) 
Make available to any member of the public, private sector firm or any 
registered civil society organization  all bidding documents and requests for 
proposals issued in accordance with the procurement provisions of this 
agreement, subject to payment of a reasonable fee to cover the cost of printing 
and delivery. In the case of requests for proposals, the relevant documents will 
only be made available after notification of award to the successful firm. Each 
document will continue to be available until a year after completion of the 
contract entered into for the goods, or services in question; 
(ii) 
Make available to any member of the public upon request, promptly and at 
no cost, any short lists of consultants and, in cases of pre-qualification, lists of 
pre-qualified contractors and suppliers; 
(iii) 
Promptly disclose to all bidders and parties submitting proposals for 
specific contracts (by email or fax) notification of award to the successful 
bidder/consultant, the summary of the evaluation of all bids and proposals for 
such proposed contracts. Information in these summaries will be limited to a list 
of bidders/consultants, all bid prices and financial proposals as read out at public 
openings for bids and financial proposals, bids and proposals declared non- 
responsive (together with reasons for such declarations), the name of winning 
bidder/consultant and the contract price. Summaries will also be made available to 
the public, promptly upon request and at no cost. 
(iv) 
Make available, promptly upon request by any person or company (via 
email or fax) a list of all contracts awarded in the three months preceding the date 
of such request in respect of a project, including the name of the 
contractor/consultant, the contract amount, the number of bidders/makers of 
proposals, the procurement method followed and the purpose of the contract. 
Page  140
131 
 
(v) 
PMU shall keep electronic records of all information requests received and 
documentation provided in response to such requests and shall provide this 
information to the World Bank upon request.  
2. Mitigation of Collusion 
(a) 
Procurement risk in the EDFF project is high due to the degree of uncertainty at sub-
project level. It is agreed that in the sub-project selection process, the capacities of sub-
project implementation entities will be assessed. Potential sub-projects will also have to 
include their own Corruption Prevention Plan in their proposals. In cases when sub-
project implementing entities do not have the required procurement capacity or when 
procurement involves large and highly complex packages, procurement function will be 
centralized at the PMU.  
(b) 
Operations Manual will include guidelines for each stage of the procurement process. 
The Manual will include provisions on greater disclosure at the local level, for instance 
the use of local media and public notice boards to announce procurement related events. 
(c) 
At the project level, there is also a concern on the lack of capacity and experience in 
dealing with Bank funded projects. A procurement consultant will be recruited to provide 
assistance in the selection of consulting firm to support PMU. The consultant will be able 
to provide guidance to PMU in order to com
ply with the Bank’s Guidelines and minimize 
delays in the process.  
(d) 
Once selected, the consulting firm will assign a procurement consultant to provide 
assistance to PMU in the selection of proposals and build capacity of the government.  
(e) 
PMU will make sure that information on selection of sub-projects is clearly 
communicated at every stage of the process. In order to improve transparency at the sub 
project selection process, the selection panel will include a reputed member of the 
academic community in Aceh. The selection of this fourth member, acceptable to the 
World Bank, is part of project readiness conditions. Written evaluations of the sub-
project proposals have to be submitted in the three tiered approval process, and will be 
subject to the Bank’s No Objection. 
(f) 
PMU will ensure proper documentation of the procurement process.  
3. Mitigation of Forgery and Fraud
(a) 
Forgery and fraud will be minimized by adherence to fiduciary management practices. 
Financial management capacity and measures in the proposals’ Corruption Prevention 
Plan will be assessed for the selection of sub-projects. The Operations Manual will 
outline measures such as payment validation procedures, documentation, reporting and 
disclosure mechanism, and internal and external audits. The PMU will be supported by a 
consultant with financial management expertise, to address capacity issues within the 
government, and to provide support in supervising sub-projects’ financial management. 
Regular supervision will be performed to address issues which may arise. 
Page  141
132 
 
(b) 
Financial management reports of PMU and sub-projects will be subject to internal audits 
by the 
Inspektorat Daerah
.
The agency has agreed to include EDFF project as part of its 
regular audit, and a separate report will be provided for the purpose. Regular supervision 
will be performed by PMU and/or the Bank to address issues which may arise. 
(c) 
State Development and Financial Supervisory Board (BPKP) will perform regular 
external audits to the project.  All final audit reports and the government’s responses will 
be disclosed in the project’s website.  
4. External Oversight
(gg) 
The EDFF project has developed communications strategy to engage with the 
different stakeholder groups and beneficiaries as outlined in Annex 13. Local community 
involvement is also a key criterion in selection of sub-projects. Potential sub-projects 
have to outline their plan to engage the community in the design, implementation, and 
monitoring of the proposed project.  
(hh) 
The project will, to the extent possible, engage civil society or academia in the 
monitoring and evaluation of the project. 
(ii) 
The project should reach out to potential implementing entities and the different 
government institutions relevant to the project. PMU will maintain communications with 
the press and beneficiaries throughout the implementation period. Public meetings will be 
organized at least twice in a year to report on progress of the project.  
5. Complaints Handling
(a) As EDFF project is funded by the MDF, it will also be subject to the complaint handling 
mechanism of the MDF. The MDF’s Outreach Officer receives and records complaints, 
refers them to the project, and monitors resolution of complaints. The project will make 
use of existing government mechanism to investigate and resolve complaints. The PMU 
will make sure that there are multiple channels available for complaints, complaints are 
referred to the Inspektorat Daerah– the GoA’s internal audit agency tasked with 
investigating complaints– with copies sent to the Bank, and complaints are properly 
recorded.  
(b) The Inspektorat Daerah receives and follow up complaints from various sources: those 
referred by the Governor’s office (through website and text messages), media, mail, and 
complaints referred by other agencies. Specifically for the project, the agency agrees to 
work together with PMU and MDF in sharing information should complaints are filed 
against the project.  
(c) Upon receipt of complaints, the agency will verify whether the allegations are 
substantiated. Depending on the gravity of the complaints, 
Inspektorat Daerah
 may 
decide to refer the complaints to relevant agencies/individuals, create a special team to 
investigate or refer the case to BPKP or law enforcement agencies. The 
Inspektorat 
Daerah
 has signed agreements with the State Development and Financial Supervisory 
Page  142
133 
 
Board (BPKP) and the Anti Corruption Commission (KPK), for referral of corruption 
findings; and has had history of close cooperation with the two. 
6. Sanctions and Remedies
(a)  
PMU will activate and monitor referrals to Inspektorat Daerah and external 
authorities (police/prosecutors/KPK/BPKP) to gauge if legal and/or 
administrative sanctions are being effectively applied.  
(b)  
Administrative sanctions will be applied against public officials proven to violate 
procedures. This includes written reprimand, orders for funds to be returned, 
transfer, demotion, exclusion from promotion/training opportunities, etc. When 
there are indications that crimes are committed, cases will be referred to the law 
enforcement agencies. 
(c)   Sanctions and remedies governed under Keppres 80/2003 will apply for violation of 
the government’s procurement rules. The sanction includes suspension of 
payment, termination of contracts, or blacklisting. The black list will be made 
public through the project website. 
(d)  
The Bank may also suspend disbursement to the project or sub-projects until 
issues are resolved. Misprocurement and cancellation of grants may be declared 
when there are evidences of corrupt practices committed.

ANNEX 13:  COMMUNICATIONS STRATEGY 
 
Context 
 
1. 
The EDFF’s communications strategy will be in line with the objectives of the MDF. The 
strategy will address the needs of various key stakeholders such as: (i) donors/ MDF, (ii) 
government institutions (BRR, GoA, GOI), (iii) media, local, national and international (iv) 
international and local NGOs and civil society organizations, (v) the business community 
(including banking sector, local and outside Aceh), (vi) the communities as a whole and (vii) 
other beneficiaries. Although all actors involved in the project (Governor’s office, BAPPEDA, 
KPDT, BRR and World Bank) will have a role in communications about EDFF, guidance and 
leadership in communicating will be lead by the PMU. The PMU should coordinate with other 
communications units, such as those of Biro Humas of the Governor’s Office, BRR, KPDT, 
BAPPEDA, MDF and the World Bank.  
 
2. 
The EDFF wants to reach out pro-actively to different stakeholders, potential 
implementing entities, beneficiaries, government agencies and the Acehnese public in general, to 
inform them of the EDFF funding mechanism, vision, and its objectives in order to:  
 
(jj) 
Inform of the role sub-project to be financed by the EDFF will have in support 
sustainable economic development in Aceh; 
(kk)  Disseminate the EDFF program to both national and international development 
players and to invite them to participate in the economic development of Aceh 
through the EDFF; 
(ll) 
Manage expectations of communities, government agencies and other players as to 
what EDFF can and cannot achieve; 
(mm) Ensure transparency in sub-project evaluation and selection, keeping interested 
parties informed of the outcome of applications at every stage, explaining decisions, 
particularly the decision not to fund a particular sub-project; and 
(nn)  Ensure that interested parties (government agencies, beneficiaries) get relevant 
information on the status of sub-projects, results, etc., offering also a forum for 
interested parties to express concerns, suggestions and to pose questions. 
(oo) Ensure that all public disclosure requirements, as per World Bank or GoI 
guidelines, are fulfilled.  
3. 
In addition, given its objectives and ownership by the Government of Aceh, the EDFF 
could:  
 
(pp)  Highlight constraints for the development of a strong and competitive private 
sector, as well as providing ideas on how the GoA can address some of those 
constraints; 
Page  144
135 
 
(qq)  Act as a showcase of approaches that GoA can use to address constraints to 
increasing competitiveness of and access for the private sector; 
(rr) 
Play a role in coordinating the activities of donors and non-government agencies in 
promoting economic growth in the region. 
Communication Stages 
 
4. 
The sub-project cycle will determine where the focus in the communications strategy 
should be given the different type of information, decisions and stakeholders that are involved in 
the different stages of the sub-project cycle. The information below elaborates on activities that 
will be part of the communications strategy depending on the stage of the sub-project cycle. 
 
(ss) 
Selection of Sub-projects 
(i)  Soon after the EDFF is approved, the project should reach out to potential 
implementing entities and their partners in government institutions to 
prepare the call for proposals, explaining the objectives and selection 
criteria of the EDFF. This will allow sufficient time for applicants to 
design, plan and discuss potential proposals for EDFF funding;  
(ii) The solicitation stage should include clear information on the process 
(independent review by PMU, selection by the Selection Committee) and 
criteria by which proposals will be reviewed in order to better manage the 
expectations of applicants. Transparency in the process will be key to 
avoiding misunderstandings, all decisions should be made public in a 
dedicated website;  
(iii)Rejections of proposals should be accompanied by an explanation of why the 
proposal did not get funding (technical issues, not addressing priorities as 
identified by the GoA, etc.), and if at all possible providing information of 
other financing sources and opportunities which might be available; 
(iv) Successful applicants will also be informed and negotiations on sub-project 
agreements will be undertaken and announced when completed. 
(tt) Sub-project 
Implementation 
(i) 
Information related to sub-project selected should be disseminated 
as soon as an agreement has been signed between the EDFF and the 
implementing entities. This information should reach the interested 
parties, such as government institutions, private sector or beneficiary 
communities. 
(ii) 
Since the EDFF will be filling strategic gaps in the GoA 
development plans, it is also important that those units involved in 
development planning at the provincial and district levels as well as the 
Page  145
136 
 
parliament are informed of the sub-projects being implemented and the 
results expected. 
(iii) 
During sub-project implementation, special attention should be 
given to communicating with potential beneficiaries, so they understand 
what to expect and what not to expect from projects being financed.  
(iv) 
It is also important that PMU defines ways in which it will 
continuously communicate with government agencies involved (KPDT, 
BRR, GoA and BAPPEDA) on any bottlenecks in the implementation of 
sub-projects, so that these agencies can address these bottlenecks quickly. 
(v) 
The PMU should also establish a good relationship with the media 
(particularly local media), explaining the results expected by the EDFF 
and individual sub-projects, again managing expectations and ensuring a 
fair representation of progress. 
Communication Tools 
 
5. 
The PMU will use the following communications tools: 
 
(a) Information 
Dissemination 
(i) Use of newspaper and website for making documents (sub-projects to be 
financed, progress reports, financial statements, etc.) available to the 
public. 
(ii) Because newspapers are generally suitable for urban audiences, at the village 
level, special printed information shall be distributed for the beneficiaries 
or groups targeted. Information on project implementation status, issues, 
challenges and success stories are some examples of what could be 
published at community spots or information boards.  
(iii)The EDFF will have a dedicated website (although it might be part of an 
existing website, e.g. in the GoA or the MDF) with information on the 
selection process, updates on project implementation, contact information, 
public disclosure of project-related documents, etc. The website should 
also feature stories of some of the sub-projects being funded, showing how 
the project is contributing to sustainable economic growth and job creation 
in the province and should recognize the source of the funding. 
(iv) Visibility of sub-projects to be financed through news stories, information 
boards, socialization of activities, etc.  
Newsflash updates/ newsletter 
(b) 
Socialization and Community Outreach 
Page  146
137 
 
(i) 
Use of outreach officers and providing a complaint handling process for 
all affected parties 
(ii) 
Socialization of sub-projects to be financed with direct beneficiaries at the 
beginning of implementation and throughout the implementation period. 
Socialization will take place with communities by the SIEs instead of 
working only with community heads or associations which could be less 
representative. 
(c) 
To the extent necessary to further the outreach process, the PMU will facilitate 
meetings of interested parties (government institutions, private sector, and 
communities) to discuss progress of the project as a whole as well as progress of 
specific sub-projects of interest.

III. Supervision Plan 
 
The proposed EDFF is structured as a programmatic operation, with multiple sub-projects being 
prepared, implemented and supervised over the next four and one half years. The World Bank, as 
partner agency under the MDF legal framework, will be responsible for project supervision of 
the project on behalf of the MDF. Given the lack of experience of the implementing agency with 
World Bank projects as well as the relatively high riskiness of the project, the World Bank will 
conduct two supervision missions for the first two years, and one supervision mission per year 
for the next two years conditional on a satisfactory management of the project by the PMU and 
the GoA. In addition, the World Bank will, together with the implementing agency, undertake 
more in depth monitoring of sub-project implementation during the first two years of the project 
to ensure that implementation is consistent the with the approved project proposal and EDFF 
operational procedures. Supervision of sub-project financial management will be done on a risk-
based approach at least once a year. The supervision will review the project’s financial 
management system, including but not limited to accounting, reporting and internal control
