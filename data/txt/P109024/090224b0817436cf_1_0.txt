                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overview
                         The objective of the Economic Development Financing Facility (EDFF) is to promote post-tsunami economic recovery and foster sustainable equitable long-term economic
                         development in Aceh in line with the Government's own plans for economic development. EDFF consists of two components. The first component provides sub-grants for projects
                         designed to create opportunities for private sector job creation and growth. These sub-projects focus on livestock, agriculture (cocoa, coffee, rice, patchouli, etc), fisheries, and small
                         scale enterprise. The second component focuses on capacity building for the provincial government in project management. The project is financed by the Multi-Donor Fund for Aceh

                         The project closing date was extended from June 30, 2012 to November 30, 2012 to provide more time to complete project activities and help achieve the project’s objectives. While
                         the project faced substantial implementation delays at the outset, it achieved substantial progress in 2011 and early 2012. The project is implemented by eight international and local
Public Disclosure Copy




                         non-governmental organizations (sub-project implementing entities, or SIEs) for sub-projects valued at approximately US$ 42.7 million. The sub-projects focus on livestock,
                         agriculture (cocoa, coffee, rice, patchouli, etc.), fisheries, and small-scale enterprises. Beneficiary selection has been completed, and capacity building for beneficiaries and
                         government workers and construction of public infrastructure is ongoing. To date an estimated 34,000 farmers, fishermen and entrepreneurs have already received support for
                         improved production and profitability through the project, and more than 13,000 people are using public infrastructure financed by the project. The eight selected sub-projects include
                         a range of activities covering most of the key agricultural and fishery products of Aceh with a good geographical range across the province. Sub-projects with strong emphasis on
                         capacity building are already seeing significant progress, while implementation progress for those dependent on building economic infrastructure have been slower due in part to the
                         lengthy procurement processes.

                         Supervision/Implementation Support
                         From June 4 to 11, 2012, the Bank team conducted an implementation support mission with the goal of reviewing overall implementation progress, assessing progress toward
                         achievement of the development objectives, and identifying implementation issues that need to be resolved. The specific objectives were to review and provide support in the areas
                         of: (1) overall project status, including DIPA 2012 and plans for replicating EDFF; (2) implementation and project closing status and issues; (3) complaints handling and
                         implementation of anti-corruption plans by SIEs and the PMU; and (4) agreed actions from previous missions, and five field activities. In addition, over the last six months, the Bank
                         has also conducted the following support missions: post-procurement review (April 30 to May 4); financial management review mission (July 23-27); overall implementation support
                         (July 31-August 10); and overall implementation support (September 11-September 21).

                         Component 1:
                         Sub-Project Selection: The competitive selection process took place from September 2009 through February 2010. This process included transparent criteria, was well-publicized and
                         a Selection Committee comprised of representatives from central and provincial government and academia selected eight sub-projects (from 119 submitted) covering most of the key
                         agricultural and fishery products of Aceh with a good geographical range across the province. After a lengthy review process, all eight sub-projects had been approved to start
                         operations by the end of 2010.

                         Implementation: Implementation of all sub-projects is largely complete, as the project closes on November 30, 2012. As noted above, the project has primarily supported farmers,
                         fishermen, and women's producer groups directly through capacity building, improved inputs and value/supply chains, market linkages, and small infrastructure. Local government
                         technical staff have been trained and are working with some sub-projects, and some districts have provided land and office space to support project activities. Construction of
                         infrastructure to support processing and other value-added activities is also in progress. [Note that sources of data are EDFF Quarterly Report by the PMC and monthly updates from
                         the PMC.] Following is a summary of EDFF sub-projects:

                         (i) Swiss Contact. Swiss Contact's Improvement of Aceh’s Cocoa Economy project aims to boost cocoa production and marketing in 5 districts by providing quality inputs, training and
                         marketing support for farmers as well as for SMEs in the cocoa value chain, cocoa business organizations and government officials. Main achievements include 12,725 beneficiaries/
                         farmers trained for 16 weeks through 403 Farmer Field Schools (FFS). Each training was led by a key farmer trained through the project and took place in 339 villages. Cocoa clinics

                         with nurseries, demonstration plots and post-harvest equipment were established in five districts. Multi-stakeholder forums were established in five districts. This initiative helped to
                         establish links with private sector stakeholders in developing master plans for the cocoa sector in each district. The second annual Aceh Cocoa Forum (ACF), which also featured
                         coffee, was held in March 2012. Public and private sector stakeholders and international buyers attended the ACF. ACF launched a new website and an SMS price information
                         system that provides daily farm gate, export and stock exchange prices for cocoa to promote a transparent and fair cocoa trade. Linkages between cocoa traders, heads of
                         beneficiary farmer groups and international exporters have been established through one-day marketing workshops in five districts. This is helping provide the basic infrastructure to
                         establish sustainable certified supply chains to international buyers like Nestle and Mars. Nearly 900 hectares of cocoa farms in addition to the more than 700,000 trees in FFS
                         locations have been rehabilitated by farmers trained under the project. Building on its success under EDFF, Swisscontact secured more than USD 5 million in funding from donors
                         and private sector partners to continue its activities in Aceh and replicate the approach. Further, the sub-project has benefited from strong support from the private sector including
                         partnerships with international firms Armajaro, Nestle, UTZ, Mars and the World Cacao Foundation. Swisscontact has also lined up extensive funding from the private sector as well
                         as USD 4 million from Swiss SECO to continue the training after the EDFF project closes. This is considered a major achievement--likely to help ensure the sustainability of EDFF's
                         investments.

                         (ii) Action Aid Australia (AAA). The Improving Competitiveness of Aceh Cocoa Value Chain to Increase Farmers' Income, Create Jobs and Alleviate Poverty project is a collaborative
                         project of AAA and the local NGO Keumang that has been designed to support 4,500 cocoa farmers in 3 districts through the introduction of improved farming practices and
                         strengthening of cooperatives. The project has experienced significant delays overall in implementation and as a result, several of the originally planned activities have been

                         canceled. To date, according to the NGOs sub-project reports, 180 farmer groups with 4,500 members were selected; seven new cooperatives were formally established, and land
                         acquired (without project funds) for new cooperative buildings. One co-op with 300 members received organic certification. 7 new women’s groups were registered and members
                         trained in seed production and composting methods. 107 cooperative members (including 31 percent women) participated in management and accounting training. 450 hectares of
                         existing cocoa farms are being rehabilitated. 300 hectares of new cocoa farms were planted for 564 widows, ex-combatants and other marginalized groups, and the new farmers are
                         being trained in good agricultural practices.

                         (iii) International Organization of Migration. Through the Sustainable Economic Growth for Aceh project, the International Organization of Migration (IOM) project, in collaboration with
                         local partners, aims to improve marketing, market transparency and access to funding of coffee farmers in the districts of Aceh Tengah and Bener Meriah. Auction market and
                         warehouse receipts system for coffee (the first in Indonesia specifically for coffee) started operations. An on-line marketing platform has been established to facilitate domestic and
                         international sales of Arabica Gayo Coffee directly between the farmers and buyers, and can also be used to sell inventory stock in the warehouse to exporters. The system is
                         operational in Indonesia with other commodities, such as corn, seaweed and timber. International coffee roasters and buyers from US, Taiwan, Philippines, Switzerland, Malaysia and
                         Germany were introduced to Aceh coffee as potential partners. Arabica Specialty Coffee network was established, and Gayo Coffee received trademark status (i.e., geographical
                         indicator) from the Ministry of Justice. New coffee development research center with coffee quality testing equipment, a nursery and small processing facilities is running as part of the
                         local university in Takengon. The university now sells the seedlings from the nurseries to help support research activities. 50 community nurseries were established and are each
                         producing and selling up to 700,000 seedlings every few weeks directly to their communities, saving transport, ensuring good quality inputs to farmers and improving livelihoods.
                         Pocket-size coffee reference books have been produced and distributed to provide easy-access to information for farmers. Ten cooperatives were selected after assessment of 37
                         coops by a selection committee of government, private sector and project staff. 500 coop members gained better understanding of the demand of international markets and improved
                         processing facilities. 1,700 farmers were trained in improved production techniques through farmer field schools (FFS). The cooperatives have now established their own Farmer
                         Field Schools to continue after the project closes, and will be supported by local government. Productivity of project-supported farmers has increased an average of 300 percent from
                         300 to 1,000 kilograms per hectare per year. The cupping (quality) test score of FFS participant farmers in the project averaged 83 compared to 77 for non-participants. This score
                         equates to Grade A (export) quality and will significantly increase the sales price for the coffee. 50 local government agricultural extension workers were trained and certified in coffee
                         quality improvement, including in economics of coffee plantation. 120 businesses have been trained in marketing, business management and coffee trading and 75 of the businesses

                         (iv) Canadian Cooperative Association (CCA). The Integrated Social Economy in Aceh Project is a collaborative project of the CCA and an Acehnese NGO PASKA that aims to
                         support smallholder producers in the agriculture, aquaculture, marine fisheries and tree crop sectors. 36 cooperatives and pre-cooperatives with more than 2,400 members were
                         established/strengthened and members trained in coop, business and financial management practices; 6 women's groups increased snack food production capacity eight-fold with
                         custom presses provided by the project; a secondary cooperative was established and is facilitating sales and marketing of members' fish and agricultural produce, especially rice,
                         using the project's working capital fund; 5,000 farmers and nearly 2,000 fishermen trained in harvesting, organic farming and product quality improvement; more than 2,000 members
                         of SMEs and coops trained in gender equality, good governance and peace building. The first harvest from several of the project's fish ponds yielded 800 kilograms of fish sold to new
                         buyers from Aceh and North Sumatra. Six women’s groups have increased emping production capacity eight-fold by using custom-designed presses provided by the project. A

                         secondary cooperative to facilitate sales and marketing of members’ fish and agricultural produce was established and has been actively trading members’ commodities. The
                         cooperative also operates a rice milling unit and packaging facilities to improve the quality and appearance of its members’ products.

                         (v) Caritas Czech Republic. This project aims to support nilam (patchouli) farmers in the disadvantaged districts of Aceh Jaya, Aceh Barat, Aceh Selatan and Gayo Lues. Main
                         achievements:Farmer Field Schools with demonstration plots were conducted in 52 locations for more than 2,800 patchouli farmer members of 30 cooperatives in four districts.
                         Farmers learned about nurseries, crop maintenance, disease reduction, harvesting and post-harvesting. Nearly one million good quality seeds were distributed, and improved
                         growing technologies applied on 700,000 hectares. Some 450,000 tons of dry leaf patchouli have been harvested and 7.6 tons of oil produced by farmers. One Nilam Business

                         farmers, and will facilitate buying and selling of patchouli production (leaves or oil) from members through their primary cooperatives using working capital funds provided by the
                         project. The project’s French perfume company partner is teaching farmers best practice distillation techniques to produce high quality oil for export. Patchouli sector and local market
                         studies were completed and contacts with network of local collectors and traders established. Aceh patchouli is in process of being trademarked (i.e., geographical indicator) through

                         provision of improved bulls and heifers for fattening and breeding; construction of stables and equipment; and training for 720 farmers. The project has led to the establishment of 36
                         farmer groups and 9 centers for Artificial Insemination and veterinary health. A total of 36 farmer groups totaling 720 members were selected as beneficiaries and provided equipment
                         to grow fodder for livestock. Farmers were trained in group management, financial management, administration and general business skills. Government technical staff have been
                         trained in cattle health care, production and other relevant topics. One district government technical expert completed an internship on cattle reproduction health in East Java.
                         Construction was completed for 36 cattle houses, fodder fields and compost facilities for group management of cows, 5 biogas facilities, 12 water pumps, 15 wells and 5 shelters.
                         1,260 Aceh and Bali breed cattle have been delivered for fattening and breeding by 36 farmer groups. When ready, the cows are sold by the group, proceeds used to buy
                         replacement cows and profits will be shared by the group. The process will be repeated, creating a revolving fund for the continued group management of the cattle in the future.

                         (vii) Islamic Relief. Through the Sustainable Seafisheries for Simeulue and Singkil project, the project aims to support fishermen in the disadvantaged districts of Singkil and
                         Simeulue. The project supports the provision of improved fishing and fish processing equipment, public infrastructure (fishing platforms, fish cages and catching attractors, fish
                         hatchery, jetty) and marketing skills to 273 fishermen groups and cooperatives. The project has experienced some delays in completion of expected activities. To date, a reported
                         1,219 fishermen have received training, and women’s empowerment training was conducted for 30 women from 6 villages. A local hatchery was rehabilitated and zooplankton and
                         fingerling production restarted in Simeulue. Construction of jetty extension has been completed. 45 fishing platforms (KJAs) have been built for fishermen groups in the remote
                         districts of Simeulue and Singkil, and fishermen trained in their use. Five floating fish catching devices are under construction and 110 fish aggregation devices.

                         (viii) Aceh Development Foundation. Through the Green Engineering Approach to Improving the Fish Processing Industry project, the Aceh Development Foundation (ADF) in
                         collaboration with local partners, aims to stimulate value added processing of fish and fishery products in the districts of Bireuen and Pidie Jaya. Land for key infrastructure was
                         acquired (no project funds used) and construction of key infrastructure (i.e., ice factory, salt iodization plant, salt cooking filter, liquid smoke fish preservative factory and simple fish
                         drying facility) is ongoing. 6 primary cooperatives and 1 village-based business (BUMD) were established and in process of being strengthened to operate the facilities in
                         collaboration with private sector management.

                         Component 2: The Bappeda Aceh-based Project Management Unit (PMU) and KPDT Project Secretariat were established in 2009 and an international consulting firm is helping build
                         their capacity to manage EDFF and similar projects in the future. PMU staff are now able to more effectively manage and resolve administrative and technical implementation issues
                         and to use project monitoring reports for decision making, and KPDT has carried out a number of monitoring missions and supported resolution of policy issues with other central
                         ministries. The Government of Aceh, which has responsibility for implementing the project, has supported EDFF through co-financing and linking the related technical agencies and
                         districts in order to build project ownership early on, as well as developing an exit strategy. In recent months, the PMU has focused on helping the SIEs to accelerate their activities;
                         improving FM and procurement capacity of SIEs to speed up project implementation; and project monitoring.
