                         The objective of the Economic Development Financing Facility (EDFF) is to promote post-tsunami economic recovery and foster sustainable equitable long-term economic
                         development in Aceh in line with the Government's own plans for economic development. EDFF consists of two components. The first component provides sub-grants for projects
                         designed to create opportunities for private sector job creation and growth. These sub-projects focus on livestock, agriculture (cocoa, coffee, rice, patchouli, etc), fisheries, and small

                         and Nias (MDF).

                         After a lengthy start-up phase, the project has now made significant progress with implementation of field activities well underway. While the project offers an innovative design,

                         progress was affected by challenges related to procurement, financial management and project management. These challenges have seen significant improvement since the last
                         ISR, with increased resources from the PMU and capacity building from the Project Management Consultant (PMC) and World Bank. Although the short remaining implementation
                         time frame remains a challenge for the project, recent 5-month extensions of the Grant Agreement (to November 30, 2012) and sub-grant agreements (to August 31, 2012) are
                         providing implementing NGOs more time to finalize construction of physical works and build capacity of the beneficiaries, producer groups, cooperatives, and marketing forums to
                         increase sustainability. The project has gained considerable momentum toward achieving its development objectives. EDFF continues to have strong backing from stakeholders at
                         all levels. The project is a key element of the Government's plans to make the transition from tsunami reconstruction to sustainable economic development.

                         Supervision/Implementation Support

                         The task team carried out implementation support missions during the following dates: September 15-October 14; November 15-25 and 28-30; December 8-23, 2011. September
                         and December missions were complemented by intensive on-site support by World Bank Procurement. Implementation support included assisting the PMU and SIEs in finalizing
                         bidding documents and helping to resolve procurement bottlenecks; participating with KPDT and representatives from central government ministries in monitoring EDFF field
                         activities; assessing overall project progress and provide implementation support to PMU in areas of M&E, safeguards, and financial management; and meet with SIEs and PMU to
                         help resolve identified issues affecting project implementation. The project supervision team also includes an Aceh-based FM consultant, who works with the PMU and SIEs on an
                         ongoing basis.

                         In January 2012, missions outside of the provincial capital were suspended until after elections in early April due to security concerns. The team plans a major supervision/
                         implementation support mission as soon as the security restrictions are lifted.


                         Project Status Summary

                         The project is implemented by eight international and local non-governmental organizations (sub-project implementing entities, or SIEs) for sub-projects valued at approximately US$
                         42.7 million.

                         Component 1:

                         Sub-Project Selection: The competitive selection process, including transparent criteria, was well-publicized and a Selection Committee comprised of representatives from central and
                         provincial government and academia selected eight sub-projects (from 119 submitted) covering most of the key agricultural and fishery products of Aceh with a good geographical
                         range across the province. After a lengthy review process, all eight sub-projects had been approved to start operations by the end of 2010.

                         Implementation: While implementation progress varies by SIE, all sub-projects are well underway and more than 26,000 farmers and fishermen, including 450 producer groups and
                         cooperatives, have already been supported directly through capacity building, improved inputs and value/supply chains, market linkages, and small infrastructure. Local government
                         technical staff have been trained and are working with some sub-projects, and some districts have provided land and office space to support project activities. Indirect beneficiaries
                         exceed 100,000. Construction of infrastructure to support processing and other value-added activities is also in progress. [Note that sources of data are EDFF Quarterly Report by
                         the PMC and monthly updates from the PMC.] Following is a summary of EDFF sub-projects and progress:

                         (i) Swiss Contact. Swiss Contact's Improvement of Aceh’s Cocoa Economy project aims to boost cocoa production and marketing in 5 districts by providing quality inputs, training and
                         marketing support for farmers as well as for SMEs in the cocoa value chain, cocoa business organizations and government officials. More than 12,000 farmers were trained through
                         400 Farmer Field Schools in farm rehabilitation and/or Good Agricultural Practices (GAP); more than 200,000 trees rehabilitated; 25 government extension workers and 500 key
                         farmers trained as GAP trainers; Aceh Cocoa Forum strengthened, first annual Aceh Cocoa Conference held in March 2011 and a joint Aceh Cocoa and Coffee Conference

                         more nearly ready. 40 farmer groups were trained as Smallholder Cocoa Enterprises and received equipment to help sustain their businesses. Further, the sub-project has benefited
                         from strong support from the private sector including partnerships with international firms Armajaro, Nestle, UTZ, Mars and the World Cacao Foundation. Swisscontact has also lined
                         up extensive funding from the private sector as well as USD 4 million from Swiss SECO to continue the training after the EDFF project closes. This is considered a major

                         project of AAA and the local NGO Keumang that has been designed to support 4,500 cocoa farmers in 3 districts through the introduction of improved farming practices and
                         strengthening of cooperatives. The project has experienced significant delays overall in implementation and as a result, several of the originally planned activities have been
                         canceled. To date, according to the NGOs sub-project reports, a demonstration plot has been secured and nearly 400 key farmers trained as trainers; 2,300 farmers trained; 7 new
                         cooperatives established; 7 new women's groups registered and members trained in seed production and composting methods; 107 cooperative members received management and

                         Component 2: The Bappeda Aceh-based Project Management Unit (PMU) and KPDT Project Secretariat were established in 2009 and an international consulting firm is helping build
                         their capacity to manage EDFF and similar projects in the future. PMU staff are now able to more effectively manage and resolve administrative and technical implementation issues
                         and to use project monitoring reports for decision making, and KPDT has carried out a number of monitoring missions and supported resolution of policy issues with other central
                         ministries. T he Government of Aceh, which has responsibility for implementing the project, has continuously supported EDFF through co-financing and linking the related technical
                         agencies and districts in order to build project ownership early on, as well as developing an exitstrategy. In recent months, the PMU has focused on helping the SIEs to accelerate
                         their activities; improving FM and procurement capacity of SIEs to speed up project implementation; and project monitoring.
