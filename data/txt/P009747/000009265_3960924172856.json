The community plantation component, which\n            aimed to develop self-help woodlots, did not succeed due to\n            a variety of economic and sociological reasons. Overall, the\n            project started promptly and progressed on a timely basis.\n            It closed on schedule in December 1984 and the credit amount\n            was fully disbursed. There were revisions in the project\n            design, determined during the mid-term review, including the\n            dropping of the fuel-efficient stove component.\n            Sustainability is likely for Uttar Pradesh's capability\n            to handle its plantation programs and even teach others.\n            However, the Forest Department has not established a firm\n            capacity for certain qualitative aspects, including\n            institutional weaknesses resulting in poor delivery of\n            advice to farmers; distribution and marketing aspects of\n            tree production; and subsistence fuel needs of the poor and\n            urban populations. The Bank performed well. Supervisions\n            occurred fairly regularly, and a useful exchange of view\n            between mission members and forestry officials often\n            occurred. IDA showed flexibility during project\n            implementation. There were five lessons learned: (i) to the\n            extent that wood production can be handled economically on\n            private lands, Forest Departments should turn over that\n            responsibility; (ii) Forest Departments have begun to\n            experiment with new plantation approaches, a key one being\n            tree tenure schemes whereby poor farmers and landless\n            persons lease public land at nominal fees and take the\n            benefits of the trees they grow there; (iii) social forestry\n            should look toward both the supply and demand sides; (iv)\n            the social forestry experience has indicated that some\n            functions can be handled better by the private sector or\n            other organizations; and (v) the project was well\n            conceptualized and the overwhelming success of farm forestry\n            could not be anticipated."}, "docdt": "1989-05-22T00:00:00Z"}
