  intensify the social forestry program in Uttar Pradesh. The\n            program aims at large-scale tree plantation along roads,\n            rails and canals, on village common lands unsuitable for\n            cropping, and on degraded forest reserves in need of\n            rehabilitation. The trees would provide a much-needed source\n            of energy to the villages, raw materials to cottage\n            industries, and greater stability to the environment. The\n            ultimate objective would be to have the villagers establish\n            as soon as possible their own village forests, using\n            voluntary labor, with the assistance of state-wide forest\n            extension services, for distribution of fuelwood and other\n            products to village communities. About 48,600 ha of public\n            and village lands would be planted under the project, 45,600\n            ha of which would be carried out by the Uttar Pradesh Social\n            Forestry Directorate with varying degrees of community participation."}, "docdt": "1979-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
