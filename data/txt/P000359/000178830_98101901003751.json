The focus would be on increased food\n            crop production and improvements in coffee yields and\n            quality. The project will include: (a) expansion and\n            streamlining of Central Agricultural Cooperative Union of\n            the Western Province (UCCAO) services, strengthening of\n            cooperatives, modernization of coffee processing and\n            marketing facilities; (b) provision of incremental inputs;\n            and (c) supporting activities, including applied research,\n            village water supply, feeder roads, soil conservation,\n            reafforestation, bottomlands development, monitoring and\n            evaluation. Technical assistance, fellowships and studies\n            would also be provided. The project will support several key\n            Government objectives: (i) reducing rural-urban income\n            disparities and slowing down urban migration by raising\n            smallholder productivity and improving rural living\n            conditions; (ii) promoting national food self-sufficiency\n            and generating additional export earnings; and (iii)\n            decentralizing development by strengthening regional institutions."}, "docdt": "1984-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
