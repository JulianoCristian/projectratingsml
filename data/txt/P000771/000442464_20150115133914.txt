Empowering the Remote Communities of Ethiopia                                                             July 1, 2002
                      With a population of more than 60 million and an average per capita income of $100 a year, Ethiopia is
                      one of the world’s poorest countries.  In 1995, life expectancy in Ethiopia was just 48 years, and 117 of
                      every one thousand infants died within their first year.  Almost 700 women died in childbirth for every
                      100,000 births.  More than 70 percent of the country was susceptible to malaria, and tuberculosis was
                      the major cause of hospital-registered death.

                        In 1996, the Social Rehabilitation and Development Fund Project was created to help remote
                        communities address these tragedies, backed by a commitment from the World Bank to finance half of
the project’s $240 million total cost.

Since then, the project has enabled 600,000 children, 49 percent of them girls, to attend school.  Four million people now
have easier access to health and sanitation facilities.  Some 66,800 Ethiopians enjoy higher crop yields due to improved
irrigation.
