The components of this\n            project will be as follows: 1) construction and\n            rehabilitation of social and economic infrastructure and\n            improvement of related services including basic health and\n            education, small-scale irrigation, urban sanitation and\n            rural water supply; 2) welfare monitoring system; and 3)\n            capacity building, training and research."}, "docdt": "1996-03-13T00:00:00Z"}
