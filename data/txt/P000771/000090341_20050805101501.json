satisfactory. Lessons learned from the project:\n            Project targets must be realistic and design must be simple\n            and flexible. Timely and appropriate capacity building\n            support is key to subprojects implementation and\n            sustainability. Gender promotion requires strategic and\n            sustained approaches. Income generating activities are\n            fundamentally different from social sector activities and\n            require different approaches. Timely dissemination of\n            economic and data analysis is essential. Parallel structures\n            are efficient, but transitional in nature.
