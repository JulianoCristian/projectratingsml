The Ethiopian Social Rehabilitation and Development Fund Project (ESRDF) will provide to poor,
mainly rural communities the assets and services needed to improve their economic and social
standards. ESRDF will provide financial and technical support to communities and community
groups to construct or rehabilitate, and maintain basic economic and social infrastructure and
services that they have prioritized and in which they are willing to invest. In addition, ESRDF will
support community actions aimed at environmental conservation and rehabilitation. ESRDF's efforts
will be focused on poor communities, and especially, poor women.
To achieve these goals, ESRDF will strengthen community capacity in
project identification, implementation, and maintenance. The project will
also support the establishment of a Welfare Monitoring System to
strengthen capacity to collect and analyze information related to causes,
patterns, and incidence of poverty; and improve the basis for developing
poverty reduction strategies, assessing the impact on the poor of
economic policy reform, and evaluating the benefits of other poverty
reductions interventions.

The components of this project will be as follows: 1) construction and rehabilitation of social and
economic infrastructure and improvement of related services including basic health and education,
small-scale irrigation, urban sanitation and rural water supply; 2) welfare monitoring system; and 3)
capacity building, training and research.
