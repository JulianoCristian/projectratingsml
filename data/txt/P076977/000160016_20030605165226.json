          Sector Technical Assistance Loan (ESTAL) for Brazil is to\n            help ensure sustainable implementation of the\n            Government's ongoing energy sector reform program,\n            through technical assistance in specific areas, and by\n            providing a mechanism for continuing dialogue with\n            policy-makers about longer-term sector reform. This\n            operation focuses on the power and gas sector, where there\n            are more urgent reform needs. The hydrocarbons sector is\n            also covered through some special issues on gas and to a\n            more limited way on oil, although the scope of institutional\n            strengthening embodies all areas under the purview of the\n            energy sector authority. The ESTAL would consist of five\n            components, aimed at furthering reforms in five main\n            priority areas identified by the Government: 1) Market\n            development and regulation - correcting problems with the\n            regulatory system and with the wholesale and retail markets,\n            with a view to providing the correct incentives for\n            contracting and expansion in the sector; 2) Benefits to the\n            poor - increasing access to and affordability of\n            electricity, natural gas and LPG including through tariff\n            reform with targeted, smart subsidies focused on those who\n            are most in need; 3) Environmental management - enhancing\n            the sector's environmental framework, management,\n            capabilities, and licensing procedures; 4) Expansion\n            planning - developing a strategy and methodologies for\n            meeting future demand, integrating multiple sources of\n            energy, as well as demand and supply side possibilities; and\n            5) Institutional strengthening - enhancing the\n            Government's capacity for policy-making, and its\n            ability to implement reform measures, coordinate multiple\n            initiatives, and monitor their progress."}, "docdt": "2003-05-29T00:00:00Z"}
