The restructuring is required to accelerate the\n            disbursement of the loan to meet the Government of\n            Indonesia's (GoI's) fiscal gap for this budget\n            year. This will mean that the bank will disburse 100 percent\n            of BOS grants financed in 2011 in lieu of the currently\n            agreed 40 percent. The change has occurred as a result of:\n            decentralizing BOS and associated changes which negatively\n            affected disbursement; and slow submission of required\n            Ministry of Finance (MoF) reports by districts."}, "docdt": "2011-11-01T00:00:00Z"}
