as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: good and\n            reliable data are essential for monitoring and evaluating\n            new approaches to the delivery of education services.\n            Results must also be synchronized with the end-of the\n            project so that achievements are measured with the most\n            up-to-date information. The efficient and timely BOS\n            disbursements to schools are contingent upon establishing\n            and maintaining a clear funds flow mechanism. Adequate\n            capacity building at both institutional and staff levels, is\n            critical if major shifts are to be made in how money flows\n            from the center to local levels in a major national program\n            such as BOS. On-budget Bank support for a government program\n            allows leveraging limited Bank financing into overarching\n            national sector investments. Bank technical assistance and\n            guidance on the BOS operations manual had greatest impact on\n            improved existing fiduciary arrangements, funds flow,\n            school-based management and increased community\n            participation in BOS activities throughout Indonesia."}, "docdt": "2013-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
