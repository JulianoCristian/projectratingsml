                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the Project is to improve access to quality education in Indonesia for all children of ages 7 to 15 by strengthening school-based management and
                         community participation, improving existing fiduciary arrangements for greater transparency and accountability of the BOS program and, consequently, bringing about
                         better utilization of BOS funds.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         BOS-KITA AF continues to strengthen BOSNAS with improved fiduciary standards and increased transparency and accountability. Progress has been satisfactory within GoI’s
                         existing policy environment and institutional arrangements. As of March 99.97% of the SIL has been disbursed.

                         The PDO is relevant and achievable: BOS has made a vital contribution to improving access to basic education for all children with reduced in-school costs, and a decrease in real
                         costs faced by poor households. At primary and JSS levels (i) NERs have increased slightly by +/- 1%, since 2006 with those for the poorest quintile increasing significantly,
                         narrowing the gap between the wealthiest households by 13 percentage points; (ii) Drop-out rates have declined, particularly at primary level (above project target); (iii) Transition

                         In 2011, GoI moved to a decentralized dual system model for fund disbursement to schools – a massive change institutionally for MoEC and MoHA. MoF disbursed BOS funds to
                         District accounts on time but there were significant district level disbursement delays. This was due to overarching MoHA financial management compliance requirements with regard

                         to the separate and different fund flow mechanisms for public and private schools.

                         The complicated 2011 disbursement system also reduced the involvement of School Committees (SC) in the preparation of annual budget plans and approval of expenditure reports.
                         The system did however ensure that schools had School Improvement Plans (SIPs), prepared in close consultation with District BOS Management Teams. Knowledge about BOS
                         objectives increased but there was no significant improvement in the percentage of schools displaying the school plan and up-to-date expenditure information about BOS on
                         accessible notice-boards.

                         GoI monitored the situation closely: in December 2011a highly successful return to the Provincial Block Grant mechanism was announced: 100% of Q1 funds were disbursed by
                         January 19 2012 (a 22% improvement in Provincial level disbursement). The bank will provide ongoing technical guidance into a revised policy for decentralisation.

                         GoI has been proactive in moving forward on major activities to: (i) strengthen SBM and BOS transparency and accountability, in close consultation with DPs and other stakeholders;
                         (ii) address inequality in district and school education funding ( particularly for the poor) which continues despite MoF, MoHA and MoEC regulatory requirements that all districts
                         provide local counterpart funds, BOSDA, to supplement BOSNAS. MoEC has requested the Bank to provide ongoing technical advisory and rapid analysis support to advance this
                         work further.
