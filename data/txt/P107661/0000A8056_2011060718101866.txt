                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the Project is to improve access to quality education in Indonesia for all children of ages 7 to 15 by strengthening school-based management
                         and community participation, improving existing fiduciary arrangements for greater transparency and accountability of the BOS program and, consequently,
                         bringing about better utilization of BOS funds.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The BOS-KITA support has contributed in important ways to a strengthened BOS program in terms of GoI monitoring and the complementary and highly effective oversight provided
                         through formal institutional structures such as School Committees. The BOS program has played a vital role in mainstreaming SBM practices to facilitate an enabling environment for
                         resource allocation. Since the GOI decision to decentralize the BOS program in December 2010 however there has been a marked delay in onward transfer of funds to schools by
                         districts/cities, and the different treatment of private and public schools is an additional concern. By the end of March, 86% of schools had received their BOS funds for the first
                         quarter, and 19.5% had received their funds for the second quarter.
