                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the Project is to improve access to quality education in Indonesia for all children of ages 7 to 15 by strengthening school-based management and
                         community participation, improving existing fiduciary arrangements for greater transparency and accountability of the BOS program and, consequently, bringing about
                         better utilization of BOS funds.

                         69.96% (higher than the end target of 68.65% and baseline of 66.6%). This is based on March 2012 SUSENAS data. Transition Rates from Primary to Junior Secondary are 77.26%
                         (lower than the end target of 82.20% and base line of 82%). Transition Rates from Junior Secondary to High School are 97.93% higher than the end target of 97.34% and the
                         baseline 89.2%. This is based on 2011 MoEC data. While interim national-level data received from SUSENAS indicates below end-targets for Primary Net Enrolment Rates (NER)
