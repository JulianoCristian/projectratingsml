MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:    Project Completion Report on Turkey
Fourth TEK Transmission Protect (Loan 2586-TU)
Attached is the "Project Completion Report on Turkey - Fourth Tek
Transmission Project (Loan 2586-TU)" prepared by the Europe and Central Asia
Regional Office. No comments were received from the Borrower.
This project, the sixteenth operation in the power sector, had two
stated objectives. First, to expand the high voltage interconnected system of
the Turkish Electricity Authority (TEK) to allow continued supply of the growing
electricity demand; and second, to increase TEK's capability in network planning
and in transmission lines and substation design.   TEK fully met the first
objective but not the second one as it failed to implement the corresponding
training program. Since TEK did not comply with important financial covenants,
the rate of return on sector investments based on current prices is only 6%.
The project was completed at a cost of US$ 268 million, i.e. 29%
above the original cost estimate, and its construction took almost two years
longer than the scheduled five years. The Bank loan financed US$ 136.8 million,
and TEK and the Government, the balance. The delays in project implementation,
caused mainly by poor compliance of TEK with Bank procurement guidelines,
concurred with delays in commissioning the power generating plants supplying the
TEK interconnected system and did not thwart the project objectives.
The outcome of the project is rated as marginally satisfactory.
TEK's low electricity prices underestimate the important economic benefits of
meeting  the  increased  demand on TEK's power  interconnected  system.    The
institutional  development  impact  is  rated  as negligible.    The  project's
sustainability is rated as uncertain because TEK's financial position remains
precarious for two reasons: first, TEK is burdened by a large debt overhang
incurred as a result of the inadequate tariff policy during the implementation
of the project; second, the Government and TEK's commitment to improved
efficiency in operations, investment planning and financial management has been
weak.
The very concise PCR presents a clear picture of the project
implementation and its results and lessons. No audit is planned.

FOURTH TEK TRANSMISSION PROJECT (LOAN 2586-TU)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Fourth TEK
Transmission Project in Turkey, for which Loan 2586-TU in the amount of US$142.0
million was approved on June 18, 1985. US$136.8 million equivalent was disbursed
from the loan which was closed on December 31, 1991, one year behind the original
schedule with the last disbursement in May 1992.  The undisbursed balance of
US$5.2 million was cancelled in December 1992.
The PCR was prepared by the Industry & Energy Operations Division,
Country Department I of the Europe & Central Asia Region (Preface, Evaluation
Summary, Parts I and III). Part II of the PCR, to be prepared by the Borrower
(Turkish Electricity Authority - TEK), has not yet been received. The draft of
Parts I and III have been submitted to TEK for comments in March 1993.
Preparation of this PCR is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal
Report; the President's Report; the Loan and Guarantee Agreements; supervision
reports; project progress reports; correspondence between the Bank and the
Borrower; and internal Bank memoranda.

FOURTH TEK TRANSMISSION PROJECT (LOAN 2586-TU)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.          A loan of US$142 million was made  to the Turkish Electricity
Authority (TEK) in 1985 for the development of Turkey's high voltage power
transmission grid.   The project was the sixteenth Bank group operation in
Turkey's power subsector, and was a continuation of the Bank's assistance,
started in 1952, for developing the subsector and for increasing utilization of
indigenous resources. The loan was guaranteed by the Republic of Turkey.
Obiectives
2.          The  project  had  two  main  objectives:  (i)  to  provide  major
transmission links and transformer substations required to strengthen TEK's power
system and to ensure a continued supply of electricity to the growing demand on
TEK's interconnected systems; and (ii) to increase TEK's capabilities in network
planning and in transmission lines and substation design through a training
component.
Implementation Experience
3.          Proj ect implementation proceeded more slowly than originally planned.
The major transmission lines, with one exception, were commissioned some two
years later than scheduled. This was due in large measure to the delays in the
power generation plant construction schedules, which required corresponding
changes in connecting the high voltage transmission lines to the national grid.
4.          The other factors affecting project implementation were institutional
in nature: (i) TEK's slow and cumbersome bidding and contracting procedures and
its reluctance to use standardized bid documents; (ii) the unsatisfactory local
cost funding arrangements; and (iii) the institutional weakness of TEK.
5.          TEK and the Government did not display the hoped for commitment to
the institutional aspects of the project.   The training component was never
implemented, partly because the Bank did not adequately supervise this component.
Thus, the objective of increasing TEK's technical capability was largely
unrealized.
Results
6.          Of the project's two main objectives, only one was fulfilled.  Over
800 km of 380-kV transmission lines and the associated substations were added to



iii
TEK's transmission network. These facilities will enable TEK to service an ever
and rapidly increasing electricity demand. The delay in commissioning facilities
was not overly detrimental to system performance, because in most cases the
transmission lines were in place when needed to evacuate power from the
generation plants. As mentioned earlier, the institutional objectives of the
project were not achieved.
7.          The financial performance of TEK and its ability to function as a
viable economic organization were major concerns. Financial management continued
to be poor, and financial targets were not met.  The major factors affecting
TEK's financial performance were inadequate tariff adjustments, increased
investments in generation plants due to non-realization of BOT schemes, and
accelerating inflation and devaluation of the Turkish Lira against major
currencies.
8.          At project appraisal, the economic rate of return was estimated at
11.2%. An analysis of the project cost data reveals a more likely rate of return
of 6.14%, considerably less than originally forecast.
Sustainability
9.          From a technical standpoint, the project can be sustained.  TEK is
capable of designing, constructing, and operating modern high-voltage
transmission facilities that can reliably deliver electricity to distant demand
centers. TEK has also improved its in-house training facilities and is now able
to provide training to its staff in most areas of network operations.
Findings and Lessons
10.         The immediately apparent causes of the problems that beset the
project may be summarized as follows: (i) failure to use standardized bidding
documents; (ii) lack of coordination among the TEK departments concerned; (iii)
lack of local funds; (iv) lack of commitment on the part of TEK's management to
the technical assistance objectives of the project; (v) lack of a strategy for
the development and deployment of TEK's human resources.
11.         The lessons to be learned from this lending operation are that
project implementation and institution building efforts will not be successful
unless the borrower takes charge and there is a firm and continuing commitment
on the part of both the borrower and the Government to the agreed goals.  To
become a more viable institution in the power subsector, TEK must begin to
function more independently from the Government and must conduct its operations
on a more commercial and competitive basis.
12.         The Bank should have worked more closely with the Borrower in the
initial project phase to develop a coherent and consistent procurement plan,
including standard bidding documents, and should have relied on upfront actions
given the less than satisfactory progress of the then ongoing TEK Transmission
III Project.

2. Background
2.01     In every year from 1971 through Project Appraisal in 1985, electricity
supply was insufficient to meet demand, resulting in high costs to the economy,
as imports increased and supply interruptions became more frequent. During the
Five Year Plan of 1985-89, priority was to be given to domestic sources of
energy, especially hydro and lignite, in the country's generation expansion
program.   The salient feature of the Turkish electricity system is that the
largest load centers are located at considerable distances from the main
indigenous energy resources of hydro and lignite. As a result, TEK has had to
pay special attention to the development and construction of a high-voltage
transmission grid.
2.02     Implementation of a least-cost, long-term construction program for the
380-kV transmission grid began in 1974, which was updated regularly to take
account of changes in TEK's load growth and generation system requirements. The
Fourth TEK Transmission Project was to be a continuation of the then on-going
Third Transmission Project (Loan 2322-TU), constituting the fourth phase of
development of the 380-kV transmission network, covering the period 1986-1990.
3. Project Objectives and Description
3.01     The project had two main objectives: (i) to provide major transmission
links and transformer substations needed so as to strengthen further TEK's power
system and to ensure a continued supply of electricity to the growing demand on
TEK's interconnected system; and (ii) to increase TEK's capabilities in network
planning and in transmission lines and substation design through a training
component.
3.02     The project was part of TEK's then current 1986-1990 development plan
and included the following components:
(a) construction of about 800 km of 380-kV transmission lines to
interconnect the Altinkaya and Hamitabat power stations to TEK's
bulk supply system and provide two additional links for the
Karakaya power station:
(b)  construction   and/or   extension   of   380/154-kV   transformer
substations with total installed capacity of about 2,100 MVA;



-2-
(c)  supply,  installation,  and commissioning of equipment  for the
construction and extension of 154-kV substations with about 3,300
MVA of new installed capacity;
(d)  construction  of  a  tower  testing  station  for  towers  for
transmission lines up to 380-kV, with possibility of extension to
the 800-kV range;
(e)  supply of specialized line stringing equipment and vehicles to be
used in the installation of transmission lines;
(f)  training and supply of devices, such as computer hardware/software
to strengthen TEK's capabilities in network engineering and
planning, and in transmission lines and substation design; and
(g)  consulting services to assist TEK in project implementation.
3.03     The  total  cost  of  the  project,  including  physical  and  price
contingencies, but excluding the interest during construction, was estimated at
US$195 million equivalent, of which US$146 million was in foreign exchange.
Interest during construction was estimated at US$13 million equivalent, bringing
the total financing required to US$208 million.
3.04     The Bank loan of US$142 million was to finance 89 percent of the foreign
cost including the $13 million for interest during construction. The remaining
$66 million of total cost were to be covered by TEK's internal cash generation,
materials from stock, and Government contributions ($17 million of the foreign
exchange cost represent the cost of material and equipment supplied by TEK and
the indirect foreign exchange cost for installation and erection to be undertaken
by TEK or local contractors).
4. Project Design and Organization
4.01     Design.  At Project Appraisal, the preparation of detailed design and
tender documents for procurement was underway and was expected to be completed
by March 30, 1986. As this project was viewed as an extension of the TEK III
Transmission Project, the planning and design had been performed according to the
criteria established during previous construction and operation of TEK's
transmission system.   Installation and erection of project facilities was to
commence in mid-1986, with the project scheduled for completion by June 30, 1990.
4.02     Acquisition of rights-of-way  for  the  transmission  lines was  also
underway at Project Appraisal, whereas land acquisition for the new substations
had not yet started. The land acquisition schedule agreed to by TEK and the Bank
during negotiations called for all transmission line land acquisition to be
completed by September 30, 1986, and at least 50% of the substation land
acquisition to be completed by June 30, 1986.
4.03     Organization.  As implementing agency for the project, TEK planned to
use essentially the same organizational structure that was used for the TEK III
Transmission Project. ELTEM-TEK, a private local engineering consulting firm,
would be retained to act as project manager, providing assistance in engineering,
project management and coordination, and other technical and administrative
services.    The  use  of  ELTEM-TEK  was  consistent  with  the  condition  of
effectiveness specified in Article 7.01 of the Loan Agreement, namely, that
engineering  consultants  must  be  engaged.    ELTEM-TEK  would  hire  foreign



- 3 -
consultants, whenever needed,  to assist its own personnel.   The consulting
assistance was estimated at 60 man-months, for both ELTEM-TEK and any foreign
consultants.
4.04     Procurement.  The goods and services to be procured for the project were
initially grouped into 10 contract packages for the transmission lines component
and into 11 contract packages for the substations component.   The proposed
procurement plan called for all contracts for the lines component to awarded by
the end of 1986 and all contracts for the substations component to be awarded by
the end of May 1987. By following this schedule project completion should have
been achievable by mid-year 1990, as originally planned.
4.05     Training. Training was an important project component to complement the
training and manpower development activities under the ongoing TEK Transmission
III Project.   At least 90 individuals were to participate with the aim of
improving TEK's capabilities in network engineering and planning, and in
transmission lines and substations design. A detailed staff training plan was
to be submitted to the Bank no later than June 30, 1986.
5. Project Implementation
5.01     Implementation of the project proceeded more slowly than expected at
appraisal. Through the first four years of the project, disbursements were only
25Z of the planned disbursement curve.   Although the loan closing was only
extended by one year, project completion was actually two years later than
scheduled.
5.02     Land acquisition proceeded more slowly than scheduled because of the
governmental approval process, changes in routing and changes in project scope,
as well as construction delays.   However, land acquisition was not the main
contributing factor to overall project slippage. Procurement proved to be the
biggest obstacle to achieving the project schedule.
5.03     At Appraisal  it was  felt  that  the design and bid  specification
preparation for the agreed 21 contract packages was well in-hand, and that the
schedule was achievable. The completion of the preparation of the procurement
packages, however, took longer than planned, and this jeopardized the
implementation of an otherwise well conceived procurement plan.
5.04     The schedule slipped by two years for both the transmission lines and
substations  components.   A further  complication was  the vacillation over
contracting approach. Changes in power generation plant construction schedules,
due to disappointing experiences with new power plants under BOT arrangements,
inevitably resulted in changes to transmission line connection schedules. Faced
with difficulties in implementation of some of the transmission lines on schedule
due to the major reorganization of TEK in late-1987 as well as the pressure to
complete the ongoing construction of power plants, TEK decided to use the turn-
key approach to accelerate implementation.   With the Bank's assistance, TEK
prepared standard bidding documents for turn-key procurement of lines and
substations in early 1988. However, towards the end of 1988, TEK decided to use
multiple contracts instead of turn-key contracts, largely due to pressure from
domestic contractors because domestic preference of 15% was not allowed on turn-
key contracts.



- 4 -
5.05     In most Bank projects in Turkey, institutional strengthening or training
is an important component. The training component for the TEK IV Transmission
Project was to involve at least 90 individuals in network engineering and
planning and in transmission lines and substations design. Although a training
program was developed, the actual training was never implemented. Causes for
this include TEK's general lack of commitment to training and human resource
development and the overstretching of TEK's management with day-to-day
operations. Inadequate supervision of this component by the Bank contributed to
the failure of this component of the project.
6. Proiect Results
6.01     Although the overall project was completed well behind schedule, the
construction of the physical facilities can be considered a success. Apart from
the schedule delay, the transmission lines and substations were designed and
constructed with a minimum of technical problems.   Over 800 km of 380-kV
transmission lines were added to TEK's transmission network.   The associated
substations will facilitate electricity distribution to an ever-growing demand.
6.02     Out of the four main transmission lines constructed under the project,
three are located in remote and relatively sparsely inhabited areas. Two lines
(Karakaya - Osmaniye and Karakaya - Diyarbakir)  in the east and one line
(Altinkaya - Carsamba) in the Black Sea coast helped transmit power generated
from Ataturk, Karakaya and Altinkaya hydropower plants reducing the use of other
fuels.   The fourth line  (Hamitabat  - Alibeykoy)  in the northwest enabled
transmission of power generated from the new natural gas power station in
Hamitabat.    Thus,  the project  resulted  in positive  rather  than negative
environmental impact. Very limited resettlement resulted from the construction
of the lines due to their location.
6.03     The institutional objectives of the project, however, were not achieved.
The training program designed to increase TEK's technical and managerial
capability  was  never  implemented.    This  led  to  deterioration  of  TEK's
effectiveness and of its financial situation. The financial performance of TEK
and its ability to function as a viable economic organization were major
concerns. Financial management of the operation continued to be poor. Although
accounts receivable collection was improved, the progress was really minimal and
targets were not met.   The target ratio 1.0 for current assets to current
liabilities was not met during the life of the loan. TEK was unable to produce
funds from internal sources equal to 35% of the average incurred capital
expenditures during the life of the loan. Inadequate tariff adjustments coupled
with the accelerating inflation and devaluation of the Turkish Lira against major
currencies forced TEK into insolvency. Consequently, the estimated 6.14% rate
of return on the (1986-91) time-slice of the power system's investment program
of which the project was a part falls short of the 11.2% rate of return estimated
at appraisal.    Further the first audit  in 1988 by a private auditor of
international repute (Price Waterhouse) revealed major difficulties in TEK's
accounts.
6.04     TEK and the Government began addressing these issues from 1991 in the
context of the TEK Restructuring Project.   The measures include, inter alia,
implementation of a comprehensive financial management improvement program in TEK
and preparation annually of TEK's corporate performance plan mutually agreed
between TEK and the Government.



-5-
7. Bank Performance
7.01     The Bank was involved actively in the preparation as well as the design
of the project. The training of TEK's staff in network operations and management
under the project was intended to complement the larger institutional building
efforts initiated under the TEK Transmission III Project.
7.02     The Bank monitored the project implementation on a very regular basis.
However, even when loan disbursements were well below the planned disbursement
curve and the project was behind schedule, the project was rated as having no
problems. During the early phase of implementation, the Bank should have been
making recommendations that could have had positive results in the latter phases.
7.03     Procurement was a problem in the TEK Transmission III Project, and the
procurement plan was not being achieved on the TEK IV project. Yet it was not
until early 1988, some three years into project implementation and one year after
all contracts were to have been awarded, that the subject of standardized bid
documents was raised. In the PCR for the TEK III Project, TEK commented that
seminars for "Procurement of Works" should be held in the early days of project
implementation so that both the Bank and TEK management could better understand
each other and the project requirements and restrictions.
7.04     Training was considered an important project component.  TEK did not
attach much importance to training and was nine months late in submitting its
initial training program for Bank review and approval. However, the Bank was
negligent in responding to TEK. A formal response to TEK's proposed program was
sent some eleven months after submittal, and only after five requests from TEK
asking for comments. The Bank must take care that its own internal procedures
and staffing reorganizations do not impose untimely, and unacceptable, delays on
the Borrower's attempts to maintain schedule
8. Performance of the Borrower and Guarantor
8.01     From a technical standpoint, the project was implemented satisfactorily
by TEK and its consultant ELTEM-TEK.   Despite the two year delay in project
completion, there was little adverse impact on TEK's ability to deliver power
from its generation facilities to its load centers.
8.02     TEK and the Government did not display the hoped for commitment to the
institutional aspects of the project. Training, which can have positive long
term impacts on the organization's capabilities, was never implemented. With
regard to financial aspects of TEK, hopes of improvement were raised from the
significant increases to TEK's tariffs and capital prior to release of the second
tranche of the Energy Sector Adjustment Loan (ESAL, Ln.2856-TU) in March 1988.
However, the increase of TEK's tariffs and capital (which was not paid until
1989) was soon eroded by the onset of high inflation in 1988 and 1989.
8.03     The financial condition of TEK and the entire power sector was adversely
affected by electricity tariffs which did not reflect the economic cost of
supply, nor fully cover the financial obligations. As a result, TEK was unable
to meet the agreed financial performance targets at anytime during the project
implementation.



- 6 -
8.04     Although tariffs are not fully under its direct control, TEK should have
taken greater responsibility for those financial decisions that were within its
purview, namely, preparation of reasonable investment programs, implementation
of financial action plans to address deficiencies in accounts receivables and
foreign debt service, and auditing of financial statements.
9. Consulting Services
9.01     The engineering and project management services provided by ELTEM-TEK
were satisfactory. Through the TEK Transmission III Project, ELTEM-TEK gained
extensive experience in design and construction supervision of EHV transmission
systems. Foreign consultants were not utilized on this project.
10. Findings and Lessons
10.01    The immediately apparent causes of the problems that beset the project
may be summarized as follows: (i) failure to use standardized bid documents; (ii)
lack of coordination among the TEK departments concerned; (iii) lack of local
funds; (iv) lack of commitment on the part of TEK's management to the technical
assistance objectives of the project; (v) lack of a strategy for the development
and deployment of TEK's human resources, and for overcoming the problem of
freeing TEK's middle managers from their day-to-day tasks to enable them to
devote time to improving the structure and organization of their jobs.
10.02    The more fundamental reasons for these deficiencies, however, must be
sought in the lack of commitment by TEK's top and middle managers to the need to
define and take charge of the institutional efforts needed to improve the
performance of TEK as a whole and of its administration and financial management
in particular.   This in turn may be attributed to TEK's lack of autonomy in
establishing its personnel and financial strategies and, in particular, in
recruiting and retaining qualified managers and staff on a competitive basis.
It is unlikely that these problems can be overcome without partial or total
transfer of TEK's activities to one or several corporations functioning
independently from the Government and in accordance with normal commercial
principles within a framework of parameters defined by an independent regulatory
authority.
10.03    The lessons to be learned from this lending operation are that project
implementation and institution building efforts will not be successful unless the
borrower takes charge and there is a firm and continuing commitment on the part
of both the borrower and the Government to the agreed goals.   Also, Bank
supervision needs to devote much more attention than was done for this project
to the implementation not only of the physical aspects of projects, but also of
institution building components.
10.04    The Bank should have worked more closely with the Borrower in the
initial project phase to develop a coherent and consistent project procurement
plan and to develop concise and complete bidding documents, either as
standardized bidding documents if the project can be so structured or as
individual bidding documents for major contract packages. The Bank should also
have relied more on upfront actions critical to project implementation and on
measures such as TEK's annual corporate performance plan (introduced under the
ongoing TEK Restructuring Project) requiring TEK's and the Government's
acknowledgement of and agreement to their respective responsibilities and
obligations towards achieving the targeted performance objectives.

6. Project Results
A. Direct Benefits
New physical facilities enabled TEK to evacuate power from new generating plants
to the areas of ever increasing demand. Over 800 km of 380-kV transmission lines
were added to the TEK system.  The increase in substation capacity supported
power transmission and provided more reliable interconnection capability.
