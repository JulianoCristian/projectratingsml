The Bank is pleased to inform you that, after due consideration, it has agreed to your request to

$3,000,000 from the Loan, and the commitment charges on such amount cease to accrue from December 6, 
2001.

“Section 2.03. The Closing Date shall be December 31, 2002, or such later date as the Bank shall 
establish. The Bank shall promptly notify the Borrower of such later date.”
