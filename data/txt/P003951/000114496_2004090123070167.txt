Dear Mr. Minister:

We refer to the Loan Agreement (Kalimantan Urban Development Project) between 
the Republic of Indonesia (the Borrower) and the International Bank for Reconstruction 
and Development (the Bank), dated April 6, 1995, as amended.  We also refer to the 
Ministry of Finance’s letter dated January 8, January 29, and February 7, 2001,

The Bank is pleased to inform you that, after due consideration, it has agreed 
to your request to amend the Loan Agreement, as set forth below. Furthermore, in 
accordance with your request and pursuant to Section 6.03 of the General Conditions,

from the Loan, and the commitment charges on such amount cease to accrue from January 
29, 2001.  In addition, the Bank cancels, as of February 19, 2001, the amount of US 
dollars 138,053.84 from category 1(a) due to misprocurement as conveyed in the Bank’s 
letter on the same date.
