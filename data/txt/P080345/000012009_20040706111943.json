         outcomes, likely sustainability, and modest institutional\n            development impacts. Main lessons highlight the\n            international community's immediate reaction to soften\n            the crisis' social and economic impacts, and to avoid a\n            severe shortfall of financing, as key to success. The\n            challenge was to combine the quick-disbursement process,\n            with adequate tracking of the use of credit proceeds,\n            despite cumbersome administrative procedures that slowed the\n            process, that potentially could undermine the impact on\n            beneficiaries. Moreover, the participatory approach enhanced\n            Government's commitment, which facilitated - from\n            inception to closure - the dialogue in particular, and,\n            cooperation during the project's implementation. Other\n            lessons reinforce the value of nongovernmental\n            organizations' involvement in project implementation,\n            and, the need to find the right balance between challenging\n            objectives, and limited implementation capacity, in a\n            country just emerged from crisis."}, "docdt": "2004-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
