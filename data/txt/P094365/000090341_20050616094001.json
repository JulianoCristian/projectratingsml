Development\n            Loan for Guatemala is part of a programmatic series of three\n            to four Development Policy Loans (DPLs) intended to support\n            the fundamentals and three main pillars of the\n            government's development plan Vamos Guatemala. Within\n            this framework, it focuses on actions aimed at improving the\n            business and investment climate, creating fiscal space for\n            greater social investment and achieving key milestones in\n            improving the fiduciary environment. Other key areas for\n            growth identified in education, health and nutrition and\n            rural infrastructure are supported within the CAS program\n            through investment operations, which build on the ongoing\n            portfolio of interventions in these areas. Future DPL\n            operations are expected to focus more intensively on the\n            growth agenda (trade, investment climate, public private\n            partnerships, access to credit by SME) while maintaining\n            attention to transparency and efficiency in public spending."}, "docdt": "2005-06-09T00:00:00Z"}
