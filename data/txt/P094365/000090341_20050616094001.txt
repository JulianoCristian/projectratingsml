Commitment Fee        0.85% on undisbursed loan amounts for the first four years, beginning 60
                      days after the loan agreement is signed, and 0.75% on undisbursed loan
                      balances thereafter.
Front-End Fee         1%of the loan amount.
Tranching             Single tranche for the full amount of the loan, minus the front-end fee.
Objectives            The proposed Programmatic DevelopmentLoan is part of a programmatic
                      series of three to four DPLs intended to support the fundamentals and
                      three main pillars of the government's development plan "Vamos
                      Guatemala". Within this framework, it focuses on actions aimed at
                      improvingthe businessand investment climate, creating fiscal space for
                      greater social investment and achieving key milestones in improving the
                      fiduciary environment. Other key areas for growth identified in education,
                      health and nutrition and rural infrastructure are supported within the CAS
                      program through investment operations, which build on the ongoing
                      portfolio of interventions in these areas. Future DPLoperations are
                      expected to focus more intensively on the growth agenda (trade,
                      investment climate, public private partnerships, access to credit by SME)
                      while maintaining attention to transparency and efficiency in public
                      spending.
Description           The first loan of the program will focus on policy and institutional aspects
                      related to broad-based growth and supports actions in three areas: (i)
                      promoting growth and improvingthe investment climate, especially by
                      focusing on trade, (ii) enhancing fiscal space for priority investment, and
                      (iii)achievinggreatertransparencyandpublicsectormodernization.
Benefits              The key benefits expected from the program are:
                          Meetingfiscal needs: Board approval of this loan and its related
                           disbursement would not only help the government to meet its
                           objective o f diversifying financing sources but to secure financing on
                          more favorable terms. This would support the government's goal of
                          fiscal stabilization and efficient spending.
                          Endorsement of sound policy and vehiclefor dialogue: The DPL
                           would secure overall continuity of the Bank's policy dialogue with
                          Guatemala, strengthening the Bank's reputation as a reliable
                          development partner.
Risks                 The operation is subject to four main risks during the implementation of
                      the DPL series:
                          Political gridlock, given a divided Congress which creates obvious
                          risks for the timely passageand subsequent implementation of the

                      *   Government's legislative agenda,
                          Societal tensions related to the country's post-conflict status,
                          especially around controversial areas like continued trade
                          liberalization, promotion of increased private participation in

                      *   infrastructure, and issues surrounding property rights and land,
                          Exogenous shocks related to natural disasters, which could
                          necessitateunanticipated spending for emergency assistanceand
                          reconstruction, and
                      D   Shocks related to a deteriorating external environment,(e.g., low

                                   I.CountryContext

1.     With a multi-ethnic population of about 12.6 million and a per-capita GDP of
about $2,200, Guatemala i s the largest economy in Central America. While a source of
cultural strength and rich historical heritage, Guatemala's ethnic diversity has also
unfortunately been accompanied by a pattern of conflict and exclusion since colonial
times. In the latter half of the 20thcentury, long-standing socio-political and economic
tensions sparked a debilitating 36-year civil war, which endedin 1996with the signingof
a set of Peace Accords between government and guerrilla leaders, following protracted
negotiations. The Peace Accords marked an important turning point in Guatemala's
development.     In addition to ending the armed conflict, they aimed to reverse the
country's historically exclusionary pattern of social and economic development, setting
national targets in four main areas: (i)  resettlement, reincorporation and reconciliation,
(ii)human development, (iii)productive and sustainable development, and, (iv)
modernization of the state and improved governance. Inthe nine years since the signing
of the Accords, progress towards achievement of the specific targets contained therein
has been uneven, with major gains in some areas (e.g., reductions in the military,
decentralization, coverage of social and basic services) but slower-than-hoped-for
progress in others (accelerating economic growth, raising tax revenues to 12% of GDP,
landregistrationhedistribution andreducing crimehiolence).

2.     Poverty and Millennium Development Goals.                Largely as a result of the
country's historical legacy, about 56 percent of all Guatemalans lived in poverty in 2000
and about 16 percent in extreme poverty. Although poverty fell during the 1990s, when
real GDP growth rates reached4 percent or about 1.4 percent per capita on average, this
positive trend almost certainly deteriorated in the first years of the new millennium, given
an economic slowdown (2001-2003) associated with a series of economic shocks (see
below).    Besides high levels of income poverty, Guatemala's social indicators in
education, health and nutrition are also very poor, often falling below the indicators
observed in countries with substantially lower per-capita incomes. For example, the
World Bank 2003 Poverty Assessment indicates that despite significant improvements in
primary enrollments over the last decade, the average schooling of the adult (14+)
population in 2001 was 4.3 years, compared to 4.4 years averaged by low income
countries. Guatemala's healthoutcomes are also unsatisfactory: life expectancy at birthis
65 years, compared with 69 years on average for lower middle income countries, and
infant and maternal mortality rates are high at 40-45 per thousand and 270 per 100,000
respectively. Perhaps most alarmingly, malnutrition rates among Guatemalan children
are very poor-based    on the height-for-age measure, some 44 percent of children aged
under five years were stunted at the start of the decade, with four-fifths of the
malnourished children coming from poor, indigenous households.

3.      In order to reduce extreme poverty by half between 2000 and 2015 and thus
accomplish the first of the Millennium Development Goals, Guatemala needs to
significantly accelerate economic growth as well as ensure that the benefits of growth
reach the poor. Calculations presented in the Bank's recent Country Economic
Memorandum (CEM) indicate that to meet the extreme poverty MDG by 2015, the
economy needs to grow at a per capita rate of at least 2.4 percent or approximately 5
percent per annum in real terms. In addition to growth, it is critical to increase public
spending on human development and infrastructure investments that facilitate the
participation of the poor inthe growth process.

           11. Economic ContextandRecentMacroeconomicPerformance

4.      Despite its political troubles over the past several decades, Guatemala has been
relatively stable from a macroeconomic standpoint over most of that period -
experiencing far less volatility and lower inflation compared with regional averages.
With respect to growth, however, the Guatemalan economy has performed more poorly
than the rest of the region, with an especially poor record in the 1980s, when per capita
income declined drastically due to regional macroeconomic instability and the
intensification of Guatemala's civil war. In the 1990s, the Guatemalan economy posted
an annual average growth rate of slightly over 4 percent per annum (1.4 percent per
capita). While this pace was a dramatic improvement over the previous decade, it was
nonetheless a somewhat disappointing outcome given high growth expectations
following the cessation of the civil war in 1996 and major structural reform efforts-in
trade and financial sector liberalization, private participation in telecommunications and
power and increased spending and policy improvements in education and health-
ongoing since the mid-1980s.        Since 1999, growth rates once again declined and
remained low, falling below the population growth rate during 2001-03, with probable
negative repercussions on the country's already-high poverty rates, as noted above
(CEM, 2004).

5.      Slow growth in Guatemala in theperiod 2001-03, in contrast with developments
elsewhere in LAC, was due both to external and internal factors.             Internally, the
investment climate was negatively affected by a widespread lack of confidence in the
former government associated with unpredictable changes in public policy, deterioration
ingovernanceanda weakening of the rule of law-which,          inturn, gave rise to an intense
conflict between the Government and significant segments of the private sector.
Moreover, the perception of widespread corruption in the last 2 years of the previous
administration and the relaxation of fiscal discipline in 2003 (an election year) also
adversely affected Guatemala's image at home and abroad. On the external front, the
terms of trade were negatively affected, mainly through a drastic and long-lived collapse
in the world price of coffee. Export revenues from this crop fell from close to $580
million in 1999 to $268 million in 2002, with a severe impact on the nearly 600,000
Guatemalans directly and indirectly involved in the coffee business prior to the price
decline. Rising oil prices following 9/11 have also tended to depress growth. Inaddition,
recessionin the U.S. and other trading partners in the 2000-02 period resulted in falling




                                              2

demand for Guatemalan exports (e.g., muquilu products) and affected manufacturing
activity through investor sentiment and other channels.

6.       External balance. Slow growth in exports is a key factor in explaining the
sizeable trade imbalance of recent years, financed mainly by rapidly-growing workers
remittances. The latter stood at 8.5 percent of GDP in 2003 and are expectedto continue
to rise inthe mediumterm. The improvement inthe trade/GDP ratio since 1991has been
largely the result of the rapidgrowth of imports, which i s at the root of Guatemala's large
trade imbalances. As shown in Table 1, exports as a share of GDP continued to account
for less than 20 percent of GDP in 2001, with little improvement since the early 1990s.
However, the aggregate numbers hide important changes in the structure of exports, with
a booming muquilu sector and a dynamic non-traditional agriculture export sector (e.g.,
flowers, seasonal vegetables, fruits and organic crops) yielding a more diversified trade
basket. The current account deficit has been declining since 2001, but it remains high at
about 4.3 percent of GDP at end 2004 and the latest estimates show an average current
account deficit of 3.9 percent of GDP for the rest of the CAS period. Overall, however,
Guatemala's external position remains stable. Due to the lack of good quality balance of
payments data in Guatemala, it is hard to infer from historical figures how much of the
current account has actually been financed by debt creating flows, as an important share
of private sector financing is believed to be unreported remittances and FDI. Inaddition,
there are no obvious signs of balance of payments instability in Guatemala, as the
international reserves position is currently very strong (equal to 5 months of imports in
2004) and the total external debt (includingprivate sector) remains at manageablelevels.

7.      Fiscal trends. Since the 1980s, Guatemala has established a solid record of
responsible fiscal management.             The country's ratio of public debt to GDP has
consistently remained one of the lowest in LAC and i s currently below 20 percent (see
Annex 2 for more information on debt, including external private debt). Total public
spending exhibited a marked increase after the Peace Accords, rising from around 9
percent of GDP in 1994-96 to 13 percent in 1999 but the ratio slipped again in 2003-04.
The share to the social sectors has also risen considerably over the past 8 years, but much
more is needed for key investments to reduce poverty and support economic growth.
This, inturn, requires a considerably higher level of revenues in order to be sustainable.
Thus far, successive governments have faced an uphill battle in their efforts to raise
revenues up to the 12 percent Peace Accords target. Powerful vested interests have



                                                     3

consistently opposed tax initiatives in Congress or, in some instances, launched
successful court challenges to achieve the strike down of taxes approved by the
legislature. After some progress in 2000-02inraisingthe tax/GDP ratio, the ratio slipped
again in 2003 as the courts overturned some key corporate taxes and a tax on petroleum
products and derivatives.

8.       Future challenges. Guatemala's medium-term challenge i s to boost growth, push
ahead with poverty reduction and address dismal social indicators. As discussed in a
recent Country Economic Memorandum, CEM (June 2004) prepared by the Bank, this
will require the creation of fiscal space to strengthen key public investment programs
(mainly in the social sectors and infrastructure), deepen some o f the reforms o f recent
years (including in strengthening the investment climate and public institutions), while
maintaining sound macroeconomic management. Inter alia, this agenda will likely
require stronger revenue measures to facilitate an increase in funding for critical
investments, while improving the effectiveness and targeting o f spending.

9.      Recent Developments. The current (Berger) administration came into office in
early 2004 with a strong commitment to pursue compliance with the Peace Accords,
while at the same time taking strong steps to attack corruption and improve the
investment climate for growth. Duringits first year, much of its energies inthe economic
sphere had to focus on addressing serious fiscal troubles, as a Constitutional Court
decision inearly 2004 struck down the presumptive income tax, the Zmpuesto a Empresas
Mercantiles y Agricolas (IEMA) which, in 2003, had generatedabout half of all revenues
from enterprises (subsequently, in late 2004, the Court also struck down a tax on
petroleum and derivatives). These decisions, coupled with large spending commitments
by the outgoing administration, led to tax collection and fiscal deficit projections for 2004
of under 9 percent of GDP and 4.5 percent of GDP. To address this impending crisis, the
government worked to obtain consensus on drastic actions on both the expenditure and
revenue fronts. On the former, it enacted substantial expenditure cuts (3 percent in
nominal terms) in all areas of the budget, with the exception of spending on education,
health, and housing, which grew by about 4 percent. The cuts included an unprecedented
reduction in the military by one-third (about 12,000 personnel) and a significant
downsizing of the civil service (by about 20 percent). On the revenue side, the
Government developed a package of tax policy reforms for Congressional approval in
mid-2004 and simultaneously began to address weaknesses in tax administration and
enforcement. The tax package met with only partial success in Congress, where it was
watered down in a number of areas. These reductions were, however, offset by a better-
than-expected outcome under the tax administration and, especially, enforcement, effort.
B y end 2004, net revenue stood at 10.3 percent of GDP, unchanged from 2003. The
fiscal deficit was sharply reduced to 1 percent of GDP, allowing for a small financial
surplus for the combined public sector. Public expenditures were partially financed
through a 30-year, US$330 million Eurobond issue in September 2004, which was
heavily oversubscribed at 8.125 percent. In May 2005, the Government worked with
Congress to pass a revised version of the petroleum and petroleum derivatives tax law,
which will reinstate revenueslost as a result of the 2004 Constitutional Court decision.

10.     At the core of Government's fiscal policy for the remainder of its term is a two-
pronged strategy predicated on: (i)  raising revenues towards the 12-percent target of the
Peace Accords; and (ii)  maintaining low budget deficits while raising the efficiency of
public spending. Given the compression in public spending in 2004, the Government
expects to boost its investment program in 2005 and 2006, in turn, implying somewhat
larger deficits of 1.8 and 1.6 percent of GDP, respectively. With regard to revenue
collections, the Government's strategy going forward is to continue to strengthen tax
administration and enforcement under its 106-point plan (with technical assistance from
the Fund and from the Bank, through an ongoing tax administration project). Over the
next several months, the plan i s to engage a wide range of interest groups inround table
discussions on social priorities-including   the challenges and spending requirements of
achieving the MDGs-and       the sources of funding available to meet them. In addition,
the Government i s continuing its efforts to vigorously attack corruption and improve the
impact and transparency of public expenditures (with support from the Bank's Integrated
Financial Management Project and an ongoing PER). This, inter alia, should help build



                                             5

confidence in the fiduciary role of the Government in the use of public funds and,
consequently, reduce opposition to a new tax effort. Finally, as part of its regional
integration objectives, the Government expects to work with its Central American
neighbors to harmonize taxes and duties.

 11.    Growth Outlook. The overall outlook for economic growth improved with the
incoming Berger Administration due both to the government's anti-corruption, pro-
business stance and a favorable international context. In 2004 real GDP growth reached
2.7 percent (just above population growth rates for the first time in 3 years). This
improved but still- modest growth rate, despite the turnaround in the investment climate
in 2004, was due to risingoil prices, continued low coffee prices (untilthe last quarter of
2004 when they began to recover) and delays in the execution of the government's
investment plan during the first months of 2004. Looking ahead, the potential ratification
of the free trade agreement with the U.S. (DR-CAFTA), and the deepening of regional
integration efforts that the Berger administration has been leading within Central
America, offer significant opportunities for attracting new investment andfostering trade-
led growth, particularly if they are accompanied by complementary reforms. Clearly,
higher growth levels of the magnitude needed to meet Peace Accords targets require a
resumption of reforms as outlined in the Bank's recent CEM, particularly those related to
strengthening governance (including contract enforcement and protection of property
rights), the regulatory framework (for PPP and labor), and the competitiveness agenda
(including    educationhuman development, infrastructure,         finance   and regional
integration). Many of these are addressed in the Government's plan for economic and
social reactivation -Vamos Guatemala! discussedbriefly below.

                    111.GovernmentPrioritiesandDevelopmentPlan

12.     The current Government, in office since 2004, has demonstrated considerable
commitment to the achievement of national goals established in the 1996 Peace Accords
inthe politicalandhumanrights, as well as socio-economic, spheres. Its mainemphases
include fighting corruption, enhancing security and reactivating broad-based economic
growth (stagnant inthe 2001-2003 period) as a means of reducing poverty and inequality.
Its policy document, Vamos Guatemala! (Let's go, Guatemala!), was launched in August
2004 and lays out an ambitious program for building social solidarity, competitiveness
and trust (chart 1).

13.     As shown below, Vamos Guatemala comprises four main areas for action during
the remainder of the Berger Administration's term. At the base are a set of fundamentals
aimed at addressing the foundations of the national development program which
comprise: a stable macroeconomic framework, security (including both citizen security
with respect to crime and violence and legal security-access to speedy justice); and
improved governance and public sector institutions. Resting on this foundation are three
strategic pillarsas follows:

    0   Guate Solidaria - aimed at promoting social solidarity, reduced inequality and
        greater economic integration through strengthening social protectiodnutrition
        programs for vulnerable groups, accelerating investments in education and health


                                             6

      and development of social-economic infrastructure in indigenous and rural areas
      as a means of reducing inequality and creating opportunities;
      Guate CreceKompite - aimed at accelerating growth to above the 4 percent
      observed in the 1990s, this component of the strategy emphasizes trade
     expansion, financial sector strengthening, improved investment climate, export
     promotion, public-private partnerships for investments in housing and
      infrastructure     (principal roads, ports and airports,      renewable     energy),
     development of high potential sectors (e.g., tourism and forestry), support for
     MSMEsandgreater attention to quality standards andtechnologicalinnovation;

  0  Guate Verde - aimed at promoting sustainable development including building
     central and sub-national capacity for environmental analysis, assessment and
     monitoring, strengthening protected areas management, conserving bio-diversity
     and preservationof social andcultural heritage.
  Inaddition to the above components, and recognizingthe constraints imposedby the
  small size of the state, the Vumos Guatemala strategy formally incorporates a cross-
  cutting emphasis on the development of public-private (both business and community
  groups) partnerships across key areas of public action.

14.     The Bank's CAS for Guatemala, covering the period FY05-08, was developed
within the Vamos Guatemala program, which represents a satisfactory framework for
moving forward the Bank's core objectives of (i)    reducing poverty and inequality; and
(ii)fostering sustained, equitable growth. The strategy adopted by the Bank is to move
forward with a balanced program of roughly equal amounts of investment lending and
quick-disbursing support in the base case, the former focused on directly reducing
poverty and strengthening governance and the latter focused on reigniting equitable
growth. This document lays out the program for broad-basedgrowth to be supportedby
the DPL series, with special reference to the first loan (for US$100 million), which is
scheduledfor Board presentationinJuly 2005. The design of the DPL series draws on an
extensive body of recent analytical work undertaken by the Bank. Chief among these are
the 2003 Guatemala Poverty Assessment (GUAPA), the CEM (2004) the Investment
Climate Assessment (2004), and three ongoing studies -- the regional DR-CAFTA Study,
the Public Expenditure Review and joint CFAA-CPAR -- which are all now nearly
complete.


                  IV. Key Issues inRestoringBroad-BasedGrowth

15.    Guatemala's key challenges in restoring broad-based growth are: (i)taking
advantage of expanding trade opportunities and ensuring that SMEs can share in those
opportunities, (ii)
                  strengtheningthe climate for bothdomestic andforeign investment and
business, (iii)modernizing property rights, (iv) addressing infrastructure bottlenecks to
growth, (v) continuing to strengthen and deepen the financial sector, (vi) enhancing the
capacity for efficient and effective poverty-oriented public spending, and (vii)
strengthening public sector management and transparency. The principal issues and
government plans with respect to each of these areas are discussed further below in some
depth as they form the background to the specific actions supported by this DPL series.
Controlling the high levels of crime and violence is another key element of the effort to
promote growth in Guatemala. Issues in this area are not described here as they lie
beyond the scope of this DPL operation. It should be noted, however, that Government i s
currently working with a number of bilateral donors (including Japan, Spain and USA) to
implement an integrated strategy to address this problem, within a regional context.

A.     Trade and RegionalIntegration

16.     As noted above, the new Administration views trade expansion as a principal
driver of growth in Guatemala in the short- to medium-term and is expending
considerable political and institutional capital on expanding trade and investment
opportunities. The Guatemalan Congress ratified the US-Central America-Dominican
Republic Free TradeAgreement (DR-CAFTA) inMarch 2005, with implementation due
to follow immediately after the treaty i s ratified by the U.S. Congress. A similar
agreement is already in effect with Mexico and discussions are underway with Canada,
the European Union, Chile and Colombia. At the same time, Guatemala i s spearheading
regional integration efforts within Central America, with steps already being taken
towards a Central America customs union, through the harmonizing and simplification of



                                            8

 customs procedures with neighboring countries, most notably El Salvador and Honduras.
 To ensure that opportunities opened up by the new agreements are widely disseminated
 and to help Guatemalan businesses understand requirements to access the US and
Mexican markets, the Government i s committed to establishing an FTAManagement and
Trade Compliance Office within the next few months. It has also taken steps to facilitate
 and promote foreign investment and support quality improvements in Guatemalan
products, as discussedfurther below.

 17.    The strategy for trade expansion also assigns a central role to ensuring that the
benefits of new trade opportunities are accessible to SMEs,both directly through access
to export markets and indirectly by developing strategic linkages with FDI and local
exporting companies. As part of this initiative, steps are already being taken by the
Presidential Commission for Competitiveness (PRONACOM) to develop associations of
SME entrepreneurs (the "grupos gestores") throughout the country and to improve the
availability of market intelligence, including data on export contacts, via ajoint program
of the PRONACOM and the National Institute of Statistics (INE). In addition special
efforts are being made to reach out to indigenous entrepreneurs through the Association
of MayanEntrepreneurs and support to CECMA to create an Indigenous Competitiveness
Research Center. Finally, a network of "infocenters" with internet connectivity i s being
establishedto disseminate information throughout the country, and are expected to act as
important focal points for support to SMEs. Building on these steps, a comprehensive
strategy and operational plan for information dissemination and training to SMEs is
currently being developed and will be put into effect over the next several months.

 18.    Aware that, over time, some low income farmers and laborers are likely to be
displaced from traditional livelihoods, the government, led by the Ministry of
Agriculture, has also launched an ambitious initiative to promote alternative employment
in non-traditional agriculture, sustainable forestry and off-farm activities in sectors such
as tourism and agribusiness. In partnership with the private banking sector and groups
such as the non-traditional exporters association, Agexpront, the initiative combines
technical assistance and marketing help for micro, small and medium rural producers
with improved access to finance via the commercial banking system, through the
provision of a Government guarantee. The initiative is being supported by USAID and
other donors and will be carefully monitored to evaluate impact and implement course
corrections as necessary.

B.      InvestmentPromotionandBusinessClimate

19.     A primary focus of the Government's agenda for competitiveness is improving
the country's investment and business climate. Within this theme, an important emphasis
i s placed on reducing the costs of doing business through: (i)           simplification of
regulations and clarification of rules for dealing with customs and speeding up cargo
clearance procedures at key airports and ports; (ii)reducing red tape and
standardizingklarifying pre-investment requirements for labor, environment and other
issues with the eventual aim of creating a one-stop shop for business registrations; (iii)
strengthening of national systems for manufacturing standards and quality (with



                                             9

accredited laboratories, linked to relevant international bodies), including certification
systems established in partnership with business associations; and (iv) promoting e-
commerce. Advances have already been made in each of these areas, in part with
assistance from the Bank's Competitiveness Enhancement Project. Steps are also being
taken to build consensus for, and pass, a domestic competition law, including a system
for consumer protection.

20.     Another critical area concerns the promotion offoreign direct investment (FDZ).
A newly-established agency, Invest in Guatemala (IIG), leads this effort with assistance
from MIGA. The agency has recently finalized its promotion strategy which highlights
investments in light manufacturing, tourism, call centersbusiness process outsourcing
andagribusiness. The strategy outlines targets for new investments, job creation, indirect
employment, and the expected impact of these FDI flows on exports. In the next two
years, IIG i s seeking to effectively measure the amount of local value added. This will
set a benchmark to implement programs that increase linkages between the local private
sector and international investors operating in Guatemala to provide goods and services
that further increaselocal value added. IIGcan already point to a number of successes in
attracting foreign investments. Over the next several months, Government intends to
increase the operating autonomy of IIG, through a partnership with reputable private
sector foundation(s) operating in Guatemala.

21.     To ensureinstitutional coordination inthe competitiveness area, the Government
has created an Office of the Presidential Commissioner for the Promotion of National
Competitiveness (Pronacom) and established a system of monthly meetings between
Pronacom, the Ministry of Economy, and representatives of the private sector,
universities and civil society, to review and monitor work plans and progress achieved.
Pronacom i s part of a Central American network of government competitiveness
agencies, allowing the region to coordinate closely as it faces the challenges presentedby
the DR-CAFTA agreement. In carrying out its mandate, Pronacom has developed a
strategy of alliances with key local partners such as Agexpront and the tourism sector as
well as close connections with regional and international institutions such as INCAE, the
USDA,the WorldBank Group andthe UNsystem. Thus far, Pronacom is holding itself
to a high standard of performance, with concrete indicators in priority areas for the
private sector and DR-CAFTA. The coming into office of the Berger Government
already improvedGuatemala's World Economic Forumcompetitiveness ranking-80              out
of 104 countries in 2004 versus 89 out of 102 in 2003-largely          reflecting increased
confidence in macroeconomic management and in public sector institutions. However,
the Government recognizes that there is clearly a long way to go to make Guatemala a
very attractive country for investors, with a supportive business environment.

22.     As part of the effort to increase the productivity of Guatemalan businesses, the
Guatemalan Government i s also emphasizing means of encouraging the adoption of new
technologies andpromoting innovation-an         area in which Guatemala is lagging badly.
In addition to the appointment of a Presidential Commissioner for Science and
Technology, the Government i s in the process of developing a program to link
universities and research centers with the private sector in order to stimulate the research



                                              10

and development process in Guatemala. Another key priority is the reform of the
national training system, led by INTECAP as a means of raising the skills level of the
labor force. The main goal is to reduce INTECAP's role from a provider of in-service
training for employees of businesses into a regulator and certifier of training programs
organized and implemented by the private sector within the firms themselves. A third
goal i s to reorient the focus of the Council of Science and Technology towards improved
technological diffusion among small- and medium-sized enterprises and expand the role
of the private sector inits advisory board. Inaddition, consideration is beinggiven to the
design of a system of incentives to promote the acquisition of new technology via capital
goods purchases, technology licensing arrangements and other appropriate mechanisms.

C.       PropertyRights

23.      Fundamental to Guatemala's growth agenda-as        well as to the achievement of
increasedsocial solidarity and a better business climate-is   the question of secure rights
to land. Over the past several years, considerable progress has been made on cadastral
surveying and regularization of land-largely      in urban, but also in rural, areas. This
progress i s threatened however by limited titling and the transitory nature of the
institutional framework. For example, inthe Department of Petenonly about a quarter of
land parcels surveyed have been titled and registered reflecting both the institutional
weaknesses of the titling entities (municipalities for urban, and FONTIERRAS for rural,
land) and the transitory nature of the current cadastral process.             While some
municipalities have started addressing the first problem by implementing creative
mechanisms to increase the number and speed of titling-e.g., reducing fees for land
adjudication or introducing gradual payment schemes-the      legal framework for cadastral
registry remains inadequate. What is neededis the full integration of the cadastreand the
registry (Regisfro de la Propiedud), as well as measures to increase the transparency and
accountability of the registry itself. Government i s now working towards passage by
Congressof a modern law of cadastreand land registry to enable expansion of the pilot to
the rest of the country. This is being given high priority by Government given that the
reform of land administration is central to Guatemala's development agenda. Indeed,
Government has set an ambitious goal of completing cadastral surveying of 75 to 80
percent of the populated land area by the endof its term.

D.      Infrastructure

24.     On the supply side of the economy, the Government's growth strategy places
strong emphasis on increased investments in infrastructure (roads, ports and airports,
telecommunication and ICTs and renewable energy), through developing public-private
partnershipsfor both financing and implementation. As a first priority, the Government
has proposed a series of large infrastructure projects in the transport sector to be
implemented viapublicprivate partnerships. These include: link roads in the northern
and Pacific corridors, a link road connecting the Atlantic and Pacific ports, a partial
metropolitan beltway for Guatemala City and the construction of a freeway from
Guatemala City to El Rancho. To establish an adequate legal basis for this effort, the
Government intendsto present a framework law (and associated sectoral laws) for public-

private partnerships and/or concessions to the Congress in 2005 as well as a law
facilitating private participation in the construction of a major northern link-road
connecting some of the poorest areas of the country.

25.     Efforts are also underway to establish partnerships with the private sector to
improve management of key infrastructure such as airports and ports. One step already
taken with respect to the main international airport in Guatemala City (La Aurora) has
been to establish a management committee comprised of users (including airlines, cargo
companies, the tourism agency etc.) and representatives of the civil aviation authority for
better management of the airport. The committee, in collaboration with the civil aviation
authority, will oversee the upgrading of airport facilities and operation in accordance with
a master plan which nearing completion. Action i s also being undertaken to upgrade
Guatemala's USFAA ranking to Category Ithrough a program of strengthening the civil
aviation authority. This would enable direct flights (both cargo and passenger) to U.S.
destinations by Guatemalan carriers. Government's efforts with respect to seaports
during 2004 and early 2005 focused on upgrading their security certification to
international standards. With this achieved, the focus i s now on improving the efficiency
of operations at Puerto Santo Tomas, the country's publicly-run main Atlantic sea port,
through establishment of a privately-operated cargo handling and warehouse facility.

26.     Over the past decade, Guatemalamade huge strides in access to telephones due to
the telecommunicationsprivatization and liberalization reforms program implementedby
the end of the 1990s. The number of fixed lines has risen from 400,000 to one million;
and cellular phones, from 30,000 to 1.2 million. These improvements were due largely to
changes in the legal and regulatory framework and institutions (Le., the Superintendencia
de Telecomunicaciones or SIT) that stimulated private sector competition and investment
as well as the establishment of a universal access program (Le., FONDETEL) to stimulate
private sector investment inpublic payphones in ruralareas. Nevertheless telecom access
in Guatemala-especially in rural areas-remains         among the lowest in the region, and
this will continue to be the case without additional incentives despite growth of cell
phone networks. The Berger administration is committed to stimulating increasedprivate
sector investment in telecommunications and information technologies (ICTs) by
updating the legal and regulatory framework to make it consistent with DR-CAFTA, to
take into account market and technological innovations and to encourage the use of ICTs
to improve governance, delivery of services and increase the competitiveness of
Guatemala's economy. In order to address the growing urban-rural "digital divide",
FONDETEL adopted a rural access strategy that uses output-based aid (OBA)
mechanisms aimed at fostering private sector provision to each municipality of at least
one internet access point that enables local governments, NGOs, private sector and
operators broad band access to the internet and to ensure that all rural localities have at
least one public payphone. Implementation of the rural access strategy i s already
underway and the strategy is being incorporated into a broader Information Society
Strategy which aims at determining priorities for the national broad-band internet
network. This effort i s beingsupported by IBRD andWBI.

E.       FinancialSector Strengthening

27.      Guatemala has made significant progress in its financial sector reform program
following a banking crisis in 2001. At the core of the reform program is a package of
five financial sector laws approved by Congress between October 2001 and April 2002:
Monetary Law, Banking and Financial Groups Law, Bank Supervision Law, Central
Bank Law, and Money Laundering Law. These laws addresseda number of deficiencies
in the financial sector legal framework identifiedby the 2000 FSAP. Inparticular, they
aimed at the following: (i)reformof the monetary policy legal framework for the conduct
of monetary and financial policy, including the capitalization of the Central Bank, (ii)
reform of the financial sector legal framework aimed at strengtheningthe regulation of
financial groups and creating an orderly market exit mechanism, enhancing credit risk
management, and increasing access to financing, (iii) of bank supervision legal
                                                        reform
framework aimed at strengthening the autonomy of the Superintendent of Banks and its
legal and institutional capacity to supervise financial groups, and raise banking sector
regulation towards international standards, and (iv) enactment of legislation to prevent
money laundering to reduce illegal activities and comply with international norms. In
addition, the reform program contemplates the consolidation of the banking system
through restructuring or closure of insolvent banks, and through mergers and
acquisitions, usingthe restructuringmechanism of the new banking law.

28.      These reforms have contributed to making the banking system better able to
withstand external shocks and facilitate growth. Infact, Guatemala'sfinancial sector has
strengthened substantially since 2000, due to improvements in the prudential regulatory
framework and stepped-up onsite inspections, although the situation of the banks i s still
fragile due to the low level of provisions and excessive amount of related lending. The
authorities have made progress in the licensing, supervision and registration of financial
conglomerates, including offshore banks which are now required to be part of licensed
conglomerates in order to operate. With assistance from a Bank TA loan, Guatemala i s
also implementing a significantly strengthenedanti-money laundering (AML) regime.

29.      To complete the modernization of the financial sector legal framework, the
Government has recently submitted to Congress a package of five bills of law and is
working in the preparation of another nine bills that should be ready for submission to
Congress later this year. The five bills recently submitted are: (i)   The Law Against
Funding of Terrorism, which would make it a crime to fund terrorist activities.
Enactment of this law was a commitment taken by Guatemala when the Financial Action
Task Force (FATF) excluded Guatemala from the list of non-cooperating countries and
territories in July 2004; (ii)  The Complementary Law for the Strengthening of the
Banking System, which, among other things, would remove tax impediments to the sale
of assets among banks and income generated by trusts; (iii) Microfinance Law,
                                                                The
which would allow non-bank financial intermediaries to operate as lenders under
regulation and supervision by the Superintendent of Banks; and (iv) The Law of
Reciprocal Guarantees, which would provide the basis for the establishment of
associations that would provide collateral for its member companies to facilitate access to
credit; and (v) The Law of Movable Guarantees, which would facilitate the use and



                                            13

 repossessionof non-traditional collateral, to facilitate access to credit. This new package
 of financial sector laws aims to increase prudent lending to groups and enterprises today
 largely excluded from bank financing, such as micro, rural and small and medium
enterprises (SMEs). These proposedlegal reforms need to be complemented with further
reforms of the legal, judicial and bankruptcy environment that affect creditor rights and
theirjudicial enforcement. Several of these laws are supportedunder the third tranche of
the ongoing FSAL, with the remainderincluded in the proposedDPL series. Inaddition,
it is necessary to continue to strengthen the capacity of the Superintendent towards
implementation of Basle II-like supervision-analysis       of bank risks and implementation
of risk-based consolidated supervision-though         not necessarily involving an explicit
change towards that framework inthe immediate future.

30.     In addition to further strengthening of the legal framework, there are also a
number of other important outstanding issues in the banking sector that Government is
addressing as a matter of priority. These include: (i) provisions in offshore banks,
                                                          low
(ii) presenceofillegaloffshorebanksoperatinginGuatemala(actionstodealwith
     the
several of these are underway), (iii) weaknesses in selected banks, (iv) the high levels of
related party lending throughout the banking system and (v) modernization of the
payments system (a new electronic system i s already being piloted by Banguat and will
be implementedshortly).

F.      EnhancingCapacityfor Priority Spending

31.     A key element of the Government's growth agenda - particularly the effort to
increase the "inclusiveness" of growth - is the objective of increasing public spending in
key areas such as human development (education, health and nutrition) and on rural
economic infrastructure. Government has adopted a two-fold strategy for the
achievement of progress towards this objective: (i)concerted effort to raise tax
collections which are still considerably short of the target of 12% of GDP established in
the Peace Accords; and (ii)   improving the efficiency of public expenditures by shifting
allocations to priority sectors and strengthening budgeting processes in ways intendedto
improve the use of resourcesby these key sectors. The Government faces tough hurdles
with respectto achievementof the first of these elements. As notedearlier, to achieve the
Peace Accords tax target, the Government will need to overcome opposition to tax
increases from interests on both the right and the left, with the former arguing against
direct taxes on the grounds of losing competitiveness and the latter opposed to increases
in the VAT on the grounds of regressivity. While reallocation of resources within the
available envelope i s more amenable to Government's political will, here, too, significant
obstacles are imposed by constitutional and other legal mandates which earmark
approximately 30% of revenues, leaving very little room for maneuver. The following
paragraphsprovide some detail with respect to Government efforts to date and its plans in
each of these areas.

32.     As discussed in some detail in the section on Economic Context (paras 9-10), a
key goal for the Berger administration when it came into office in early 2004 was to
restore tax revenues to their 2003 levels (10.3% of GDP), following setbacks in the



                                             14

Constitutional Court with respect to the IlEMA (tax on gross corporate revenues). This
was achieved via: (i)     passage in mid-2004 by Congress of a package of tax policy
reforms; and (ii)  substantially strengthenedtax performance. InMay 2005, a revised law
on petroleum and petroleum derivatives taxes was also passed to replace a previous law
inthis area, which was struck downby the Constitutional Court in2004.

33.      Further progress on raising tax revenues remains a significant challenge in
Guatemala, but one to which the Government remains firmly committed. Aware of still-
substantial resistanceto a stronger tax effort, the Government has launched a campaign to
promote public awareness and spearhead a national dialogue on the country's social
objectives and needs, define their costs, and build consensus on the appropriate role for
the public sector in achieving them. Another key element of its strategy is to continue to
strengthen and modernize tax enforcement as a means of raising revenues, within existing
tax policy. To accomplish this, Government is focusing on rapid implementation of its
 106 point tax administration plan, developed with assistance from the IMF and the
Bank's Tax AdministrationProject, which, inter alia, emphasizes improvement of VAT
collections through requiringelectronic filing of VAT tax reports by the largest taxpayers
and institutinga system of computerized cross-checks to control payments. Inparallel,
Government expects to work with local governments and the Congress to promote
revisions to the municipal tax code to enable increases in property tax revenues, in part
through provision of greater autonomy to the municipalities to set appropriate property
tax rates.

34.      With respect to increasing spending efficiency, the Government has committed to
continue to increasethe share of the social sectors inthe total budget, increasing spending
by at least a full 1 percent of GDP from its 2004 level.           This level would imply
expenditures on the social sectors of around half of total public spending and well over
half of 2004 revenues. Inaddition, Government i s committedto strengthening budgetary
processes in order to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of core ministries. The
Government took a significant leap towards enhancedplanning and accountability in key
sectors with the introduction in 2005 of agreements among MFP, SEGEPLAN and four
major Ministries (Education, Health, Agriculture and Infrastructure, Communications and
Housing) to adopt aresults-based and multi-annual approach to budgeting.The process
has been undertaken under a well-designed plan that has resulted in the early
communication of institutional budget ceilings to improve the formulation process, and
that is likely to result soon in a formal medium-term expenditure framework. To validate
and sustain what i s by nature a long-term endeavour, a gradual approach is being
adopted. It i s expected that the 2006 budget will include results-based allocations for key
programs in at least two of the four pilot Ministries, with extension of the approach to all
four pilot Ministries for the 2007 budget cycle.

35.      In addition to the above efforts to strengthen the efficiency and quality of public
spending, the Government is continuing its efforts to vigorously attack corruption and
improve the impact and transparency of public expenditures (with support from the
Bank's Integrated Financial Management Project, and the ongoing PER and Country
Fiduciary Assessment). This, inter alia, should help build confidence in the fiduciary
role of the Government inthe use of public funds and, consequently, reduce opposition to


                                              15

a new tax effort. This is discussed further below, in the section on transparency and
public sector management.

G.      Transparency and PublicSector Management

36.     The Vamos Guatemala plan highlights the need for improved governance,
enhanced law and order and public sector management as means of forging higher levels
of trust between government and the public and in enhancing investment climate. In
addition to the Government's well-publicized anti-corruption efforts and indictments and
the development of a comprehensive strategy for reducing crime and violence, a major
thrust in this regard is on improving the quality and transparency of public expenditure
management through the continuing modernization of budgeting, financial management
and procurement practices.

37.     At the center of the financial management reform initiated in 1996 is the
integratedfinancial management system (SZAF),whose module for standardizedbudget
formulation and execution is operating in 43 central government entities -including the
Congress- and 20 decentralized agencies. A version tailored to municipal needs
(SIAFMUNI) i s under implementation in 46 municipalities. Operation of SIAF has
increasedthe efficiency of budgeting, accounting and treasury operations, as well as their
transparency. Worth noting is the recent roll-out of an internet-accessible fiscal
transparency portal that has enhanced public access to budget execution data. The
Ministry of Finance is planning to increase operational coverage of SIAF to seven
additional agencies and at least 40 additional municipalities inthe short term.

38.     Another major step towards public expenditure transparency is the recent
successful launch of an internet-based procurement system (Guatecompras), which i s
already in use by 76 public sector agencies and around 185 municipalities. It i s expected
that further development of the system will take place in the context of a comprehensive
strategic plan for e-procurement, focusing in particular on a better interface with SIAF,
product classification and information standards, and use of data for procurement
planning. Inparallel, steps are beingtaken to strengthen capacity for procurement in key
line ministries and municipalities.

39.     The Government is also well poised to deepen the public financial management
reform process in other areas identified in the Country Fiduciary Assessment, such as (i)
enhancing transparency of budgetary documentation by further adoption of international
best practice, (ii)increasing the number of municipalities that report on a timely basis
their budget execution, debt and procurement information, (iii)strengthening the
regulatory framework for state procurement, including modernization of the normative
body and tools, (iv) developing more effective internal controls, and (v) improving
external oversight through better implementation of the government auditing system
(SAG).

                                  V. The ProposedLoan

A.      LinktoCAS

40.     The Bank Group's assistanceover FY05-08 is elaboratedin a Country Assistance
Strategy discussed by the Board in May, 2005 that proposes a strategic program of
lending and non-lending services to support the fundamentals and three main pillars of
the government's development plan "Vamos Guatemala": (i)          promote social solidarity,
reduce poverty and inequality and promote economic integration; (ii)      accelerate growth
to above the 4% observed in the 1990s; and (iii)     to ensure the environmental and social
sustainability of economic development. In terms of new lending during the FY05-08
period, the strategy adopted is to move forward with a balanced program which allows
for about half of lending to be channeledthrough a series of programmatic Development
Policy Loans focused on growth, with the other half devoted to an investment program of
interventions aimed at directly reducing inequality and poverty and continuing to
strengthen governance - all of which are also important elements of the growth agenda
(Para 11). The third pillar, related to environmental sustainability would also be
supportedunder the CAS, in part through a proposed local and rural development project,
associatedGEF grants and AAA activities.

41.     The loan proposed in this document, for a total amount of US$100 million, i s the
first in the series of three annual DPLs (US$lOO million each) in the base case of the
CAS, and i s integral to the achievement of CAS objectives. The CAS also provides for a
fourth DPL of US$120 million in FY08, provided high case triggers are met. The DPL
series draws largely on Government's own priorities as laid out in Vamos GuatemaZa,its
detailed sectoral plans and the Bank's analyses of key issues and desirable policy
directions through the GUAPA, CEM, ICA, PER and CFAA and CPAR. Within this
framework, it focuses on policy and institutional aspects related to broad-based growth
that are most amenable to support via a program of single-tranche loans. These include
actions aimed at improving the business and investment climate, creating fiscal space for
greater social investment and achieving key milestones in improving the fiduciary
environment. Other key areas for growth identified in Para 11 -- especially further
investments in education, health and nutrition and rural infrastructure -- are supported
within the CAS program through investment operations, which build on the ongoing
portfolio of interventions inthese areas.

B.      LessonsLearned

42.     The Bank has no prior experience with DPL lending in Guatemala. The most
recent experience with adjustment lendinghas been in the FinancialSector, where results
have been extremely positive to date. While a final ICR has not been conducted, the
recent CAS Completion Report found that the three-tranche FSAL has been a key part of
the effort to stabilize, strengthen and modernize Guatemala's financial sector following
the banking crisis of 2001. Importantly, commitment has remained strong despite a
change of government duringthe implementation of the FSAL and the inevitable changes
of senior officials and personnel as a result of the election. A key element of the FSAL's
success was its basis in rigorous and comprehensive analytical work, a lesson which has


                                              17

been adopted in the design of the DPL series. As noted at the outset, the design of this
DPLis firmly grounded inthe findings of the Bank's key diagnostic studies-the          Poverty
Assessment, CEM, ICA, PER and CFANCPAR (see Box A) -as                          well as specific
sectoral studies such as the regional DR-CAFTA study, the infrastructure policy note and
the findings of PPIAFfunded studies on PPP in infrastructure andtelecomms/ICTs.

C.      Design of DPL

43.     The design of this new lending approach takes into account the lessons learned
from past operations in Guatemala and the latest thinking on Development Policy
Lending.' The underlying principles of the operation are the following:

         (i) Upfrontactioninsteadofex-post conditionality:Thisloanhasbeen
        triggered by the new government's demonstrated commitment to move forward
        on the Peace Accords agenda, albeit in a difficult socio-political context; and by
        specific and significant policy actions toward those ends.

        (ii) Supportofreformprograminsteadofspecificconditionality.TheDPL
        and the programmatic approach will support a broad government reform program.
        Lack of reform progress in a specific area can be compensated with actions in
        others if the overall reformprogramremains on track.

        (iii) Aligning program loans with budgetary cycle. The proposed
        programmatic approach i s designed to become a predictable low cost source o f
        financing for the government.

Each DPL in this programmatic series o f three to four loans will be scheduled for
presentation in June or July of each calendar year, to enable the Guatemalan Government
to fully incorporate them in the budget before it i s presented to the Congress during the
thirdquarter.

D.      ProgrammaticFramework

44.     As noted above the proposed DPL i s part of a programmatic approach that
supports actions in three areas: (i)   promoting growth and improving the investment
climate, (ii) enhancing fiscal space for priority investment, and (iii)    transparency and
public sector modernization. A Letter of Development Policy i s attached (Annex 3) and
the policy framework i s included in Annex 5. Box A shows the links between analytic
work conducted by the Bank and the actions supported by the DPL. The key measures
highlighted as prior actions for this DPL are the following (see referenced paragraphs for
further details):

        Promoting Growth and Strengthening the Investment Climate

        0   Maintenance o f a stable macro-economic framework

                                                                     passage
            petroleum and petroleum derivatives taxes, and (iii)   improve tax enforcement
            (Para. 32-33)

        0   Budgetary allocations for social expenditures (Peace Accords definition)
            increased from 5% o f GDP executed in 2004 to at least 5.5% in 2005 (Para.
            34)
        Transparency and Public Sector Management
        0   Integrated Financial Management System (SIAF) operational in 43 central
            government entities -including Congress-, 20 decentralized agencies, and 46
            municipalities; and fiscal transparency portal launched to enhance public
            access to budget data (Para. 37).

        0   Transparent web-based procurement system (Guatecompras) in use in 76
            public sector agencies and 185 municipalities (Para. 38).


E.     FiduciaryAspects

45.    To document the current state o f public financial management in the country, the
Bank i s finalizing a Country Fiduciary Assessment (CFANCPAR) which indicates that
the fiduciary environment is generally adequate, as evidenced by the improvements inthe
public expenditure management systems made over the past decade and actions taken by
the current administration to increase transparency. While challenges remain, the


                                             20

government is moving ahead to further strengthen its public fiduciary control framework,
as described previously in Section II(part G). In connection to this process, the Bank i s
actively engaged in policy dialogue with the government to follow up on priorities
identifiedin the Country Fiduciary Assessment. Drawingfrom this ongoing work, certain
key actions (Annex 5) and selective milestones (Annex 6) in the context of the DPL
program have been identified to help track the public financial management reform
progress. The latter, in turn, is significantly supported by the Bank-financed Third
IntegratedFinancialManagement Project under implementation.

F.      Loan Administration

46.
(BANGUAT) denominated in US dollar^.^ BANGUAT will immediately credit the
        The Bank would disburse the loan proceeds into an account of the central bank

disbursed amounts to the Ministry of Finance Treasury Single Account ("common
fund"), thus becoming available to finance budgeted expenditures. Within a week of this
operation, the Ministry will accordingly provide the Bank with a written confirmation. If,
after deposit in BANGUAT, the proceeds of the Loan are not used as determined above
(including use for ineligible purposes as defined in the Loan Agreement), the Bank will
require the Government to promptly refundthe disallowed amount

G.      Monitoringand Evaluation Arrangements

47.     The government and the Bank will take advantage of several important data
sources to assess progress for the DPLs, including:

        Central and nonfinancial public sectorbudget monitoringfrom the Ministry of
        Finance
        NationalInstitute for Statistics reports, including a living standards survey
        planned for 2005, andannual tracking surveys
        Investment climate surveys
        Central Bankof Guatemalareports and analysis
        Reviews and analyses of laws and implementing regulations from the Bank and
        other stakeholders
       Data from key Government agencies such as Pronacom and UTJ
       Financial audits andfollow up of CPAR and CFAA recommendations
       Bank and IMFsupervision missions and reports
       CEPAL and SIECA surveys.




 Inthe context of the latest IMFcentral bank safeguards assessment, an action plan has been agreed with
BANGUAT. Moreover, BANGUAT is a participant in the Bank's Reserves Advisory and Management
Program (RAMP).



                                                 21

48.     The government of Guatemala and the Bank have agreed to monitor progress in
the DPL program regularly, including at the annual reviews of CAS progress, when
revisions to the scale and timing of the Bank's lending program can be undertaken.
Discussions will be held with the Ministry of Finance, the main counterpart agency for
the loan, who will be in charge of M&E for the loan and for collecting from the
appropriate sources the data necessaryto assess implementation progress. Other agencies
that will play an important role in this process are the Central Bank (for financial sector
issues), the Ministry of Economy and the Commission for Competitiveness (for trade and
investment climate issues) and the Office of the Commissioner for the Government's
Plan.

49.     Semi-annual reviews will take place between the Ministry of Finance and the
Bank team aimed at identifying areas of strengths and weaknesses and possible assistance
neededto maintain momentum toward the government's planned medium-term outcomes
and address possible downside risks. A mid-term review will be made in the first quarter
of 2006, when the government and the team will jointly evaluate progress in achieving
the outcomes laid out for the program.

H.      Poverty and Social Impact Analysis and Environment

50.     The actions supported by this first DPL are not expected to have any adverse
distributional impact.     To the extent that these measures have played a role in
Government's ability to maintain social spending levels, their impact on income
distribution is expected to have been positive. This i s confirmed by public expenditure
incidence analysis undertaken in the context of the GUAPA which indicates that public
social expenditures (Peace Accords definition) are generally pro-poor. With respect to
future fiscal reforms, a PSIA i s being undertaken to help determine the distributional
implications of the various tax measuresbeingconsidered. Results of the PSIA (which is
nearing completion) will feed into the national dialogue on fiscal reform and into the
design of actions to be supported by future loans in the DPL series. With respect to the
social impact of CAFTA, the Banks regional report "DR-CAFTA: Challenges and
Opportunities for Central America" found that about 84% of the Guatemalan population
are net consumers who would benefit from price reductions as a result of increased
competition. Once DR-CAFTA i s in effect (expected in the second half of 2005), the
agreement grants long grace periods and slow tariff phase outs (7 to 20 years) for
sensitive agricultural activities. However, the Bank's report concluded that some groups
of poor rural households engaged in these agricultural activities may require assistance
during a transition to increased competition. To better understand the circumstances of
the specific groups who may be affected, PSIA work (planned for FY06) will concentrate
on further narrowing down the potentially affected population by analyzing potential
price reductions by commodity and by region, enabling the design of targeted programs
to assist these groups. Such programs would be part of the policy dialogue for future
DPLsand other Bank interventions inGuatemala.


51.     The specific policies supported by this DPL operation are not expected to entail
significant impacts on the environment, forests or other natural resources. However, to


                                             22

 the extent that measures supported by the DPL program are successful, over time, in
 attracting new investment (including in infrastructure) and trade expansion, there will be
 a need to strengthen Guatemala's national institutional capacity to identify and address
 environmental policy and regulatory issues. With this in mind, a strategic Country
Environmental Analysis (CEA) is planned for FY06 which will identify cost-effective
 approaches to closing gaps in institutional capacity and the regulatory framework for
environmental protection. The results of the CEA can thus provide timely inputs for the
preparation of subsequent loans inthis programmatic DPL series.



I. Risks

52.      Continued strong performance by the Government is subject to three main risks
during the implementation of the DPL series: (i)political gridlock, given a divided
Congress, (ii)   societal tensions related to the country's post-conflict status, and (iii)
exogenous shocks, related either to natural disasters or a deteriorating external
environment. These are describedbelow.

53.      Politicul risk is inherent in a post-conflict situation such as Guatemala's, where
there continue to be deep fissures within society and where the electorate i s very
polarized and where the Government lacks a simple majority in Congress. This, in turn,
creates obvious risks for the timely passage and subsequent implementation of the
Government's legislative agenda. Currently, consensus needs to be reached with
opposition parties for all legislative priorities, with important implications not only for
the pace of reforms, but also the ability to retain the technical and policy coherenceof the
agenda within a political context of continuous trade-offs and compromises. Likely to be
especially controversial i s the fiscal reform agenda which (as discussed in para 33) i s
strongly opposed for differentreasonsby powerfulinterests on boththe right and the left,
but remains central to the country's medium- and long-term growth efforts, includingthe
drive to reduce poverty and inequality, forge greater social and economic solidarity and
achieve higher growth rates in a sustainable manner. Political as well as social tensions
also arise in other politically controversial areas including continued trade liberalization
and promotion of increasedprivate participation in infrastructure, and issues surrounding
property rights and land, all of which are crucial to accelerating growth and are central to
the Government's agenda.

54.      Efforts now underway to consolidate support for the executive's development
agenda in Congress, through the creation of a single GANA party or a unifiedbloc with a
common policy platform could help progress on key legislative initiatives. Efforts by the
international community (including IDB, UNDP, bilateral and WBI capacity-building
initiatives) to modernize and professionalize Congress should also help create better
understanding of the technical issues surrounding the legislative agenda. In addition, the
Government's public communicatiodconsultation initiative around social needs and
sources of funding, as well as its continued anti-corruption and public expenditure
transparency campaign, could help build consensus around goals and the development
challenges in the social sphere but also build support for a broader tax effort. It should


                                              23

also be noted that DPL-supported goals of achieving increases in social spending are
largely predicated on actions to improve the quality and targeting of social spending and
increase the share of social spending in the budget so that possible delays in raising
overall tax revenues would not by themselves derail DPL goals.

55.     Besides political and social risks, Guatemala is also susceptible to external risks
deriving from natural phenomena and shocks related to international economic trends.
As with the other Central American countries, Guatemala is vulnerable to natural
disasters (hurricanes, and seismic or volcanic activity) which could necessitate
unanticipated spending for emergency assistance and reconstruction, thereby affecting
achievement of established development goals in the short term. In addition, there
remains the threat of shocks from the external economic environment (e.g., low
commodity prices, persistently high oil prices, global recession, political difficulties in
the U.S. for DR-CAFTA ratification, unfavorable conditions in financial markets) that
affect the economy negatively-keeping growth rates low and negatively affecting efforts
to raise tax revenues.

56.     The Bank's DPL program is particularly well suited for managing the risks
inherent in Gatemala's difficult political and social context.          The choice of a
programmatic series of single-tranche operations for the provision of quick-disbursing
support means that there will be several points at which the Bank's program could be
reassessed if political gridlock or social tensions appear to be derailing the development
agenda, despite the Government efforts to address them. In addition, the overall
flexibility of the single tranche design means that -providedoverall progress is on track -
- specific elements of the planned program could be adjusted in terms of the scope and
form of specific reforms as well as necessary sequencing changes to take into account
changing political and social realities.

                                           Debt Sustainability inGuatemala

Guatemala has one of the lowest debt levels as a share of GDP in Latin America and
among developing countries worldwide, which reflects a tradition of very conservative
macroeconomic management. However, a question still remains of how sustainable are
current public debt levels given the also low levels of tax collections. To explore this
issue a mediumterm sustainability analysis was done under the macroeconomic scenario
shown in Table 2 of this program document, which assumes full delivery of the $610
million IBRD CAS envelope. Under the baseline scenario public external debt would
stabilize at approximately 14 percent of GDP by 2008 (see table A2.1 below). Total
public debt service would increase slightly to 10.8% of exports by 200S4, as a result of
higher interest payments on recent bond issues. Even though the baseline scenario
assumes that sovereign bond financing will continue in the future, the use of less costly
DPL lending during the 2005-2007 period would prevent sharper increases in interest
payments. These conclusions are consistent with the preliminary analysis for the Public
Expenditure Review-PER (see Public Domestic Debt section below) as well as with the
IMF's debt sustainability analysis from its recent Article IV report, although the latter
actually estimates a declining debt path (see Box A2.1 for details).

This baseline scenario also indicates that all external vulnerability indicators would
remainsound. A moderate GDP growth of 3.8 percent on average is expected duringthe
period, while the external current account balance would improve somewhat, reaching
3.8 percent of GDP by 2008 as a result of steady growth in remittances and stronger
nontraditional exports. The scenario also contemplates that debt-creating inflows would
be reduced due to new DR-CAFTA-related foreign direct investment and as a result,
Guatemala's private external debt would also stabilize around 5.9 percent of GDP by
2008, slightly lower than 2004 levels. International reserves would also remain strong at
4.3 months of imports throughout the period.

Public Domestic Debt

In its fiscal sustainability section, the ongoing PER complements the results
discussed above by including public domestic debt in its analysis. Its preliminary
findings suggest that Guatemala's total public debt of almost 19 percent of GDP
(including domestic debt) i s sustainable, even in a scenario that contemplates the same
GDP growth rates experienced in recent years (averaging 2.3 percent during 2002-04)
and a balanced primary fiscal deficit. However, in this pessimistic scenario there i s little
room for additional borrowing to finance significantly higher levels o f public spending in
social sectors. The PER concludes that until Guatemala has proven its capacity to grow
faster, there appears to be little scope for financing a significant expansion of public
spending through greater deficits and, therefore, attention must focus instead on raising
tax revenues.



                                                    Box A2.1
                                 The IMFand Debt Sustainability inGuatemala

       In its recent Article IV consultation report of May 2005, the IMFfinds that Guatemala's external
       and public debt outlook is sustainable, even under alternative negative shocks scenarios for the
       underlying macroeconomic variables.        The baseline scenario estimates that total public debt
       would decline to 15 percent of GDP by 2010, from 18 percent in 2004. Similarly, public external
       debt will decline from 14to 12percent of GDP during the same period.

       A "weaker policy" scenario was prepared to illustrate the main vulnerabilities that remain under
       the baseline scenario. Under this scenario tax revenues are not raised, inflation remains at current
       levels and the financial reform is postponed. The results show that public debt would remain at 18
       percent by 2010, instead of declining. Nevertheless, the ratio o f public debt to tax revenue would
       still be the lowest in Central America and Guatemala's protection against vulnerabilities would
       remain relatively strong. Temporary negative shocks to key variables (interest rate, exchange rate
       and GDP growth), would lead to some increase in the level of public and external debt, but the
       ratios return to a declining path once the shocks disappear. Under such negative circumstances, the
       IMF warns that the investment climate could be affected, raising the cost of borrowing for
       Guatemala and further lowering GDP growth.

Mrs.PamelaCox
Vice-presidentfor LatinAmerica
World Bank
Washington, D.C.

Dear Ms. Cox:

As you know, the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Guatemalacovering the
period 2005-2008 includes a program of three Development Policy Loans (DPLs), whose
main objective is to support the different areas of the Government's program aimed at
achieving its goals of promoting greater economic growth andreducing poverty.

Within this context, and given that the first loan is being prepared this year, the
Government of Guatemala is requesting that the World Bank to move forward with the
First Broad-Based Growth Development Policy Loan, for an amount of US$lOO.O
million.   These resources will support the economic and social components of the
Government's Program, as well as improve the country's external indebtednessprofile.

With respect to the economic program, we'd like to note the results achieved in 2004 in
the areas of economic growth, fiscal and monetary policy and in strengthening the
external position. In particular, macroeconomic stability was consolidated, economic
performance improved, relations between the public and private sectors were
strengthened and the investment climate improved. As a result, the rate of growth
acceleratedto 2.7 percent, well-above the rate achieved in the previous year (2.1%). On
the external side, exports rose and a substantial increase was observed in remittances.
Foreign exchange reserves continued to rise, to a level equal to approximately 5.2 months
of imports of goods and services. While the exchange rate has had a tendency to
appreciate, it has remainedstable overall. Inflation reached 9.296, higher than the target
set by the monetary authorities, due in part to pressure from higher international oil
prices. Currently, inflation is showing a declining trend which indicates that 2005
inflation levels will be lower than in the preceding year. With respect to the fiscal
position, the deficit was contained to 1% of GDP, and it i s expected to remain below
2.0% in2005.

The Government's social development program i s being carried forward within the
framework of Vamos Guatemala!, our national initiative to promote economic
reactivation and social harmony through programs of rapid and broad-based impact.
Vamos Guatemala! is a central component of Government's program for 2004-2008,
which seeks to achieve Peace Accords targets. It includes specific, measurableprojects
that promote a favorable investment climate and concrete benefits for Guatemalan
households.

                                           36

Vamos Guatemala! i s comprised of four main components: Guate Solidaria, Guate
Compite, Guate Crece, and Guate Verde. Below, find the most important measures to
be undertaken within these areas, especially those that pertain to the DPLprogram.


I. EconomicgrowthandimprovementintheinvestmentclimateofInvestment
        (Guate Crece and Guate Compite)

In this area we are working on improving infrastructure, both with regard to road
maintenance and the construction of new projects. With respect to promotion of private
investment, we are promoting a Concessions Law which seeks to encourage private
investment inmajor projects (metropolitan beltway, the northern highway and the Pacific
Corridor). We have also created the "Invest in Guatemala" office, under the oversight of
the Ministry of Economy, with the objective of stimulating private investment.

In addition, we are improving tourism infrastructure through improved security, hotel
capacity, improved flight schedules etc.        In terms of improving exports we are
accelerating the process of achieving a Central American customs union and harmonizing
and simplifying customs procedures with neighboring countries. We have made progress
in reducing the times and costs for customs processes as well as improved services in
ports and airports to achieve the international certification necessary to ensure efficient
operation of these facilities.

Inaddition, we havenegotiatedimportant trade treaties, notably the DominicanRepublic,
Central America and United States of America Free Trade Treaty (DR-CAFTA)), which
was approved by Congress in March 2005, by means of decree 31-2005 published on
March 16, 2005. Inparallel, we have initiatednegotiations for treaties with other trading
partners, including the European Union, Canada, Chile, Colombia and Taiwan. We have
also improved the implementation of VAT reimbursements for exporters.

At the same time, we are promoting public investment in technological innovation and
quality promotion as primary elements in improving access for small and medium
enterprises to developed country markets.


11.     Stability and macroeconomic consolidation

Public Finances

Immediately upon taking office in early 2004, the current Administration has moved
rapidly to restore the credibility of public institutions, apply fiscal discipline and regain
the confidence of the markets.       As part of this effort, the Government reaffirmed
commitment to the Peace Accords and adopted a plan for improving tax collections and
strengthening tax administration. These measures allowed for regaining the income
which had been lost as a result of adverse judgments by the Constitutional Court which
haderodedthe tax base of the country.




                                             37

Specifically, in May 2004, the Executive presentedto the Congress a series of initiatives
aimed at increasing taxes with the purpose of complying with commitments included in
the Peace Accords. By means of Decree no. 18-04, the Congress approved the Law of
Income Tax (Zmpuesto Sobre la Renta); and, through decree 19-04, it approved the Law
for an Extraordinary and Temporary Tax inSupport of the Peace Accords (IETAAP in its
Spanish acronym). Although the Executive's proposal was only partially approved, the
passage of these laws made it possible to avoid a decline in tax revenues, which
amounted to 10.3% of GDP for the year 2004, equal to revenues in 2003. Additionally,
the Executive adopted a strategy for the strengthening of tax administration, with
technical assistancefrom the International Monetary Fund.

In May of this year, the Congress approved Decree 38-2005 - Reforms to the Law on
Taxes on the Distribution of Crude Petroleum and Combustible Fuels Derived from
Petroleum -- through which revenues lost as a result of a Constitutional Court ruling at
the endof 2004, were restored.

The actions in support of public finances will continue in the coming months through
continued implementation of the strategic plan of the Superintendency for Tax
Administration and through other actions to be identified via a dialogue with key sectors
insociety.

Inaddition to the above, the Government has set inmotion a strategy for internal and
external debt aimed at securing longer terms and more favorable interest rates, which, in
turn, has allowed for an improvement inthe public debt profile and maintained access to
international credit at reasonable cost. All this has contributed to the strengthening of
public finances, a central element of the Government's program.


Strengthening of the Financial sector

Guatemala has made significant progress in its financial sector reform program, which
includes the approval by Congress of the Central Bank Law, the Bank Supervision Law,
Banking and Financial Groups Law, the Monetary Law and the Fund for Savings
Protection Law. The Government has also issued the regulations needed to make these
laws fully operational.     Currently, the country continues with the deepening and
strengthening of the financial system, through moving forward new initiatives and
through controlling contingent risks, including clean-up of the Credit0 Hipotecurio
Nacional. In addition, banking supervision continues to be strengthened, in particular
through movingtowards Basle-II-like, risk-based supervision.

In addition, it is worth noting that as a result of the (Government's) policy of
transparency in public sector management and support for the fight against money-
laundering and drug-trafficking, Guatemala was removed from the list of non-
cooperating countries by the FinancialAction Task Force inJuly, 2004.

Other priorities include the implementation of a regulatory framework to facilitate the
expansion of credit to groups that have traditionally been excluded from the formal
financial system and at the same time to take steps to assure the stability of non-bank

                                            38

financial intermediaries.    Towards these ends, the following draft laws have been
developed: (a) Law on Micro-Finance Institutions; (b) Law on Reciprocal Guarantees; (c)
Law on Movable Property. We hope that these laws will be reviewed and approved by
the Congress during the current year.


111.    Social investment (GuateSolidaria)

In parallel to the economic program, the Government is implementinga social program
which seeks an increase in (social) expenditure accompaniedby improvedefficiency and
targeting of these expenditures. Ineffect, the current Government is promoting a strategy
for human development (Guate Solidaria), whose actions, taken together, will contribute
to the reduction of the poverty which affects a large proportion of society, especially in
rural areas. It i s also committed to improving the nutritionalstatus of the most vulnerable
population groups. To achieve this, the Government i s giving high priority to social
investment, which, in turn, will be accompanied by concentrated attention to the most
vulnerable groups and through the promotion of better coordination between the priority
social sectors such as health, education, nutrition and food availability, thereby increasing
the efficiency and impact in this area.

This integrated strategy will be implemented in the municipalities and localities
determined to be the most vulnerable from the standpoints of social risk and poverty,
identified by having the most number of unmet basic needs. It is anticipated that
households most affected by extreme poverty would be able to improve the quality of life
inthe medium-term andbe able to move out of poverty inthe long-term.


IV.     Transparency and Public Sector Management

Government Procurement

Regarding procurement issues, significant progress has been made through the launching
of an internet-based system (Guatecomprus) for public use, which provides real time
information on governmental contracting and procurement transactions. This system
allows for more transparency and for a competitive process using best practices on
Government's acquisitions.       It permits all privately owned businesses to access
information on, and participate in, all Government procurement. It is already in use by
more than 76 public sector agencies and 185 municipalities.




                                             39

Integrated Financial Manapement Svstem (SIAF)

Inorder to promote greater transparency inbudgetaryexecution by all three Branchesof
Government, we have moved from a client - server electronic format to a real time
internet-based system, SICOIN-WEB. This promotes a more transparent environment
and the efficient use of public funds. Currently, the system has been implemented in all
central government entities and in 22 decentralizedagencies, which by the end of 2005 i s
expectedto expand to 6 more.

Regardinglocalgovernments, SIAF has been incorporated in46 municipalities, andplans
are to expand to 100by the endof this year.


Conclusion

As the above indicates, the GuatemalanGovernment is strongly committed to taking the
necessary steps to promote economic growth, increase employment and improve health
and education as well as improving citizen security and fighting poverty. Inthis context,
the support and partnership that the World Bank can bring to the country through
approval of the program of Development Policy Loans is a very important element.
