institutional development\n            impact was substantial, and the Bank and Borrower\n            performance were both satisfactory. The major project\n            components include five high-grade highways in five\n            locations, and upgrading, improvement and construction of\n            rural roads. The project tried to address all the key\n            transport sector issues in China. During the phase\n            preparation in 1994 and 1995, the Shaanxi Provincial\n            Transport Department was keen to develop the proposed\n            components, but soon it was overwhelmed with other projects\n            funded by other banks. The agency was overstretched in its\n            capacity to implement various projects and experienced\n            severe shortage of qualified staff. The Roads Improvement\n            for Poverty Alleviation program demonstrated positive\n            contribution towards poverty alleviation and in providing a\n            basic road access for social services and markets. The\n            technical complexity of highway construction and operations\n            was underestimated. This component experienced substantial\n            costs overruns. Changes in design and variations could have\n            been avoided or minimized if designs had been based on more\n            accurate topographic maps and results of geotechnical\n            investigations during the project preparation."}, "docdt": "2003-02-10T00:00:00Z"}
