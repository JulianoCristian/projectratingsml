ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION PLAN tEAP)
WEINAN - TONGGUAN EXPRESSWAY
1.    INTRODUCTION
1.1 Ge;neral Description
1.          The proposed Weinan - Tongguan expressway is an integral component of
National Highway No. 310 (Lianyungang-Houcheng National Trunk Highway). It is also a
key section of the Shaanxi provincial highway network which will connect the local districts
of Weinan, Xi'an, and Tongguan (Figure 1.1). The number of vehicles traversing the
proposed highway is predicted to reach between 20,000 to 30,000 vpd by the year 2000;
increasing to approximately 55,000-80,000 by 2018. The present highway from Weinan to
Tongguan is a Grade III roadway which in some areas deteriorates significantly and is
inadequate for coping with current traffic loads.
2.           The primary objective for construction of the Weinan - Tongguan expressway
is to increase transportation capacity in order to meet current and predicted traffic volumes,
and improve access to and from the project area as a means of facilitating economic growth.
The proposed expressway will strengthen communications between Shaanxi and the
neighboring provinces of Henan and Shanxi to the east and northeast respectively. The
proposed project area and adjoining regions in the adjacent two provinces have been
designated an economic development center due to abundant resources and physically
accessible location.
3.           Additional anticipated benefits of the pwoposed project include growth in
tourism due to improved access to many historic and cultural sites along the alignment, and
increased market access for goods produced within the project area The variety and quality
of goods imported into the area will also improve as transportation cost is reduced and the
purchasing power of local residents increases.
4.           The main physical components of the proposed project include construction
of a 78.14 km long, restricted access auto vehicle expressway; erection of eight large and
nine medium span bridges; and six interchanges. The interchanges will provide access to
nearby towns and villages along the roadway. The proposed project will entail acquisition
of 6093.8 mu (406.3 ha) of agricultural land and demolition of 30,774 ml of building area.
5.           The expressway traverses mainly flat topographies and low hills for
approximately 49km, and highlands for 29km with designed speeds of 120km/hr and
l00km/hr respectively. It has a design capacity of over 25,000 vpd.

1.2   Major Environmental Impacts
6.           Cultivated land acquisition, resettlement, socio-economic disturbance and
potential disruption to cultural and historic sites and ecologically sensitive areas are
anticipated due to the project development.
7.           During construction, environmental impacts primarily include, disruption of
areas adjacent to construction locations and excavation areas, soil erosion, and potential air
and water quality degradation.    0
8.           Operadon of the road will polentially lead to air pollution and noise impacts.:
Moreover, the risk of accidents resulting in spills of hazardous materials will increase.
1.3   Consideration of Project Alternatives
9.           Three alternative alignments were considered from the point of view of
physical constraints, technical and economic leasibility and relative environmental impacts.
The selected alternative minimizes land acquisition and potential enivironmental impacts, as
well as avoiding cultural relics and sensitive geological conditions relative to the other two
alignments (see Figure 1.3).
2.     ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND PROPOSED MITIGATION MEASURES
2.1   Significant Environmental Impacts
2.1.1 Location Issues
i.    Relocation and Cultivated Land Acquisition
10.          Approximately 30,774 m2 of construction area will be demolished and 238
families (1151 people) in 10 villages will be resettled as a result of the project
implementation. One school and one hospital will be totally relocated and two senools
partially relocated in areas where noise levels from operation of the road cannot be mitigated
to Class II Noise Standards. The location of affected sensitive sites and villages are shown
in Map I appended to this report.
11.          The total cultivated area impacted by construction of the expressway is
estimated at 406.3 ha, which is 95% of total land acquisition. Approximately 1018 families
(4989 people) will require compensation with land of similar or superior quality. In addition,
572.1 mu (38.1 ha) of agricultural land will be temporarily disrupted where the fertile topsoil
will be removed and stockpiled and subsurface soil excavated for construction materials. The
topsoil will then be replaced and the land restored to its original use.

12.           Details of resettlemenit and land acquisition compensation issues not related
to environmental impacts is providcd in the project Resettlement Action Plan (RAP).
ii.    Cultural and Historical Sites
13.           Fourteen cultural sites have been identified along the proposed alignment by
the Shaanxi Provincial Archaeological Institute (SPAI), which may to various degrees be
- impacted by the construction project as discussed below. (Map 1)
iii.    Ecological Impacts
14.           No significant impacts on wildlife, sensitive habitats or protected areas were
identified in the EIA as the alignment has long been disrupted by agricultural and industrial
activities. Ecological concerns include potential impacts in areas of farmed wetland at
Xiquandian. (Map I) An existing road passes through these areas wiie:h afe degraded and
have little remaining natural wetland vegetation due to several decades of lotus cultivation.
Approximately 137,600n9 of the lotus field area will be disrupted as a result of the
construCtion.
2.1.2 Construction Issues
15.           Potential construction phase impacts include disruption of areas adjacent to
construction and excavation sites, soil erosion and waterway siltadon, noise and vibration
impacts, and air quality degradation resulting from construction activities and material
transportation. Impacts on water quality in 18 seasonal water courses traversed (Map 1, or
used as borrow sites by the project, may also arise should construction activities continue
during the rainy season or if excavation during the dry season is not carefully managed.
Additional direct impacts may arise due to solid and liquid wastes generated in construction
camps or material storage areas including sewage, sanitary, construction and hazardous
wastes.
2.1.3 Operation Issues
16.           Operation of the road may potentially lead to deterioration of air quality and
an increase in background noise levels. In some areas, projections indicate that noise and air
pollution levels may exceed national standards in the future.
!
17.           Since the road will restrict access to all but motor vehicles, the risk from
mixed vehicle type accidents will be eliminated. However, existing industrial activity along
the alignment and plans to develop the industrial base in the region, will increase the risk of
traffic accidents resulting in chemical and other hazardous materials spills. Emergency
response measures and facilities are required and have been planned as discussed below to
5



respond to spill incidents, and mitigate impacts on the ecological environment and human
|hcalth.
2.2    Proposed Mitigation Concepts and Mcstires
18.          Environimental protection strategies for mitigation of potential project impacts:
a.    projcct design  includes  elements which  optimize opportunities  for
environmenial improvemnent and avoids or minilnizes adverse environmental
impacts. Where avoidance or minimization is not possible, economically and
technically feasible mitigation measures have been formulated and shall be
undetaken within.a reasonable time frame during project implementaLion.
b.    environimiental protection measures include mitigation of impacts during the
I                     construction and operation phases of die project.
19.          In accordance with these principles, the proposed alignment was selected on
the basis of minimizing both socio-economic and environmental impacts. Where impacts are
unavoidable, the project design includes minimization measures including adequate
I       resettlement and compensation measures for families affected by the project.
20.           Several environmental improvement measures have been incorporated or are
1       inherent in the project design, including:
a.    the use of pulverized fuel ash (PFA) from Qinling power station as a sub-base
consi-ructon material is a means of re-utilizing a waste resource which
currently is a source of environmental pollution.
J               b.    irmprovement and upgrading of existing dirt roads along routes used for
cransport of materials. This reduces fugitive dust and improves rural traffic
1                      movement.
c.    diversion of through traffic from the center of villages will have a net positive
d                      impact on air quality and noise levels within settlements. It will also serve
to reduce congestion and the risk of accidents which may involve loss of
human life or release of hazardous materials.
2.2.1  Design Phase
i.    Environmental Considerations
21.           The project was formulated and authorized in accordance with the "Three
Synchronization' rule, which requires that all development and construction projects
6



I
incorporate environmental protection measures in planning, design, constructionl and operation
phases.
22.           Environmental factors have been taken into considcration to minimize visual
impacts and the need for physical alteraLion of the landscape, as well as impacts to natural
resources, sensitive ecosystems, cultural resources, agricultural lands and populated areas.
ii.    Route Selection,
23.           The alignment of the proposed Weinan-Tongguan expressway (Alternative 2)
was selected from among three alternatives in order to minim ize land acquisition, social and
economic disturbance, advcrse environmental imnpacts including atmospheric pollution, noise
on sensitive sites and residential areas, water quality degradation and ecological disruption,
as well as to avoid cultural relics and unfavorable gcological conditions.
iii.   Social Disruption
24.           Provisions have been made in the project design for residential areas affected
by the project development. These include reducing right-of-way land requirements and
minimizing severance of local access roads in selecting transportation routes.
25.           In order to solve the problem of community separation and isolation due to
the project construction and to meet the requirements of vehicle access, 178 crossings
(equivalent to 2.8 crossings/km) and six interchanges have been incorporated into the project
I       design.
iv.    Soil Erosion
26.           A total of 16,588m of slope protection, 7030m of retaining walls, 7030m of
protection walls and 164 culverts were included in the engineering design so as to facilitate
natural drainage and avoid soil erosion and slope failures. In addition, temporary and
permanent drainage systems were designed to minimize soil erosion and alteration of
hydrological regimes, including impacts on irrigation and artificial ponds. Overland drainage
*        will be controlled to prevent channeling and sediment transport by diverting flows from areas
where soils are exposed. Drainage channels will be properly lined where necessary.
27.           The deficit of cut and fill earth works required by the project will be
borrowed from a number of locations within the construction corridor. Following the
completion of activities at each site, grading will be undertaklen and the area will be re-
vegetated. Where appropriate, grading and revegetation of cut slopes, embankments, median
dividers, shoulders and closed borrow sites will be undertaken.
7



28.           An extensive landscape program  has been integrated into the engineering
design according to topographical and geological characteristics along the alignment to reduce
erosion and prevent land sutbsidence,
v.    Fugitive Dust and Air Pollution
29.           Quarries, borrow areas and transportation routes, as well as waste disposal
sites were identified, taking inito account adjacent land uses and transportation distances from
material source areas to constriction sites. Dust and atmospheric lollution arising from tLhese
areas were evaluated with particular einphasis to protection of environmentally sensitive
locations such as rcsidential areas. ThC locations of excavation sites are shown in Map 1.
30.           Pulverized Ftuel Ash (PFA) used as constniction material for Lhc road base
will be stabilized witlh lime to avoid fuigitive dust and potential contanlinalion of lhe
underground formations.
vi,    WaLer PollutionI
31.           Adequate permanent anid temporary drainage systems were incorporated in hlie
project design to miinmize surface water pollution and disturbance to irrigation channels and
drainage systems. SeLtling basins will be installed to reinove sediment before runoff is
discharged into surface water bodies.
32.           Sanitary waste water facilities (septic systems) were designed for service
stations in order to prevent direct discharge to surface waters.
33.           Underground storage tanks for gasoline and other hazardous materials will be
installed in a crypt to prevent groundwater contamination.
vii.   Noise
34.           Adequate noise mitigation measures were integrated in the design and bid
documents which include installation of noise barriers and surrounding walls and planting of
forest belts. Sensitive facilities where noise impacts cannot be mitigated to acceptable levels
after implementation of the above measures will be relocated.
*                      viii.  Flooding
_       35.            Bridges, culverts and roadside drainage systems were adequately designed to
meet requirements for safe discharge of flood,
8



ix.    Cultural Relics
36.           In addliton to route selection, the design phase included initial studies and
rclic site surveys, identilication, avoidance and excavation planning where necessary. A
detailed Cultural Relics ActioIn Plan has bacn prcpared by Shaanxi Provincial Archaeological
-     In~~lStitull.
x.   Ercological Resourccs
37.           MiLigatioll plans have been formulated to minimnize disrupLion of Lhc potential
ecological function of farmod lotus fields throuigih restricting excavation and construction to
a narrow corridor adjacent to the cxisting road.
38.           Opportunities lor creation and upgrading of new and existing wetlands will
be optimized through usc of cxcavated lotus field soils. Drainage facilities were designed and
will bc installed to prevent run-off from the road surface to the farms to thc nortil of thc
roadway.
xi.   Safety Managmcent and Einergency Response
39.          B1uildinigs, bridges and other strucLures were designed to criteria appropriate
to the local seismic risk, wind and snow loading, and other dynamically imposed loads
associated with climatic and geological factors inherent at the locations,
40.           Restriction of the road to auto vehicles will significantly reduce the occurrence
of accidents, however the risk of accidents involving spills of hazardous materials will
increase as the economy develops. Adequate provisions have been incorporated in the project
design to minimize the risk of accidents:
a.     Protection fences will be installed on either side of bridges and embankments
where the road base is over 2 meters high;
b.    the central segregation belt will be planted with vegetation (to 1.2m) to avoid
glare from oncoming traffic;
c.     adequate signs and signals will be erected and emergency telepliones will be
provided at one kilometer intervals along both sides of the road;
d.     supervision and emergency response services and facilities wi'l be enhanced
to inmprove response to accidents involving chemical spills.

2.3.2 Construction Phase
i.    Temporary Land Take
41.           During the construction phase, reasonable actions will be taken to incorporate
good construction practices in the project implementation in order to avoid undue or long
term disturbance of farmland and water courses.
42.           At 13 locations along lhe alignment, cultivated lands will be used for
construction soil borrow sites, fertile topsoil will be removed, stockpiled and after compledon
of subsoil removal, will be restored and the land reverted to its original condition.
ii.    Soil Erosion/Water Pollution
43.           Erosion control will be achieved by minimizing vegetation removal and
exposed surfaces until required by construction and by installing silt traps, and other erosion
prevention measures.  Excavation sites will be reclaimed, stabilized and re-vegetated
following cessation of activities. To further minimize risk of erosion, borrow and quarry
areas will be terraced as necessary. Silt screens wiU placed at excavation sites. In addition
excavated land will be reclaimed and reverted to its original condition as soon as soil has been
removed. Digging and refilling activities will be avoided during the rainy season.
44.          Temporary ponds shall be placed where appropriate within construction areas
to capture surface drainage and settle out eroded soils. In areas adjacent to surface water
bodies, rivers, irrigation ditches and drainage channels, surplus excavated material disposal
shall be apprr,priately controlled so as to prevent sedimentation and adverse water quality
impacts. Temporary channels or conduits shall be constructed where necessary to facilitate
irrigation and drainage, during the construction of permanent drainage systems.
45.           All reasonable measures shall be taken to prevent direct discharge of polluted
j       water from construction activities into rivers and irrigation channels. Waste water and run-off
from construction sites will be collected and settled before discharge to water courses.
46.           Construction of bridge piers and material excavation from water courses will
be avoided during the rainy season. Drainage interception facilities will be installed at
bridges to prevent poliuted run-off from entering water courses.
iii.   Fugitive Dust and Air Pollution
47.           Road surfaces, excavation areas and construction sites will be sprayed and
kept moist as necessary particularly near towr.;, water resources and sensitive locations.
*       Identified access roads will be upgraded, and where necessary widened and pavxd, and
sprayed regularly to minimize fugitive dust.
10



48.          Stockpiles and storage areas will be covered or sprayed to prevent fugitive
dust impacts. Construction materials will be covered during hauling to prevent undue dust
or debris on roads.
I       49.           Asphalt and concrete mixing equipment will fitted with dust collection
facilities and located 500 meters down wind of residential areas. Workers will be provided
with dust masks and trained in their usage. Construction machines will be equipped with
exhaust gas control units.
iv.   Construction Camps
50.          Septic tanks shall be installed at construction camp sites to prevent direct
|     - discharge of sanitary sewage to surface water bodies. Sewage sludge and domestic waste
from construction sites will be collected to be used as fertilizer or disposed of following
I       recovering of recyclable components. Septic tanks shall be regularly emptied.
51I.         Disposal sites shall be approved and secured to avoid environmental
I       contamination or site failures. Camp domestic solid wastes shall be collected in containers
and/or at designated areas and disposed of regularly in order to enhance sanitation.
52.         Drinking water at construction sites shall meet China's national drinking water
standards.
V v.    Noise and Vibration
]       53.           Operation of machinery associated with excavation and road construction may
cause hearing damage to construction workers in the event of prolonged exposure. Hearing
protection for construction workers will be provided and construction activities will be
prohibited between lOpm and 6am near residential areas.
54.          Construction machinery and trucks will be properly operated and maintained.
Devices for the control of noise will be properly installed so as to control noise in compliance
with Chinese Class IV noise standards in urban areas, and with Class II standards in sensitive
areas including schools and hospitals.
55.          Vibration monitoring will be undertaken by environmental supervisors at each
contract lot and mitigation measures will be properly adopted to rectify any detected damage
as a result of vibration of construction machinery. Heavy machines will not be operated
simultaneously.
11



vi.   Ecological Resources
56.           During construction at Xiquandian, temporary drainage facilides will be
installed to ensure that construction run-off flows away from the lotus fields to the north of
roadway. Excavation and construction will be restricted to a narrow area adjacent to the
existing road which will accommodate the proposed alignment and optimize opportunities for
upgrading of existing farmed lands.
57.           Where amble land is selected as material borrow sites, fertile topsoil will be
removed and stockpiled and the sub-soil excavated for construction materials. Following
compledon of excavation, topsoil will be replaced and the area will be reverted to original
uses.
58.           Forests will not be used for material borrow sites. Education of construction
workers will be strengthened to protect natural resources, wild plants and animals. Poaching
will be strictly prohibited. Construction trucks will be restricted to approved or designated
roads so as to avoid damage to farms.
vii. Cultural Relics
59.           Work will be stopped if new relics are discovered as a result of road
construction or excavation activities. The Shaanxi Provincial Archaeological Bureau(SPAB)
and Shaanxi Provincial Archaeological Institute (SPAI) will be notified immediately and a
survey of the site will be undertaken by authorized personnel. Necessary mitigation measures
will be identified and implemented under the supervision of SPAB. Detailed action plans will
be formulated for discovered sites where excavation is required.
viii. Risk Management
60.          In order to guarantee construction safety, construction vehicles shall have
effective lights; and safety signs and lighting shall be installed on roads and intersections used
during construction. Traffic control measures will be implemented at intersections, especially
of access roads used for material transportation, to avoid risk of accidents. Adequate traffic
regulations shall be adopted and enforced for all construction routes.
61.           Unauthorized personnel will be prohibited from  entering hazardous or
restricted areas. Blasting times, signals and guards shall be stipulated according to Chinese
regulations. People and vehicles in dangerous areas shall be evacuated in time. Careful and
thorough checks shall be made before blasting. Management and blasting materials usage
protocols shall strictly observe Public Security Department requirements.
12



I_
ix.   Traffic and Transportation
62.           Local sources will be used to the extent possible to avoid long distance
I       transportation of construction materials. PFA brought into the construction site by trucks will
be loaded directly to the road base to avoid contamination arising from temporary stockpiling.
63.          Where necessary, slow traffic lanes and paved shoulders for pedestrians and
non-motored transportation will be provided to minimize disruption to local communities and
secure access requirements. Adequate traffic control measures will be implemented in
consultation with Communications and Public Security Departments when roads are congested
E       during the construction period. The contractor is required tO provide adequate diversions and
signs where the construction crosses existing alignments.
I       64.           Where sections of existing roads are used for transportation of construction
materials, temporary service roads shall be constructed as appropriate to alleviate congestion
i      3o n existing roads.  A construction materials transportation plan and schedule shall be
formulated to avoid hauling activities during peak hours especially on existing roads.
2.3.3  Operation Phase
t.    Transportation Management and Road Safety
I       65.           The Public Security Department shall be informed prior to transportation of
hazardous materials on the roadway, especially with regard to the nature of t .e hazard, and
the time, routes and parking places of vehicles transporting suchmaterials. '1he vehicles and
drivers will be checked by the Public Security Department. Experienced, qualified drivers
-       will be required. Pertinent danger sign will be posted on the vehicles indicating the nature
of the hazard. Transport of hazardous material will be restricted to a limited number of off-
peak hours and will be accompanied by escort vehicles if necessary. Hazardous material may
|       not be transported tog-cner with passengers, or other goods.
66.          The local fire-fighting department will be responsible for responding to spills,
fires and major accidents during operation.
ii.    Vehicle Management
67.          Vehicles speeds on the expressway shall not exceed 120 kIm/h in flat areas and
100 km/h in mountainous areas.
-:       68.           Vehicles that do not meet noise and exhaust emission standards will be baired
!        from using provincial roads including the expressway. A tail gas inspection station will be
established at Huaxian Interchange to enforce emission laws.
13



69.           Public awareness and education campaigns will be undertaken to familiarize
people with air and noise pollution regulations for vehicles.
iii.    Noise
70.           Sound barriers will be erected at affected sensitive sites and villages where
noise levels are predicted to exceed national noise standards (GB 3096-93). Where necessary,
mitigation measures such as structural noise barriers and forest belts will be implemented.
71.           Taoxia Hospital and Xiaoquan Primary School will be totally relocated since
it is not possible to reduce noise impacts to acceptable levels at the current locations. Two
primary schools: Fengliang and Fushui will be partially re-located so as to meet Class II
National Urban Noise Standards for sensitive sites. Relocation of these facilities forms part
of the resettlement and compensation plan for the projecL Details of mitigation measures that
will be implemented at different stages of operation of the expressway are listed in Table
2.3a.

Chinese cabbage and other types of vegetables will be prohibited within 40 meters of the
alignment after 1998 and shall be substituted with non-edible crops.
3.    ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING PLAN
3.1   Introduction
77.          The Environmental Monitoring Plan of the project has been formulated in
consultation with the Shaanxi Provincial Highway Survey and Design Institute and the Shaanxi
Provincial Institute of Environmental Science.
78.          The overall project impacts are minimized through  well planned
implementation strategies on the part of the project proponents. An overall monitoring
program  has been formulated in order to (i) ensure early detection of conditions that
necessitate particular mitigation measures, and (ii) provide information on the progress and
consequences of mitigation measures.
79.          The purpose of monitoring activities during highway construction and
operation is to determine the influence on air, noise, and water quality so that appropriate
mitigation measures can be undertaken to alleviate any identified impact. Monitoring
parameters, network distribution and frequency have been determined according to the nature
and locations of potentially significant impacts as well as results of the baseline monitoring
program.
17



3.2   Monitoring Plan: Schedule, Parameters and Locations
80.          Baseline environmental monitoring along the alignment was performed by the
Shaanxi Provincial Environmental Monitoring Center (SPEMC) between 1993 and 1994,
which included air quality, background noise level, surface water quality, and soil and crop
lead content monitoring.
81.         In addition, a survey of habitat and wildlife along the alignment was
undertaken and no significant ecologically sensitive locations were identified.
82.          A systematic monitoring plan is presented in Table 3.1. The detailed locations
of proposed monitoring sites are shown in Map 11.
3.3.1 Construction Phase
-'                  i.    Air Quality Monitoring
83.          TSP will be monitored four times per year over a period of three consecutive
days, 6nce in the morning and afternoon around the construction sites, quarries, material
borrow sites and major roads used for transportation of material. Monitoring results will be
assessed in relation to Class II National Air Quality Standards (GB 3095-82).
84.          Fugitive dust monitoring will be undertaken by environmental supervisors at
each contract lot every 5-10 days. Dustpans will be placed in at least 6 sampling locations
at construction sites, quarries and material borrow sites and major access roads. More
frequent monitoring will be undertaklen during the beginning stages of construction.
ii.    Noise and Vibration Monitoring
85.          Noise monitoring will be undertaken by environmental eupervisors on a
weekly basis, three times per day (in the morning, afternoon and at night) at construction sites
and major transportation routes. Ad hoc noise monitoring will also be undertaken as
appropriate. Monitoring data will be assessed on the basis of National Urban Noise Standards
(GB 3096-93) Class lI for sensitive sites and Class IV for residential areas. Noise monitoring
at construction sites will comply with Noise Standards at Construction Boundary (GB 12523-
90). The vibration monitoring data shall be analyzed in compliance with National Standards
of Environmental Vibration in Urban Areas (GB 10070-88).
iii.   Water Quality Monitoring
86.          Water quality monitoring will be undertaken by the environmental monitoring
group of the Central Supervision Laboratory at permanent streams near construction sites and
where bridges are being constructed. COD, SS, DO, oil, temperature and pH will be
18



monitored one month before construction starts and after this three times each year for two
consecutive days.
3.3.2  Operation Phase
i.    Air Quality Monitoring
87.          Monitoring of TSP, NQO and CO will be undertaken at four locations (See
Map 11), semi-annually on five consecutive days, four times per day.
ii.    Noise Monitoring
88.          Regular monitoring will be undertaken to establish noise levels and trends and
enable the need for additional noise mitigation measures to be assessed. Monitoring of noise
levels at 7 sensitive sites (Map 1) will be undertken four times a year over a period of tree
consecutive days, at daytime and night time as well as ad hoc monitoring where appropriate.
Resulting data will be assessed for compliance with National Standards for Noise in Urban
Areas (GB 3096-93 - standards for sensitive sites and areas bordering trunk roads).
iii.   Water Quality Monitoring
89.          COD, SS, DO, oil, temperature and pH will be monitored three times per
year at permanent streams, semi-annually for a period of two consecutive days.
90.          Following accidents involving spills of chemicals or other hazardous
substances monitoring of water quality impacts will be undertaken as appropriate.
Parameters, frequency and location will be detenined according to the nature of the incident.
iv.   Lead Monitoring in Soils and Crops
91.          The lead content in soils and crops along the highway will be monitored at
five locations once a year during the operation phase. Monitoring will be undertaken at 20m
from the road edge to the depth of 20cm. Wheat and maize are the main crops that will be
monitored. If elevated levels are identified appropriate measures will be taken including crop
substitution. Since there is currently no national standard for lead content in soils, a
reference standard of < 300 mglkg will be adopted. Lead content of crops will be assessed
in accordance with National Food Hygiene Criteria.
V.    Vehicle Emissions Monitoring
92.          An inspection station will be established at Huaxian interchange to undertake
ad hoc monitoring of CO and THC generated from gasoline vehicles and TSP generated from
diesel vehicles using the highway.
