The second component\n            funds a training program for teachers and education\n            managers. It specifically finances a needs assessment and\n            specification of the contents of the training packages and\n            preparation of trial training packages, improves the\n            capacity of teacher training institutes, supports the\n            appraisal of training packages, and publishes and delivers\n            training modules. The third component provides suppots for a\n            Quality Assurance Team, improves the personnel management\n            information system, develops accreditation and teacher\n            classification procedures, and provides communications and\n            training for school improvement. The fourth component\n            supports revision in the Terms of Service for teachers. It\n            supports technical assistance and research, preparation and\n            discussion of options and supporting changes, and consensus\n            building activities."}, "docdt": "2001-11-14T00:00:00Z"}
