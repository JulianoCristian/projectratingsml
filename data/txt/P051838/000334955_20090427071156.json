Some lessons\n            learned included: 1) a standards-based approach in education\n            has much to recommend it in terms of clear expectations for\n            outcomes, objective evidence of achievement, planning for\n            growth or development, and rewarding progress; 2) changes in\n            teaching methods are best achieved through combining theory\n            and practice, as happened when teachers undertook training\n            modules while involved in teaching the new curriculum; 3)\n            teachers appreciated the Professional Profile because it\n            defined their work, set targets for improvement, and offered\n            rewards for better performance; and 4) the motivation for\n            teachers to engage in self improvement could be impeded\n            unless performance appraisal is included in the criteria for\n            teachers' titles, along with qualifications."}, "docdt": "2008-04-22T00:00:00Z"}
