"The principal objective of the Kingston\n            Metropolitan Urban Transport Project is to promote the\n            development of an adequate and efficient urban transport\n            system in the of the Kingston Metropolitan Region (KMR),\n            following the divestment of the publicly-owned Jamaica\n            Omnibus Company to the private sector. The project is\n            designed to minimize the annual foreign exchange\n            requirements for the operation of vehicles in the KMR and to\n            rationalize and reduce in real terms Government expenditures\n            in the urban transport sector. The project comprises the\n            following major components: (i) traffic management measures,\n            including steps for improving traffic flow along the three\n            most heavily travelled public transport corridors in the\n            KMR, intersection improvements, and traffic signals; (ii)\n            support for the 7 1/2-year road maintenance program in the\n            KMR; and (iii) technical assistance and training to assist\n            in the execution of the project and to improve management of\n            the KMR urban transport system."}, "docdt": "1984-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
