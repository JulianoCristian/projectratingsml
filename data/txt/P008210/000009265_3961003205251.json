To assist in achieving this goal, the\n            primary objective of the project is to improve and\n            strengthen national and local institutions engaged in the\n            planning, financing, design, and operation of urban\n            transport systems.  In addition, the project will help to\n            increase the efficiency of traffic and transport operations,\n            to preserve the urban transport infrastructure through\n            better maintenance and consequently to assist in reducing\n            user costs and deferring new transport investments.  The\n            project is also expected to contribute to poverty\n            alleviation by facilitating access to public transport by\n            the poor.  The project consists of two parts:  a) an\n            institutional development and policy program; and b) an\n            infrastructure and equipment investment program at the\n            municipal level.  Part A consists of the following\n            components:  (i) an institutional strengthening program for\n            the National Urban Transport Fund (FONTUR); (ii) an\n            institutional strengthening program at the municipal level;\n            (iii) a national urban transport sector training program;\n            (iv) a traffic police program; (v) policy studies; and (vi)\n            preparation of city subprojects.  Part B will provide\n            resources to individual municipalities for urban transport\n            subprojects.  Municipal subprojects will comprise\n            investments in traffic and transport infrastructure and\n            equipment, and associated maintenance programs."}, "docdt": "1993-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
