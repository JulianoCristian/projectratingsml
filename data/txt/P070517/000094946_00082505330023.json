The project has one component, for\n            labor intensive activities of debris collection and solid\n            waste management. With a duration of five months, the\n            project will be divided into three stages: 1) A pilot stage\n            involving one community in the most urgent area of Dili to\n            establish recruitment and related procedures and their\n            effectiveness. This phase will concentrate on the cleaning\n            up of rubble and debris before moving onto refuse removal.\n            2) A second stage involving cleaning of rubble and debris\n            from within some 25 functional villages within Dili. 3) When\n            building-rubble and debris is substantially cleared from\n            within a community attention will focus on the collection\n            and removal of domestic refuse. Benefits from the project\n            will derive from: a) social stabilization established by the\n            provision of short term employment; b) injection of funds\n            caused by wage payments into local communities; c) public\n            health improvements created by environmental enhancement; d)\n            community confidence in reconstruction efforts created by\n            visual impact of cleaning the city; and e) social\n            reintegration within and between communities initiated by\n            community cooperation."}, "docdt": "2000-03-29T00:00:00Z"}
