The outcome of employment generation was\n            highly satisfactory and in fact far surpassed targets.\n            Considering extremely limited institutional capacity, and\n            economic and civil instability at the time the project was\n            implemented, project achievements are noteworthy. Project\n            sustainability is rated as likely, and is related to the\n            government's implementing agency's improved\n            ability to remount a similar safety-net operation in the\n            future (if needed); and the beneficial institutional impact\n            of the project on the development of social capital and\n            government-community linkages. Both World Bank and Borrower\n            performances are assessed as satisfactory overall. Some\n            lessons learned are: Community management structures are a\n            successful implementation arrangement for rapid employment\n            generation and an important mechanism to strengthen bonds of\n            social capital. Rubble collection and waste management, as\n            employment activities, could be expanded to include urban\n            beautification initiatives. Spot checks and other\n            supervisory mechanisms, and transparency in and\n            communicatrion of recruitment procedures and wages are\n            critical to controlling corruption risks. Transition to\n            regular operations requires more atention to developing an\n            longer-term waste management plan. Follow-on vocational\n            education training and employment generation for youth would\n            have been advisable, since youth unemployment is an\n            important cause of future civil unrest and crime."}, "docdt": "2001-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
