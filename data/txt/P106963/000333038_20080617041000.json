Environmental\n            degradation and unsustainable use of natural resources are\n            constraints to sustainable economic growth and poverty\n            reduction. With more than half of its territory situated\n            above 3,000 meters, the country is particularly vulnerable\n            to natural disasters. The environmental challenges in the\n            country, according to the recent National Environmental\n            Action Plan (NEAP) is: (i) land degradation, including\n            deforestation, degradation of pasturelands, arable and\n            irrigated lands; (ii) lack of improved drinking water and\n            water quality deterioration; (iii) waste pollution from\n            agriculture and industry; (iv) deficiencies in sewerage\n            system infrastructure and management; (v) uncollected and\n            untreated solid waste; (vi) environmental hazards and\n            natural disasters caused by floods and drought; (vii) energy\n            supply; and (viii) lack of environmental education."}, "docdt": "2008-05-15T00:00:00Z"}
