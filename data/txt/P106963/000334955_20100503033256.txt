1.       Project Context, Development Objectives, and Design

1.1    Context at Appraisal (brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for
Bank assistance)

Country and sector background. At the time when the operation was being prepared in 2006,
Tajikistan was still recovering from a prolonged civil war that started in 1991 shortly after
independence from the Soviet Union and ended in mid-1997, with the signing of a peace accord.
A long period of political stabilization and consolidation followed. Tajikistan held its first
parliamentary elections in 2005. These resulted in the first non-coalition government since the
end of the hostilities. The United Nations in 2005 declared Tajikistan to have emerged from
post-conflict status.

The extended political consolidation, however, complicated key elements of the economic
transition agenda. As such, Tajikistan had made little progress in the transforming its public
sector from a central planning and state production apparatus into an instrument for encouraging
private investment in human, social, and physical capital. Largely unreformed Soviet era
structures and a poorly paid civil service marred by years of politicization had left the country
with low indicators of government effectiveness and regulatory quality even compared with
other Central Asian states and members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. 1
Remnants of central planning remained in key industries, notably in the cotton sector. Moreover,
private investment averaged a low 5 percent since the end of the civil conflict, due to unfinished
structural reforms and an extremely weak investment climate. Between independence until the
early 2000s, the key social indicators (primary and secondary school enrollment rates, infant
mortality, maternal mortality ratio, total fertility rate, incidence of tuberculosis, and child
malnutrition) declined. Combined with a relatively high population growth rate, this meant that
Tajikistan faced a depreciation of its human capital.

Notwithstanding the gradual political transition, Tajikistan managed to quickly stabilize the
economy by 2000 and undertake exchange rate, price and trade liberalization, financial sector
reform, privatization of small enterprises, and restructuring of land to give family farmers more
secure tenure rights and responsibility for production decisions. Economic growth accelerated to
10.2 percent in 2001 and averaged 7 percent per year through 2005.

The combination of sustained macroeconomic stability and economic growth and the political
consolidation created space for the first time for fundamental reform. The government outlined a
comprehensive program of structural and institutional reform in its first poverty reduction
strategy (PRS) (covering 2002­05), aimed at sustaining growth and reducing poverty. This
strategy centered on (a) accelerating growth, (b) providing basic social services, (c) offering
targeted support for the poor, and (d) improving governance. The government in 2005 requested
technical assistance and financial support from the World Bank and other development partners
to assist in implementing the strategy.

The government implemented the reform program as laid out in the matrix of the First
Programmatic Development Policy Grant (PDPG 1), with a few agreed minor modifications that

responded to changes in country conditions. During 2006 and 2007, Tajikistan's macroeconomic
performance was strong (with a GDP growth rate of 7 percent in 2006 and of 7.8 percent in
2007). Moreover, according to data from the 2007 Tajikistan living standards measurement
survey, poverty had fallen sharply from 83 percent of people living below the poverty line in
1999 to 64 percent so in 2004 to 53 percent there were doing so in 2007. Thus, the government's
overall policy reform agenda appeared to be delivering anticipated development results.

However, in October 2007, the authorities revealed that the National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT),
the country's central bank, had guaranteed at least US$328 million of external loans to Kredit
Invest, an insolvent Tajik private sector non-bank financial institution, ostensibly for cotton
financing. This in effect encumbered all of the country's foreign exchange reserves. In addition,
the NBT provided domestic credits equivalent to about 8 percent of GDP to Kredit Invest,
thereby expanding the supply of base money almost threefold, precipitating a macroeconomic
crisis. Although progress with the agreed reform agenda remained on track, the poor
macroeconomic performance and the corresponding weaknesses in governance in Tajikistan led
the Bank to delay further processing of the PDPG 3 operation until the issues were satisfactorily
addressed. Some members of the country team questioned whether a development policy
operation would be an effective instrument in a context of low capacity and weak governance,
such as in Tajikistan. However, others were encouraged by the track record of the government in
implementing the agreed reform program, and observed that the reforms appeared to be yielding
results. They pointed out that without the PDPG 1­3 operation, the Bank would not have had a
vehicle for focused, cross-sectoral policy dialogue with the authorities. They also argued that
risk of misuse of the funds was nonexistent, since the funds are dedicated to servicing external
debt. Without the development policy operation, they noted, the World Bank in Tajikistan
would have been less effective. The government in late 2008, facing a budget shortfall arising
from the impact of the global economic crisis, asked the Bank for quick-disbursing budget
support to help it to maintain essential social expenditures and other commitments. The
government subsequently agreed on a sound macroeconomic management program under an
International Monetary Fund (IMF) supported Staff-Monitored Program, and the Bank
responded positively to the government's request.

Rationale for World Bank involvement. The World Bank's involvement in supporting the reform
program was valuable for several reasons. First, the Bank's experience with implementing far-
reaching reform programs in post-conflict countries, other countries of the former Soviet Union,
and in Tajikistan itself, helped the government to articulate a reform program that was realistic
and that would be effective in achieving its objectives. For example, previous experience with
the first and second Structural Adjustment Credits showed that progress with reform was
possible even in an environment with weak capacity and little experience with market-driven
economic systems, as long as the reform program was realistic and backed with considerable
technical assistance from development partners. Second, the Bank's experience in working in
partnership with other development partners helped the government mobilize substantial
technical assistance to design and implement reforms. For example, the Swiss government
financed technical assistance to design an external audit function and to draft legislation for its
establishment. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) provided
support with designing and implementing licensing reforms. The IFC Advisory Services project
on Business Enabling Environment/Investment Climate provided technical assistance and
capacity building in private sector development to the government, with funded from the Swiss
                                                2
Secretariat for Economic Affairs and from the U.K.'s Department for International Development
(DFID). The European Commission (EC), DFID, and USAID supported aspects of the
government's public financial management reforms. The EC, through its Civil Service Reform
Project, assisted with the development of a strategy for civil service reform and a job description
system for civil servants. The Asian Development Bank helped to implement cotton sector
reforms. Third, the Bank was able to bring substantial financial resources to the effort,
facilitating sound fiscal management.

Contribution to higher-level objectives. The operation was fully consistent with the Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) for fiscal 2006­09, discussed by the World Bank's Board of
Directors on July 26, 2005. This focuses on three strategic objectives: (a) improve business
opportunities in rural and urban areas, (b) enhance the quality of health and education, and (c)
improve the delivery of energy services and exploit the country's hydropower potential.

The PDPG operation supported all three of the CPS's strategic objectives. To improve business
opportunities in rural and urban areas, the operation supported reforms aimed at streamlining
licensing, inspections, and permits regimes, ensuring greater transparency of the privatization
process, promoting market competition, and improving aviation transport. The operation helped
to enhance the quality of health and education by supporting wage reform and modalities of
sector financing. The operation also supported measures aimed at improving the delivery of
energy services. The operation complemented the Bank's investment projects in public sector
reform, education, health, agriculture, and energy.

The Bank's CPS was itself aligned with the government's second PRS covering 2007­09, which
was under preparation in 2005. This built on the first PRS for 2002­05, and presented the first
three-year plan to operationalize the country's long-term development vision laid out in the
National Development Strategy for 2006­2015. The overarching objective of the PRS 2 is to
promote sustainable improvements in the living standards of the population, particularly of
vulnerable groups. The PRS 2 is organized around three pillars: (a) reforming public sector
management, (b) improving the climate for private sector investment, and (c) developing human
potential.

1.2    Original Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators

The development objectives of the operation were to improve the environment for private sector
development, and to improve overall functioning of the public sector and the delivery of key
public services. The policy matrix in annex 2 of the program documents for PDPG 2 and 3
specified key performance indicators. These were:

       Time and cost to businesses of dealing with licenses falls.
       Number of inspections per enterprise falls.
       Access to Tajikistan by air increases.
       Effectiveness of the government in Tajikistan improves.
       Ratio of salaries between specialist and deputy minister salaries increased.
       Wage bill for primary health care workers rises faster than for other health care workers.

1.3    Revised Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification

The operation's development objectives were not revised during implementation. Some of the
key performance indicators were revised during implementation to reflect changes in the reform
program and to make them more monitorable. For details of these changes see section 1.5.

1.4    Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program:

The operation comprised two pillars each with a number of components. These were:

Pillar 1: Promoting Private Sector Development

Component 1: Maintaining macroeconomic stability.                   This component assisted the
government to maintain a fiscal deficit (excluding externally financed public investment) of no
more than or 0.5 percent of GDP. It was expected that debt relief and public sector reforms
would permit the government to increase spending on social services, and gradually increase
public sector wage levels in line with projected inflation targets.

Component 2: Improving the investment climate. This component supported reforms to
streamline the licensing and inspections systems, increase the transparency of the privatization
process, and promote market competition. Specifically, the operation supported the adoption of
amendments to the licensing law to reduce the number of activities subject to licensing and to
streamline the procedures and implementing regulations. It assisted with the adoption of
legislation and regulations to reduce the burden on business of frequent and arbitrary inspections.
The operation supported the preparation of an audit of privatization transactions by an
independent international auditor to assess compliance with privatization regulations and the
public disclosure of its findings. Finally, to promote free and fair competition in the market
place, the operation supported the adoption of legislation to strengthen the competition law and
the natural monopolies law.

Component 3: Regulatory Reform in key strategic sectors (aviation, cotton, and energy).
To increase access to double-landlocked Tajikistan, the operation supported wide-ranging
reforms of the aviation sector. These included separation of the policy making function from
technical regulation and accident investigation, with the aim of increasing the transparency and
performance of operations. It also involved unbundling Tajik State Airlines to create new
companies, one to operate the state owned airline, one to operate air traffic control, and four to
operate the nation's airports. To revitalize the cotton sector--an important source of export
earnings (15 percent) and income for 75 percent of the rural population--the operation supported
selective reforms in the cotton sector contained in the government's 2005 Cotton Sector Reform
Strategy. These included introduction of a new cotton pricing method (methodica) and
introduction of universal cotton grading standards, both actions intended to improve returns to
farmers. To enhance the functioning and financial viability of the energy utilities (electricity,
gas, and heat), the operation supported key aspects of the government's 2005 energy strategy.
These involved restructuring of the electricity sector by separating the policy making from
commercial operations of Barki Tajik, (b) implementing a schedule for electricity tariff



                                                4
adjustments for 2007­10 to gradually move toward cost recovery levels, and (c) implementing a
social protection measure for the vulnerable groups to ensure access to a basic level of service.

Pillar 2: Improving Public Sector Management and Public Service Delivery

Component 1: Reform of public sector management. To improve the functioning of the
public administration, the operation supported reforms laid out in the government's Public
Administration Reform Strategy, adopted in March 2006. These included support to rationalize
core public administration structures and to implement a new transparent and predictable civil
service wage system, aimed at attracting and retaining qualified staff and at creating improved
career and earnings prospects for public officers. It also involved support for the introduction of
a policy of merit-based recruitment and promotion policy. In addition, the operation supported
implementation of several reforms of public financial management, including adoption and
implementation of a new procurement law, introduction of an MTEF in the education sector,
strengthening of the public internal financial control, and the development of an independent
external audit function.

Component 2: Improving service delivery in health and education. The operation supported
measures articulated in the government's 2005 health strategy to improve incentives for efficient
and effective delivery of health services. These included improving wages for primary health
workers relative to others, aimed at attracting and retaining qualified staff in this important area.
It also involved reintroducing the of basic benefits package, introducing a new job classification
and wage grid system for primary health care workers, and separating funding flows and
accountability mechanisms between primary and secondary care. To improve the efficiency of
resource use in education, the operation supported implementation of a system of per capita
allocation in schools, and measures to increase the authority of schools to hire non-teaching staff
on a contract basis and to allocate their own budgets against the individual line items.

1.5    Revised Policy Areas

The policy areas were not revised.

1.6     Other Significant Changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding
allocations)

The operation's design, scope and scale, and implementation arrangements were not changed
significantly during project execution. However, a number of the prior actions to be supported
under the operation were changed during implementation to reflect changing country
circumstances and early implementation experience. The November 2006 elections led to a shift
in the government's approach to public sector reforms, delaying the adoption of a new
government structure. In response, the Bank replaced the trigger specified in PDPG 1--the
government will adopt a new structure of central ministries and agencies--with a set of measures
related to development and approval of a concept for the structure of the public administration
and measures for its realization. The election also resulted in the reorganization of the State
Financial Control Function--which had been developing its functions as the Supreme Audit

                                                 5
Institution--subsuming its functions into a newly created State Financial Control and Anti-
Corruption Agency. As international good practice calls for a truly independent external audit
function, the Bank and the government agreed on a sequenced set of prior actions in this area to
be included in PDPG 2 and 3.

Several milestones were also dropped or added during the implementation of the operation. The
milestone to assess compliance with the new cotton pricing method was dropped due to a
decision by the government to eliminate the requirement that purchase contracts be registered
with the state-owned commodities exchange. Revelations in late 2007 that the NBT had played a
major role in cotton financing, leading to the encumbrance of nearly all the country's
international reserves, resulted in the addition in PDPG 3 of a milestone demonstrating the end of
the central bank's role in the cotton sector. Two milestones were also added to PDPG 3 to
reflect efforts to address poor governance of energy utilities (submit draft audit of the 2007
financial statements of Barki Tajik and of Tajik Gas to IDA, and implement at Barki Tajik and at
Tajik Gas an agreed financial management improvement program). Several milestones for
reform of health and education were revised during implementation of the program to reflect
adjustments in government's position or slower progress than originally anticipated. The health
sector milestone relating to the reintroduction of the basic benefits package was dropped due to
lack of consensus on the appropriateness of the approach in favor of introducing per capita
financing to a number of pilot rayons. Two education sector milestones were dropped, one
relating to the design and adoption of a new stavka system (teaching load) and one referring to
the adoption of regulations on accountability and financial management at school level.

The operation's schedule was adjusted during implementation. Board approval of PDPG 3 was
delayed by nine months from July 2008 to March 2009, due to a macroeconomic crisis in 2007
that resulted from the NBT's questionable role in providing excessive guarantees for cotton
financing. To tackle the impending macroeconomic crisis, the authorities in late 2007 requested
assistance of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) under a Staff Monitored Program that
would allow the authorities to rebuild its credibility with the international community. The
authorities successfully completed the program in early 2009, allowing processing of PDPG 3 to
resume. The amount of PDPG 3 was increased from US$10 million to US$20 million to assist
the country mitigate the impact of the 2008/09 global financial and economic crisis.

2.     Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1    Program Performance

The government successfully implemented its agreed reform program, although with some
delays. The PDPG series specified a sequenced set of prior actions to be achieved in successive
years, with the first year focusing on laying the foundations for reform (for example, by drafting
and adopting legislation), the second year concentrating on deepening the reforms (for example,
by preparing and adopting implementing regulations), and the third year directing attention on
implementation progress. All but one trigger identified in the policy matrix of the first PDPG
were fulfilled at the end of the program. One trigger was dropped because the elections of
November 2006 prompted a change in the approach for restructuring the public administration
(see section 1.5). One trigger was added to the PDPG 2 policy matrix to reflect government's

                                                6
decision to establish an independent external audit function. Details are presented in the table
below.

2.2       Implementation

Several factors contributed to the satisfactory performance of the operation. The PDPG team
identified the operation's prior actions and triggers through extensive consultation with the
government, with the Bank sector specialists, and with other development partners. The reform
program supported under the operation therefore realistically reflected both the opportunities for
change and the country's capacity to design and implement reforms. Thus, while the reform
program may appear unambitious to those who do not know Tajikistan, it fit the country context
well. The Bank team mobilized substantial technical assistance from two Policy and Human
Resources Development (PHRD) grants and from other development partners to help the
government to design and implement the reform program. 2 It also intensively supervised
implementation of the technical assistance and of progress with developing and implementing
reforms. It learned from early implementation experiences and proactively proposed measures
for overcoming obstacles. For example, the Bank team advised the government on how to
identify and select qualified consultants to assist with aspects of the reforms in licensing,
external audit, aviation, cotton, and budget preparation, among others. Strong teamwork of Bank
staff, including with the International Finance Corporation (IFC), proved effective in

      PHRD grants are provided from a Japanese fund for project preparation, administered by the World Bank.

coordinating a complex reform program, and provided important opportunities for learning what
works and what does not. The Bank team consistently encouraged the leadership, commitment,
and monitoring of progress with the reform program by the Executive Office of the President and
by the various ministries and agencies involved, regularly holding workshops with decision-
makers on key aspects of the reform program, and on the reform program as a whole. The
operations' aide memoires thoroughly described the status of reform actions, and provided
detailed action plans with a timetable for addressing challenges. The Bank's key role in the
development partner coordination group helped in forging consensus among the partners on the
key reforms required for growth and poverty reduction and on effective approaches for
supporting reform.

However, despite consistent progress of the Ministry of Finance and of the sector ministries and
agencies with implementing the agreed reform program, a single factor disrupted the planned
schedule of the operation, delaying by nine months the processing and Board approval of
PDPG 3. This was the macroeconomic mismanagement by the NBT, described in detail in
section 1.5.

2.3    Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

Design. The three program documents included a policy matrix clearly setting out prior actions
for the current operation, the triggers for the subsequent operation, milestones, and expected
outcomes. The outcome indicators were refined after the first PDPG was approved and the
policy matrixes for the subsequent two operations contain generally well-specified outcome
indicators with baseline and target values and clear sources of information for measurement. In
line with good practice, most of the data required to track progress comes from publicly-
available sources of information, rather than from operation-specific surveys. The monitoring
and evaluation framework generally represents good practice.

Implementation. The Bank team closely monitored progress with implementation of the reform
program, discussing each reform area with the authorities during each PDPG mission. Detailed
aide memoires reported on progress, on challenges, and agreed measures for moving forward.
Sector specialists carried on the dialogue with the authorities in their respective areas, and
reported on progress with implementation and on outcomes to the PDPG team.

Utilization. The government and Bank teams used the monitoring information to identify areas
of particular challenge and to develop measures to address them. Specifically, the teams noted
during preparation of PDPG 3 the slow progress with implementing the licensing and inspections
legislation, and proposed additional technical assistance from USAID and the IFC to identify and
overcome the obstacles. The technical specialists undertook a detailed review of the draft
implementing regulations to identify inconsistencies with the law. They then provided specific
drafting help to bring the regulations into consistency with the law. Similarly, the teams
observed the difficulties the government was having in advancing the medium-term expenditure
framework in education, and identified an international expert with experience in the area who
could provide timely advice in addressing challenges. The teams will draw on the outcome
information in designing the next programmatic development policy loan series, tailoring support
in ways that are likely to achieve results.

2.4    Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation

The Minister of Finance in a letter dated May 22, 2009 requested continued budget support from
the Bank to help finance a significant budget gap resulting from the global economic crisis. The
Bank has agreed in principle to assist the government with a proposed new series of three
development policy operations, Programmatic Development Policy Operation (PDPO) 4­6. The
Bank team has agreed with the government on the broad policy areas of the new operation and
on the specific reforms to be supported under PDPO 4. The proposed new operation will help to
mitigate the immediate impact of the global economic crisis and to deepen reforms to support
growth over the medium term. It will provide budget support to enable the government to
protect its expenditures for essential social services. It will also support the government's
medium-term reform agenda, aimed at deepening reforms that have been initiated under the
previous operation to support economic recovery and growth, while addressing emerging
challenges. Board approval of PDPO 4 is anticipated in the first half of 2010.

3.     Assessment of Outcomes

3.1     Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

Overall rating: Satisfactory

PDPG 1: Satisfactory, PDPG 2: Satisfactory, PDPG 3: Satisfactory

Objectives. The program's overall objectives were, and remain, relevant. They reflect the
importance of stimulating private sector investment for growth and jobs creation and to improve
overall functioning of the public sector and the delivery of key public services to achieve
development results. As mentioned in section 1.1, the operation's objectives are consistent with
the objectives of Tajikistan's PRS 2 2007­09 and with the Bank's CPS for fiscal 2006­09, both
of which recognize private sector development and improved public sector management as goals.

Design. The design was and remains relevant. The program included only reform actions to
which the government was committed, leaving others for the future, once commitment grows.
Therefore, it supported regulatory streamlining, but not reform of Talco (previously TadAZ), the
state-owned aluminum company. While avoiding areas where success was not likely, the
program nonetheless covered very difficult areas where some opportunity for change existed.
Thus, the program supported cotton sector reform--a difficult area--but one in which the
government recognized change was needed because of a large and unsustainable build up of
cotton sector debt. In addition, the program supported policy reforms in areas where the Bank or
other development partners could provide technical assistance, where the analytical basis was
adequate, and where a government strategy for moving forward existed. In addition, it stayed
away from areas covered by other development partners. For example, the reforms of roads and
railways policies are not covered because the Asian Development Bank has been taking the lead
in these areas. It did not support reform of the customs regime because USAID is leading in this
area. The design also included realistic triggers and targets, well adapted to the weak capacity of

                                                10
the country, which nevertheless proved challenging to achieve and would help the country
achieve its desired results.

Implementation. Implementation arrangements were relevant. The Ministry of Finance was the
executing agency because of the importance of general budget support for managing the fiscal
framework. The Executive Office of the President was appropriately the implementing agency,
because of its key role in coordinating policy within government. The State Advisor for
Economic Policy was suitably responsible for coordinating actions among the ministries and
agencies involved and for monitoring and reporting on progress. He was sufficiently senior to
push reforms forward whenever they stalled. Arrangements for carrying forward specific
reforms worked well. The presidential administration was responsible for implementing the
public sector reforms. The line ministries involved (energy, education, health, agriculture, and
transportation) were accountable for implementing the sectoral reforms specified in the reform
program. The State Committee for Investment and State Property Management (SCISPM) was
responsible for overseeing specific policy actions related to private sector development. The
Ministry of Economy and Trade oversaw implementation of anti-monopoly and competition
policy.

3.2      Achievement of Operation Development Objectives

Overall rating: Satisfactory

PDPG 1: Satisfactory, PDPG 2: Satisfactory, PDPG 3: Satisfactory

The operation achieved its development objectives of improving the environment for private sector
development, and improving overall functioning of the public sector and the delivery of key public
services. The outcome indicators have been achieved. Specifically:

      The time to businesses of dealing with licenses fell. The time required for an average
      small and medium enterprise (SME) to obtain a license fell significantly from 12.3 days in
      2005 to 6.6 days in 2007, according to the IFC's surveys of SMEs in Tajikistan, carried out
      in 2005 and 2007.3 See table 2 below. This exceeds the original target value of 8 days.

     This encouraging performance is corroborated with data from other sources. Tajikistan was
     named a top ten performer in IFC's Doing Business 2010, and its rank jumped from 164 (of
     183 economies) in the 2009 survey to 152 in the 2010 edition. Improvements were
     particularly noteworthy in ease of starting a business and in protecting investors (see table 3
     below). In addition, the 2009 Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey
     reports that the percentage of firms naming business licensing and permits to be a problem
     has declined from 43 percent of firms in 2005 to 36 percent of firms in 2008.5 However,
     despite the improvements, Tajikistan is still in the bottom quartile of the economies covered
     in Doing Business and has a long way to go to offer an attractive place to do business to
     investors.

     The burden on businesses of dealing with inspections fell. The number of inspections per
     enterprise fell from 13 inspections per enterprise in 2005 to 7 inspections in 2007.6

     Access to Tajikistan by air increased. The number of passengers traveling through the
     international airport in Dushanbe has been rising steadily since 2004 (see table 5). The
     number of flights and of airlines operating regularly scheduled flights to Dushanbe also rose
     significantly. However, the costs and convenience of air travel are still worse in Tajikistan
     than in most countries in the region, as the government still places significant restrictions on
     foreign airlines wishing to serve the country to limit competition with the state-owned
     carrier and the new domestic private carrier.

   Effectiveness of the government in Tajikistan improved. Tajikistan's score for
   government effectiveness rose from 3.01 in 2005 to 3.38 in 2009, according to the World
   Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Report. This exceeds the original target value of
   3.37. Actions supported under the PDPG 1­3 that have contributed to improved
   government effectiveness include establishment of more transparent public procurement
   system and stronger procedures of internal control and audit. Despite the improvements,
   Tajikistan's rank for government effectiveness is very low at 122 of 134 countries; and it is
   classified as at only the first of three stages of development.

   Salaries in the public service became more closely linked to levels of responsibility and
   complexity of job. To better reward those that hold positions of higher complexity and
   responsibility, the government in 2007 through its annual wage decree increased the ratio in
   pay between specialist and deputy minister to 1 to 3.5 (from 1:2.4). The government in
   2008 increased the ratio in pay between specialist and department head to 1 to 4 (from 1:2).
   This meets the original target values. This reform is expected to attract better qualified
   people to senior positions in the government, and eventually to enhance government
   effectiveness.

   The wage bill for primary health care workers rose faster than for other health care
   workers. The government during 2006, 2007, and 2008, through its annual wage decrees
   increased the wages of primary health service providers at a greater rate than for other health
   professionals. Specifically:
    2006: 60 percent for primary health service providers, 40 percent for others
    2007: 54 percent for primary health service providers, 46 percent for others.
    2008: 70 percent for primary health service providers, 50 percent for others.

   The asymmetry in the increases was somewhat less than originally targeted, due to a delay
   in implementation of the basic benefits package and in the institutionalization of out-of-
   pocket payments for certain types of medical treatment. Higher wages for primary health
   service providers is expected to attract and retain better qualified professionals to serve in
   primary health centers. Over the longer term, this is expected to lead to greater access to
   health services of inhabitants in rural and remote areas, and therefore to greater equity in
   access to health services.




                                                       13
Outcomes in areas other than the program's core policy areas were also notable. Specifically,

     The privatization process became more transparent. Information on asset sales,
     including sales prices, name of bidders, and name of winner was published in the newspaper
     and posted on the SCISPM website.

     Compliance of the authorities with the rules governing the privatization process
     improved. Compliance improved over each of the three years of the privatization program,
     as demonstrated in each successive in-depth review of compliance starting with the review
     of the 2004 privatizations. The findings of the compliance were posted on the SCISPM
     website.

     Efficiency in resource allocation in general education in the pilot districts improved.
     The student to teacher ratio increased from 17.8 to 1 in January 2005 to 20 to 1 in January
     2009. Over the same period, the share of wages in education expenditures fell from 92
     percent to 71 percent, freeing resources for improving the quality of education. In addition,
     the teacher to teaching load (stavka) ratio declined from 1.46 in 2007 to 1.34 in 2009, and
     the student to stavka ratio increased from 13.2 to 15 over the same period.8 Achievements
     exceed the program's original targets.

     Transparency of rules for cotton grading and pricing increased. Tajik Standards in
     2008 registered universal cotton grading standards for use by firms. A firm jointly owned
     by the Ministry of Agriculture and Wakefield (a U.K. based cotton grading firm) graded
     some 64 percent (70,000 of 110,000 metric tons) of the 2008 crop in accordance with
     universal cotton grading standards. In addition, transparency in pricing almost certainly
     improved, due to the issuance of a presidential decree establishing a new method of
     determining the ex-gin price of cotton to replace all others. However, monitoring the
     implementation of the cotton pricing method through a review of contracts registered with
     the state-owned commodity exchange proved not possible because the government
     restructured the exchange and eliminated its role in registering contracts.
         
     Financial viability of Barki-Tajik and Tajik Gas increased and efficiency of energy
     services improved. Customer payments at the utilities improved and total losses (defined
     as unaccounted for energy) declined (table 6). Improvement in the financial viability and
     efficiencies of the energy utilities is expected in the medium term to result in greater
     reliability of and access to modern energy services in Tajikistan.

    Government budget credibility improved. The deviation in aggregate expenditure
    outturn compared with the original approved budget declined from 9 percent in 2005 to 8
    percent in 2007 to 5.7 percent in 2008, according to the Ministry of Finance.

    Procurement practices became more transparent. A new law on procurement was
    adopted in March 2006. Standard bidding documents were adopted in 2007. Procurement
    offices in seven government entities (ministries of health, education, justice, industry and
    energy, agriculture, and the SCISPM, and the mayor's office) were established, and certified
    staff appointed to operate them. All are now procuring goods and services, with that of the
    Ministry of Education being most active (it is procuring goods and services using both under
    both government and development partner funds). A Public Procurement Agency
    restructured to the Agency on Procurement of Goods, Works, and Services, and
    Organization of Stock Exchange Activity is monitoring activities of the seven agencies and
    preparing quarterly reports.

    The institutional framework for internal financial control, including internal audit,
    improved. An internal financial management control department for the first time is
    functioning at the Ministry of Finance and internal audit units are functioning at four line
    ministries (Ministry of Education, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry
    of Labor and Social Protection of the Population), and one agency (Tax Committee). While
    these departments are still new, they are expected in the medium term to strengthen
    managerial accountability and transparency of the execution of the budget.

The program's outcomes indicators are presented in annex 2.

3.3   Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)

Rating      S

Achievement of the objectives of the operation is rated satisfactory. The operation objectives,
design, and implementation arrangements were and remain relevant. The operation achieved its
intended outcomes. High relevance and satisfactory achievement of objectives justifies an
overall outcome rating of satisfactory for the operation.

3.4      Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)

(a)    Poverty impacts, gender aspects, and social development

The program documents noted that the operation drew on several pieces of Bank-led analytical
work for its design that were aimed at deepening understanding of poverty and social dynamics.
Poverty and social impact assessments of cotton and energy reforms helped in promoting
dialogue with the government on issues of social protection. Measures to effectively strengthen
the social safety net is now a matter of priority concern to the government, and is a potential area
of support under the proposed PDPG 4­6 operation. A poverty assessment update has deepened
understanding of poverty and its dynamics, and helped to influence the design of policy reforms
in the cotton, energy, health, and education sectors. Improved public services will certainly
benefit low-income people, women, and other marginalized groups, as they are the least able to
afford private substitutes.

(b)    Institutional change/strengthening (particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term
capacity and institutional development)

The operation helped to bring about key policy and institutional reforms in multiple areas. To
promote private sector development, it helped to reduce the regulatory burden on business
through support for changes in licensing and inspections legislation and for strengthening of the
SCISPM (under the PHRD grant) to carry out periodic reviews of its implementation. It
supported significant change in the institutional set-up of the aviation sector, supporting the
separation of policy making from technical regulation and accident investigation, and the
unbundling Tajik State Airlines. This has created the foundation for more competitive, efficient,
reliable, and safe aviation services. The operation has also assisted major institutional change in
the energy sector by helping to bring about separation of policy making from commercial
operations at Barki Tajik and adjustments in electricity tariffs during 2007­2010 to gradually
move toward cost recovery levels. It helped foster reform in cotton sector institutions by
supporting changes in pricing and grading practices, both aimed at enhancing transparency and
improving returns for farmers. In addition, the operation supported changes to Tajikistan's
competition and natural monopolies legislation and regulations, designed to create an
environment conducive to new private investment. While much more needs to be done to create
an attractive climate for investment in Tajikistan, each of these reforms is helping to lay the
foundation for deeper change in the future.

To improve the functioning of the public administration and enhance service delivery, it
supported the development and adoption of a concept and an action plan for improving the
structure of Tajikistan's public administration. This lays the basis for restructuring of the public
administration over the next few years into a modern, performance-oriented civil service. It has
also supported revisions in wages for civil servants and for education and health service
providers, aimed at improving incentives for performance. In public financial management, it
has supported important changes in procurement, internal control, external audit, and budget
management. Changes in procurement practices are especially noteworthy; the operation has
supported preparation and adoption of a new law on procurement, formulation and approval of a

                                                16
set of standard bidding documents, and establishment of procurement offices in seven
government entities (ministries of health, education, justice, industry and energy, agriculture, and
the SCISPM, and the mayor's office). It also supported creation of the Public Procurement
Agency, which is monitoring activities of the seven agencies and preparing quarterly reports.
Although public procurement under the new institutional arrangements began only in 2009,
based on experience in other counties, these reforms can be expected to enhance the transparency
of procurement. Reforms of internal controls are also significant, with the establishment of a
functioning internal financial management control department at the ministries of finance, health,
education, agriculture, labor and social protection, and the tax committee. Still, Tajikistan will
have to implement much deeper and more far-reaching reforms to create an effective public
service and improve its ranking for government effectiveness relative to other countries of the
region.

4.      Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

 Rating     M

PDPG 1: Moderate, PDPG 2: Moderate, PDPG 3: Moderate

Both government commitment to the overall reform agenda and its capacity to implement
reforms are uneven. However, the global economic slowdown and the pressure it brings for
sustainable fiscal and macroeconomic management has perhaps strengthened commitment to
reform, because many of the structural rigidities responsible for a poor investment climate (for
example, burdensome business regulation, an uncompetitive aviation sector) and subsidies of the
past for favored industries, such as Talco, are increasingly seen as no longer affordable.
Government's decision to seek support from the IMF under the Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility also indicates a commitment to put into place sounder practices of economic
management. However, Tajikistan's macroeconomic situation remains fragile, as a result both of
recent imprudent central bank guarantees which have added to the government's debt burden and
of the impact of the global financial crisis which has adversely affected the level of workers'
remittances and prices of key exports, such as aluminum. Although the program's outcome
targets have been met, Tajikistan is still considered to be among the least reformed and most
poorly performing transition economies, and still has a considerable way to go in order to unlock
it's promising economic potential. Tajikistan has not yet built up a system of strong independent
and accountable political institutions or established a strong governance framework that might
otherwise anchor needed reforms. Given the current economic conditions, the pace of reform is
likely to remain gradual, although it is likely that the progress made will be consolidated rather
than reversed. The sustainability of some areas of reform, however, is at more at risk than
others, as described below.

The risk to the improvement in the investment climate is moderate to significant. The risk
of an increase in the burden of licenses and inspections for business is moderate. The

                                                17
government has demonstrated its commitment to the reforms by implementing actions that
resulted in Tajikistan being named a top-ten performer in Doing Business 2010. In addition, the
government conducted a review of implementation in 2009 to assess progress, and to identify
areas where more work needs to be done. The current status of regulatory reforms and next steps
are a regular topic of discussion of the Investment Council and other government-development
partner forums. Moreover, in July 2009, the government launched "200 Days of Reform" with
the aim of further improving the business environment and making Tajikistan more attractive to
private investors. This identified streamlining the permits system and facilitating access to the
licenses, permits, and other documents required to start a business as key next steps in the reform
process. The government has established the Permits Review Commission to oversee the
implementation of the guillotine process to eliminate unnecessary permits. It has also
established a one-stop-shop in 50 of the country's 68 tax inspectorates (including Dushanbe) to
enable entrepreneurs to receive the information, forms, and other services they need to start and
grow a business. However, bureaucratic resistance to reforms at ministries and agencies and at
subnational levels of government that threaten income raised from issuing licenses, permits, and
related documents remains high. This resistance is likely to be particularly intense where
officials are able to use their discretionary powers to obtain informal payments, or to protect
state-owned or other politically significant business interests from competition. Moreover,
streamlining of regulations is only one element of the overall investment climate. Other
important factors named by businesses are the unreliability of energy supplies, high-cost
transportation services, a heavy tax burden, and poor governance. These factors may be
responsible for the persistently large role of the state in the economy--as shown by recent
analytical work undertaken for the forthcoming Country Economic Memorandum--which itself
could have a potentially dampening effect on the investment climate for the private sector.

The risk to reform in the cotton, aviation, and energy sectors is moderate to significant.
People who benefit from the current situation may resist reforms that threaten their interests.
However, the government appears committed to continuing the reforms, due to the significant
economic benefits that are likely to result from change and to support from development partners
that has bolstered reformers and helped to build capacity for implementation. With respect to the
cotton sector, the government has instituted far-ranging reforms, starting in 2008. It announced
in 2008 that farmers have full freedom to choose what to grow and where to market it. Although
still not fully implemented, progress is being made in reducing government interference in
agriculture, particularly in non-cotton growing areas. The government adopted in May 2009 a
cotton debt resolution strategy aimed at relieving small farmers of debt, which it is now
implementing. It expects to issue debt write-off certificates for all eligible farmers by early
2010. However , the Tajikistan Bureau of Standards, which was expected to withdraw from of
cotton grading to avoid a potential conflict of interest and pave the way for the introduction of
the internationally recognized universal cotton-grading standard has recently reentered the
business.

With regard to aviation services, the six firms unbundled from Tajik Air are functioning
successfully. According to the officials of the Ministry of Transport, most are performing well
enough to meet their debt-service obligations and pay dividends to the government. In addition,
the introduction of higher salaries at the firms that reflect the comparatively higher levels of
productivity that have been made possible by the reorganization has boosted morale in the sector

                                                18
and support for the reform. The unbundling has also revealed the very low levels of productivity
at Tajik Air compared with Somon air, which is bringing pressure for managerial improvements
at Tajik Air. As the next step in aviation reform, the government is in the final stages of
adopting a draft aviation policy with the objective of ensuring that aviation services are able to
make their maximum contribution to the nation's economic development.

In the field of energy services, the government is starting to implement international financial
reporting standards at Barki Tajik and Tajik Gas. This multi-year effort will enable the energy
utilities to improve their internal controls and management of their fixed assets and revenues.
The government has also steadily increased electricity tariffs in line with an agreed schedule,
with the aim of achieving full cost recovery by 2010. However, this policy objective is likely to
remain elusive as long as the major consumer Talco receives highly favorable tariffs compared
with other users. Given the potential strength of the counter pressures to reform, continuous
support from the central government and from development partners will be required to maintain
the gains and ensure further progress.

The risk to benefits of improving transparency of the privatization process and enhancing
competition is low to negligible. The privatization process is complete, so lack of transparency
of the process is no longer a concern. The risk to reforms to enhance competition is moderate,
due more to a lack of capacity than of government commitment. The satisfactory rating in this
policy area reflects the fact that the formal target has been achieved. However, the expectation
that the role of the state in the economy would be reduced has not been met. According to the
draft Country Economic Memorandum, state-owned enterprises account for 30 percent of formal
employment in Tajikistan although they comprise only 15 percent of enterprises. State-owned
enterprises on average have three times the number of employees (101) as private firms have
(31). The number of state-owned enterprises is also growing, although not as quickly as private
firms. Although not a policy area covered in the PDPG 1­3 series, the risk of established and
new state-owned enterprises crowding out private sector investment in key sectors appears
significant. The role of state-owned enterprises in the economy will require further study to
ascertain whether it may be an obstacle to future growth.

The risk to public sector reform and improving public service delivery is moderate. The
risk to reforms of the public administration is moderate. While more slowly than expected, the
government has steadily implemented the reforms with support for capacity building provided
under the Bank-financed Public Sector Reform Project. This project will continue to support the
government in its efforts to reform the public administration. Risks to strengthening of public
financial management are also moderate. The government has demonstrated commitment to
reform in this area, and slow progress is more a matter of weak capacity than of lack of will. The
Bank-financed Public Financial Management Modernization Project and the EC-financed Civil
Service Reform Project will continue to support the required capacity building in this area.

The risk to envisaged reforms of health and education services is moderate. The reforms
supported under the operation have been institutionalized within the government, and are not
likely to be reversed. Bank and other development partner support are continuing to assist the
government develop the capacity it needs to maintain and build on the achievements. However,
overcoming the problems of absenteeism and related poor service delivery, as long as the pay

                                               19
scales for educational and medical workers remain so far below the incomes of migrant workers,
will remain extremely challenging.

5.      Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1    Bank Performance

(a)    Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry (i.e., performance through lending phase)

 Overall Rating      S

PDPG 1: Moderately satisfactory, PDPG 2: Satisfactory, PDPG 3: Satisfactory

QAG at entry September 7, 2007.

The Bank's overall performance in ensuring quality at entry was satisfactory. The Bank's
performance in identification was satisfactory. By early 2005, when the first operation in the
series was under consideration, the government had established a track record of reform in key
areas. It had in 2002 produced a PRS covering 2002­05, the first member of the Commonwealth
of Independent States to do so. By early 2005, the government was preparing to formulate its
second PRS. It had also successfully completed the Bank-financed First and Second Structural
Adjustment Grant for 1998­2000 and 2001­04, and the IMF-supported Enhanced Structural
Adjustment Facility/Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (1998­2001) and the second PRGF
arrangement (2002­05). Moreover, the government had indicated its commitment to a deeper set
of reforms in a number of areas aimed at improving the investment climate and at the efficiency
and effectiveness of the public sector. It requested in 2005 support from the Bank to implement
the reforms through a programmatic development policy series of three operations. The Bank
responded appropriately, mobilizing technical assistance to help design and implement reforms
from a PHRD grant and other development partners.

The Bank's performance in preparation and appraisal of the first operation in the programmatic
series was moderately satisfactory. It was fully satisfactory in preparation and appraisal of the
subsequent operations. Each of the operations' designs was based on extensive Bank analytic
and advisory activities. These included a public expenditure and institutional review, a public
and civil service wage note and an update, and a remittances note, which informed the design of
the policy actions aimed at improving public sector management and delivery of services. An
investment climate assessment, an aviation sector note, and an energy utility reform review
highlighted key reforms required to attract private sector investment. A 2005 cotton sector
review highlighted the importance of revising the cotton grading standards and the cotton pricing
method to improve returns to farmers. A 2005 energy utility sector review and a 2006 poverty
and social impact analysis of options to mitigate the impact of rising tariffs on the poor informed
the design of the energy sector reforms. The operation was also grounded in various government
sector strategies. For example the government's 2006 public administration reform strategy
provided the basis for the operation's public sector reform policy actions. Its 2005 health sector
strategy provided the framework for the reforms in the health sector. The government's energy

                                                20
strategy and its cotton sector reform strategy (both of 2005) guided the reforms in these areas.
The Bank PDPG team included staff from the relevant sectors, who were leading the dialogue in
their areas of expertise. The program documents candidly assessed the risks the operation would
face and identified adequate mitigation measures to protect the Bank's reputation and to preserve
the gains from the policy reforms should challenges emerge. They also provided a detailed
assessment of potential environmental impacts from the reforms, demonstrating that the impacts
were not likely to be significant. The operations' designs also reflected lessons learned from
experience in Tajikistan, in other post-conflict states, and in other countries of the region
undertaking a reform program with the assistance of budget support. The operation had well-
specified triggers that reflected well weak capacity of the country in several reform areas. The
monitoring and evaluation framework contained generally well-specified outcome indicators and
baseline and target values.

A Quality Assurance Group (QAG) Quality at Entry Review conducted for PDPG 1 rated quality
at entry as moderately satisfactory. It rated risk assessment as highly satisfactory, and structural;
financial and macroeconomic aspects; poverty, gender and social aspects; environmental aspects;
and implementation arrangements as satisfactory. It rated strategic relevance and approach,
fiduciary aspects, and policy and institutional aspects as moderately satisfactory. It rated only
Bank inputs and processes as moderately unsatisfactory. Because several dimensions of the
operation were fully satisfactory, QAG regarded the program as likely to succeed.

QAG highlighted several strong aspects of quality at entry. These included (a) very good
analytical work up front in some areas, for example the poverty and social impact assessment for
the cotton sector, and private sector surveys to identify key areas for reform (business
inspections and licensing); (b) a very realistic set of triggers and targets, well adapted to the
weak capacity of the country in several reform areas, although less so on public sector reforms;
(c) the good engagement with the government; (d) the inclusion of staff across the relevant
sectors and the with experience in the country; (e) the decision to address governance
improvements through specific reforms in sectors (cotton, aviation) identified as having severe
governance weaknesses, which constitutes excellent practice; (f) the strong political analysis,
which is good practice, and provides excellent context for what first appears as unambitious
reforms, explaining what is possible and the risks involved.

QAG also noted several areas that needed improvement. These were (a) a disconnect between
overly ambitious objectives specified in the program document and the limited reforms
proposed, however this is not translated into unrealistic triggers, with the exception of those
related to public sector management; (b) a failure of the program document to provide the
broader picture for the reforms and to give adequate information on what other donors are doing,
which makes the selection of triggers appear ad hoc (QAG pointed out that the interview with the
team revealed that in fact this is not the case, and was mainly a presentational weakness); (c) the
expectation for the pace of public sector management reforms was very unrealistic, however, the
experience gained through earlier interventions and from actual implementation of this operation,
combined with gradual improvements in domestic capacity, would lead to a reform program
which, in time, could have substantial and durable impact.




                                                 21
Although, QAG's assessment was not available until after PDPG 2 had been presented to the
Board, the team had already addressed the key weaknesses noted by QAG in preparation of the
subsequent operations, the most important of which were that the prior actions and triggers for
public sector management were made much more realistic.

(b)    Quality of Supervision (including M&E arrangements)

 Overall Rating     S

PDPG 1: Satisfactory, PDPG 2: Satisfactory, PDPG 3: Satisfactory

Each operation in the programmatic series was approved based on the fulfillment of prior
actions, so supervision was technically not necessary. Nonetheless, the Bank team maintained a
continuous dialogue with policy makers and technical staff on progress towards agreed triggers
for each subsequent operation. The team also regularly discussed aspects of the reform program
with other development partners to ensure that all were working towards a common goal. The
team responded proactively to challenges as soon as they arose and offered pragmatic and
effective solutions to them. For example, the team helped the government to mobilize technical
assistance to help design an independent external audit function and to separate the financial
accounts of the seven firms to be unbundled from Tajik State Airlines.

The Bank's sector specialists closely monitored progress with actions being supported under
their projects. The Bank team responded flexibly to changing country circumstances and early
implementation experience. Thus, it agreed to adjust the timetable for prior actions related to
restructuring of the central government administration to allow time for the newly elected
government to decide on its approach. The program documents for the second and third
operations described in detail what adjustments were being made to the prior actions and
triggers, and why the changes were needed.

Having one staff member serve in the role as task team leader for the series greatly assisted with
maintaining consistency of the dialogue. The two country directors, two sector managers, and
two country managers that served during the time the operation was under implementation
actively helped in ensuring that the project remained on track to meet its objectives.

Outcomes and indicators were well-specified in the program documents for PDPG 2 and 3. The
Bank team regularly sought data on progress towards the outcomes throughout the nearly four
years of implementation, and reflected available information in the implementation supervision
reports.

(c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

 Rating     S

PDPG 1: Satisfactory, PDPG 2: Satisfactory, PDPG 3: Satisfactory

The Bank's overall performance was satisfactory. In lending, the Bank responded to the
government's request to support its reform program under a programmatic development policy
                                               22
operation. Drawing on extensive Bank analytical work and lessons learned from other post-
conflict countries and other countries of the region, it advised the government on effective
approaches to reform. It also mobilized substantial technical assistance to enable the government
to overcome capacity constraints in designing and implementing reforms.

In supervision, the Bank maintained a close dialogue with policy makers, technical staff, and
development partners throughout the nearly four years of implementation. The Bank responded
proactively and effectively to find solutions to challenges. A rating of satisfactory for ensuring
quality at entry and a rating of satisfactory for supervision justify an overall rating of satisfactory
for Bank performance.

justification only for Overall Borrower Performance.

           indistinguishable

(a)    Government Performance

 Rating      MS

PDPG 1: Moderately satisfactory, PDPG 2: Moderately satisfactory, PDPG 3: Satisfactory

The government's performance was moderately satisfactory. Government commitment to the
overall reform program as laid out in the policy matrix of the PDPG operation was strong,
although it was stronger in some areas than in others. The government appointed a senior
official in the Executive Office of the President to coordinate the overall reform program and to
serve as the main point of contact for the Bank team. It also appointed government officials
within the participating ministries or agencies to oversee implementation of sector-specific
reforms. This greatly facilitated communication and monitoring of progress by the Bank team.
Key officials in the Executive Office of the President helped to catalyze adoption of key policies,
legislation, and regulations whenever individual ministries or agencies sought their assistance.
The government also helped to overcome capacity weaknesses in implementation by mobilizing
support from development partners and supporting various implementation reviews.

However, the government's commitment to maintaining overall macroeconomic stability (and
thus an enabling environment) was unsatisfactory, as demonstrated by the macroeconomic crisis
brought about by the inappropriate involvement of the NBT in guaranteeing cotton sector debt.
One of the conditions for accessing funding under the PDPG operations is that the government
maintains a stable macroeconomic environment. That it did not, resulted in a delay of nine
months in the processing of PDPG 3. Although the government has taken decisive action to
address the crisis, the inability of the authorities to maintain sound macroeconomic management
throughout the implementation period results in an overall rating for government performance of
moderately satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency Performance

 Rating     S

PDPG 1: Satisfactory, PDPG 2: Satisfactory, PDPG 3: Satisfactory

The performance of the Executive Office of the President was satisfactory. Top officials of the
office generally provided the required leadership to motivate and guide the sector ministries and
agencies in designing and implementing reforms. The program coordinator performed ably
throughout implementation, regularly monitoring progress with the reforms to identify obstacles
when they arose and quickly resolve them. He also communicated effectively with top decision
makers, technical staff at the ministries and agencies, and the Bank team. He used the convening
power of the office to push forward reforms that had stalled. He also explained to the Bank team
what reforms were possible and which were not in a given timeframe, to ensure that the reform
program was challenging but achievable.

The performance of the participating ministries and agencies was mixed. Weak performance
was due primarily to a lack of capacity. However, some entities also lacked motivation, as
undertaking reforms is a difficult challenge, yet would bring no immediate benefits in the form
of a higher budget allocation. Nonetheless, all performed as expected, once given the mandate
by the Office of the President and provided with the necessary technical assistance to overcome
capacity constraints.

(c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

 Rating     MS

PDPG 1: Moderately Satisfactory, PDPG 2: Moderately Satisfactory, PDPG 3: Satisfactory

The overall performance of the borrower was moderately satisfactory. The government
demonstrated its commitment to the program, from identification of the reform program laid out
in the policy matrix of the first operation to successful completion of each operation's prior
actions. It facilitated the adoption of key policies, legislation, and regulations, and promoted
their implementation. However, the government failed to manage the macroeconomic
framework soundly, precipitating a macroeconomic crisis that is still being resolved with the
help of the IMF, the Bank, and other development partners.

The Executive Office of the President performed satisfactorily, intervening when necessary to
resolve implementation challenges. The program coordinator performed capably throughout
implementation, monitoring progress and communicating effectively with stakeholders. A rating
of moderately satisfactory for government performance and of satisfactory for implementing
agency performance results in an overall rating of moderately satisfactory for Borrower
performance.

6.     Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)


                                               24
   Achieving development results is possible if interventions are designed on the basis
   of a good understanding of Tajikistan's political economy and the Bank is willing to
   be flexible in identifying the reform program that it will support. Tajikistan's
   political economy is complex. At the time when the PDPG 1­3 series was being
   designed, Tajikistan had undergone a major political and economic upheaval, starting
   with independence from the ex-Soviet Union that unleashed a shift in the balance of
   power among ethnic and regionally-based groups and led to violent civil conflict. The
   conflict came to an end with the signing of a peace accord that offered the various
   factions access to power and resources. The government's commitment to reform was
   initially constrained by the need to maintain peace and accommodate the interests of the
   different ethnically based politicians that benefited from the status quo. Parastatal
   management of broad swathes of the economy further politicized economic decision-
   making. Areas in which reform would have potentially high impact, such as actions to
   resolve cotton sector debt, or to enhance financial transparency and reform Talco, the
   largest state enterprise, were deliberately left out of the program, because of a lack of
   government commitment to bring about the necessary improvements The achievements
   under the PDGP series are due largely to the creativeness of the Bank team in identifying
   entry points for reform, and then in giving reformers the support they needed through
   dialogue, analytical work, and technical assistance. The aviation sector is a good
   example of an area that reformers within government were initially unwilling to directly
   tackle because of powerful interests that were indirectly benefiting from the state's
   monopoly despite the low productivity in the industry. The Bank team bolstered the
   reformers by preparing an aviation sector note that quantified the benefits of reform and
   that laid out a road map for change that would not lead to initial job losses. It then
   maintained a constant dialogue on the issue with those decision-makers best able to take
   long-term, macro view of the economy, rather than with those close to the operations of
   the state-owned airline. The restructuring of the industry into a number of separate
   operating units is now providing information on the wide variations in financial
   performance and productivity of individual firms, stimulating efficiency improvements
   and creating opportunities for new entrants to the industry. It is also creating an internal
   consensus on the need for further reform.

   Having in place a good monitoring and evaluation framework promotes a better
   dialogue improves government coordination and helps in monitoring
   implementation and progress towards expected outcomes. The misreporting of
   foreign loan guarantees by the NBT, which led to a delay in the processing of the PDGP3
   operation, underscored the need for a robust monitoring and evaluation framework to
   guard against weaknesses in the governance framework and promote confidence among
   stakeholders that the reform program is on track. The program documents of the
   operation (especially PDPG 2 and 3) contained in the policy matrixes well-specified
   policy actions and clear monitorable outcome indicators, baseline and target values, and
   sources of information for tracking progress. In turn, the greater attention paid to these
   indicators has encouraged stakeholders to scrutinize official data more carefully and has
   created a demand for improvements in the quality and timeliness of government statistics.
   The use of independent surveys and assessments, such as IFC's Doing Business
   indicators for assessing progress in the private sector reform agenda, and the Global

                                           25
   Competitiveness Index of the World Economic Forum for assessing the effectiveness of
   government further contributed to stakeholder confidence in the assessment framework
   used in the PDPG operation. The focus on results is helping to strengthen the governance
   environment for the reform program and to change the dialogue with government and
   other stakeholders from a narrow focus on the necessity, timing, and strength of
   particular steps along the reform path to a discussion of how to best accomplish the
   development outcomes that Tajikistan wants for itself. The focus on outcomes has
   proven to be an effective approach for focused policy dialogue on a range of structural
   issues and to encourage implementation of reforms. The PDPG 1­3 series also served to
   enhance policy coordination within the government, by bringing the decision makers
   across government into common meetings to discuss the rationale for each of the reform
   areas, progress in implementation, and the expected benefits of reform. This focus on the
   bigger picture helped the government better coordinate actions that required the consent
   and active support of important ministries that were not necessarily directly involved in
   detailed design of the program. Line ministries were able to explain the importance of
   specific measures for achieving national priorities. The inclusion of specific measures in
   the PGDP matrix also raised the profile of these reforms and assisted line ministries in
   overcoming bureaucratic inertia within government.

   A mix of development policy lending and investment operations can be effective in
   supporting development outcomes in post-conflict and fragile states. However, the
   desire to improve overall portfolio performance carries the risk of overloading the
   policy-based finance agenda. The Bank's country assistance strategy for Tajikistan
   embraced the idea that policy-based finance could support reforms that would
   complement and reinforce the impact of investment operations. The PDPG team
   involved many Bank staff from a variety of sectors. This extensive collaboration helped
   build strong links between actions supported through ongoing investment operations and
   the PDPG operation. However, the PDPG operation was also used by the country team
   as a vehicle to raise the profile of specific implementation problems in some Bank
   projects. This arguably led to the proliferation of implicit and overlapping conditionality
   in the preparation and execution of the PDPG program. There is now agreement in the
   country team that future PDPG operations need to be more focused and involve fewer
   sectors. They should avoid duplicating the specific understandings already agreed in the
   context of investment lending and related supervision. The country team has learned that
   achieving the benefits of complementarity is not an easy task. The environment is
   difficult and uncertain for both investment and development policy lending, and
   formulating appropriate responses to a fluid situation is not simple. Members of the
   country team therefore intend to work even more closely on the design and
   implementation of future PDPG operations to ensure that investment projects and policy-
   based programs operate in a complementary and cohesive manner.

   Providing support for implementation of the reform agenda is essential to success in
   environments of low capacity. Passage of legislation and adoption of strategies have
   often had little impact in Tajikistan, because of lack of institutional capacity to implement
   reforms. The PDPG 1­3 series followed each reform area from initial design to adoption
   of policies and legislation to implementation. Through intensive supervision, the team

                                            26
   quickly identified obstacles to implementation and then helped the government in
   obtaining technical assistance and advice to help address the obstacles. For example, to
   assist in implementing the new legislation on inspections, the IFC offered training and
   guidelines to all the inspectorates about how to prepare a checklist, and based on this
   (plus some strong urging from the Ministry of Justice and the SCISPM), the inspectorates
   completed their checklists on their own. As another example, government commitment
   to public administration reform has grown once the Bank helped build capacity for
   reform under the Public Administration Reform Project. The government remained in
   the driver's seat in managing the technical assistance program and incorporated these
   activities into the work programs of the appropriate ministries thereby ensuring that it
   was viewed as an integral part of their work. This enabled the Bank to build a strong and
   productive dialogue with reform champions at technical levels in the various participating
   line ministries. Wage reform in the civil service, progress in job classification, and
   establishment and enforcement of new rules would not have succeeded without close
   dialogue with technical level staff. In addition to working with the line Ministries the
   Bank team had close consultations with senior technical level staff in the Executive
   Office of the President which had oversight responsibilities for the overall program and
   facilitated the inter-ministerial coordination and approvals that were necessary for many
   of the reforms to succeed.

   Basing the reform program on a strong foundation of analytical work and piloting
   innovative approaches can help stakeholders better understand what will work in
   the specific circumstances of Tajikistan. High-quality analytical work is critical in
   gaining the confidence of decision-makers that innovative approaches will provide the
   intended results, especially in a country with limited experience of market-based
   approaches. For example, analytical work demonstrating that Tajik Airlines could be a
   viable enterprise even with greater competition, as long as it operated its business on
   commercial principles, persuaded decision makers to proceed with unbundling the state-
   owned enterprise, despite considerable resistance by its management and employees.
   Similarly, the design of public sector wage reforms was based on a Bank-led wage note
   and an update. Piloting is also essential to allow the government, the beneficiaries, and
   the Bank to gain experience with alternative approaches and to gain the knowledge
   required to refine the design of interventions. For example, health and education reforms
   in the PDPG 1­3 series were based on substantial analytical work and piloting. Where
   piloting has not been done--such as new financing models for agriculture that can
   convince farmers and the government that reforms will increase farm income while
   lowering risk--reform has proven much more difficult.

   Creating effective partnerships with the IMF and other donors in designing the
   proposed program increasing the likelihood of success. Substantial progress has made
   with development partner coordination, with the Bank regularly consulting with other
   development partners on a wide variety of issues. This has led to a greater division of
   labor among partners and reduced and the burden on government of uncoordinated
   development partner efforts. The IMF, the Asian Development Bank, the EC, and the
   major bilateral donors in Tajikistan were all informed of the status of the implementation
   of the prior actions and milestones of the PDPG 1­3 series to ensure that all were able to

                                          27
        advance the reform agenda. The Bank and the IMF consulted closely on the design and
        implementation of the Staff-Monitored Program and of the PDPG program to ensure the
        quality and effectiveness of their dialogue on macro issues. Moreover, the Bank team
        worked closely with the IMF team to ensure the IMF integrated the Bank's priorities
        (selectively increasing public sector wages and protecting social expenditures) in its
        discussions with the authorities on the design of its support under the Poverty Reduction
        and Growth Facility.

1.     Implementation of the Policy Development Programmatic Grant (PDPG I-III)

In the framework of the World Bank's Country Partnership Strategy for Tajikistan the
Government closely cooperated with the World Bank to implement reforms in the context of
PDPG. The PDPG measures for the period 2006-2009 were aimed to achieve the goals of
economic development, implement the reform in the government sector and improve the quality
of public services. The Government of the Republic of Tajikistan was committed to the reforms
agreed in the framework of PDPG, which was evident from successful implementation of
activities under three tranches of this Program.

The Government of the Tajikistan agrees with the World Bank and believes that all objectives set
forth in the PDPG I-III were attained, thereby producing significant results described below.

2.     Major results of the reforms

Measures of the Government of the Tajikistan supported by the Programmatic Grant I-III were
aimed at: (i) facilitating private sector development, (ii) public sector and public services
management improvement. Each of the aforementioned phases consisted of a few components.
Thus, Phase 1 included the following components: (1) maintenance of macroeconomic stability,
(2) investment climate improvement, (3) key strategic sectors regulation reform (aviation, cotton
growing, energy). The second phase included the following components: (1) public sector
management reform and (2) improvement of the quality of services in the fields of education and
health protection. The Government of the Republic of Tajikistan has made a good progress in
each of the components.

Facilitating private sector development

Creating of a more favorable investment climate is the main goal of the Government policy in
the field of private sector development. Measures taken by the Government of the Tajikistan
provide for regulation and minimizing government intervention in the activities of entrepreneurs
as well as eliminating barriers to market entry. We admit that the above mentioned factors are
the main obstacles for private sector development. In this regard, the following complex
measures have been taken towards further improvement of investment climate:

       The Government adopted a new Law of the Republic of Tajikistan "On inspections of
       business entities' activities in the Republic of Tajikistan" and made changes and
       amendments to the effective Tax Code as well as to the Law of the Tajikistan "On
       licensing of specific types of activity". The Government is taking steps to harmonize the
       legal framework with these laws.

       Legal documents linked with inspections of business entities' activities were developed
       and adopted and relevant changes and amendments made to the effective normative acts
       linked with licensing of specific entrepreneurial activities. These normative documents
       shall add maximum clarity, allow avoiding double meanings and ensure highest possible
       compliance with relevant procedures. In future it is proposed to carry out through
                                               38
       monitoring of observance of newly adopted laws in the field of inspections and licensing
       to ensure their proper and efficient execution.

       The Presidential Decree dated July 25, 2008 (No. 496) declared a moratorium for all
       types of inspections of small and medium enterprises for 2 years. Moreover, the
       Government adopted the Law of the Republic of Tajikistan "On moratorium for
       inspections of small and medium enterprises" (No. 505, dated March 6, 2009). Coming
       into force of these normative acts allowed to significantly reducing the number of
       inspections.

       According to the new Law of the Republic of Tajikistan "On state registration of legal
       persons and individual entrepreneurs" dated May 19, 2009 the state registration of
       business entities is carried out by tax authorities based on "single window" principle.

As concerns the cotton growing sector, the Government has approved and is implementing
cotton growing farms' debt resolution Strategy, which provides for measures aimed at
productivity improvement and ensuring fair distribution of incomes in the cotton growing sector.
The Government has also adopted a Resolution declaring a transition to international standards
of cotton quality rating; a joint venture has been established with internationally recognized
company competent in cotton quality rating and in the next two years the Government shall
introduce a system of compulsory certification of cotton quality and weight. According to the
Decree of the President of the Republic of Tajikistan dated May 30, 2009, No. 663, debts of
business entities of the Tajikistan in the field of cotton growing incurred before January 1, 2008
at the expense of all funding sources were remitted. In general, the aforementioned measures are
aimed at cotton growing sector productivity improvement through the development of
competition and fair income distribution.

To improve the air transport access to the country the Government took concrete steps to reform
the aviation sector. The Government adopted a number of normative acts to share the tasks
related to policy making and technical regulation. Besides, the Government approved and
implemented a restructuring plan of the State Unitary Airline "Tajik Air" for a period up to 2008
with the aim of juridical, operational and financial differentiation between the Airport, Airline
and Air Traffic Control Service. Consequently, the following enterprises were established:
national carrier "Tajik Air", Air Traffic Control Enterprise, International Airports in Dushanbe,
Khujand, Kulyab and Kurgan-Tube. Relevant steps were taken towards capacity building and
ensuring financial sustainability of each enterprise. All of these measures facilitated efficient
functioning of the aviation sector and development of competition. Moreover, the Government
shall continue gradually providing its airspace to other airlines.

Public management system reform

The Government of the Tajikistan made a considerable progress in implementing the public
management system reform Strategy, which was adopted in March 15, 2006. The Government
undertook a number of significant steps in the key aspects of the public management and public
service reform process, which create basis for efficient functioning of public sector, thereby
facilitating private sector development and quality improvement of basic services:

                                               39
   The Government adopted a new Law of the republic of Tajikistan "On public service"
   dated March 13, 2007, which provides for government employees' task sharing between
   political and administrative, selection of government employees on a competitive basis,
   accretion of power of the heads of human resources divisions and departments and
   introduction of incentives mechanism ensuring motivation and reward. In order to
   comply with the provisions of the Law on public service, the Public Service Department
   in 2008-2009 worked out and adopted a number of secondary normative acts.

   The number of government employees was reduced by changing the status of support
   personnel and putting them outside the scope of government service. A mechanism of
   competitive selection was introduced to ensure efficient employment and career
   development. As of April 2007 all vacancies in government service are filled through
   competitive selection. Operating instructions were elaborated to facilitate compiling of
   job descriptions in accordance with best international practices. In spring 2009 the
   Government obliged the ministries and agencies to bring their staff job descriptions into
   line with the requirements of new operating instructions.

   The register of public positions drawn up based on the new classification of public
   service positions ranked in eight categories was approved by the Government, thereby
   creating a basis for further advancement of the wage reform. A considerable progress was
   made while introducing a new compensation plan based on wage rates distribution (scale
   of rates), which is supposed to add the remaining increments (bonuses) to the official
   salary. Thus, the transparency of the wage system shall be enhanced.

   The Government worked out and approved the public management system organization
   Concept, which pooled all the provisions of the public management system reform
   Strategy and key procedural recommendations of the horizontal functional survey
   (approved beginning of 2007). According to the Plan of action (approved by the
   Presidential Decree dated May 29, 2009) on implementation of the aforementioned
   Concept the Government is elaborating a draft Law of the Republic of Tajikistan on
   public management organization. This law shall serve as the legal basis for creating an
   institutional system of public management, thereby reinforcing consistency, efficiency
   and accountability of public management system in the medium-term perspective.

   The Government of the Tajikistan approved the government financial Strategy for 2009-
   2018, dated March 20, 2009. In addition to this Strategy the Ministry of Finance worked
   out and approved a Plan of action for 2009-2011. The Government Financial
   Management Strategy laid down the foundations of the Government Financial
   Management Modernization Project approved by the Bank in May 14, 2009.

   In order to reinforce the primary health care (PHC) the Government of the Tajikistan
   increased the wage fund for the PHC employees faster than for other employees of the
   health sector. Throughout 2006, 2007 and 2008 the Government kept increasing the
   salaries of the PHC employees at a higher percent than for other medical persons: in 2006
   - a 60 percent increase for PHC employees and a 40 percent increase for other medical

                                          40
       persons; in 2007 ­ a 54 percent increase for PHC employees and 46 percent for other
       categories; in 2008 ­ a 70 percent increase for PHC employees and 50 percent for other
       medical persons.

       A register of health sector positions was compiled in order to introduce a new wage
       system in the health sector. The new register includes all basic and secondary positions in
       the system of health protection, including primary and secondary health care. This
       register helped classify positions according to their category, thereby facilitating
       introducing a principal of equal pay for the equal amount of work done in the health
       sector. At present the Ministry of Health has drafted a resolution on the new wage system
       in the field of health care, which is now awaiting endorsement by the relevant ministries
       and agencies.

3.     Remaining challenges

Despite the progress made the Government of the Tajikistan fully recognizes that in future
Tajikistan may be confronted with greater difficulties. Being the poorest CIS country, Tajikistan
is still affected by external factors. The country's vulnerability is explained by its dependence on
export operations ­ three fourths of export proceeds fall on aluminum, cotton and electricity,
whereas labor migrants' remittances remain the main source of trade deficit financing, thereby
stabilizing the balance on on-going operations. Moreover, the country' economy significantly
depends on the import of energy resources, the prices for which tended to boost in the past few
years, and faces enormous electricity deficit in winter season. These factors shall impede the
economic growth in the long-term perspective. Meanwhile, the need to promote a long-term
economic growth implies major investments in energy and transport infrastructure development.
To mitigate the risks the Government intends to continue attracting investments for the
implementation of infrastructure projects, particularly for the construction of Rogun hydro power
station, and push forward structural reform in all sectors of the economy with greater resort to
internal potential to ensure high economic growth and poverty reduction. The Government of
Tajikistan shall also continue to rationally manage its macroeconomic policy, especially in the
field of external debt management. Further implementation of public management system reform
is required to ensure gradual building of the Government's capacity to carry out significant
reforms.

4.     The Bank's performance appraisal

Taking account of measures taken by the World Bank team as well as the approaches and efforts
applied to popularize the best practices, we appraise the Bank's performance as satisfactory. This
appraisal takes into consideration the best practices introduced and the scope of reforms
supported by the World Bank and the Bank's efforts to mobilize technical assistance for
implementation of reforms in the framework of PDPG by other development partners.

However, there are some points of interaction between the Government of Tajikistan and the
World Bank worthy of being noted, which did not facilitate successful implementation of the
reforms. In the framework of PDPG the World Bank discussed with the Government of the
Tajikistan the action plan providing for procurement of the grant. Though the plan of action
generally answered the purpose of the reforms to be implemented by the Government of the

                                                41
Tajikistan, it covered a great number of measures supposed to be taken in the limited time frame.
For instance, PDPG II included 31 activities and PDPG III ­ 22 activities. Implementation of
such high volume program of activities by the Government of Tajikistan, each of which provided
for a package of pre-starting arrangements, within a short period of time did not allow the
Government to give a detailed consideration of the proper implementation mechanism (e.g. the
condition "to introduce changes to the technical regulations to ensure compliance with the new
international standards for cotton quality rating and pricing procedure", PDPG-II). This
condition was met, but it turned out that the method (strategy) applied was incorrect and much
more time was required for amending the technical regulations as compared with initial
expectations. To avoid such confusions in future, the Government of the Tajikistan and the
World Bank should take more considered decisions when specifying certain conditions, taking
account of the Government's potential and acceptable terms of implementation. Besides, a great
number of conditions set forth in the measure matrix of Programmatic grants, as experience has
shown, can have adverse effect on the progress of reforms.

5.     Appraisal of the Borrower's performance

The Government of the Tajikistan, same as the World Bank, believes that the Programmatic
grant attained the aim of further development of the private sector, improvement of the
performance and services rendered by the public sector. Since the Government managed to meet
the challenges and achieve final results (as it was mentioned in the WB's report), the
Government of Tajikistan appraises the overall performance of the Borrower as satisfactory. The
argument offered in the WB's report that the appraisal of the Borrower's performance was
lowered down due to ill-considered steps taken by the National Bank of Tajikistan toward
financing the cotton growing sector is considered to be unreasonable, because this issue was not
in the frame of PDPG.

6.     Lessons learned

Experience gained in the course of PDPG I-III implementation shows that a great number of
conditions imposed by the World Bank are not always positively affecting the progress of
reforms. While implementing a great number of activities set forth in the measure matrix of the
PDPG, neither the World Bank's team nor the Government of Tajikistan are able to make sure
that all activities are implemented with due diligence and in full volume. In this regard, the
Government of the Tajikistan suggests thoroughly working out the details of the proposed
conditions in future and reducing the number of such conditions by one third. This measure shall
enable the Government to give a more focused consideration of the policy measures to be
implemented and shall eventually have a positive effect on the progress of reforms.

7.     Conclusion

Within the period of 2006-2009 the Government of the Tajikistan successfully implemented
major reforms in the framework of PDPG. The Government of Tajikistan is committed to further
implement the reforms required to ensure economic growth and improve the quality of public
services. In this regard, the World Bank's support given to the Government of the Republic of
Tajikistan to implement the reforms through the PDPG is very important and highly appreciated
and we hope for further fruitful cooperation.
