Third Programmatic Development\n            Policy Grant is the third and final operation in a\n            programmatic sequence that supports the government's\n            reform program outlined in the Tajikistan first and second\n            poverty reduction strategy. Its development objectives are\n            to improve the environment for private sector development,\n            and to improve overall functioning of the public sector and\n            the delivery of key public services. The program is divided\n            into two pillars each with several components with pillar\n            one promoting private sector development. First component is\n            to maintain macroeconomic stability; second component is to\n            improve investment climate through reform of licensing and\n            inspections, increasing transparency of the privatization\n            process and promoting market competition; and third\n            component is to reform regulatory frameworks by separating\n            policy making from regulatory functions in key strategic\n            sectors (aviation, cotton, and energy). Pillar two: improve\n            public sector management and public service delivery. First\n            component is public sector management reform through\n            restructuring of core public institutions, reforms of civil\n            service management and wage system, strengthening of the\n            medium-term expenditure framework; and second component is\n            improving social service delivery in health and education."}, "docdt": "2009-03-02T00:00:00Z"}
