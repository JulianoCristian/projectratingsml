There were five\n            total restructurings that took place during this project.\n            The first restructuring included: (1) modification of land\n            credit facility; (2) inclusion of three additional\n            mechanisms for land access; and (3) a minor reallocation of\n            Credit proceeds. The second restructuring extended the\n            closing date by almost two years. The third restructuring\n            included a: (1) reformulation of the results matrix; (b)\n            establishment of a new disbursement category to make\n            explicit the expenditures for consultant services, training\n            and operating costs for Component 2; and (3) reallocation of\n            Credit proceeds to reflect the evolution of the project. The\n            fourth and fifth restructurings extended the closing date by\n            six months. There were several lessons taken from this\n            project including the following: (1) a pilot project needs\n            to incorporate a system to test innovation and make results\n            available to policymakers for scaling up; (2) it is possible\n            to implement productive investments in ways that are\n            compatible with customary land tenure; (3) projects looking\n            to expand land access should also consider modalities based\n            on usufruct rights; and (4) projects working to improve the\n            productive capacity of vulnerable rural populations should\n            facilitate insertion into markets."}, "docdt": "2015-03-12T00:00:00Z"}
