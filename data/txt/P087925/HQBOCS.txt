Re:    Credit No. 4366-BO (Land for Agricultural Development Project)
Third Amendment to the Development Credit Agreement
Excellency:
Please refer to the Development Credit Agreement dated February 11, 2008, between the
Plurinational State of Bolivia (the Borrower) and the International Development Association (the
Association), as amended and restated (the Development Credit Agreement). Capitalized terms used in
this letter (Amendment Letter) and not defined herein have the meaning ascribed to them in the
Development Credit Agreement.
Pursuant to your request dated October 31, 2012, as well as our recent discussions on the subject,
the Association hereby agrees to amend the Development Credit Agreement to: (a) establish a new
disbursement category; and (b) reallocate the proceeds of the Credit among the disbursement categories.
Consequently the Development Credit Agreement is hereby amended as follows:
1.     The table under paragraph A.1 of Schedule I to the Development Credit Agreement is amended
to read in its entirety as set forth in the Annex to this Amendment Letter.
2.     Section 1.02 of the Development Credit Agreement is amended to read as follows:
(a)    A new definition of "Operating Costs" is added to read as follows:
"(p)   "Operating Costs" means reasonable expenditures which would not have been incurred
absent the Project, including, inter alia, maintenance and leasing of vehicles and equipment, fuel,
office supplies and other consumables, insurance, office rent, internet connection costs, utilities
and travel, transportation and accommodations and salaries of incremental PCU staff.
Consequently, the definitions included in Section 1.02 (p) through (cc) are respectively renumbered as (q)
through (dd).
(b)    A new definition of "Training is added to read as follows:


﻿"(ee)  "Training" means expenditures (other than for consultants' services), solely as required
for the Project, incurred for: (a) reasonable travel, room, board and per diem for trainers and
trainees (in connection with their training) and non-consultant training facilitators; (b) course
fees; (c) training facility and equipment rentals; (d) training material preparation, acquisition,
reproduction and distribution expenses not otherwise covered under this paragraph."
Please confirm your agreement with the foregoing amendment by signing and dating this
Amendment Letter in the spaces provided below. All other provisions of the Development Credit
Agreement except as amended through this Amendment Letter shall remain in full force and effect. This
Amendment Letter shall be executed in two (2) counterparts each of which shall be an original.
Upon your confirmation, please return one fully executed original to us. The provisions set forth
in this Amendment Letter shall become effective as of the date of its countersignature upon receipt by the
Association of one fully executed original of this Amendment Letter.
Please also note that the approved Restructuring Paper dated January 29, 2013 will be disclosed
on the Association's external website.
Sincerely,
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
