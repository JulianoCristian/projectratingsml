                         farmers to acquire suitable agricultural lands and implement investment subprojects which puts them on a sustainable, higher-income, livelihood path.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Although implementation has faced challenges recently, the Project has already completed the establishment of 237 Productive Associations (PAs) that are benefiting close to 2,900
                         families, mainly poor indigenous families. It has also contributed to the incorporation of aproximately157,000 hectares into productive use by the PAs. A graduation strategy and
                         technical assistance strategy for PAs is under implementation to promote the sustainability of results.
