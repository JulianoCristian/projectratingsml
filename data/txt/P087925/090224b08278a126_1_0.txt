                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of the proposed project is to establish a decentralized beneficiary-driven land distribution mechanism that allows organized landless or poor
                         farmers to acquire suitable agricultural lands and implement investment subprojects which puts them on a sustainable, higher-income, livelihood path.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project will close on September 15, 2014. Preliminary results from the final evaluation indicate that the two major outcomes of the Project have been achieved. The Project
                         partially helped to establish a decentralized beneficiary-driven land distribution mechanism, while supporting productive investments that helped to improve the livelihoods of
                         beneficiaries. Specifically, through the Project, a total of 237 Productive Associations (PA) were established -- surpassing the original target of 190 -- thus benefiting close to 2,900
                         mainly poor indigenous families and incorporating 157,000 hectares for potential productive uses. Nearly 80 percent of investment sub-projects followed the implementation plans
                         satisfactorily. Factors such as land market conditions made it impossible to utilize all land access mechanisms available under the Project. However, the final focus on land access in
