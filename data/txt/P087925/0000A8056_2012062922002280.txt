                         farmers to acquire suitable agricultural lands and implement investment subprojects which puts them on a sustainable, higher-income, livelihood path.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project continues to advance well. The Project has helped to establish 128 Productive Associations (PAs), benefiting over 1,250, mainly poor indigenous families; almost 98,000
                         hectares have been accessed by PAs for potential productive uses; the IFI (Banco Union) that will administer the credit line has been selected; and additional lands for purchase by
                         PAs are being identified within the pilot department of Santa Cruz. The project is also providing technical assistance to the PAs to ensure that their activities are successful.
