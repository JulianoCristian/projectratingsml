   economic reform. The Russian Government has embarked on a\n            comprehensive effort to restructure the economy on the basis\n            of market principles emphasizing private sector initiatives\n            in the productive sectors. The initial stages of the reform\n            program have already been implemented with the\n            liberalization of most retail and wholesale prices during\n            the first quarter of 1992 and the unification of the\n            exchange rate on July 1, 1992. A policy framework of\n            systemic and structural reforms has been developed with the\n            assistance of the Bank in the following areas: enterprise\n            reform (including privatization), pro-competition and\n            anti-monopoly policies, foreign direct investment, financial\n            sector reforms, and establishment of a social safety net."}, "docdt": "1992-07-22T00:00:00Z"}
