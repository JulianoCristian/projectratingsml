"abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Health Sector Reform\n            Support Project (APL1) for Dominican Republic were as\n            follows: outcomes were unsatisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            moderately unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: the design and implementation of APL1 suggests\n            that the momentum generated either by adopting a new legal\n            framework or by accommodating an incoming administration\n            tends to foster an overly optimistic environment, in which\n            the actual possibilities for achieving goals in the short\n            and medium term are overestimated. The momentum may be very\n            conducive to setting ambitious, long-term goals and securing\n            political commitments but, if the borrower does not make a\n            clear distinction between the long-term reform goals and\n            what a small loan can achieve, overly ambitious objectives\n            and targets for an investment program may be included in\n            project design, without an appropriate evaluation of the\n            risks involved. Alternatively, the measurement of targets\n            that require very complex and costly studies may be more\n            suitable for an evaluation analysis where a new policy is\n            introduced than for project development objective (PDO)\n            indicators. Targets that can be measured periodically should\n            be closely monitored to determine whether they need to be\n            adjusted, especially if a clear trend of lack of progress\n            towards PDO indicator targets emerges. Moreover, the\n            supervision of procurement processes of civil works in the\n            health sector is highly complex due to various special\n            circumstances arising from the geographic dispersion of\n            health care units and the wide range of types of works (from\n            simple refurbishments in numerous but scattered health\n            centers to highly specialized infrastructure projects such\n            as hospitals and pharmaceutical warehouses). Therefore, the\n            bidding, planning, and implementation processes require\n            experienced teams that can take into account the realities\n            of the health sector civil works and of the market. Price\n            considerations may require an analysis of past experiences\n            with public bidding to avoid dealing with local firms that\n            may offer lower-than-market prices but later prove unable to\n            deliver, leading to lengthy processes for the cancellation\n            of contracts and costly investments to repair and preserve\n            investments already made."}, "docdt": "2010-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
