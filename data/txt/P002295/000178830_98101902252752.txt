INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL
FOR A THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Senegal for the equivalent of US$15.0 million to
help finance a Third Highway Project. The loan would have a term of 20
years, including 5 years of grace, with interest at 8.5 percent per annum.
PART I: THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "The Economy of Senegal" (212-SE) was distributed
to the Executive Directors on September 10, 1973. A s:pecial mission on public
finance visited Senegal in October 1974; its findings are included in this
report. Country data appear in Annex I.
Past Development
3.        During the 1960's, the Senegalese economy experienced virtual stag-
nation, as real output increased less rapidly than population, and per capita
GNP declined. Two factors were responsible for this situation. First, with
independence, Senegal lost its privileged position as the center of French
West Africa and therefore had to adjust to reduced economic, administrative,
and political dimensions. Secondly, the difficulties of adaptation to the
new situation were compounded in the latter part of the decade when ground-
nut production fell by 50 percent due to unfavorable weather and falling
export prices. In 1971, weather conditions improved Lemporarily, but 1972
and 1973 brought the Sahel's most severe drought in tuis century.   Food
emergency operations avoided widespread starvation, but both the fiscal and
balance of payments situations sharply deteriorated.
4.        Public savings net of amortization, which had substantially improved
during the preceding years, were all but wiped out in 1972/73 and 1973/74.
Revenues were affected by the decline in economic activity; and recurrent
expenditures were further increased by a rise in salaries to compensate for
the rapidly increasing cost of living, substantially higher debt service pay-
ments, and perhaps most importantly, heavy consumer subsidies which resulted
from maintaining low domestic prices in the face of skyrocketing food import
prices. Thus, at mid-1974, in spite of a US$46 million higher transfer to
the Stabilization Fund from groundnut sales than in the previous year, the
public finance situation was more serious than it had been since 1960.
5.        Faced with a difficult situation in public finance, the Government
took a number of steps in November 1974 which were excpected to put public
finances on a sounder footing. Consumer prices for rice, sugar, and ground-
nut oil were raised to bring them more closely in lire with world market

I of their official duties. Its contents may not otherwise be disclosed without World Bank authorization.



prices. Thus, the consumer price of rice was increased by 70 percent (com-
plete elimination of the subsidy), the price of sugar was increased by 90
percent (leaving a subsidy of about 20 percent) and that of groundnut oil
was raised by 43 percent (leaving a subsidy of about 20 percent). However,
high world market prices for wheat required an increase in domestic flour
prices which the Government was reluctant to pass on to the consumer and
which led to a subsidy on flour. At the same time, when subsidies were re-
duced, Government salaries were raised by 16 percent on the average, but with
actual increases rangirg from 60 percent for the lower salaries to 3 percent
for the higher salaries, to compensate for the rapid increase in basic food
prices. Farmer prices for groundnuts were brought closer to world prices
which were particularly high at that moment. The Government thought it could
safely reduce its take from the groundnut crop since world phosphate prices had
increased five-fold and compensating revenues from this source were assured
through expanded government participation in the phosphate mining company and
a 100 percent tax levy on excess profits accruing from the price rise. How-
ever, during FY75 a good part of the additional public savings was absorbed
by payments for the increased participation in the phosphate mine and the
servicing of debt incurred to finance new investments and state acquisitions
of two foreign-owned public utility companies.
6.        Through FY75 the current budget of the central Government showed
record surpluses but deficits started to build up again in the Stabilization
Fund due to the consumer subsidy on flour and sagging world market prices
for groundnuts. The falling trend in wheat prices may enable Government
to phase out the flour subsidy in the course of FY76, but the financial
situation of the public sector will nevertheless become difficult again;
groundnut prices are continuing to fall and the world fertilizer market
has been unable to support the earlier five-fold price hike.
7.        The balance of payments also came under pressure in 1973 and 1974,
in the former year because of a widening of the trade gap and in the latter
year because capital outflows from the private sector partly offset a sub-
stantial improvement in the current account. Net foreign reserves at the
end of 1974 stood at minus US$44 million. In January 1975 Senegal drew its
full US$19.2 million allocation under the IMF oil facility.
8.        Balance of payments problems persisted through 1975 largely because
of cyclical factors. The good 1974 crop was harvested at a time when world
groundnut prices were still high; this created an atmosphere of optimism both
in the private and public sector. At the end of 1974, the state marketing
organization purchased the crop from the farmers at generous prices thereby
injecting massive purchasing power into the economy. In summer 1975 private
and public expenditures were booming, but the bulk of the groundnut crop
remained unsold, world market prices were 30 percent lower than a few months
earlier, and foreign exchange reserves fell rapidly under the pressure of
excess demand. The Government responded by introducing selective credit
restrictions which so far have been effective in reducing total credit out-
standing and stabilizing domestic inflation. Foreign exchange reserves



- 3 -
stood at minus US$66 million by the end of November 1975; this was financed
by a drawing in September of US$11.7 million under the second IMF oil
facility, by the monetary union to which Senegal belongs, and by the mostly
foreign-owned commercial banks.
9.        The first half of 1976 will see a continuation of the problems
experienced in 1975; the Government's reluctance to cut incomes of groundnut
farmers has encouraged it to maintain producer prices in the face of slack-
ening world demand for groundnut products. UnfortunatEly, phosphate rock
prices are weakening as well; this will effectively eliminate the cushion
which has enabled Senegal to absorb the recent rises ir oil and other import
costs while implementing a policy of income distributicon in favor of the rural
areas. Hopefully, this income redistribution policy will not fall victim to
the current difficulties Senegal is experiencing. There are strong indications
that several OPEC countries are willing to provide increased capital aid; more-
over, there remain substantial sources of additional balance of payments assist-
ance the Government can tap such as the IMF, Stabex and the monetary union to
which Senegal belongs. Finally, the Government has already demonstrated its
willingness to use credit restrictions and to eliminate costly consumer subsidies
to maintain control over the short-term situation.
Prospects
10.       As demonstrated during the last five years, weather conditions and
groundnut world market prices remain critical for Senegal's growth prospects.
The Government is striving, with our support, to reduce its vulnerability to
variances in these factors. Its long range program calls for development of
areas less affected by rainfall fluctuations (Casamance and Eastern Senegal)
where cash crops other than groundnuts can be grown. Irrigation is being
developed in the arid northern part of the country; this will reduce depen-
dence on cereal imports. With substant:ial gains also in industry, tourism
and fisheries, weather conditions and groundnuts by 1980 will be far less
decisive factors than today. However, groundnut cultivation is the mainstay
of the economy and provides the livelihood for the ma ority of the rural poor.
The Government is, therefore, introducing animal tracLion, fertilizers and
crop rotation techniques to raise the productivity of the groundnut farmer.
11.       The Fourth Development Plan (1973/74 - 1976,'77) continues to give
highest priority to rural development (36 percent of i-he total), housing/
public utilities (18 percent) and transport infrastructure (16 percent).
Industry and tourism, quite justifiably, see their share increase from 5
to 10 percent of the total. Assuming average rainfal:L conditions, Senegal's
growth in real terms in the remainder of the 1970s wiLl be of the order of
4.5 percent or about 2 percent per capita, which is si:ill a considerable
improvement over the past decade. A new plan is unde-: preparation and will
be reviewed in the course of a basic economic mission scheduled for the
Fall of 1976.
12.       The structure of Senegal's balance of payments will gradually im-
prove, but in the next few years the benefits of thes2 favorable trends will
be reduced by falling terms of trade.    Tourism, some new export industries and



an important expansion of phosphate rock mining will provide additional foreign
resources, and the implementation of existing irrigation plans will progres-
sively diminish the large food imports for urban centers. These prospects
combined with a favorable long-term outlook for groundnut production should
result in a healthier trade balance in the early eighties. The favorable long-
term prospects remain contingent on the execution of the investment program which
will have to be largely financed from abroad at a rate cf about US$125 million
annually on concessionary terms. Traditional sources of aid will probably not
suffice, and it will take time before new aid flows from Midd-le East OPEC colntries
are developed. Therefore, for the coming two or three years supplemental foreign
funds, over and above foreseeable project aid, will be needed.
13.       The financial pressures of the past three years have already led
the Government to borrow on the Eurodollar market for a total amount of US$85
million, partly to roll over previous debts. Part of the expected balance of
payments deficits over the next two or three years could be financed through
access to the expanded IMF facilities or the Stabex fund; but additional
foreign exchange resources at a rate of about $25 million a year will pro-
bably be needed. Assuming additional borrowing to cover the gap is done on
Eurodollar terms, debt service would increase from six percent of exports of
goods and non-factor services in 1975 to roughly ten percent by the end of the
1970s.
14.       In view of Senegal's performance in economic development and the
expected shortfall in the amount of concessionary aid needed to implement the
Government's development program and to raise the incomes of the rural poor
Senegal is considered eligible for Third Window loans from the Bank. The
country is creditworthy although foreign reserves are at the moment low and
will stay so for the rest of the decade because of the recent reverses in
the terms of trade. By extencling the grace period an their loans foreign
donors can help to alleviate the balance of payments situation during this
period of financial stringency.
PART I1: BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN SENEGAL
15.       The Bank Group has had 23 operations in Senegal to date.     Total
lending amounts to US$116 million (net of cancellations), including fourteen
IDA credits, four Bank loans, two blends of Bank and IDA funds, two IFC opera-
tions, and one blend of Bank and IFC funds. Annex II contains a summary
statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as of January 31,
1976 and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
16.       Execution of these projeces, apart from the Railway Project and
the Site and Services Project, is moving forward without exceptional delays.
The procurement for the railway has been slow due to time consuming contract



- 5 -
approval procedures, but most project components have now been received or
ordered. The Site and Services Project is about one year behind schedule,
although physical execution is now progressing satisfactorily. The Bank
Group and Senegal held discussions recently on delays in reorganizing the
executing agency, Office des Habitations a Loyer ModEre (OHLM), and in
implementing Government's commitment to reorient its housing policy in favor
of lower income groups. Two agricultural credits (140-SE and 404-SE) pro-
vided for technical assistance designed to facilitatE! the reorganization
of the Office National de Cooperation et d'Assistance au Developpement (ONCAD);
while this program failed to achieve meaningful results for some time, the
Government recently took a number a steps to strengthen ONCAD's management and
financial operations. Some improvement, especially in accounting, resulted
from these efforts. But ONCAD's overall performance has not improved and the
organization remains overstaffed, which is costly in times of high wage
inflation (see Annex II).
17.       In view of Senegal's need for substantially higher capital inflows,
the scale of Bank Group lending is expected to increase significantly in the
future. The Bank Group share of foreign aid disbursements (including grants)
is expected to increase from about 6 percent in 1970,/71 to 24 percent over the
1974-80 period. By then the Bank Group is likely to be the largest aid donor.
This will increase the Bank Group's share of the outstanding and disbursed
debt from 12 percent at the end of 1973 to about 25 percent by 1980. IBRD/
IDA share in public debt service will probably go up from 2.2 percent in 1973
to about 13 percent by 1980.
18.       The objectives of Bank Group project lending in Senegal fall under
four main headings. Priority will continue to be rural development, including
development of irrigation in the Senegal River Valley Region (e.g., the Debi-
Lampsar Engineering Credit), intensification of grou:dnut production and
diversification into new crops and new regions (e.g., the Sine Saloum and
Terres Neuves projects and the proposed Eastern Senegal Livestock Project).
As in the past, our agricultural lending is expected to exceed one-third of the
total. Secondly, we shall assist diversification of the economy by lending for
the growing sectors of tourism and industry (e.g., the proposed tourism infra-
structure project on the Petite Cote and a proposed second loan to SOFISEDIT,
a development finance company established with assistance from the Bank Group
in 1974). Thirdly, we shall continue investment for modernizing and expanding
the country's infrastructure (e.g., the project described in this report and
a Feeder Roads Project, and a proposed fishing wharf at Dakar Port). Finally
we shall continue lending to reorient and expand the country's education
system, as in the Second Education Project.

PART III: THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
19.       Senegal possesses a relatively well-developed transport system,
including some 13,300 km of roads, 1,032 km of railways, a modern deepwater
port and international airport at Dakar, and three secondary ports and 18 local
airports. The system is concentrated on Dakar, the rest of the Cap Vert Penin-
sula, and the Groundnut Basin to the east which are the areas with the largest
population and economic activity. Dakar's airport and port serve as points of
entry for international traffic to landlocked Mali and to Mauritania.
20.       Government's transport strategy focuses on:   (i) developing local
transport infrastructure in support of overall economic growth, particularly
in the agriculture and tourism sectors; (ii) promoting regional integration,
especially in rural areas and with the Casamance region; and (iii) maintain-
ing the already extensive investment in the sector. In addition, Senegal will
continue to provide Mali with a link to the sea and to upgrade its international
transportation facilities - air, port and rail. The Bank Group has supported
this strategy with six projects totalling US$35.7 million.
Roads
21.       Roads are the principal mode of domestic transport, carrying about
75 percent of commercial inter-urban passenger and freight traffic excluding
phosphates. About 2,600 km of the 13,300 km road network are paved and
6,300 km are all weather gravel roads. The remaining roads consist of partly
improved earth roads and ill-defined tracks. Government strategy in the
highway sector has been to extend roads throughout the country, especially
in remote areas with agricultural potential; the Bank Group's First Highway
Project (Credit 198-SE, 1970) included the construction of 78 km of feeder
roads in the southern Groundnut Basin and purchase of maintenance equipment.
The proposed Feeder Roads Project submitted for your consideration concurrently
with this project will finance a comprehensive program of feeder road rehabi-
litation and maintenance of 1,000 km and maintenance of 250 km of existing
feeder roads.
22.       Most of Senegal's primary roads, which carry the bulk of the traffic,
are now more than 15 years old and underdesigned for present traffic levels.
In addition, road maintenance has been inadequate and much of the paved network
has deteriorated and is now in unsatisfactory condition. Recognizing the im-
portance of preserving its substantial investment in the present road network,
Government has begun to give increasing attention to rehabilitation of its
paved roads and to maintenance. The Second Highway Project (Credit 366-SE,
1973) provided for pavement strengthening of 109 km of primary roads and a
four-year program of highway maintenance. Cost increases due to a one-year
delay in execution, inflation, and changes in the exchange rate forced a re-
duction in the scope of this project. Government decided, and the Bank Group
agreed, to give priority to the highway maintenance program and consequently
the pavement strengthening component was reduced from 109 km to 35 km; the
sections left out remain economically justified and are included in the pro-
posed Third Highway Project. Project execution under the Second Highway Pro-
ject started slowly but has substantially improved in the last year,



- 7 -
particularly for highway maintenance where Government has successfully com-
pleted an action program agreed upon with the Bank as n condition for going
ahead with the proposed project. In addition, there has been a noticeable
improvement in the productivity of Government's maintenance operations due
in large part to improved training and technical assistance. The preinvest-
ment studies financed under the Second Highway Project were satisfactorily
finished and serve as a basis for construction items included in the proposed
Third Highway Project.
Railways
23.       Senegal Railways consist of a main line extending from Dakar to
Kidira on the Mali border and branch lines, including those connecting Dakar
with St. Louis in the north and with the Taiba phosphate mine. The Bank
Group has financed two railroad projects (Credit 96-SE, 1966; Credit 314/Loan
835-SE, 1972) which have concentrated on improvements in physical infrastruc-
ture. Project implementation has been slow, and until recently the railway's
operating and financial performance has been poor. As a result, traffic has
been lost to other modes of transport, primarily roads in Senegal and to the
Ivory Coast railway for international traffic to Mali. However, the rail-
way's performance has improved over the last two years due to higher tariffs
approved by Government, increased financial autonomy from the Ministry of
Finance, reorganization of technical assistance, Government subsidies for
unprofitable branch lines, and special efforts to improve maintenance produc-
tivity and thereby increase locomotive availability. The long-term prospects
of Senegal Railways depend in part on a number of proposed mineral projects
being studied by Government including the opening of a, new phosphate mine
at Tobene and an iron ore mine and pelletizing plant at Faleme in Eastern
Senegal.
Ports and Aviation
24.       Traffic at the Port of Dakar, consisting mainly of phosphates, pet-
roleum, general merchandise and international traffic for Mali and Mauritania,
has doubled over the last ten years and now totals about 6 million tons annually.
The Port's financial performance has been good, due primarily to temporary
additional traffic generated when the Suez Canal was closed but also because
of new tariff increases. The Bank Group's Port Project (Loan 493-SE, 1967)
extended the Port's facilities and was successfully completed. A second proj-
ect for a fishing wharf will be appraised by the Bank in March 1976. Govern-
ment is also considering possible development of an ancillary mineral port
facility near Cayar, north of Dakar, initially to handle imports for a pro-
posed refinery/petro-chemical complex and for export of phosphate from the
new Tobene mine, and in the long-term for export of iron ore from Faleme. If
the Cayar Port were built it would not have a substantial impact on Port of
Dakar operations.
25.       Aviation centers on the Dakar airport, a major international transit
point for Europe-Africa-South America traffic which handled 560,000 passengers
in 1974. A Bank project (867-SE, 1972) helped to finance extension of the
runway and other improvements, and was completed only two months behind sched-
ule and within the CFAF cost estimates made at appraisal. Domestic air traffic



- 8 -
is insignificant, although Air Senegal provides scheduled services to 13 of the
18 regional airports and airfields.
The Road Transport Industry
26.       Of the approximately 73,000 registered vehicles in Senegal in 1973,
about one-third were trucks and buses. The road transport industry is comprised
of three major segments: (i) a few large firms generally with significant for-
eign ownership in the modern private sector. These firms have their own main-
tenance and repair facilities and carty the products of trading companies and
modern businesses; (ii) a large number of owner-drivers and small firms in the
highly competitive traditional private sector; here traffic is highly seasonal,
depending to a large extent on the groundnut harvest, and many firms sustain
themselves only by overloading vehicles, neglecting maintenance and insurance,
deferring vehicle replacement, and underpaying drivers; 1/ and (iii) vehicles
owned by public and semi-public agencies. The number of trucks in the road
vehicle fleet increased by about 6 percent annually in the middle 1960s, but
the growth rate has since declined to about 5 percent per annum as a result
of reduced economic activity during the drought period and as small trucks
are replaced by larger ones.
Administration
27.       The Ministry of Public Works, Urban Development and Transport (MPWUT),
through its Department of Public Works (DPW) is responsible for administration
of all classified roads. Following the reorganization of MPIWUT in July 1974,
DPW consists of five divisions: road maintenance (including feeder roads),
road construction, building construction, equipment, and administration. At
present a number of ministries and organizations are involved in various as-
pects of the transport sector and there is no single agency responsible for
planning and coordination. MPWUT which executes Government policy in the
transport sector had three separate planning units. The July 1974 MTWUT re-
organization combined the three planning units into a single Directorate of
Studies and Programming (DSP) which should increase MPWUT's capacity to exe-
cute economic and technical studies and to determine sector strategy and invest-
ment priorities. The Bank was asked to assist in drawing up the terms of
reference and staff requirements for DSP and a mission visited Senegal in
December 1975 for this purpose. Technical assistance to DSP will be included
in the proposed project (para. 34). The Second Railway Project financed a
sector study carried out by consultants Berenschot-Bosboom on aspects of trans-
port coordination including improvements in regulation, taxation and collection
of statistics. The recommendations of this study have been discussed with
Government which agreed that issues requiring further investigation will be
included in DSP's terms of reference for further investigation, MPWUT has a
shortage of staff at the upper and middle levels which is partially alle-
viated by French technical assistance which provides 14 engineers. However,
1/ A program for assisting the development of the domestic trucking industry,
particularly in the traditional sector, would be included in the terms of
reference for the Directorate of Studies and Programming in MPWUT (para.
27).



- 9 -
from 1976 onwards, four Senegalese technical colleges and universities will
provide about 60 engineers and technical personnel annually which should
form the basis for filling MPWUT positions with qualified local personnel.
Financing
28.       Highway expenditures exclusive of foreign financing have risen
from US$11 million in FY 71 to US$13 million in FY 75. Assistance from
external donors, primarily the Bank Group, FED and ADB, has averaged about
US$9 million annually during this period. Road useT taxes totalled about
US$35 million in 1972 accounting for about 10 percent of Government revenues
but only about 30 percent of these taxes were expended on the highway sector.
Investments in new roads are financed primarily by ioreign donors or alterna-
tively by a Road Fund financed mainly from taxes on fuel. Maintenance works
and MPWUT's administrative expenses are financed primarily out of the general
budget with maintenance also assisted by the Bank Group through the financing
of equipment and consulting services to improve maintenance operations and
by the Road Fund for periodic maintenance operations consisting of paved
road resurfacing. Government appropriations for ma:intenance operating costs
have increased from US$3.2 million in 1970/71 to US'j4.6 million in 1975/76,
still not quite enough to cover the impact of inflation and to maintain
adequately a growing road network. Government has agreed to provide suffi-
cient funds to maintain the roads rehabilitated under the proposed project
in addition to continuing its current maintenance program (Section 4.04 of
the Loan Agreement).
The Construction Industry
29.       Public investment in transport infrastructure is expected to total
about US$255 million during the period FY 1974-77, of which about 50 percent
would be for road construction. At present about 16 major civil works contrac-
tors are engaged in road construction and rehabilitation; these are primarily
foreign-owned but there are two companies which are Senegalese controlled and
three which are joint ventures of foreign and Senegalese companies. Minor
works are carried out by about 110 small and medium sized domestic firms.
The development of domestic contractors has been hampered by lack of capital,
long-term credit, personnel experienced in modern management and construction
techniques, and by time consuming Government contract approval and payment
paying procedures. The proposed project would include technical assistance
to domestic contractors by identifying and helping to implement a program of
action to train contractor personnel in modern management and construction
techniques and to promote closer cooperation between contractors and already
established institutions such as SONEPI and SOFISEDIT 1/ which have the
potential to assist them.
1/ SONEPI provides limited financial assistance through funds for loan
guarantees and equity investments and SOFISEDIT, a DFC established with
Bank Group assistance in 1974, can provide long-term financing.

PART IV: THE PROJECT
30.       The Government of Senegal has asked the Bank to expand financing
of road strengthening and maintenance started under the Second Highway Project
(Credit 366-SE). The proposed project is based on studies carried out by
consultants BCEOM and Louis Berger under Credit 366-SE. The project was
appraised in May 1975 and negotiations were held February 9-11, 1976 in Dakar,
Senegal with a Senegalese delegation led by Mr. Tidiane Ndiaye, Director of
Finance in the Ministry of Plan and Cooperation. The appraisal report (No.
975a-SE) is being circulated separately to the Executive Directors. Annex III
provides a loan and project summary and the attached map (IBRD 11900) shows
the project area.
Project Description
31.       The proposed project consists of:
(a)   pavement strengthening of 204 km of primary roads;
(b)   procurement of equipment for highway maintenance and for
a soils laboratory and DSP;
(c)   technical assistance to MPWUT for:   (i) transport planning
in DSP, (ii) scholarships for training of local DSP
personnel, and (iii) advisory services for promotion of
the domestic construction industry;
(d)   consulting services for:   (i) construction supervision under
item (a) above; (ii) preinvestment studies for improvement
of the Louga-Dahra road (80 km), and for pavement strengthening
of about 180 km of primary roads; and (iii) road maintenance
begun under the Second Highway Project.
Strengthening of Paved Roads
32.       The proposed project will finance pavement strengthening of 75 km
of roads dropped from the Second Highway Project and of 129 km of new roads
identified by consultants BCEOM; these roads, primarily in the Groundnut Basin,
along the Senegal River, and near Dakar, serve areas with substantial agricul-
tural activity and high population densities and form part of major inter-
regional transport routes. The roads were built between 15 and 25 years ago
and regular maintenance cannot halt further deterioration. The pavement
strengthening would consist of reconstruction of the base and surface course,
regravelling shoulders, improving drainage and widening pavement and platform
where necessary.
Equipment Purchase
33.       Funds provided for procurement of highway maintenance equipment
under the Second Highway Project have proven insufficient due to delays in
project execution, rapid inflation (para. 22), and a higher than expected



rate of deterioration of existing maintenance equipment. Given the high
priority of the maintenance program to protect the country's investment in
its road network, the proposed project will include US$1.0 million for more
road maintenance equipment procurement plus US$100,000 for equipment for
MPWUT's soils laboratory.
Technical Assistance
34.       In order to improve transport planning and coordination, the pro-
posed project will provide technical assistance to DSP including: (i) the
services for three years of four experts (senior transport planner, senior
transport economist, a highway planning engineer, and a transport economist);
(ii) the purchase of equipment for DSP; and (iii) scholarships and training
for local DSP staff. The terms of reference for the experts and their annual
work program will be reviewed with the Bank. Governzrent has agreed to employ
counterparts for the experts and to nominate candidates for the scholarships
within three months of the date of signature of the Loan Agreement.
35.       A two phase program of technical assistance will aim at helping domes-
tic civil works contractors increase their participation in major road works
now dominated by foreign contractors. Under the first phase investigations
will be carried out on the structure and needs of the domestic construction
industry, Government procedures for awarding civil wcrks contracts and paying
contractors in this sector, and the potential role of existing institutions
such as SONEPI and SOFISEDIT in assisting domestic contractors. The recommen-
dations resulting from the first phase would, following discussions between
Government and the Bank, form the basis for an action program to assist domestic
contractors. This program might include, inter alia, improved coordination
and assistance among existing institutions and the domestic construction indus-
try, changes in Government contract approval and billing procedures, and
advisory services and training courses for domestic contractors in submitting
contract bids, accounting and cost control, and organization and management.
Consulting Services
36.       Transport for the Louga-Dahra region in the northern Groundnut
Basin is presently dependent on a branch line of the Senegal Railways which
provides irregular and unprofitable service and remaLns open only with a
Government subsidy. Feasibility and detailed enginearing studies of the
Louga-Dahra road (which is at present only an 80 km sand track) will investi-
gate the possibility of replacing the railroad servi:e with a road. In addi-
tion the proposed project will include updating studies of 98 km of pavement
strengthening investigated by BCEOM under the Second Highway Project which
should be economically justifiable after 1977 plus an additional 80 km of new
roads or other improvements to be defined during project execution. These
studies may be carried out by DSP and DPW using consultants as required.
Supervision of the pavement strengthening component of the project will be
done by consultants. Because of the higher than expected work load and,
until recently, slow project implementation, additional consultants are
needed for the highway maintenance program financed under the Second Highway



- 12 -
Proj ect. The Third Highway Project will provide consulting services for the
pro ect manager, one highway engineer and four mechanics (two locally employed)
for a total of 96 man/months to continue supervision of the maintenance
program and equipment repair operations and to train local personnel. The
Third Highway Project will include US$2.4 million for 500 man/months of tech-
nical assistance.
Project Cost and Financing
37.       The total cost of the project net of taxes and including contingencies
is US$20.5 million. The proposed loan of US$15.0 million will finance 100 per-
cent of the estimated foreign exchange component or 73 percent of total project
costs net of taxes. The local costs (US$5.5 million equivalent) will be pro-
vided by Government.
Execution and Procurement
38.       MPWUT would be responsible for execution of the project and would be
assisted by consultants employed on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank
for supervising pavenment strengthening and highway maintenance activities and
possibly for feasibility and detailed engineering studies. Contractor CSE,
the lowest bidder for the pavement strengthening component under the Second
Highway Project, will execute the pavement strengthening of the 75 km of roads
dropped from this project and included under the proposed Third Highway Project
on the basis of prices and conditions of its original bid received in April
1974, adjusted to take account of price increases as stipulated in CSE's
December 1974 contract. International bids will be called for the additional
129 km of the pavement strengthening program in accordance with Bank Group
guidelines. Equipment and spare parts for highway maintenance and for the
soils laboratory will be procured on the basis of international competitive
bidding in accordance with Bank Group guidelines. Items costing under US10,000
may be procured on the basis of quotations obtained following local procedures
acceptable to the Bank; the total amount of such purchases should not exceed
US$100,000.
Disbursement
39.       The Bank loan will be disbursed to cover 58 percent of total expendi-
tures for construction contracts; 75 percent of total expenditures for consul-
ting services and technical assistance; and 100 percent of foreign expenditures
of equipment and spare parts or 91 percent of the total costs of these items if
procured locally; and 100 percent of expenditures for scholarships for training
of DSP personnel abroad.
Benefits
40.       The Government of Senegal has begun a program of public investment
to extend and diversify the economy, emphasizing the development of rural areas
and the agricultural sector. The success of this effort will depend in large



- 13 -
part"on increasing production and utilizing resources from every region of the
country, for which a reliable and efficient transport system is essential. The
primary purpose of the proposed project, in line with this objective, is to
protect past investments by rehabilitating and maintaining the existing highway
network. Benefits from road improvement will primarily result in cheaper, safer
and more reliable transport and in savings in road niaintenance costs. On the
basis of conservative traffic projections, and savings on vehicle operating
costs alone, the economic return on the pavement strengthening component,
which accounts for 80 percent of project cost, is estimated at 30 percent with
returns for individual sections ranging between 22 and 42 percent. For the
purpose of sensitivity analysis, cost increases and benefit decreases of 25
percent would yield returns of at least 18 percent ror individual road sections.
With regard to the highway maintenance component, which accounts for eight per-
cent of project cost, the program started under the Second Highway Project,
is now estimated to have an economic return of 28 percent. The economic
return for the whole project is about 30 percent.
41.       Institution-building is also an important goal of this project.    The
technical assistance included in the project would provide key staff, equip-
ment and training for MPWUT's newly created Directorate of Studies and Pro-
gramming and will help improve its capacity to evaluate investment proposals
and prepare a coordinated investment plan for the transport sector. In
addition, technical assistance will help establish an action program to
improve the capacity of the domestic construction industry to participate in
major road works.
PART V: LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
42.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Senegal and the
Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii)
of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the text of a draft resolution
approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately.
43.       A feature of the Loan Agreement of speciaLl interest is referred to
in paragraph 28 of this report.
44.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.

Credit of February 10, 1969 and Loan of same date (cancelled);
Effective June 25, 1969; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
The credit is almost fully disbursed and a completion report is
being prepared.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Cr. 252        Casamance Rice Project; US$3.7 million
Credit of June 18, 1971; Effective January 6, 1972;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977
Project progress is satisfactory although the number of farms super-
vised has not increased as much as anticipated. On the other hand, production
targets established at appraisal will be reached. Adequate rainfall will
ensure a satisfactory 1975/76 campaign, although maize production suffered
from heavy rains in August. Because of cost overruns, mainly due to the
increased number of extension staff, salary increases and changes in the US
dollar exchange rate, the project was running out of funds. However, Govern-
ment has made available US$960,000 to finance project implementation between
July 1975 and June 1976. Together with undisbursed IDA funds (US$900,000)
this would ensure enough money to maintain project activities until a second
project is submitted to the Board for consideration.
Cr. 253         Technical and Agricultural Education Project; US$2.0 million
Credit of June 18, 1971; Effective November 30, 1971;
Closing Date: October 1, 1976
All components except the University Institute of Technology (IUT)
have been implemented. This item is 2.5 months overdue and is now expected
to be completed In March 1976. Delay has been due largely to technical
problems. A cost overrun of about US$500,000 on the project as a whole
is anticipated; the Government will finance it.
Cr. 254         Terres Neuves Settlement Project; US$1.35 Million
Credit of June 18, 1971; Effective January 31, 1972;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977
The project's settlement program was completed in 1974 as antici-
pated at appraisal. Adequate and evenly distributed rainfall ensured good
crops during the last two seasons. The project has been successful in pro-
viding higher incomes than expected for settlers and has attracted families
with more adult workers than anticipated. STN (the state corporation in
charge of the project) has taken over project management from the management
agency agreed upon at appraisal. During negotiations of the second project,
satisfactory arrangements were worked out to ensure adequate project manage-
ment and coordination with other regional agencies involved in the area.
The credit will he fully disbursed in the near future.

Cr. 314/Ln. 835      Second Railway Project:   US$3.2 Million and
US$6.4 Million Credit and Loan of June 23, 1972;
Effective December 29, 1972; Closing Date: June 30,
1976
The original project was substantially modified to reduce
track renewal works in favor of funds for spare parts for track laying and
maintenance equipment and for locomotives. By the end of 1975, US$6.0 million
had been disbursed out of the total Loan/Credit of US$9.6 million; track re-
newal had been completed, as well as procurement for workshop rehabilitation
and orders had been placed for all track equipment and spare parts for loco-
motives under the project; bids for the civil works to rehabilitate the work-
shops had been submitted and were being analyzed. In recent months, as a
result of sustained efforts by supervision missionE, the railway has been
granted financial autonomy, locomotive availability has been increased result-
ing in a higher carrying capacity, and steps have been taken to strengthen
technical assistance. Much improvement is still needed, however, in manage-
ment efficiency, and a proposed Third Railway Project, scheduled for FY 1977,
will focus on this. A drop in international traffic (end of the Mali drought
relief program) and in phosphate traffic (slump in world phosphate market) has
weakened railway finances.

Progress has been made in removing the major bottlenecks
to project execution. To accelerate physical execution the Government has:
(a) created a separate Site and Services Project Capital Account authorizing
OHLM's Director General to make direct withdrawals under a post hoc audit
control and permitting accelerated payments to conl:ractors; and (b) permitted
the continued use of a "procedure d'urgence" to accelerate tender award proce-
dures. As these measures have only recently been Lmplemented, physical pro-
gress remains slow, although construction activity has visibly quickened.
These and other agreed upon measures should contribute to recouping some of
the delays now amounting to about one year. Some 1,100 plots have now been
allocated by public lottery. Plot occupation is expected to begin in early
1976. Rather than reduce the size of the project, the Government and IDA have
agreed to reduce the disbursement percentage on civil works from 67% to 45% to
ensure the availability of IDA funds for all project components. Although
improved working performance has been achieved at the executing agency level
and some counterpart personnel have been elevated to project responsibility,
adequate counterpart staffing continues to pose difficulties and will warrant
close attention.

Ln. 866             Telecommunications Project; US$6.25 Million Loan of
December 19, 1972; Effective June 5, 1973; Closing Date:
December 31, 1976
Large cost overruns have raised the cost of this project
from US$8.9 million at appraisal to US$19.9 million according to recent esti-
mates. A co-financing formula was successfully worked out which included a
loan from the French Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE) of US$4
million, new French suppliers' credits of US$4 million, and an increased
contribution from our borrower, Office des Postes et Telecommunications du
Senegal (OPTS). The new financial package and conditions of the CCCE loan
were accepted by the Senegalese Government and the agreement would enable the
project to be completed as originally appraised. However, recently OPTS has
been informed that the Government intends to levy an income tax on OPTS's
profits from operations in FY 1975 and also for previous years. OPTS has
never before been subject to tax.   This change of policy towards the OPTS
is causing doubts about the financing plan drawn up at the time the CCCE loan
was negotiated. These matters are being discussed with the CCCE and the
Government.
Ln. 867             Airport Project; US$3.0 Million Loan of December 9, 1972;
Effective May 22, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1976
All project work was completed, the runway in full opera-
tional service and the loan fully disbursed by the end of January 1976. The
total cost of the project did not exceed the CFA franc costs made at appraisal
although the devaluation of the US dollar resulted in the proceeds of the Bank
loan financing a smaller percentage of the works than originally contemplated.
Cr. 350              River Polders Project; US$4.5 Million Credit of Janluary 9,
1973; Effective June 8, 1973; Closing Date: December 31,
1977
Procurement has been completed for the main components of
the project and contracts have been awarded. Construction of works is progres-
sing satisfactorily. The Senegalese authorities requested that the Debi/
Lampsar components of the project be deleted from Credit 350-SE and be reform-
ulated within the broader framework of integrated development of the Senegal
River Basin. The proposed reformulation was agreed upon by IDA and an en-
gineering project for Debi/Lampsar was appraised in December 1974 and approved
by the Board in April 1975. Because of price increases, US dollar devaluation
and additional works, the proceeds of Credit 350-SE will not be sufficient to
complete the project, despite the deletion of the Debi/Lampsar component.
The project authority SAED (Societe d'Amenagement et d'Exploitation des Terres
du Delta), is presently seeking supplementary financing from Government of
about US$3.6 million to complete the project.

Cr. 366              Second Highway Project; US$8.0 Million Credit of April 9,
1973; Effective November 28, 1973; Closing Date:
December 31, 1978
Implementation of the maintenance program and engineering
studies started about six months behind schedule and execution at the begin-
ning was slow but has improved since 1975. Engineering studies for the next
phase of pavement strengthening were completed during the first half of 1975.
Work on pavement strengthening began in February 1975, about 18 months later
than appraisal estimates. The pavement strengthening component originally
comprising 109 km of road rehabilitation had to be reduced to 35 km due to
higher construction costs than expected at appraisal, changes in the exchange
rate of the US dollar and the shifting of funds from pavement strengthening to
higher priority road maintenance.
Cr. 404              Second Agriculture Credit Project; US$8.2 Million Credit
of June 25, 1973; Effective November 28, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977
The 1974/75 campaign was good: groundnut and cereal
production (1.0 million and 0.7 million tons, respectively) reached their
highest levels since 1969. Demand for short and medium-term credit under
the 1975/76 campaign remained stronger than anticipated, but available credit
funds were sufficient to cover requirements for this campaign, the output of
which is expected to be even higher than that of 1974/75. Government intends
to cancel the subsidy on equipment but the subsidy on fertilizers will not
be reduced significantly, as required. However, the on-going study on fer-
tilizer applications financed under the Credit should provide a basis for
policy review. Major organizational and financial problems still exist at
ONCAD despite technical assistance provided since 1969. Steps taken by
Government in early 1975 to remedy this serious situation--maintaining staff
level, giving ONCAD management more financial autonomy and strengthening it
with qualified accountants--resulted in some improvement, especially in
accounting. However, ONCAD's overall performance has not improved and the
organization remains overstaffed. High wage inflation increased operating
costs without compensation through higher tariffs for its interventions.
ONCAD credit requirements attained record levels, partly because of accumu-
lating operating losses but mainly because of the large groundnut and millet
stocks and prolonged prefinancing for Government's account.
Ln. S-3              Ship Repair Engineering Loan:   US$0.6 Million Loan of
September 20, 1973; Effective February 5, 1974;
Closing Date: March 6, 1976
The project consists of carrying out the following studies
to determine the feasibility of a dry dock project:

(a)  Technical studies including those of physical and
geophysical factors affecting site selection.
(b) Economi,c studies including a market survey, a
revision of the dry dock project feasibility study
and a survey formulating a training program.
The studies have now been completed; they indicate low economic and financial
returns, and a relatively high market risk. The Government is exploring
possible financing and ways of reducing the market risk.
Cr. 446              Drought Relief Project; US$3.0 Million Credit of
December 7, 1973; Effective February 5, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976
The project is part of the Senegalese plan to rehabilitate
people In drought affected areas by assisting them to redevelop and improve
their farms and lands. Operations, including strengthening of health and
water supply services, have been proceeding satisfactorily and the project is
expected to be completed on schedule.
Ln. 987              SOFISEDIT Project; US$3.0 Million Loan of May 24, 1974;
Effective November 22, 1974; Closing Date: December 31,
1978
SOFISEDIT was created by the Government in March 1974 for
the purpose of providing long-term financing for industry and tourism develop-
ment. To recruit the initial staff and to find office space took several
months and the company did not start operations until November 1974. During
its first fiscal year of operations which ended September 30, 1975, SOFISEDIT
approved nine loans totaling US$2.4 million and three equity investments for a
total of US$320,000. The loan to SOFISEDIT is expected to be fully committed
by the end of 1976 and a second project was appraised in December 1975.
Cr. 530              Second Education Project:   US$15.0 Million Credit of
February 19, 1975; Effective April 22, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980
The project management unit has been strengthened and is
functioning well. Design work on the four lower secondary schools is well
advanced and is proceeding satisfactorily in the case of the lower secondary
science/technology centers. Construction at the Dakar Industrial Worker
Upgrading Center has begun and a tender has been issued for the National
Marine Training School. Equipment lists and bills of quantities of construc-
tion materials for the nonformal rural youth training program have been
approved by IDA. The Hotel/Tourism Training Center is delayed due to pro-
longed contract negotiations between the Government and the selected archi-
tectural consulting firm. Also the Government has yet to complete the terms
of reference for a preinvestment study of primary education.
