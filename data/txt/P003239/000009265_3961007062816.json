In this way, the project aims to improve\n            health outcomes, particularly in terms of nutritional\n            status, lower fertility, and reduced transmission of HIV.\n            Fulfilling these objectives will contribute to the social\n            sustainability of the adjustment program and strengthen the\n            human resource base necessary for the future growth of\n            Zambia. The credit will be divided into three major\n            components: 1) policy development support, including support\n            for national policy development and operational research to\n            help refine the basic policy framework, and adapt\n            operational strategies to the Zambian context through phased\n            testing of the delivery systems, operations research and\n            studies; 2) investment program support, and incremental\n            recurrent budget support which would support Districts in\n            the implementation of Health Reforms through their service\n            delivery, for both capital investment costs and recurrent\n            costs; and 3) external monitoring and evaluation including\n            support for monitoring progress attained through health\n            reforms, and evaluation through beneficiary assessments,\n            auditing, and quality control."}, "docdt": "1994-10-14T00:00:00Z"}
