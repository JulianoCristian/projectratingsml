MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IDA TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO ZAMBIA
FOR A HEALTH SECTOR SUPPORT PROJECT
I.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to Zambia for SDR 38.7 million, the equivalent of US$56 million, on standard
IDA terms, with a maturity of 40 years, to help finance a project for health sector support. The
project has significant cofinancing on a grant basis from a number of bilateral and multilateral donors.
2.    Bacftround. The rehabilitation and reform of social service delivery is a key area of concern
in Zambia's adjustment program and in the Government's overall development strategy, as stated in
the Policy Framework Paper. The health sector has not been able to adequately respond to increasing
demand for basic health care services to help households address problems of illness and disease.
Funding cutbacks in all social sectors, during the economic crisis of the 1980s, led to severe dilapida-
tion of existing health inrastructure and inappropriate capital investments. Nevertheless, the 1993
World Development Report shows that Zambia is among those countries whose health outcomes are far
lower than what could be expected, given its level of spending on health.
3.    The causes of the inefficiencies are: "verticalization", where health interventions, staff and
management systems were organized around specific diseases and interventions, from central level to
health facility, in response to growing dependence on donor assistance; "over-centralization", with
inability to react to changing social, demographic, political, macro-economic and physical environ-
ments; and "over-sophistication", with the health system driven by health professionals' demands for
new and expensive technology that fails to respond to the majority of health needs. The Govermnent
has launched a major health reform program to address these issues, primarily by decentralizing
management of health services to the district level. The aim is provide all Zambians with "equit of
access to cost-effective quality health care as close to the family as possible.  The Government has
identified the need for reform in the areas of management and accountability, community participa-
tion, public/private partnerships, and human resource development. This opens the doors to
(re)examining what health care is provided and how it is delivered (types of services, access, organi-
zation), whpt inputs are used to deliver it (efficiency), and exploring new possibilities in terms of
financing (identifying, mobilizing, and more effectively allocating resources for health care).
Improved service delivery at community and district levels will henceforth be the focus for achieving
this goal, for it is here that the health service system and communities can most effectively interact.
4.    The Government has undertaken a strategic planning exercise that matches resources with
national goals to define the basic package of care that should be delivered to all Zambians. This
exercise has convinced policy nakers to make tough trade-offs that they were reluctant to make in the
past, such as reallocating fumds, decentralizing decision-making authority, and moving away frm
vertical programs to instead package services to improve efficiency and equity in delivery. The exer-
cise has strengthened Zambian ownership of the health system while producing a national Strategic
Plan that outlines basic policies and sets the stage for joint government and donor support to the health
reforms. Since August 1993, all districts have received funding for non-personnel recurrent costs
directly, first on a pilot basis financed by donors, then by the Govermment since January 1994.
Continued funding is contingent upon the development and approval of district plans that include
monitorable indicators; district management must also have proven accounting capacity to handle these
finds locally. Substantial consensus- and capacity-building activities have been and continue to be



-2-
undertaken, using donor and Project Preparation Facility funds, by training and involving health staff
in all nine provinces and all 61 districts in the definition and vlanning of their own agendas.
5.    Projie  Ob_iectives. The project would support the Govermment's health sector reform pro-
gram with a view to improving access of the whole population to, and the effective utilization of,
good quality primary health care, nutrition interventions and family planning services. Fulfilling these
objectives would contribute to the social sustainability of the adjustment program and strengthen the
human capital base necessary for the future growth and development of Zambia.
6.    Project Descriltion. The project would support a share of the Government's health sector
reform program agreed to by a core group of donors. The project would support three major compo-
nents: (1) Policy Development and Operations Research to help refine the basic policy framework and
adapt operational strategies; (2) District impiementation of the health reform, through financing of
investments such as civil works, training and equipment, and of recurrent costs including supplies,
drugs, maintenance and logistics; and (3) Monitoring/quality control and evaluation, particularly
through beneficiary assessments. IDA would play the role of "lender of last resort", by supporting
those elements of the agreed program for which there is no other donor funding.
7.    IDA funding would provide a "buffer" by filling gaps between identified resource needs and
available funding, within the national investment and recurrent budget proposals. The exact mix of
domestic, donor and IDA funding over the life of this project will therefore be determined annually,
based upon joint agreement on the investment plan and recurrent budget. Financing will be structured
so that Zambia assumes an increasing share of the recurrent budget, and so that IDA will not (expli-
citly or implicitly) finance ineligible expenditures, e.g., land purchases or taxes. Cofinancing will be
done on a parallel basis, with each donor funding "full contracts" (complete sets of goods that do not
depend upon administrative obligations of other donors to complete the procurement), except for
recurrent budget support to Districts, where national procedures acceptable to all financiers have been
developed. A breakdown of the costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. The estimated
procurement and disbursement schedules are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in Zambia are shown in Schedules C and D
respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 13480-ZA is attached.
8.    Project Implementation. The Government, IDA and core donors have agreed on the
following implementation process for the reform program. The Government is currently refining its
"Strategic Plan" which outlines the framework and standards for the new system including: content
and cost-effective delivery methods for the basic package of care; roles and responsibilities of each
level of the health system; and policies aimed to improve utilization of drugs, supplies and human
resources. This plan was the main focus of the joint donor mission in April 1994, along with an
implementation strategy detailing the criteria and means by which district plans will be funded,
executed and monitored. It is complemented by an action plan to harnonize planning, budgeting,
disbursement and accounting mechanisms that will enable all donor support to be channeled through
one system, whether supportive of broad sectoral operations or specific program activities. The
Strategic Plan will be updated annually by Government and discussed with donors in the first half of
each calendar year. It will identify the needs for donor support in policy developmnent and reform
implementation. Based upon the Strategic Plan, the Government will prepare a rolling five-year
investment programn and an annual recurrent cost budget. These documents will be discussed with
donors (including IDA) during the last half of each year, starting in October 1994. Each donor will
then bilaterally structure its support on the basis of the Strategic Plan, investment program and budget.



-3-
The donors who provide 80 percent of total donor funding have indicated their conmitment to this
system, and they agree to fund only items included in the core documents. Other donors will likely
follow suit, once the new system is in place and the Government is in a position to decline donor
funding outside the agreed framework.
9.    Proiect Sustainabilitv. The project will strengthen the capacity of the health sector to res-
pond to evolving epidemiological and financial circumstances, thereby developing sustainable services.
Recurrent costs will be financed on a sliding scale, as 're-tooling" of the delivery system from the
present inefficient, centralized system will require short-run cost increases. The Goverment is
conmitted to ensuring sufficient domestic funding of the health systemn and has already increased its
funding for District non-personnel recurrent costs in the 1994 budget. The Government is also com-
mitted to developing a comprehensive health financing framework and already has authorized some
local cost recovery measures. The linkages between quality, costs, and fees are being addressed.
10.   Lessons from Previous IDA Involvement. The Bank Group has not been involved in the
Zambian health sector before. Health sector experiences in other countries demonstrate, however, the
need for more comprehensive and integrated sectoral involvement to ensure sustainable development
impact. Zambia is currently pursuing a similar approach to donor support in the agriculture sector
and has also asked for IDA involvement there.
11.   Raonale for IDA Involvemnt. IDA has played a key role in supporting the health reforms
over the last two years, together with UNICEF and WHO. Moral support for the reforms must now
be followed by flexible, yet targeted and timely lending. In each of the three areas outlined above,
there is a need for a "donor of last resort" (1) to fill the gaps after other (mostly bilateral) donors have
adjusted their support to meet specific requirements and restrictions (e.g., several Northern European
donors are limited from providing support to urban health care, despite its significance in Zambia),
and (2) to enable the Government to realize their strategic sector plan overall. While in full
agreement with these principles, UNICEF and WHO do not have the necessary financial resources to
provide this support.
12.   The latest Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was reviewed by the Board on March 10, 1994.
This health sector support project is a key comiponent of the country strategy, in tenns of both the
process adopted for preparing the project and the content of the resulting operation. First on
processes: (1) this project is the first in a series of integrated sector operations, designed to ensure full
government ownership and control over the aid process; and (2) the project is based on extensive
systematic client consultation exercises and will be monitored using beneficiary and stakeholder
assessments. These are the two main elements in the process adopted in the CAS. On content, the
CAS proposes to assist Zambia in three main areas, all based on the overall goal of poverty reduction:
(1) facilitating growth through removal of policy constraints and improving the enabling environment,
including fiscal management; (2) improving the provision of infrastructure and the building up of
human capital; and (3) targeted intervel-tions to the poor. Improving access to quality health services
is critical to meeting these objectives, and support for the health reforms is thus a critical element of
the CAS: (1) health is a critical element of human capital formation; (2) the reforms supported by this
project will improve the management of fiscal resources in the health sector and will ensure a greater
role for private providers; and (3) even though not explicitly targeted to the poor, public health
services, focusing on a basic package of care, would proportionately benefit the poor more than other
groups, especially by increasing cost sharing of non-basic, tertiary, hospital-based services.



-4-
13.   Aareed Actions. With assistance from WHO, UNICEF and IDA, the Government has
reviewed the basic framework for health financing. It has also presented a final version of its
strategic plan for health, as well as its investment program for 1995-97 and a recurrent budget for
1995, all acceptable to IDA and other donors. As a condition of effectiveness, the Govermnent will
assure IDA that the program for 1995 is fully financed. As conditions of disbursements (1) against
civil works for District health facilities, the Government will submit standard architectural designs
acceptable to IDA; and (2) against provincial and central level hospitals, the equivalent of US$ 10
million will have been disbursed from the IDA credit for District health facilities. The Credit
Agreement is structured to ensure that continued IDA disbursements are contingent upon govermnent-
IDA agreement on the Strategic Plan and investment program at any point in time during
implementation of the program.
14.   Envirounental Aspecs. The project has been rated C due to the sector reform nature of the
credit. Environmental considerations will be built into the sub-project appraisal and financing criteria
and agreed with IDA prior to implementation. Such criteria will be consistent with the recently
completed National Environmental Action Plan. The overall impact on the environment is expected to
be small but positive: some of the main health problems are due to poor sanitation and water supply,
and remedies for those problems will improve both public health and the environment. All of the
infrastructure work will be either rehabilitation or expansion of existing facilities.
15.   Program Obietrve Category. This forms part of the core poverty alleviation program of
IDA. An integral part of the poverty reduction aspects of Zambia's reform program is the improved
efficiency and effectiveness of social service delivery - and witiin this the health sector is talcing the
lead. The project will therefore also contain major elements of civil service reform and improved
private/public mix in service delivery. The services supported are targeted by level of service (e.g.,
preventive and basic curative services), but not explicitly by income group.
16.     cipatory ADproac. The reform program was prepared by the Ministry of Health in
consultation with private stakeholders (NGOs, private industry and health service users) and health
service providers. The basic principles of the reform to remove the constraints outlined above were
identified through beneficiary assessments and other participatory methods. Three different
beneficiary assessments were funded by the Association in preparation of the IDA support to the
reform program. These dnd the recently completed Participatory Poverty Assessment (which contains
large sections on health) form the base-line for evaluation and monitoring. Local participation is a
critical element of the reform program as witnessed by the emphasis on partnership and local
leadership. Autonomous district health boards (including communrity leaders) manage the overall
health service in a district, and community management structures are being established for health
centers. Annual beneficiary assessments will be carried out along with stakeholder analyses as an
integral part of monitoring progress of the project.
17.   Project Benefits. The ultimate benefit of the project would be improved health status of the
Zambian population (as measured by longer-run outcome measures such as infant mortality and adult
morbidity). This will be accomplished by improved service delivery (as measured by output and unit
cost indicators, such as coverage rates for ante-natal care, inmunizations, growth monitoring, contra-
ceptive prevalence and quality of care indicators), and through improved institutional set-ups and
procedures (as measured by process and input indicators, such as amount of drugs and supplies enter-
ing the system, clinics rehabilitated, degree of budgetary autonomy of the health boards and number of



- 5-
staff trained). Monitoring will be done using beneficiay assessments, review of administrative
records and periodic technical audits.
18.    ro,ject Risks. The Zambian Governent could conceivably abandon the entire structural
reform process, but this risk is being minimized through adjustment lending that includes immediate
and visible positive results in terns of refonns in social service delivery systems. This project would
help support macroeconomic reforms by improving service delivery within a core public expenditure
item. Another risk to the sustainability of the reforms is the continued ad-hoc implementation of cost
recovery schemes, in isolation from quality improvements in health services, as perceived by Zambian
clients. Resentment over new financial burdens without commensurate exchange of service value is
undermining public support for the entire reform process. Discussions are cngoing with Government
to review this policy. There is no practical alternative to the proposed sector approach. A traditional
investment project would destroy the government-led process of reforms and would not be sustainable
institutionally.
19.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Association, and I rcommend tlhat the Executive Directors approve it.
