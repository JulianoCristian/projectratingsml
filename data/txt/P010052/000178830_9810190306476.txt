INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
OF THE
PRESIDENT
TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A
PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO
THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
FOR A
SECOND WEST PAKISTAN HIGHWAY PROJECT

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT TO THE
ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN FOR A SECOND WEST PAKEISTAN HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan in amounts in various
currencies equivalent to US $36 million to assist in financing a Second
Highway Project in West Pakistan. The credit includes an amount of $1 mil-
lion to refinance the Highway Engineering Credit provided for in Development
Credit Agreement No. S-1 PAK dated August 22, 1966.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The construction of new roads to meet the increased demands of
agricultural and industrial growth in West Pakistan stands high on the list
of Pakistan's development priorities. Allied to this is an increasing aware-
ness on the part of the Central and Provincial Governments of the need to
establish policies for transport coordination in West Pakistan and to resolvc
certain serious problems of road maintenance and highway administration.
3.        The problems of road transport in West Pakistan have engaged the
attention of the World Bank Group since 1961. In 1964 the Association made
a first credit of $17 million (Credit 54-PAK) to finance the construction
of a highway and three bridges, feasibility studies and general consultants'
services in West Pakistan. This project is being carried out satisfactorily.
4.        In 1966 a second credit of $1 million was provided by the
Association (Credit S-1 PAK) to assist in financing the detailed engineering
of two major roads and two bridges in West Pakistan.  The Association indi-
cated, at the time, that this credit would be refinanced out of the proceeds
of any Bank loan or IDA credit, which might subsequently be made available
for construction work on the project. The quality of work performed under
this credit is satisfactory.
5.        The proposed third credit would enable Pakistan to continue the
improvement of road transportation facilities and highway organization
financed under Credit 54-PAK. It would also complement the program of
work under Credit S-1 PAK by providing construction financing for the high-
ways engineered under that credit.
6.        The project was appraised in March 1968.  Negotiation of the
proposed credit took place in Washington between June 5 and June 10 with
a delegation comprising Mr. A.R. Bashir, Economic M1inister, Embassy of
Pakistan; Mr. Niaz Ahmad, Secretary to the Communications and Works
Department of the Government of West Pakistan; Mr. Saeed Ahmad, Director
General of the Highway Department of West Pakistan; and Dr. A. uz Zaman,
Economic Secretary, Embassy of Pakistan.
7.        The Bank has made 24 loans to Pakistan totalling about $460
million, of which 16 are fully disbursed. The Association has made 23
credits totalling $321 million, of which 5 are fully disbursed. The
following is a summary statement of Bank loans and IDA credits to Pakistan
as at May 31, 1968:

8.        A $10 million credit for a second Agricultural Development Bank
Project was approved by Executive Directors on April 30.   The Development
Credit Agreement together with a companion credit of $5 million extended
by the Swedish Government are to be signed on June 13.   Two loans for
fertilizer projects and a loan for a gas pipeline project have been appraised
and are expected to be ready for presentation for your consideration in the
near future.   In addition, a $25 million loan for the Tarbela Project in
West Pakistan has been negotiated and is expected to be submitted for your
consideration shortly.
9.        Execution of Bank Group financed projects generally has been
satisfactory and progress on the construction of the Indus Basin works has
been particularly good.   Continuing difficulties in the execution of the
Dacca and Chittagong Water Supply Projects (Credits 41 and 42-PAK) have
resulted in a further cancellation of $2.8 million and $7 million respect-
ively.   The proposed revised and scaled-down projects will be presented for
your consideration shortly.   It is expected that these projects will now be
completed successfully.   The recent mission of the East Pakistan Agricul-
tural and Water Development Program has suggested a revision of the Chandpur
Irrigation Project which will be presented to you shortly for your approval.
This became necessary due mainly to increased costs and technical difficul-
ties.   A proposal for the extension of the Closing Date of Credit 22-PAK,
Khairpur Irrigation Project, will shortly be presented.
10.       IFC has made 8 commitments in Pakistan totalling $17,818,558.  The
outstanding commitment net of repayments, cancellations and sales of loans
is $14,167,49h.   IFC is presently considering investment applications for
fertilizer, and additional jute and paper projects.   The IFC operations in
Pakistan are proceeding satisfactorily.
PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED CREDIT
11.       Borrower:                Islamic Republic of Pakistan.
Beneficiary:             Province of West Pakistan.
Amount:                  Various currencies equivalent to
$36.0 million including $1 million to
refund the Engineering Credit under S-1 PAK.
Purpose:                 To finance the foreign exchange cost of
the construction of two highways via
Sheikhupura - between Lahore and Lyallpur
and Lahore and Sargodha respectively -
including a major bridge across the
Chenab River; a transport coordination
study; consultant services for the
reorganization of the Highway Department;
updating of feasibility studies
for the main trunk road between Hyderabad
and Multan and the preparation of



detailed design for high priority sections of
this road; a feasibility study for the main
trunk road between Lahore and Rawalpindi; and
a three-year maintenance program.
Amortization:       The development credit would be for a period
of 50 years, repayable in semi-annual install-
ments commencing February 15, 1979, and ending
August 15, 2018; each payment up to and in-
cluding the payment due on August 15, 1988 to
be 3½ of 1 percent, thereafter to be 1½ percent
of the principal amount.
Service Charge:     3,'b of 1 percont per annum.
Relending Terms:    The proceeds of the credit, less the amount
required to refinance the Engineering Credit
(S-1 PAK) and the amount allocated for the
transport coordination study, will be relent
to the Government of West Pakistan on IDA terms.
PART III - THE PROJECT
12.       A detailed description of the project is given in the attached
Appraisal Report entitled "A Second Highway Project for West Pakistan"
(TO-651a) dated June 12, 1968.
13.       West Pakistan has a network of roads totalling about 30,000 miles
of which over 10,000 miles are paved. Although the length of the network is
generally adequate the width and strength of the pavement is limited, the
quality of surfacing is poor and many of these roads cannot be made suitable
for modern motor traffic without extensive rebuilding. The problem is com-
plicated by the widespread use of animal drawn traffic on trunk roads which
further reduces their capacity to carry motor traffic.
1.       The project will finance the construction of two highways and one
of two bridges engineered under Credit No. S-1 PAK. One section of a high-
way - engineered from Sargodha to Khushab - has been deferred for later
financing. The project area includes some of the best agricultural lands
and the heaviest industrialized areas in West Pakistan. It also contains
some of West Pakistan's most congested population centers.
15.       The proposed road from Lahore to Lyallpur would link the second
and third largest cities of West Pakistan by a modern highway. The road
from Lahore to Sargodha which includes the new bridge over the Chenab River,
is expected to result in a sharp drop in transport costs between Lahore and
the agricultural area west of the river.  The two roads which are expected
to yield an internal rate of return of 17 percent will have a total length
of about 170 miles which is 27 miles less than the existing routes.



Construction will be confined to two-lane roads in both cases, but right
of way acquisition is proceeding as planned for ultimate expansion to six
lanes from Lahore to Sheikbupura and to four lanes from Sheikhupura to
Lyallpur and Sargodha when warranted. The Pakistan Government's current
intention is that tolls would be collected on both roads, but it has agreed
to consult with the Association on this matter in the light of the findings
of the transport coordination study.
16.       The project also provides for feasibility studies and detailed
engineering design for sections of the National Highway between Karachi
and Rawalpindi. The Karachi-Hyderabad section is presently being constructed
under Credit No. 5h-PAK and detailed engineering of the Nultan-Lahore
section has been financed by USAID. It is now proposed to update the feasi-
bility studies of the Hyderabad-INultan road, carried out previously by USAID,
and prepare detailed design for high priority sections of that road totalling
about 250 miles. A feasibility study is also provided under the project for
the trunk road between Lahore and Rawalpindi.
17.       Provision is also included in the project for consultant services
to assist in the reorganization and training of the staff of the Highway
Department of West Pakistan; and for a three-year maintenance program which
would include the purchase of equipment and spare parts. The project also
provides for a study by the Central Government which would make recommenda-
tions for effective transport coordination in West Pakistan.
18.       The project - excluding the transport coordination study - would
be carried out,with the assistance of consultants, by the Highway Department
of the Communications and Works Department of the Government of West
Pakistan. The Highway Department was established on October 1, 1967 follow-
ing a recommendation of the general consultant retained under Credit 54-PAK,
that the then combined Buildings and Roads Department be reorganized as two
separate departments. Continued assistance by the general consultant is
required for reorganizing and training of staff in the Highway Department an&
assurances were given by the representatives of the Provincial Government
during negotiations that a contract for these services will be signed before
the proposed Credit Agreement is signed.
19.       The proposed credit would finance only the foreign exchange compo-
nent (approximately 47 percent) of the total project cost. The Credit Agree-
ment, if approved, could not be signed until funds are available for commit-
ment as the result of IDA replenishment. No disbursements from the credit
would be made for expenditures prior to the date on which the Credit Agreemen..
is signed except for spare parts and consultants' services for which retro-
active financing from July 1, 1968 is proposed. Even if the replenishment
is delayed for several months, this would not involve more than a few hundred
thousand dollars.
20.       It is intended to exempt the procurement of two items from inter-
national competitive bidding. These are spare parts for existing equipment
(approximately $150,000) and some specialized office and engineering equip-
ment (approximately $50,000).
21.       The Government of Pakistan would relend the proceeds of the credit,
less the amount required to refinance the Engineering Credit (S-1 PAK) and
the amount allocated for the transport coordination study, to the Government
of West Pakistan on IDA terms.

PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
22.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Islamic
Republic of Pakistan and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between
the Association and the Province of West Pakistan, and the Recommendation
of the Committee provided for under Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles
of Agreement of the Association are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately.
23.       The draft legal documents contain provisions generally used for
highway projects.   In addition, provisions are made in the draft Develop-
ment Credit Agreement regarding the refinancing of the Highway Engineering
Credit (S-1 PAK) and the relending of part of the proceeds of the credit by
the Borrower to the Province.
24.       Under the draft Project Agreement, the Province undertakes
to allocate annually, until the completion of the transport coordination
study, recurrent maintenance funds for highways under the jurisdiction of the
Highway Department of the Province in an amount not less than the amount
allocated by the Province in the fiscal year 1967/68.
PART V - THE ECONOMY
25.       The last Report on the economic position and prospects of Pakistan
(AS-136a) was circulated on April 17, 1968.   Pakistan's economic perfor-
mance has been satisfactory, although further improvements are desirable,
particularly in the field of foreign trade and exchange policies, and in
increasing national savings.   Prospects are for a 25 percent shortfall in
development expenditures during the Third Five-Year Plan (1965/66 - 1969/70);
but due to a massive drive in the field of agriculture, and a change in
industrial strategy, physical output targets for 1969/70 may be reached in
many cases.   In particular the original target for wheat production has
already been exceeded in 1967/68.
26.       The Pakistan Consortium which met on May 21, 1968 recorded general
satisfaction with Pakistanls economic growth and with her development policy,
particularly the revised agricultural program.    Concern was expressed at the
rapidly rising external debt service ratio, which is likely to exceed
20 percent in a few years.   The need to strive towards a soft blend of 80 to
20 in future assistance to Pakistan was reqognized, and the Bank was charged
to initiate a study on practical ways of improving the terms on which aid has
so far been made available.   At the meeting, the Pakistan representative
indicated that the Government would take steps along the lines recommended in
the Bank Report, both in the field of exchange policy and taxation.



PART VI - COMPIIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
27.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VII - RECOMMENDATION
28.       I recommend that the Executive Directors adopt the following
resolution:
RESOLUTION NO. IDA-
Approval of Development Credit to the Islamic Republic
of Pakistan in an amount equivalent to US $36,000,000.
RESOLVED:
THAT the Association shall grant a development credit
to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan in an amount in various
currencies equivalent to thirty-six million United States
dollars (US $36,000,000),to mature on and prior to August 15,
2018, to bear a service charge at the rate of three-fourths
of one per cent (3/4 of 1%) per annum, and to be upon such
other terms and conditions as shall be substantially in
accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the form
of Development Credit Agreement (Second West Pakistan Highwjay
Project) between the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the
Association and Project Agreement (Second West Pakistan
Highway Project) between the Association and the Province of
West Pakistan, which have been presented to this meeting.
