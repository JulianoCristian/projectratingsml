A HIGHWAY PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. Geographic and Economic Setting
1.01      Zimbabwe is a landlocked country of about 390,000 square kilometres
bounded by Mozambique, Botswana, Zambia and South Africa (see Map). Topogra-
phically, the land rises from low plains in the northwest and southeast to a
high plateau (1,200-1,500 meters) which runs from the southwest to the north-
east. The high country has a temperate climate with a reasonably high level
of rainfall, while the middle regions are warmer and drier and the low areas
are arid to sub-arid. As of June 1981 the population was estimated at 7.7
million people, of which 97% were black Zimbabweans; population growth is 3.4%
per year. The remaining "non-African" population consists of about 170,000
Europeans, 10,000 Asians and 23,000 people of mixed origin.
1.02      Between 1964 and 1975, real growth of the economy averaged over 7%
per year, far outstripping population increments. However, between 1975 and
1979, the country suffered a severe recession and underwent some significant
economic changes due primarily to intensified civil war and UN imposed
economic sanctions before independence. GDP declined by 14% while the
population continued to increase, so that by 1979 real per capita income had
fallen back to its 1965 level. In 1980 and 1981, GDP (at 1965 prices) grew at
an average of about 10% per year. The 1980 GDP per capita at current prices
is estimated at US$630, making the Zimbabwean economy the second largest in
southern Africa.
1.03      The economy is well diversified.  Agriculture, manufacturing and
mining are the most important sectors of the economy. Agriculture accounts
for 14% of GDP and provides employment for 300,000 persons (35% of all
employment) and some income for another 1.4 million who depend mainly on
subsistance or small holder agriculture. In 1980, agricultural exports
provided approximately 37% of foreign exchange earnings. Zimbabwe's mining
sector contributes 8% of the country's GDP and accounts for almost 6% of
employment.  Mining is also central to Zimbabwe's foreign trade--mining
exports earn about 40% of the foreign exchange earnings. The mining and
agricultural sectors supply the bulk of the inputs for the manufacturing
sector, which in 1981 was 24% of GDP, employed 163,000 persons and accounted
for 21% of Zimbabwe's merchandise exports.
B. Transport System
General Description
1.04      Zimbabwe has an extensive transport system of 85,621 km of roads,
3,374 km of railroad and eight airports (three international), which
principally serve the country's urban areas, commercial farms and industrial



- 2 -
and mining centers. The development and maintenance of transport facilities
in the communal lands, where approximately 60% of population lives, have been
neglected due to past government policies and the war. In its post war policy
statement, the Government has emphasized the importance of rehabilitating and
developing the transport infrastructure especially for integrating the rural
economy into the modern sector. This is reflected in the transitional
programs for public sector development currently being implemented by the
transport agencies (para. 1.13) and in the National Development Plan under
preparation by the Government.
1.05      As a landlocked country, Zimbabwe faces difficulties with respect to
the transport of imports and exports through neighboring countries. The
shortest route is the railway through Mozambique, which has become increasing-
ly congested and inefficient, forcing ever greater dependence upon the rail
routes through the Republic of South Africa (RSA). The main rail route now is
the line through Botswana to Port Elizabeth, RSA. The other South African
route to Durban via Beitbridge can handle only limited tonnage for Zimbabwe.
Sitting astride key railway and road routes Zimbabwe's transport network is of
vital importance to the entire Southern Africa region and offers Zambia,
Botswana and parts of Zaire accesses to the sea. Zimbabwe's own transport
difficulties and those of its neighbors cannot be solved without a coordinated
effort in developing regional transport facilities and services. This has
been given the highest priority by the Southern African Development
Coordination Conference (SADCC) which established the Southern Africa
Transport and Communications Commission (SATCC) to promote and coordinate the
development of regional transport and communications in its nine member
countries. Ninety-seven projects at an estimated cost of US$2 billion have
been presented by SATCC for consideration by international and bilateral
financing agencies.
Highways
1.06      Details of the road sub-sector are presented in Chapter II.
Railways
1.07      Although faced with some problems the National Railways of Zimbabwe
(NRZ) is a well-managed and efficiently operated parastatal organization. It
operates 275 diesel locomotives, 159 steam locomotives, 13,480 wagons1/, and
356 passenger coaches over 3,374 km of track2/. In 1981 NRZ carried 13.9
million tons of freight, a 5% increase over the previous year. However, net
ton-kilometers declined slightly from 6.9 billion in 1980 to 6.6 billion in
1981 caused chiefly by the withdrawal of leased locomotives by RSA. Of the
traffic carried, 62% was local, 15% exports, 15% imports and 8% transit.
While the availability of freight wagons is very high, 94% for general cargo
and specialized wagons, operations have been hampered by low availability of
locomotives: 60% for diesel and 50% for steam. This is attributable to the
age of the locomotive fleet, shortage of skilled labor and periodic shortages
of spare parts due to foreign exchange constraint. As a result, NRZ was able
to carry only 85% of the traffic offered in 1981.
1/ Of which 10,800 are reportedly available for service.
2/ This includes 640 km of track in Botswana operated by NRZ.

1.08      NRZ has incurred deficit in its operations each year since 1970 and
is subsidized by government grants. The deficit, which totalled Z$32.3
million (US$51.2 million) in FY1980, has risen steadily, the result primarily
of heavy cost of subsidization of the transport of coal, coke, passenger and
some agricultural commodities. The Government is reluctant to allow a rapid
increase of tariffs on the grounds that it would be inflationar3, However,
under the terms of the Transport Rehabilitation Imports Program Loan (Loan
1994-ZIM), the Government is studying the railway tariff and cost structure
and is taking steps to improve NRZ's financial working ratio from 113 in 1980
to 100 by FY1985. NRZ's financial situation improved slightly in 1981 despite
the decline in ton-kilometers hauled, as a result of a 60% rise in passenger
traffic and two tariff increases (on October 1 and again May 1, 1981) for an
effective increase of 20 percent.
1.09      Another pressing problem is the critical shortage of qualified
staff, especially artisans. This is a result of a neglect of training of
black Zimbabweans for senior management positions in the past and the exodus
of artisans from Zimbabwe since independence. The problem is being addressed
in the short-term by employment of expatriate technical assistance from
England, India, and Pakistan, and in the longer term by improvement of train-
ing programs and facilities. This critical problem is expected to be
addressed in the Bank's proposed Railways Technical Assistance and Training
Project scheduled for FY1984.
Air Transport
1.10      Air transport, though secondary to railways and roads, provides a
vital link between major cities and with other countries in Africa and
Europe. There are eight airports, of which three, Harare, Bulawayo and
Victoria Falls, are international. Air Zimbabwe (AZ), a parastatal company
under the Ministry of Transport (MT), operates eight Viscounts, three Boeing
720s, three Boeing 707s and one DC-3 on eight domestic and five regional
routes and one inter-continental route to London. To increase the long and
medium haul capacity of the AZ fleet, three Boeing 720s are being taken out of
service and two Boeing 707s are being purchased.
1.11      In FY1981, AZ flew 431 million passenger kilometers, 67% higher than
the previous year, and carried 5 million ton-kilometers of cargo, a 73%
increase from 1980. While revenue for FY1981 was in excess of Z$40 million,
an increase of 48% from 1980, net profits fell 89% mainly attributable to the
purchase of equipment, high fuel costs and salary and wages increases. AZ is
allocating a significant portion of its revenues to expand its staff (1,440 in
1981) to include more Africans and institute special training programs to
accelerate their absorption into the work force. This is important for the
long-term development of AZ which is beset by continuing departure of many
experienced staff of European origin. Despite these difficulties, AZ is a
sound organization and is expected to become increasingly profitable.
1.12      Affretair, a subsidized parastatal corporation under MT, handles
most of the cargo transport. In 1981, Affretair carried 20,000 metric tons of
cargo with its fleet of two DC-8s, one DC-7 and two CO-44s. It serves
domestic, African and some European countries. Merger of AZ and Affretair is
being considered.



C. Transport Policy, Planning and Coordination
1.13      The country's transport policy is to: (i) integrate the rural areas
into the modern sector by providing necessary transport and communications
services; (ii) repair war-damaged roads and refurbish the road maintenance
equipment and vehicle fleet; (iii) rehabilitate the railway tracks, repair
locomotives and wagons and replace South African locomotives and wagons
withdrawn from Zimbabwe; and (iv) replace AZ's aging fleet of aircraft. The
policy is sound, but the current programs are transitional in character and
are only a beginning in the post independence development process and are
expected to be followed by a more comprehensive plan with long-term objectives
as part of a National Development Plan.
1.14      The proposed transport sector investments for FYs1982-84 are
presented in Table 11 which has been based on short term transitional
development programs prepared by the various transport agencies. By far the
largest investment is for the railways -- 62% of the total transport invest-
ments. Roads and aviation investments constitute 34% and 4% respectively.
The substantial expenditures on railways are mainly for spare parts and new
locomotives which are being financed with assistance from bilateral and multi-
lateral aid agencies such as the European Development Fund (EDF), Overseas
Development Administration (ODA) and the Bank. The increases in expenditures
for roads and aviation are small and are within the capacity of Government
resources with a little external assistance. However, given the subsidies to
NRZ for transport of certain commodities and NRZ's losses, the gradual elimi-
nation of rail subsidies and free competition between the transport modes,
particularly road and rail, should be considered in order to optimize

1.15      Transport planning is carried out separately by each of the agencies
responsible for a particular mode, namely, NRZ for railways, the Department of
Civil Aviation for aviation and the Ministry of Roads and Road Traffic (MRRT)
for roads. There is no formal coordination but the Treasury assumes this
function in approving development budgets and control of rail tariffs and
subsidies as does MRRT in issuing permits to operate commercial road transport
services. The Ministry of Finance, Economic Planning and Development (MFEPD),



established in 1980, has begun to be concerned with questions of transport
coordination and planning in approving transport projects and investment, but
its future role in transport coordination and planning is uncertain.
1.16      A Transport Planning Branch (TPB) has been established recently in
MRRT to study questions of highway investment planning and coordination with
other transport modes. The ministry should now be better able to evaluate the
engineering and economic analyses of highway investment proposals but TPB
lacks expertize to deal with transport coordination problems and issues. To
assist Zimbabwe in these areas, the proposed project includes a national
transport study to improve transport coordination and to recommend changes in
regulatory and pricing policy to ensure the most economic transport services
in the country (para. 3.10).
D. Past Bank Group Involvement and Bank Strategy
1.17      The Bank recently approved the Transport Rehabilitation Program Loan
(Loan 1994-ZIM, US$42.0 million, 1981) to provide foreign exchange for spare
parts, track maintenance equipment, tools and technical assistance to NRZ and
for replacement of unserviceable road maintenance equipment and vehicles and
spare parts to the Central Mechanical Equipment Department (CMED) for use by
the road agencies. Implementation of the program is satisfactory.
1.18      The Bank strategy in the highway sub-sector is to (i) support the
Government's efforts to strengthen and complete the paving of the basic road
network and (ii) provide assistance to improve transportation in the communal
lands (formerly called the Tribal Trust Lands) where the need for funds and
technical assistance is the greatest. The Bank should also ensure that the
institutional base is established to continue development in the longer-term
and that rural roads and transport services are maintained satisfactorily.
Moreover, the Bank should continue the policy dialogue begun under the
Transport Rehabilitation Program Loan to review subsidies in the railways and
to develop a regulatory and pricing policy which encourages a more efficient
use of both rail and road transport facilities and services.

II. THE HIGHWAY SUBSECTOR
A. The Network
2.01      The highway network of Zimbabwe totals 85,621 km, of which about 14%
is paved, 54% gravelled surface and about 32% earth roads and tracks (Table
2.1).

2.02      State roads are the major roads, connecting provincial and district
centers and providing the international links. Rural council roads serve
principally the commercial farming areas. District roads are those serving
the less developed communal lands. The roads located in the eleven urban
areas controlled by the municipalities are designated municipal roads.
2.03      The length of the state and rural council road networks is adequate
but its condition has suffered from a lack of strengthening and improvement
due to a diversion of funds to the war efforts. The district roads had been
given a low priority before independence and were seriously damaged when
fighting erupted in the communal lands. The main roads in these areas are
being taken into the state road network and upgrading to all-weather standards
is underway. The proposed project will finance the construction of about 400
km of these roads (paras. 3.06 and 3.07).
2.04      The feeder roads (district roads) are being rehabilitated with
financial assistance from bilateral aid agencies, such as Kreditanstalt fur
Wiederaufbau (KfW), ODA and USAID, to provide access to remote parts of the
communal lands. The KfW will soon undertake a study to prepare a feeder roads
project in seven districts in the country to be implemented with KfW
financing. The national feeder roads study included in the proposed project
will prepare a feeder roads project for areas other than those covered by KfW
(para. 3.12).



B. Road Transport Characteristics
Vehicle Fleet
2.05      From a peak of about 20,000 in 1971, new registrations of motor
vehicles declined to about 8,000 in 1979 due to the shortage oi foreign
exchange caused by UN imposed economic sanctions and the war. However,
between 1976 and 1980, the vehicle fleet increased from 206,193 to 247,130
(Table 2.2 ) as owners of trucks and cars kept their vehicles in service
longer. The truck fleet with one truck per 450 inhabitants is the second
largest in the region after Kenya. The light vehicle fleet with one vehicle
per 32 inhabitants is the largest.

2.06      The domestic motor vehicle manufacturing industry consists of the
manufacture of some parts and assembly of cars and trucks of foreign origin.
The present local content for passenger cars is 40% and for trucks is 50%.
Almost all cars and trucks sold in the country are produced locally. The
industry was badly hurt during the war by shortages of foreign exchange but
the situation has improved greatly since independence with increased
allocations of foreign exchange specifically to the industry. Production in
1980 was 10,160 units compared to 6,472 in 1979 (Table 2.3). It is not clear
if the industry is efficient and competitive as it is highly protected by the
import licensing and tariff structure but the selling prices are about the
same as the sticker prices in the United States. Under the Manufacturing
Rehabilitation Imports Program (Loan 1987-ZIM), a review of the licensing and
tariff practices is expected to be completed by March 1, 1983, which will
enabie the Government to introduce measures to encourage efficiency and
competitiveness of the local manufacturing industries including the motor
vehicle industry.

Fuel Consumption and Prices
2.07      Sales of gasoline and diesel oil declined from 1973 until indepen-
dence in 1980 when they rose by 18% over the preceding year. In 1980, 530
million liters of gasoline and diesel oil were sold in the country, of which
roughly 84%, was for automotive purposes. The scope for restraining fuel use
depends on increased fuel efficiency, which is determined by road conditions
and replacement of old equipment. The pump prices for regular gasoline and
diesel in Harare are Z$0.70/liter and Z$0.36/liter, respectively, including
taxes. The tax component represents 50% of the cost of gasoline and 3% of the
cost of diesel. The gasoline price is higher than those in neighboring
Botswana, Swaziland and RSA due to higher taxes and transport costs but the
diesel price is considerably less. Although the Government has moved towards
increasing the price of diesel by raising the tax on diesel from 0.8 cents/
liter to 2.8 cents/liter in August 1982, demand mix of fuel use is likely to
be distorted if the wide disparity between the prices of gasoline and diesel
is allowed to continue.
2.08      The Bank Energy Assessment Report (Report No. 3765-ZIM, June 1982)
recommended that the whole question of petroleum prices be considered in an
energy pricing study which has now been incorporated as a condition of the
recently negotiated power project. The study is scheduled to be completed
before July 1, 1984, with implementation of its findings immediately after-
wards. The study will cover petroleum products in addition to coal,
electricity and wood fuel, and recommend appropriate price/tariff structure
for each energy source. From the perspective of the transport sector, the
main issues are the probable impact on railway operations and expansion of the
road transport industry (the two major consumers of diesel along with the
commercial agricultural sector) and on resource mobilization.
Traffic Growth and Characteristics
2.09      For five years following the unilateral declaration of independence
in 1967, traffic grew at about 9% p.a. on state roads until 1972 when traffic
volumes for light vehicles began to drop for security reasons. Heavy vehicle
traffic continued to grow at 9% p.a. until 1977 when it began to level off
because of the intensity of the war. Since independence, traffic has grown
60% and overall traffic is approaching the peak levels in 1971. Traffic on
the paved road network outside urban areas averages about 600 vpd with a large
portion carrying over 1000 vpd; about a third of this traffic consists of



- 9 -
trucks and buses. Heavy traffic is expected to grow at a faster rate than
light traffic as indicated by the growth of the vehicle fleet between 1980 and
1981 (trucks: 5.4%; light vehicles: 1%).
2.10      MRRT is responsible for taking traffic counts on the state road net-
work. Continuous counts are maintained by automatic axle counters at 50 sites
on a variety of roads with manual counts every other day. At other locations
7-day, 24-hour manual counts are taken at least once a year. These provide a
continuous record of traffic and have been useful in assigning priorities and
selecting investments.
Vehicle Regulations
2.11      The Road Traffic (Axle Loading) Regulations govern vehicle weights
and provide adequate legislation to protect the road system. They are
strictly enforced with weighbridges located in vehicle inspection centers in
all major towns supplemented by loadometers at strategic points in the road
network. Vehicles entering the country with overloaded axles are not allowed
to proceed until the load has been reduced or adjusted. The maximum single
axle load permitted is 8.2 m tons as RSA. Road pavement designs are based on
periodic surveys of axle loads on the country's main arteries. The Government
is opposed to increasing the permissible axle load even though the neighboring
states are considering doing so. However, the Government has agreed to
include in the terms of reference for the national transport study in the
project, an evaluation of existing legislation on the control of vehicle loads
and dimensions (para. 3.10).
Road Safety
2.12      The Government is alarmed at the increasing number of accidents
involving motor vehicles. In 1980, the number of accidents reported increased
by 28% over the preceding year; 1,140 persons were killed on the roads, an
increase of 48%. The surge in the accident rate corresponds to the sharp
increase in traffic since the war ended in early 1980 but the fatality rate
appears to be rising. The Government estimates that the direct and indirect
cost of traffic accidents in 1980 was at least Z$95 million. Because of the
seriousness of the situation the Zimbabwe Traffic Safety Board is increasing
its staff, opening additional offices and enlarging its safety programs. It
is increasing its support to safety education in schools and community groups
and programs such as the Defensive Driving Courses. The Government is also
strictly regulating the certification of driving schools and driving
instructors. Major changes in road safety legislation are also being
considered. The measures being taken by the Government are satisfactory.
Road Transport Industry
Freight Transport
2.13      About 90% of freight transport is handled by manufacturing enter-
prises and businesses which have their own vehicles. The remaining 10% is
carried by commercial haulage contractors who own between them about 150



- 10 -
tractor units plus 150 trailers and 200 semi-trailers. The commercial haulage
industry is dominated by a few large haulage firms which operate very large
trucks. About 55% of the total fleet is 10-12 years old; that segment trans-
porting agricultural produce is even older. This has led to high vehicle
operating costs which, coupled with a shortage of spare parts, makes truck
operators unwilling to travel on bad roads, most of which serve the communal
lands. There is a critical shortage of 8-12 ton trucks suited to serve the
areas of low productivity within the communal lands.
2.14      The size of the trucking fleet is regulated by the Road Motor
Transportation Act which is administered by the Roads Motor Transportation
Branch (RMT) of the MRRT. The RMT, essentially a licensing body, is required
by law to protect the railways and curb unhealthy competition between truck
operators. While the shortage of foreign exchange has acted as a further
brake on the free expansion of the trucking-fleet, total freight transported
by road in 1980 is estimated to be 2.8 billion ton-kms compared to 6.9 billion
ton-km by rail. Because of the urgent demand for transport in 1981 created by
the bumper maize harvests and the inability of the railways to handle increas-
ed traffic, licenses to truck operators have been freely granted in recent
months and the tonnage carried by road is expected to increase significantly.
The national transport study will review the Road Motor Transportation Act and
the operations of the road transport industry and make recommendations with a
view to ensuring optimum growth of the trucking industry (para. 3.10).
2.15      The Government does not regulate the freight tariffs but they are
fairly uniform among the large operators because of the relatively stable
market shares as determined by the existing licensing system. Rates are
usually set by the transport firms which have tariff schedules based on
distances and road conditions. The economic cost of freight transport ex-
cluding overheads or profits ranges between Z$0.09 and Z$0.22 per ton-km
depending on the size of truck and road conditions. The tariffs appear to be
about 20% above these costs and should cover the operating expenses plus
adequate profits. They are thus reasonable.
Passenger Transport
2.16      The passenger transport industry consists of an urban system
operated by private operators under franchise agreements with the municipali-
ties and a rural system regulated by RMT. The urban tariffs are fixed by the
operators in consultation with municipal authorities. RMT sets a maximum
tariff (currently 1.454 cts/pass-km) for specified rural routes. The bus
fleet numbers about 2,200, equally divided between the urban and rural
system. While the urban fleet is operated by a few large firms the rural
fleet is operated by many small firms, some owning less than 10 buses. The
major barrier to entry into the business of transporting passengers is the
lack of capital and shortage of locally produced buses.
C. Administration
2.17      MRRT is responsible for planning, building and maintaining the state
road network. The rural council roads and the municipal roads are administer-
ed by the 55 rural councils and 9 municipalities. The responsibility for the



- 11 -
district roads lies mainly with the District Development Fund (DDF), a semi-
autonomous agency under statutory control of the Minister of Local Government
and Town Plarning (MLGTP); however, the newly established District Councils
(DCs) are beginning to assume responsibility for some of these roads. With
the exception of the district roads, the other classes of roads are adminis-
tered satisfactorily.
2.18      MRRT is headquartered at Harare and has offices in the country's
seven provinces for executing the state road construction and maintenance
programs, seven provincial engineers direct these activities. The MRRT orga-
nization (Chart) is satisfactory but the administration has been weakened by
the departure of many experienced engineers. The rural councils have their
own road construction and maintenance crews but rely on consultants and the
MRRT for technical assistance. The municipalities have works divisions,
usually headed by qualified engineers, to construct and maintain their roads.
DDF also has offices in the provinces to carry out maintenance and development
of infrastructure services in the communcal lands, including roads, water
suply and storage facilities, and buildings. It has no qualified engineers
and its work is usually of poor quality because of lack of supervisory staff
with adequate training (Para. 2.21). The MRRT provincial engineer assists the
DDF in his province in engineering and planning matters. The recently
established DCs are not organized to carry out road construction and mainte-
nance although the Government has given them small grants to undertake minor
roadworks. Since the future of the relationship between the DDF and DCs and
their responsibilities for road development and maintenance in the communal
lands are not clear, the proposed feeder roads study will make recommendations
(para. 3.12).
2.19      The Central Mechanical Equipment Department (CMED) in the Ministry
of National Supplies (MNP) is responsible for the procurement, maintenance and
replacement of all Government equipment and vehicles, which it rents to the
various user agencies including MRRT. It has 6 main workshops, 15 minor work-
shops and 21 mobile units. In addition, it has a central store in Harare.
Although CMED is organized and managed satisfactorily, its output on the shop
floor has dropped significantly due to the loss of experienced supervisors and
mechanics particularly for heavy equipment (para. 2.22). CMED operates on a
commercial basis but its rental rates, set by the Treasury which reviews them
each year, are about 20% lower than private rental rates. The system is sound
but the rental income is insufficient to meet replacement costs of equipment
and vehicles. As a result, to some extent, the MRRT costs of road construc-
tion and maintenance by force account are being subsidized and do not reflect
actual costs. The Government has agreed to review the rental rates it charges
MRRT and adjust them to provide adequate allocations to cover all costs of
acquisition, repair and maintenance.
D. Staff and Training
2.20      There are vacancies in the Government departments at all levels.
Experienced professionals, technicians and artisarns of European origin are
emigrating or joining the private sector. Out of MRRT's 69 positions for



- 12 -
engineers and 310 for sub-professional staff and artisans, there are 31
vacancies for engineers and 37 for the others, or about 15% of the establish-
ment. The situation with regard to the engineers is deteriorating and the
MRRT has taken steps to recruit expatriates to fill vacancies and to expand
its programs to train engineers at the University of Zimbabwe (21 are
currently studying civil engineering). By expanding training facilities
locally, it is possible to fill all vacancies at the sub-professional and
artisan levels with Africans. MRRT has, therefore, increased its intake of
students at its Road Training Center (RTC) which provides training for
technicians. The manpower situation insofar as road administrations are
concerned is not expected to reach a crisis point as current shortages and
future requirements can be contained by giving out more work to consultants
and contractors.
2.21      RTC is administered satisfactorily and has no vacancies on its
teaching staff. Due mainly to lack of funds, RTC must use worn-out equipment
which is inadequate to meet its growing requirements. RTC is expanding its
courses to cover the grades below the technician level and to train increasing
numbers of development officers of DDF involved in feeder road construction
and rehabilitation and rural council road supervisors. Provisions have,
therefore, been made in the project to procure RTC's requirements of training
aids and equipment (para. 3.08). The demand for training by the DDF and the
DCs is large because of Government policy to redress past neglect of roads in
the communal lands. The feeder roads study in the project will assess
training needs of DDF and DCs and prepare suitable training programs (para.
3.12).
2.22      Although 5 positions in CMED for engineers have been filled, there
are 10 vacancies for supervisors and foremen out of 30 positions and 91
vacancies for artisans (mechanics, electricians, boiler makers) unfilled out
of 275 positions. Training at CMED is done principally on the shop floor by
experienced mechanics; it is supplemented by instruction at CMED's training
center. Basic training is given at the Government Motor Trade Association
Training Center which is being doubled in size by the Government. Tne
Government is refurbishing the CMED training center and recruiting expatriate
mechanics to train apprentices. These steps are being taken to meet the
growing demand for CMED equipment and vehicles from user agencies such as the
Police, Department of Civil Aviation, Ministry of Natural Resources and Water
Development and others. MRRT is able to cope with its requirements by renting
from private companies which already meet half of MRRT's needs. Further, MRRT
can reduce its equipment and vehicle requirements by executing more works by
contract.
E. Planning and Financing
2.23      Planning for the state road network is carried out by the Planning
Branch (PB) of the MRRT. It is responsible for the preparation of a three-
year development plan which is reviewed twice annually and provides the basis
for the annual estimates of expenditures. The plan itself is based on a
longer ten-year program prepared by PB and updated from time to time. Factors
which PB takes into account in setting road priorities are traffic volumes and
maintenance and vehicle operating costs. Economic feasibility studies were
undertaken only recently in response to the requirements of bilateral aid
agencies and the Bank Group. MRRT's Transport Planning Branch (TPB) was



- 13 -
established to undertake such studies and to coordinate highway investments
with those in other transport modes, particularly, railways.
2.24      The Government has yet to finalize a National Development Plan for
the country. Highway investments are currently based on a draft three-year
transitional development program prepared by MRRT for the state roads and a
similar reconstruction program prepared by DDF for the district roads. Each
rural council has its own program but these programs are not consolidated into
a single accessible document and the proposed magnitude of investments is not
known.
2.25      The objectives of the transitional development program for the state
road network are to (i) strengthen and upgrade overstressed roads which had
been deferred because of the war, (ii) repair neglected roads in the war zones
and war-damaged bridges and (iii) incorporate the main roads of the communal
lands into the state road network. The total investments proposed for FY1982-
1984 amount to Z$95 million covering about 2,200 kms of roads. Based on
progress to date the plan is realistic and can be executed satisfactorily. A
summary of the proposed investments in state roads is shown. in Table 2.4.
Details including external aid agencies involved are given in Annex 1. The
proposed project would finance four of the roads listed above which will
account for only about 15% of the investments for the three-year period.

2.26      The DDF's three-year program to rehabilitate feeder roads (Table
2.5) is financed by commodity loans from KfW, ODM and USAID. It is also
undertaking a construction program for which budget allocations are only
available for the current year; the program is based on submissions by the
district councils, which are approved on an annual basis. The current alloca-
tion is Z$4.8 million.

2.27      The expenditures on administration, construction and maintenance of
roads for the past five years are shown below (Table 2.6). The expenditures
on the state roads are adequate. Although expenditures on rural council roads
by the various rural councils have not been consolidated and not readily
known, judging from the condition of these roads the expenditures have been
satisfactory. By contrast, the district roads have received meager funds in
the past for their development and maintenance (para. 2.29).

2.28      The MRRT and MLGTP request funds for the state and district roads in
their annual budgets. Funds are appropriated by the Legislature out of the
Consolidated Revenue Fund into which all taxes, fees and other government
revenues are paid. The MRRT's budget includes block grants to the rural
councils for the rural council roads. These grants are supplemented by the
councils' revenues from local taxes levied on real estate and motor vehicles.
Funds for municipal roads are obtained from property and other taxes levied by
the municipal councils locally.
2.29      Road users contribute to Government revenue through taxes and duties
on vehicles, fuel, lubricants and spare parts and through fees for vehicle
registration and inspection, road service permits, driving tests and licenses,
abnormal load permits and a surcharge on licensing fees for all heavy
vehicles. By far, the major part of road user revenues comes from the taxes
on fuel (Table 2.7). Revenues from licensing fees and other sources are not
easily available but an estimate made for FY1981 shows that such revenues
would have amounted to Z$13.01 million. During the war years road-user
revenues exceeded all recurrent and capital expenditures on the state road
network. With the increase in gasoline taxes in July 1981 from Z$0.20/liter
to Z$0.43/liter, revenue from this source is expected to be about double, with
the possibility of funds being available to meet expenditures on roads other
than state roads. The revenue from gasoline taxes alone for FY1982, based on
consumption in FY1981, is estimated to be at least Z$43 million. (Table 2.7).

F. Engineering
2.30      MRRT's Planning Branch carries out most of the detailed engineering
needed to construct and improve roads. It selects the routes, locates
materials and prepares plans for the work to be undertaken. MRRT sets and
controls the design standards, which are published in manual form and follow
good engineering practices. Consultants have rarely been used but for the new
works planned in the three-Year transitional development program, MRRT is
employing more consultants than it has previously to meet its current staff
shortage and the requirements of an expanded capital investment program.
There are consultant firms established in the country, mostly branches of
international firms of British or South African origin. The few that can
strictly be described as local are firms which have been formed by former MRRT
engineers and carry out studies and detailed engineering in association with
foreign based firms. The quality of consulting work is generally
satisfactory.
G. Construction
2.31      Road construction is carried out mostly by force account; only 10%
of the works is by contract. The works are organized and executed satisfac-
torily but the trend is for more works to be given out on contract because of
the shortage of manpower particulary at the management level. There is at
least one force account unit operating in each province at any one time.
These units typically employ 300 laborers under the supervision of a resident
engineer and an assistant resident engineer and use equipment rented from CMED
or private companies. The value of the work executed by each unit is about
Z$1-2 million annually. MRRT experimented unsuccessfully with some labor-
intensive techniques during sanctions because of shortage of foreign exchange
for equipment, spare parts and fuel and had, at times, 1,000 laborers working
in one construction unit. The main problems seem to have been with the
provision of personnel services (eg. accommodation, transport).
2.32      Almost all contract work is done by locally based contractors who
belong to the Zimbabwe Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors. Out of 51
such contractors, 23 are registered as local contractors eligible for 10%
preference in all bidding for government contracts. The sole qualification is



- 16 -
the execution of government contracts up to total minimum value of Z$50,000 in
the preceding 12 months. Many of the locally based contractors are subsi-
diaries or associates of foreign firms who have in the past not participated
in bidding for road works because of the small sizes of contracts. The
Government does not have a policy of excluding foreign based contractors from
bidding for local contracts and has agreed that the 10% preference to local
contractors will be waived for Bank financed projects.
H. Maintenance
2.33      Road maintenance is carried out entirely by force account.  The MRRT
rents equipment and vehicles from CMED while the rural councils and DDF have
their own equipment and vehicles. Maintenance funds are adequate for the
state roads and rural council roads. The district roads administered by the
DCs have received relatively little attention and were the most affected
during the war.
2.34      The state road system is maintained to a high standard by MRRT. The
road network is divided into maintenance sections between 50-250 km, each of
which is in the charge of a roads supervisor who heads a crew of 20-30
laborers and drivers and equipment operators. MRRT maintenance staff use a
maintenance manual which emphasizes the need for the keeping and regular
updating of maintenance records and road inventory sheets and details all the
maintenance tasks to be performed and materials to be used. The equipment and
crew composition is left to the provincial engineers who have a flexibility in
the allocation of these resources.
2.35      MRRT cost estimates for routine maintenance of state roads is based
on per kilometer costs derived over the years. In the early seventies, MRRT
tried a costing system but found it too unwieldy. Although the present system
works well and routine maintenance is generally satisfactory, the Government
is reintroducing the costing system for the principal maintenance operations
in order to identify sources of insufficiency and low productivity and set
cost standards against which they can be measured. Estimates for regravelling
and resealing are based on costs of individual road sections prepared by the
provincial engineer in his submission for each financial year and funding is
adequate. In all, the state road maintenance is well organized and executed.
2.36      While the rural councils also maintain their roads satisfactori-ly
because of sound financial management and their power to levy local taxes
supplemented by central government grants, DDF is dependent on aid from a
number of bilateral agencies and annual grants from the central government for
rehabilitation and construction of district roads. The recently established
DC's are similarly dependent but grants to them are negligible (about
Z$300,000 in FY1982 for 55 DC's) as their absorptive capacity at present is
too limited to benefit from large grants. With DC's new powers to raise
revenues locally through taxes and levies, the DC's may expand their road
programs in parallel with the DDF. Both DDF and the DCs lack staff, training
facilities and secure funding for maintenance of the district roads. The
proposed national feeder roads study in the project is expected to make
recommendations for resolution of these problems including the need to revieew
the allocations of central government funds towards the development and
maintenance of roads other than state roads (para. 3.12).

III. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
3.01      The aim of the project is to support Zimbabwe's transitional deve-
lopment programs, prepared in early 1981 following the country's independence
in March 1980. A main goal is to integrate the communal lands into the
country's economy through programs to develop these hitherto neglected areas.
The provision of adequate infrastructure services, including roads, is an
important component of the Government's programs. The specific project
objectives are to:
(a)  upgrade priority sections of the basic road network, which had been
deferred because of the independence struggle;
(b)  extend the basic road network into the communal lands;
(c)  assist in the planning of development and maintenance of feeder
roads in the communal lands, and
(d)  improve transport coordination and planning.
B. Description
3.02      The project comprises:
(a)  construction of the Pamushana-Birchenough Bridge Road (88 km) to
two-lane bituminous standard;
(b)  widening and strengthening of Birchenough Bridge;
(c)  implementation of a three-year program to construct the following
state roads in communal lands to all-weather gravel standard:
(i)  Chivhu-Lothian Road (132 km);
(ii)  Ndanga-Triangle Road (100 km);
(iii) Range-Mharadzano Road (83 km);
(d) procurement of training aids and equipment for the MRRT Roads
Training Center; and
(e) consulting services for:
(i)  construction supervision of (a), (b) and (c) above,
(ii) detailed engineering of 172 kms of roads in (c) above,
(iii) a national transport study,
(iv) a national feeder roads study, and,
(v)  feasibility studies and detailed engineering of about 400 km of
state roads.

Construction of Pamushana-Birchenough Bridge Road (88 km)
3.03      The road is part of the Masvingo-Birchenough Bridge Road (175 km)
which is an important link in the domestic and regional road network. The
section from Masvingo to Pamushana (87 km) is already a two-lane pavel road.
The road then becomes a single lane sand-seal up to Birchenough Bridge. The
road generally follows the existing ground line over rolling terrain and was
not designed to any specific geometric standards: horizontal curves of less
than 200 meters radius and gradients of up to 8.5% occur over short
distances. Since the Bank identification mission in early 1981 the extensive
potholing of the surface has been repaired but pavement failures are apparent
over the whole length of the road. Bridges are mostly of recent construction
(1970-74) and will be incorporated in the new road. The bridge across the
Nyangura river, partially constructed before the war, will be completed under
the project. Traffic on the road varies from 250 vpd at the Pamushana end to
166 vpd at the Birchenough Bridge end; in the central part of the road it is
about 240 vpd.
3.04      MRRT undertook the final design for 23 km; detailed engineering for
the rest of the road was carried out by consultants, Civil and Planning
Partnership (Zimbabwe/Italy). The work is satisfactory. The new road will
have a double bituminous treated surface and designed for a 20-year life to
the standards given in Table 3.1 which are appropriate for the predicted
traffic.

Widening and Strengthening of Birchenough Bridge
3.05      The bridge, constructed in the mid-1930s, is a two-pinned arch
bridge with steel trusses. The bridge is well-maintained and is in excellent
structural condition. The bridge, designed to the old British Standard,



- 19 -
cannot carry a gross truck load in excess of 44 tons, which has resulted in
costly diversions of long-distance freight traffic which comprises several
55-ton trucks. The bridge will be strengthened to permit the passage of the
heavier trucks. The roadway will also be widened from the existing 18 feet to
24 feet. The work was engineered by MRRT assisted by consultants Freeman, Fox
and Partners (UK) in 1978 and their work is satisfactory.
Three-year Program to Construct State Roads in the Communal Lands
3.06      The Government has embarked on a program to improve infrastructure
services in communal lands to redress neglect by earlier governments. It made
MRRT responsible for the primary communal lands roads of which about 6,000 kms
have been added to the state road network. These poorly designed and
constructed earth and gravel roads were seriously damaged by the war. The
MRRT has begun to improve about 1,600 km of these roads to all weather gravel
standard under the current transitional development program. The proposed
project would finance 315 km over a period of three years consisting of the
Chivhu-Lothian (132 km), Ndanga-Triangle (100 km) and Range-Mharadzano (83 km)
roads.
3.07      The roads were identified from pre-feasibility studies carried out
in early 1981 by government-financed consultants. The Ndanga-Triangle and
Chivhu-Lothian roads were studied by consultants Moores Carlisle and Jordan in
association with Sir M. Macdonald and Partners (Zimbabwe/UK) and the Range-
Mharadzano road by Scott Wilson Kirkpatrick and Partners with Associated
Consultants (UK/Zimbabwe). Recent traffic counts provide the basis for an
update of the studies by the Bank appraisal mission. Consultants have started
detailed engineering on segments of the three roads and final design has been
completed for construction works during the first year of the three-year
program. Their work is satisfactory. The roads will be designed for a
20-year life to the standards given in Table 3.1, which are appropriate for
the predicted traffic.
Training Aids and Equipment for MRRT Roads Training Center
3.08      RTC offers courses in drafting, soils and materials technology and
surveying designed to train technicians. At any one time about 30 MRRT
Technician Trainees attend each of the three courses in addition to DDF
development officers and rural councils supervisors. During the period when
sanctions were being imposed, the shortage of foreign exchange forced RTC to
make do without proper training aids and its equipment was diverted to the
field for execution of works. The need for adequate training aids and
equipment has become critical. The proposed project will therefore help meet
RTC's requirements. The list of equipment to be procured was discussed and
agreed during negotiations.
Consulting Services
Construction Supervision (402 man-months)
3.09      Consultants will supervise construction of all the project roads and
the widening and strengthening of Birchenough Bridge. Specialist consultants
would be employed for the latter.



- 20 -
Detailed Engineering of State Roads in the Communal Lands (32
Man-Months)
3.10      Consultants, financed by the Government, have already completed
detailed engineering for about 140 kms of state roads in the communal lands
included in the project for construction to all-weather gravel standard.
About 170 kms are yet to be engineered during project implementation and
provisions have been made in the project for local consultants to undertake
this work. The quality of their work is satisfactory.
National Transport Study (91 man-months)
3.11      This comprehensive study would be the first overall study of the
transport sector; its purpose would be to recommend a coordinated strategy for
transport development. It will include a detailed investment program for each
transport mode based on social and economic priorities of specific projects
for a five-year period, FYs1985-89 and a long-range program for the period
through FY1994 based on probable future developments. In addition, it will
review government transport policies especially with regard to regulations,
tariffs and user-charges and make recommendations to ensure optimum utiliza-
tion of existing assets and adequate coordination of transport services. The
study will also recommend improvements in the operation, planning, administra-
tion, organization and management of each transport mode. The outline terms
of reference for the study are given in Annex 2. The detailed terms of
reference have been agreed with the Government and are included in the project
file.
National Feeder Roads Study (28 man-months)
3.12      The study will consist of two parts.  The first part will (i)
evaluate the agencies involved in feeder road development, and the
organization and management of construction and maintenance; (ii) recommend
the most effective organization to plan and implement programs to develop and
maintain feeder roads; (iii) identify funding sources and recommend basis for
allocation of funds for construction and maintenance and (iv) prepare a
project selection manual. The second part will identify about 1,000 km of
high priority feeder roads and prepare a feeder roads project for financing
under a future Bank project. Outline terms of references are given in Annex
3. The detailed terms of reference will be drafted in conjunction with the
review of the KfW-financed study of feeder roads in the communal lands. The
Bank project study will be particularly concerned with the institutional
problems and issues confronting feeder road development and maintenance.
Feasibility Studies and Engineering (88 man-months)
3.13      The project includes the conduct of feasibility studies and
engineering for about 400 km of state roads. The roads will be selected from
the list of roads in the investment program to be recommended by the National
Transport Study (para. 3.11).

C. Cost Estimates
3.14      The total project cost, excluding a capitalized front-end fee of
US$0.39 million but including price and physical contingencies, is estimated
to be US$70.6 million with a foreign exchange cost of US$37.7 million or 53%
(Table 3.2) . Total cost net of taxes and duties is US$66.0 million. The
base cost estimate is in April 1983 prices. Price Escalation based on rates
shown below has been included in the project cost estimates:
1983     1984      1985      1986
Local Costs      15.0%    12.0Z    12.0%    12.0%
Foreign Costs    8.0%       7.5%     7.5%      7.0%
3.15      Cost estimates for the construction of the Pamushana-Birchenough
Bridge road (US$231,000/km) and the widening and strengthening of Birchenough
Bridge (US$1.36 million) were based on bids received recently as a condition
of Board presentation. There was a risk that foreign contractors bidding for
the civil works, other than those from the region, might offer unusually high
bid prices because of lack of familiarity with a country that had been
effectively closed to the outside world for a number of years but it has not
materialized. Bids were also received for about half the number of contracts
for the construction of the state roads in the communal lands to gravel
standard and the bid prices are close to the appraisal estimates (US$
91,000/km). These represent the first year of the three year program to
improve roads in the communal lands.
3.16      Consulting services included in the project will total 641
man-months at an average man-month cost of US$ 8,800 which include salary
costs, fees, international travel and local subsistence. In addition to these
personnel costs, the consultants costs will include local transportation,
local office costs and other miscellaneous operating expenses. These costs
compare favorably with current costs in the region.
D. Financing
3.17      The project cost net of taxes and duties but including the front-end
fee is US$66.0 million equivalent. The financing of all the foreign exchange
cost, estimated at US$38.0 million is to be shared between the Bank, the Arab
Bank for Economic Development in Africa (BADEA) and the Government as below:
US $ (Million)
Bank                                 26.4
BADEA                                10.0
Government                            1.6
Total                                38.0
All local costs, estimated to be US$28.0 million equivalent, will be financed
by the Government.

3.18      The Government is expected to obtain assistance from bilateral aid
agencies in respect of its share of the foreign exchange costs (US$1.6
million) which will be used to finance the full foreign exchange costs of
consulting services for the national transport study, national feeder roads
study and feasibility studies and detailed engineering. BADEA's share of the
foreign exchange costs will be applied as follows:
i)   joint financing with the Bank for construction of the
Pamushana-Birchenough Bridge Road; and
ii) parallel financing of the full foreign exchange cost of the
widening and strengthening of Birchenough Bridge and
construction of the Ndanga-Triangle Road.
The loan agreement with BADEA was signed by BADEA and Government on December
15, 1982.
E. Implementation and Procurement
3.19      The MRRT will be responsible for the execution of all project
components except for the national feeder Roads Study which will be implement-
ed by MLGTP. The two agencies will be assisted by consultants. The national
transport study will be supervised by a steering committee comprising the
Secretaries of the MEPD, MRRT and MT. The project will be implemented over a
three-year period beginning July 1983. The timing of the execution of the
project components is shown below. Steps to be taken to initiate project
implementation are detailed in Annex 4 and have been agreed with the
Government.

3.20      The construction of the Pamushana-Birchenough Bridge road, estimated
to cost about US$20.3 million, will be executed under two unit price contracts
bidded in one package. The Birchenough Bridge will be widened and
strengthened under a separate unit price contract, estimated to cost about
USS1.4 million. Construction of state roads in the communal lands, estimated
to cost about US$28.5 million, will be executed under 7 unit price contracts,
divided into bidding packages of two to three contracts each. The sizes of
the contracts were determined to provide a number of small contracts to
encourage participation of local contractors. All the above contracts will be
awarded after international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank
Group Guidelines. The eligibility of country origins of contractors bidding
for the strengthening of Birchenough Bridge and the construction of
Ndanga-Triangle road, which are wholly financed by BADEA, would be subject to
BADEA rules. In view of the specialized nature of the training aids and
equipment and relatively small cost (US$0.2 million), they will be procured
through limited international bidding. Contracts for civil works to be
financed from the proposed Bank Loan would be subject to prior review and
approval of the bid documents by the Bank. The above have been agreed with
the Government.
3.21      The contracts for consulting services to be financed by the Bank,
estimated to total about US$4.4 million, will be awarded in accordance with
Bank Guidelines for the Use of Consultants. In respect of the other consult-
ing services (US$ 2.5 million), the Government has agreed that it will appoint
qualified and experienced consultants and that their terms of reference would
be agreed with the Bank. The Government has also agreed that price will not
be used as a factor in evaluating consultants proposals for services other
than construc- tion supervision.
F. Disbursement
3.22      The loan funds will be disbursed on the following basis:
(a) 40% of the total costs (including taxes and duties) of construction
of the Pamushana-Birchenough Bridge road;
(b) 50% of the total costs (including taxes and duties) of construction
of the Range-Mharadzano and Chivu-Lothian roads in the communal
lands;
(c) 100% of CIF cost of training aids and equipment if directly
imported, 100% ex-factory if manufactured locally or 85% if procured
locally; and
(d) 85% of total costs (including taxes and duties) for consulting
services.
All disbursements will be fully documented.

3.23      The estimated schedule of disbursements of the Bank loan is given in
the table below.  It has been based on anticipated progress in project
execution as there is no recent experience with Bank financed projects in the
country.  The disbursement profiles on projects in the neighbouring countries
are diverse but a significant time lag exists between actual expenditures and
loan withdrawal applications in all the countries. A time lag of 3 months has
been assumed in this case.

G. Accounting, Auditing and Reporting Requirements
3.24      Project Accounts will be maintained by the MRRT and MLGTP with
separate accounts for each component. Government accounts are audited
annually by the Comptroller and Auditor General who is required by the
constitution to submit an annual report to Parliament. As thesa audits are
not detailed, an independent auditor will be appointed by the Treasury to
audit the project accounts as required. The Government has agreed that, not
later than six months after close of each financial year, the project accounts
would be audited by an independent auditor who would prepare a report for
submission to the Bank. Agreement has also been reached with the Government
on quarterly progress reports and the submission of a project completion
report in a form satisfactory to the Bank not later than six months after the
project closing date (Annex 5).
H. Environmental Aspects
3.25      No significant ecological problems are expected.  The reconstructed
ted roads will have improved drainage facilities which will benefit the imme-
diate surrounding land. The engineered alignments of the roads and wider and
well-constructed shoulders will contribute to road safety. Additional right
of way will be required for the works but this is not expected to interfere
with current land use.

IV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
A. General
4.01      The project will assist the Government to complete a program,
repeatedly deferred during the struggle for independence, to strengthen and
upgrade sub-standard segments of the basic road network and to commence a
program to extend the state road network into the hitherto neglected communal
lands. These programs are embodied in the MRRT transitional development
program (FY1982-84) which the project is designed to support. The project
roads are part of the main road network located in the areas designated by the
Government for development under its Intensive Rural Development Area Projects
I and V. They form an integrated road network serving the large communal
lands in the central and south-eastern region of Zimbabwe. The project has
been aimed not only at supporting the construction of high-priority roads in
the Government's current development program but at equipping the MRRT Roads
Training Center and assisting the Government to develop a coordinated strategy
of transport development through a national transport study and improve the
administration, planning and financing feeder road construction and mainte-
nance through a feeder roads study.
4.02      The proposed construction of the Pamushana-Birchenough Bridge road
to two-lane bituminous standard is expected to yield an economic return (ER)
of 21% and the strengthening and widening of the Birchenough Bridge, 42%. The
three-year program of construction of state roads in the communal lands to all
weather gravel standard is expected to yield a combined ER of 14%. The
overall ER for these project components is estimated to be 18%. No ER has
been calculated for the provision of training aids and equipment and consult-
ing services for the studies. However, the equipping of the MRRT Roads
Training Center will enable it to increase the number of trainees and improve
the quality of training which will benefit road construction and maintenance
operations.
4.03      In addition to the benefits to vehicle operators and consumers
arising out of lower vehicle operating costs on the project roads as a result
of the proposed improvements, the project will enable the Government to reduce
gasoline and diesel consumption in the country by providing roads with better
alignments and surface condition. Provided driver habits are good, it is
estimated that in the first year, the reduction in fuel consumption would be
about 0.9 million liters and that during the design life of the project roads,
the total reduction would be around 27 million liters.
B. Economic Evaluation
Construction of the Pamushana-Bichenough Bridge Road (88 km)
(a) Area of Influence and Main Benefits & Beneficiaries
4.04      The Pamushana-Birchenough Bridge road is the only remaining bottle-
neck in the main road system linking the major economic centers of Harare,
Bulawayo, Gweru and Mutare with Masvingo. The route provides the shortest
distance between Bulawayo and Mutare and the Eastern Districts, the alterna-
tive being at least 125 km longer via Harare. The road is also locally
important for it is the only trunk road serving several heavily populated
communal lands. The present condition of the road imposes substantial speed



- 28 -
reductions, and some vehicles, such as refrigerated trucks, cannot use the
road because of damage to expensive equipment caused by dust and rough road
conditions.
4.05      The primary beneficiaries of transport cost reduction will be the
vehicle owners and operators using the road between Mutare, Masvingo and
Bulawayo. Trucking will become increasingly competitive with the relaxation
of Government control over granting permits to commercial operators. It is
expected that savings to the road transport operators will eventually be
passed on to the consumers through lower prices for goods and produce. At the
very least, the upgrading of the road will slow down increases in prices of
goods and services affected by transport costs. There should also be some
reduction in freight transport cost passed on to the customers due to the
shorter distances travelled by truckers who currently travel via Harare
because of poor road conditions and weight restriction on Birchenough bridge.
Additional benefits are expected from a reduction in road accidents caused by
poor sight distance and gravel shoulders. However, these benefits have not
been included in the computation of the ER since they are difficult to
quantify due to lack of reliable data.
(b) Economic Analysis
Traffic
4.06      The current traffic composition is basically transit traffic with
the exception of the buses which serve the communal lands. From 1968 to 1973,
the traffic grew at about 13% p.a. for heavy trucks and 12% p.a. for total
traffic, reaching a peak in 1974/75. Due to the war traffic fell sharply
until 1979, when the trend reversed. During 1981 there was a rapid increase,
which is expected to continue into 1982 and 1983. From 1979 to 1981, the
traffic grew at over 30% p.a. in most traffic count stations along the project
road. However, the rapid traffic growth is expected to taper off in the next
few years and return to the normal growth rate. Thus, traffic growth rates of
20% for 1982, 10% for 1983, 8% for 1984-1993 and 6% for 1994-2005 have been
used in the economic analysis.

Vehicle Operating Costs (voc)
4.07      Vehicle operating cost savings are based on cost of operating
typical vehicles on the road presented in Table 4.2. The present road has a
3m narrow bituminous surface with poor shoulder conditions. Although the



- 29 -
numerous potholes have been temporarily filled, the quality of the road
surface is expected to deteriorate substantially during the rainy season.
After the reconstruction and expansion of the road to two-lane bituminous
standard under the project, voc's are expected to be reduced 20% to 32%
depending on vehicle type. As the traffic grows, vehicles would spend an
increasing amount of time on the shoulders to allow vehicles to pass and voc
would rise to the level of a poor gravel road. Accordingly, voc's on the
project road have been assumed to escalate over time to reach the same costs
as on a poor gravel road when the traffic exceeds 1000 vpd (Table 4.2)1/.

Construction and Maintenance Costs
4.08      The estimated cost (net of taxes) at September 1982 prices of
constructing the road to two-lane bituminous paved standard is Z$16.1 million,
including 10% physical contingencies and Z$1.0 million for construction
supervision. The works are expected to take 36 months to complete and the
road will be opened for traffic in early 1986. Routine maintenance cost (net
of taxes) for the new road is estimated to be Z$405 per km during the first
year and costs for subsequent years take into account the need for increased
maintenance owing traffic growth. These costs have been based on MRRT records
of actual expenditures for varying traffic levels on similar roads over many
years. Resealing of the road with a single bituminous surface treatment is
assumed after eight years at an estimated cost (net of taxes) of Z$6,300 per
km. The costs of routine and periodic maintenance without the project are
based on a satisfactory level of such maintenance to preserve the existing
condition of the road.
Economic Return (ER)
4.09      The economic analysis was carried out by comparing the paving of the
road to two-lane bituminous standard to maintaining the road at the existing
standard as the base case. The road was divided into three sections and
1/ Hans Adler, Economic Appraisal of Transport Projects: Pages 62-69



- 30 -
separate analyses were carried out for each section. Calculations over an
assumed 20-year service life show that paving of the whole road will yield an
overall ER of 21% and that each of the three sections, ER's of 23%, 19% and
42% (Annex 6).
Sensitivity Analysis
4.10      While cost estimates have been carefully prepared, an analysis has
been made for a 20% increase in construction costs; this, to allow for the
uncertainty in estimating unit costs in a country which has only recently
become independent and accessible to the outside world. Such an analysis
shows that the overall ER would still be a high 18%. A similar analysis has
been made for a 30% drop in traffic-related benefits; the result is an ER of
15%. A combined cost increase of 20% and a 30% decline in traffic-related
benefits would give an ER of 12%. It has been calculated that the traffic-
related benefits would have to decline by 50% before the ER drops to 10%.
Widening and Strengthening of Birchenough Bridge
4.11      The weight restriction currently enforced on the Birchenough Bridge
due to low design strength has seriously deterred transport operators from
using the much shorter Birchenough-Masvingo road to serve the central, east-
central and southeast central areas of the country. The restrictions reduce
the load to 80% of legal axle loads which effectively reduces the payload by
40%. Many operators have opted to carry goods via Harare instead of cutting
their loads, and some operators have been reluctant to tender for markets
because of this limitation. After extensive interviews conducted by the
consultants, it was determined that an average of about 3.6 vpd will be
diverted due to the strengthening of the bridge. The average net distance
saved is 265 km. Comparing the voc savings of heavy trucks due to the
reduction in travel distances with the construction and incremental mainte-
nance costs of strengthening the bridge2/, the ER on the bridge is estimated
to be 42% (Annex 6).
Three-Year Program to Construct State Roads in Communal Lands
General
4.12      Three roads totalling 315 km are to be re-constructed and improved
to all-weather gravel standards under this program. The roads are located
mainly in communal lands. Population density in the areas served by the
Chivhu-Lothian and Ndanga-Triangle roads is high with an average of 49
persons/km2. All these areas depend on agriculture (particularly maize,
sorghum and groundnuts), livestock farming and off-farm labor in surrounding
cities. They are characterized by very low per capita income with poor infra-
structure development. The condition of the three earth and gravel roads is
generally poor and deteriorating rapidly as traffic increases. Traffic
volumes range between 100 and 125 vpd with the lowest traffic on the southern
half of the Range-Mharadzano road.
2/ Strengthening costs, net of taxes, are estimated to be Z$0.89 million.
Incremental maintenance costs are negligible.



- 31 -
Main Benefits and Beneficiaries
4.13      Quantified benefits arising from improving the roads are the savings
in voc, which will accrue to vehicle owners and operators in the first
instance.  These will most likely be passed on to farmers as lower freight
cost or lower delivery cost for general merchandise. The coi3tant and assured
delivery of goods due to the new all-weather road will stabilize the prices
for consumers and ensure the timely delivery of agricultural inputs to the
farmers. Other benefits, such as passenger time savings and better access to
social facilities will also occur but they have not been included in the
analysis due to lack of reliable data.
Economic Analysis
4.14      Based on traffic counts taken in August/September 1981, traffic in
the opening year for each road is given in table below:

The traffic on all road sections is expected to grow at 8% p.a over the 20-
year design period. The savings in voc (net of taxes) shown in Table 4.4
reflects the difference between the costs on the existing earth/poor gravel
surface and those expected on the new all weather-gravel road.

- 32 -
4.15      Routine maintenance costs (net of taxes) of the reconstructed roads
are estimated to be Z$675/km annually. These costs increase with traffic
growth during the roads' service life. Periodic regravelling costs, estimated
to be Z$7650/km (net of taxes), have been assumed for the fifth year, the
frequency of regravelling increasing with growth in traffic. The existing
roads are only subject to intermittent maintenance which is estimated to cost
Z$225/km (net of taxes) annually.
4.16      Based on the above assumptions, costs and voc savings, the economic
analysis of each road section indicates that the roads yield ERs as follows:
Chivhu-Lothian 13%, Ndanga-Triangle 15%, Range-Mharadzano 13%. The overall ER
on the construction of the three roads is expected to be 14%. A sensitivity
analysis was carried out to test the effects of a 10% increase in construction
costs, 10% decrease in benefits, and a combination of both. The results show
that even under these conditions the ERs would exceed 10%. The details of the
economic analysis of e&ch road section are given in Annex 6.
C. Risks
4.17      A major risk to the project is the possibility of sudden departure
of the remaining staff of European origin in government departments, who
perceive changes in employment and salary policies as erosion of their
benefits. About 80% of the professional staff and senior technicians in the
road agencies are currently of European origin. The Government has already
started a campaign to recruit expatriates to fill vacant positions in the MRRT
and it can be stepped up in an emergency but this might slow project execution
and generally weaken administration of highways, particularly their mainte-
nance.

V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
5.01      Agreement has been reached with the Government as follows:
a) that the Government will review periodically the hire rates it
charges MRRT for equipment and vehicles and adjust them to
include adequate allocations to cover all costs of acquisition,
repair and maintenance (para. 2.19);
b) on the list of equipment for MRRT's Roads Training Center
(para. 3.08);
c) that contracts for the civil works will be awarded through ICB
in accordance with the Bank Group "Guidelines for Procurement
Under World Bank Loans and IDA credits" of March 1977 and BADEA
eligibility requirements in respect of the strengthening of
Birchenough Bridge and construction of Ndanga-Triangle Road
(para. 3.20);
d) that procurement of training aids and equipment will be through
limited international tendering (para. 3.20);
e) that consultants will be engaged on terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank in accordance with the Bank Group "Uses
of Consultants by the World Bank and its Borrowers" of August
1981 for consultants financed by the Bank and price will not be
a factor in evaluating consultants proposals for services other
than construction supervision (para. 3.21);
f) that an annual audit report of the project accounts by an inde-
pendent auditor will be submitted to the Bank not later than 6
months after close of each financial year (para. 3.24); and
g) that quarterly progress reporting requirements and a project
completion report, in a form satisfactory to the Bank, not later
than six months after the project closing date (para. 3.24 and
Annex 3).
5.02      An implementation schedule and steps to initiate project execution
have also been discussed and agreed with Government. (Para. 3.19 and Annex
4.)
5.03      A condition to the effectiveness of the Bank loan will be the
receipt by the Bank of satisfactory evidence that all conditions, except for
effectiveness, precedent to initial disbursement of BADEA funds, have been
fulfilled (para. 3.18).
5.04      Provided that agreement is reached on the items outlined above, the
project would be suitable for a Bank Loan to the Republic of Zimbabwe of
US$26.4 million equivalent for 20 years including a five-year grace period.

Outline Terms of Reference for National Transport 'cudy
1.        The Government of Zimbabwe wishes to commission a comprehensive
study of the country's transport system (but excluding intra-urban transport)
to cover the period 1982-1992. The study should form the basis to formulate
an appropriate transport policy and a detailed investment plan for the period
1982-1987, as well as an indicative investment plan for the period 1988-1992.
2.        The purpose of this transport study is to recommend improvements in
Zimbabwe's existing transport services and to formulate a coordinated develop-
ment program for the transport sector. To achieve this, the study shall
provide:
(a) a detailed program of transport investments for 1982-1987, based on
the social and economic priorities of specific projects; and a
prospective program of transport investments for 1988-1992 based on
a range of probable future developments;
(b) recommendations for the improvement of the operation, planning,
organization, administration and management of each transport mode
including the operations of the road transport industry; and
(c) review and recommendations on specific improvements of government
transport policies, especially regulation, tariff and user-charges
policies, to ensure optimum utilization of existing assets, effi-
cient operation of the various modes, and adequate coordination of
transport services.
3.        The study shall cover the entire territory of the Republic of
Zimbabwe and all transport modes that have a significant role in the national
economy. The study will also pay attention to the potential role of any new
transport mode such as pipelines. Consultants shall focus primarily on inter-
urban passenger and freight traffic (national and international) and will not
include study of intra-urban traffic, except to the extent that inter-urban
traffic may be affected.
4.        The consultants shall perform according to the highest standards,
all technical and administrative studies, economic analyses, financial inves-
tigation, field investigations and related work as required to attain the
objectives in para. 2 above. The consultants shall coordinate their work with
other relevant studies and surveys (national and international) prepared or
being carried out by other consultants or government agencies (e.g. the rail-
way tariff study). General guidance will be given to the consutlants by a
Project Coordinator representing a Steering Committee comprised of the
Secretaries for the Ministries of Economic Planning and Development, Roads and
Road Traffic and Transport.
5.        Detailed terms of reference are included in the Project File.

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
Feeder Roads Study - Outline Terms of Reference
1.        The construction of feeder road systems, particularly in the
communal lands, is a high priority in the Government's post independence
development plans. Aid agencies such as the KfW, ODA and USAID are helping
the Government with rehabilitation of feeder roads damaged by the war but more
feeder roads have to be constructed to service adequately the remote rural
areas of the country. As a first step in assisting the Government, a Feeder
Roads Study should be carried out to (i) identify and resolve the institution-
al problems and issues, (ii) improve project selection and ranking of road
priorities, (iii) install a road maintenance capability and (iv) employ
appropriate technological methods of construction and maintenance.
2.        The objectives of the Feeder Roads Study are to:
(a) make recommendations on the institutions and organizations to
administer, fund, plan, construct and maintain feeder road systems;
(b) evaluate the planning and selection process involved in preparation
by Government of feeder road programs;
(c) evaluate the organization and methods of execution of construction
and maintenance works and recommend appropriate organization and
technologies to be used;
(d)  assess training needs and formulate suitable training programs; and
(e) identify and prepare a feeder road project involving about 1000 kms
for implementation under a future project.
3.        The study would consist of two parts as follows:
Part I:   A study of the agencies currently involved in feeder road
development, project selection and organization and management of
construction and maintenance and funding for such agencies.
Part II: A study to identify about 1000 kms of priority feeder
roads and feasibility studies and engineering for preparation of a
feeder project for possible implementation under a future project.
Part I:
3.        The consultants shall review the current institutional arrangements
and their likely evolution. In addition to the Ministry of Roads and Roads
Traffic, the Division of District Administration of the Ministry of Local
Government and Housing, and the District Development Fund, the roles of the
Ministries of Agriculture and Lands and Resettlement and parastatals such as
DEVAG, ARDA and AFC should also be examined.



- 37-
Annex 3
Page 2 of 4
4.        The consultants should suggest appropriate institutional arrange-
ments taking into account such questions as to whether they should be
centralized or decentralized or partly so. The consultants, however, shall
make proposals also for remedial action affecting existing institutional
arrangements so that in the short term feeder road programs can proceed to be
effectively implemented.
5.        Particular issues to be considered are the shortage of technical and
managerial staff, the economical use of equipment, conservation of fuel
resources, the generation of employment opportunities locally in the areas
where the roads are located, effective planning process to include those whose
lives are affected by proposed developments and funding resources, especially,
for road maintenance.
6.        The consultants shall review the Government's current selection
methods and criteria employed for priority rating of feeder roads and recom-
mend appropriate criteria with a view to developing an adequate methodology
for initial screening. This would involve the examination of the following:
(a) network criteria which would include termination at one end to a
primary or secondary road;
(b) economic criteria such as providing a route for marketing agricul-
tural output or the supply of inputs and other goods, possibility of
complementary investments; and
(c) social criteria such as the population served and provision of
access to health centers and hospitals, schools and community
centers.
The consultants shall prepare a projection selection manual incorporating
their recommendations and instructions for use by the Government.
7.        The consultants shall review the engineering and technical
capability in the country including the private sector and make recommenda-
tions for maximizing the use of local capability. They shall also comment on
the adequacy of local capability to execute current and proposed feeder road
development programs and determine training needs. The consultants shall
formulate suitable training programs with details of categories of personnel
to be trained, methods of training and appropriate courses, availability of
manpower and its potential and timing of implementation costs.
8.        In particular, the consultants shall assess the local contracting
and consulting capacity and the feasibility of labor intensive methods of
construction and maintenance, suggest the appropriate mix of private and
public sector participation in feeder road construction and maintenancce and
methods of execution of construction and maintenance tasks.
9.        The consultants shall also review the engineering procedures
(surveys, alignment selection, pavement engineering, etc.), practices and the
minimum design standards for low trafficked gravel and earth roads currently
used and comment on their adequacy and recommend any changes which they
consider desirable.



- 38-
Annex 3
Page 3 of 4
10.       The consultants shall address the maintenance problems and make
recommendations for improved organization procedures and funding. The
consultants shall review the sources of funding for feeder road construction
and maintenance both in the three-year transitional plan as well as in the
longer term. The latter would involve an investigation of the division of
fiscal authority and expenditure responsibilities between the central
government and the newly elected District Councils. The consultants should
analyze the adequacy of the budgetary procedures especially as regards the
reliability of funding for feeder road maintenance and suggest improvements if
necessary.
Part II
11.       This part of the study will be conducted in three stages:
Stage 1: A reconnaissance survey of areas other than those covered
by other aid agencies (such as the KfW) and, applying the project
selection methods recommended in Part I of the study and agreed with
the Government, identification of about 1000 kms of feeder roads for
in-depth study in Stage 2.
Stage 2: Technical and Economic Studies to confirm their
feasibility for construction; and
Stage 3: Minimum engineering to enable bills of quantities and
other documentation to be prepared for construction of the feeder
roads by contract and preparation of such documentation.
12.       During Stage 2 the consultants are free to adopt their own
methodology for economic evaluation within the limits of the estimated
budget. A sophisticated approach is not envisaged. The evaluation will
consist essentially of:
(a) defining the area of influence of the road or group of roads;
(b) relating the roads to notable development that may be planned or
ongoing in these areas;
(c) calculating benefits in vehicle operating costs (both normal and
generated traffic) to be derived from proposed improvements,
development benefits, if any, due to the road improvements, and
benefits accruing from improved social activities and conditions;
and
(d) calculating economic indicators, including Economic Returns.
Where the area of influence is dominated by a particular activity such as
agriculture, forestry, mining, manufacturing or other sector or by population,
then the effect of the road or group of roads on the activity or sector should
be investigated. In making traffic projections, the consultants shall
consider the potential for growth of the road transport industry and the
availability of suitable types of vehicles to serve the rural areas.



- 39-
Annex 3
Page 4 of 4
13.       In Stage 3 the consultants shall prepare a three-year program for
the execution of the road works based on economic priorities including cost
estimates, method of execution (by force account or by contract) and recom-
mended organization.

A HIGHWAY PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
Project Progress and Reporting Requirements
A.   Project Progress Reports
1.        Progress Reports should be submitted quarterly in triplicate, no
later than one calendar month after the end of the quarter. The first Report
should cover the quarter ending June 30, 1983.
2.        The Report shall contain the following information:
(a) General Information: this section should refer to Project Monitoring
indices (Attachment) in reporting the following:
i)     the physical progress accomplished to date of report and
during the reporting period;
ii)    the progress made in achieving training objectives;
iii)   actual or expected deviations from the project implementation
schedule;
iv)    actual or expected difficulties or delays and their effects
on the implementaton schedule, and the steps planned or taken
to overcome the difficulties and avoid further delay;
v)     expected changes in the completion date of the project;
vi)    key personnel changes in the staffs of MRRT, consultants or
contractor;
vii)   matters which may affect the cost of the project; and
viii) any development activity likely to affect the economic
viability of project components.
(b) A bar-type progress chart, based on the project implementation
schedule, should show the progress in each project component.
(c) A financial statement should be set out in tabular form and indicate
for each project component:
i)     original estimated cost;
ii)    revised cost, if appropriate;
iii)   actual expenditure;
iv)    projected expenditure; and

Annex 5
Page 2 of 3
v)     actual and projected withdrawals from the Loan Account.
(d) Finally, the Report should state the status of action on each
covenant of the Loan Agreement.
B.   Project Completion Report
3.        The Borrower will prepare a Project Completion Report (PCR), to
be submitted to the Bank not later than six (6) months after the Closing
Date,
4.        The primary objective of the PCR is to reinforce self-evaluation by
the Borrower and the Bank's operating departments and to facilitate
dissemination of lessons learned through the project:
(a)  the performance by the Borrower and the Bank of their respective
obligations under the Loan Agreement and whether the Bank could have
been more helpful;
(b)  the results that can be expected from the project, as compared with
expectations at appraisal, and whether the original expectations
were realistic; and
(c)  whether in retrospect the project was worth doing or could have been
done better.
5.        For those components of the project for which a rate of return was
estimated during appraisal, the PCR should contain a new estimate of the
return the project is now likely to yield and analyze the reasons for physical
or economic deviations. However, the new rate of return calculation should be
as simple as possible under the circumstances and should absorb only a minor
portion of the time devoted to the preparation of the PCR. An annex with the
relevant information supporting this analysis should be included.
6.        The basic documents to be referred to are:
(a)  Loan Application;
(b)  Appraisal Report;
(c)  Loan Agreement Documents, Supplementary Letters, etc.;
(d)  Supervision Reports;
(e)  Quarterly Progress Reports;
(f)  Project Correspondence Files; and
(g)  Miscellaneous Evaluation Reports.
7.        The Transportation Division 2, Eastern Africa Projects Department,
will review and comment on the PCR in consultation with the Programs
Department. After approval by the Division Chief, the PCR is sent to the Bank

Group's Operations Evaluation Department (OED) which is responsible for
conducting au audit of the project subsequent to the PCR exercise. This audit
can lead to suggestions for changes or additions in the PCR as OED prepares
the Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR) for submission to the Bank Group's
Board of Directors. Before going to the Board, the draft PPAR which includes
the PCR, is sent to various Bank Group divisions, to the Government and
occasionally to consultants (especially if they have been criticized).
