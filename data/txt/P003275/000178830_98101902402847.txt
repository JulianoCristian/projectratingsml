LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower                         Government of Zimbabwe
Amount                           US$26.4 million -- Bank, including a
capitalized front-end fee.
Terms                            Variable interest rates payable in 20 years,
including five years grace.
Purpose                  :       The proposed loan would improve Zimbabwe's
road transport system by helping finance:
(a) construction of the Pamushana-
Birchenough Bridge Road (88 km) to two-lane
bituminous standard; (b) strengthening of
Birchenough Bridge; (c) construction of
three state roads (315 km) in the communal
lands to all-weather gravel standard; (d)
training aids and equipment for the MRRT's
Training Center; and (e) consulting services
for (i) supervising (a), (b), and (c) above
including detailed engineering of 172 km of
the roads in (c) above; (ii) a national
transport study; (iii) a national feeder
roads study; and (iv) feasibility studies
and detailed engineering of about 400 km of
state roads. The project would improve the
existing road network. It would also expand
and improve the training facilities and
develop a coordinated strategy for transport
development. Furthermore, it would lower
vehicle operating costs and reduce gasoline
and diesel consumption in the country.
The main risk facing the project is the
possibility of a sudden departure of the
remaining non-indigenous staff in government
departments which would slow down project
execution and weaken road maintenance capa-
bility. However, the risk would be mini-
mized by recruiting expatriates and techni-
cal assistance, and training of local staff.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE ZIMBABWE
FOR A HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Zimbabwe for US$26.4 million equivalent at variable interest rates,
payable in 20 years, including five years grace, to help finance a Highway
Project. The Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa (BADEA), is
expected to contribute US$10.0 million equivalent.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The first Bank economic mission to independent Zimbabwe visited
the country in September 1980. A Country Economic Memorandum (Report Num-
ber 3234b-ZIM) was distributed to the Executive Directors in April 1981.
This description is based on that memorandum and on information obtained on
subsequent missions.
3.        Zimbabwe is a landlocked country of about 390,000 sq km, bordered
by Mozambique on the east, Botswana on the southwest, Zambia on the
northwest and South Africa on the south. The population as of December
1981, was estimated to be 7.7 million, 97 percent of whom are Africans. 1
The remainder consists of about 170,000 Europeans, 10,000 Asians and 23,000
people of mixed origin. The growth rate of the African population is esti-
mated to be about 3.4 percent per year. The number of Europeans has been
declining due to emigration, which has recently been occurring at an aver-
age rate of about 1,700 persons per month. According to estimates based on
pre-war data, 20 percent of the population is urban; but this is almost
certain to understate the present extent of urbanization.
4.         In 1980, per capita income was Z$470 (US$630, using the World
Bank Atlas methodology). Estimates for 1981 suggest that real per capita
income grew at about 4.6 percent, giving a 1981 figure of slightly under
Z$500 per person. In spite of this good growth performance, distribution
1 The Government of Zimbabwe's nomenclature for population divisions is
used throughout. The first census since 1969 was carried out in August
1982; the results are not yet available.



of income and assets between Africans and non-Africans remains highly skew-
ed. The Land Tenure Act of 1969 updated legislation of the 1930s and con-
firmed division of the country's total land area into roughly two equal
parts for European and African settlement, the Europeans possessing most of
the best land. Given the difference between the size of the two groups,
the division resulted in an allocation at independence of approximately
2.5 ha per African and 65.2 ha per non-African. The degree of disparity
will begin to change now that majority rule has been achieved, but similar
disparities exist in the distribution of other productive assets and in-
come. Rough estimates made in 1979 of the differences in per capita income
suggest that the average per capita income for Africans was about Z$110
(US$175) compared with roughly Z$5,500 (US$9,000) for non-Africans.
5.       Following the Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) in
1965, the international community imposed economic sanctions, and in 1973,
a costly guerrilla war started. The sanctions were only partly effective.
Between 1965 and 1974, real GDP grew at about 7 percent per year and per
capita income at about 3.5 percent. Exports expanded, enhancing the
country's ability to import. Notably, the sanctions stimulated development
of local import substitution capacity, so that by 1979 consumer goods were
only about 10 percent of total imports, compared with 22 percent in 1964.
Sanctions also encouraged the diversification of commercial agriculture and
the rapid growth of investment in and exports from the mining sector.
6.        However, the economic situation changed for the worse between
1975 and 1979. The added effect of the guerrilla war, increases in the oil
price and two droughts caused economic activity to decline, so that per
capita income in real terms fell by 35 percent to its 1965 level. While
the value of exports rose slightly even during this period, the dramatic
increase in the cost of imports, in particular oil, caused the volume of
imports to fall precipitously. Real investment and formal employment also
declined significantly.
7.        Despite these setbacks, the new Government inherited a well-
diversified economy with good potential for growth. Agriculture, manufac-
turing and mining are all important, contributing 18 percent, 26 percent,
and 5 percent, respectively, of GDP in 1981, and together providing    52
percent of total formal employment. Agriculture and forestry account for
more than 290,000 jobs or 28 percent of the total; manufacturing for
173,000 jobs and mining for 69,000. Most of the remaining formal employ-
ment is provided by service sectors such as public administration, educa-
tion and, in particular, domestic service. Mining and agriculture earn
significant amounts of foreign exchange and supply most inputs for manufac-
turing, which in turn accounts for between 30 and 35 percent of Zimbabwe's
merchandize exports, mainly processed agricultural and mineral items.
8.         Since independence, the economy has rebounded strongly as resump-
tion of normal economic activity has been accompanied by an improvement in
the terms of trade and expansion of external borrowing. Imports increased
by 47 percent in 1980 and by 26 percent in 1981, facilitating increases in
capacity utilization. Growth has been extremely strong in agriculture,
which benefitted from good weather in 1980 and 1981. Consequently, overall
real growth of the economy was about 11 percent in 1980, and over 8 percent
in 1981.



9.       The substantial increase in imports in 1980-81 was financed with
reserve drawdowns and short-term borrowings. This increase in imports and
short-term borrowing, coupled with a slower than required rate of growth of
exports, have resulted in a very serious balance of payments situation.
10.      Some short- and long-run problems must be addressed if the country
is to experience more equitably distributed growth. The major short-run
problem is controlLing domestic demand so as to reduce inflation (currently
about 17 percent per year). Some needed policies are already being imple-
mented. Sales and import taxes and interest rates have all been raised.
The rate of expansion of the money supply was reduced from 22 percent in
1980 to 15 percent in 1981. The overall budget deficit as a percent of GDP
has declined from its high of 14 percent in 1979/80. However, further
reductions must be accomplished during the current (1982/83) budgetary
exercise if stabilization efforts are to fully succeed. Significant
longer-term problenis concern the need to increase the level and quality of
investment, to expand domestic savings, and to adopt a wage policy
consistent with the need to increase employment. Although these issues are
inter-related, the Government recognizes that increasing -nloyment and
labor productivity are key to achieving its aim of gio wth with -quity.
I1.      The Government is taking measures to address some ot these prob-
lems. It has published a Transitional National Development P-an wnich sets
course for the economy for the next three years (paras. 37 and 38). The
Government is discussing with the IMF a stabilization program which
stipulates a number of measures including: an exchange rate adjustment (as
a result of the dialogue, the Government devalued the Zimbabwean dollar by
20 percent on December 9, 1982 in order to restore export competitiveness
that had been eroded by large increases in labor costs and high domestic
inflation); an adjustment in the basket of currencies on which the value of
the Zimbabwean dollar is determined; a reduction in the budgetary deficit;
limitations to wage and salary increases; and ceilings to short-term
external debt and domestic credit. The negotiations are at an advanced
stage and are expected to be successfully concluded shortly. In addition,
the proposed export promotion program is also designed to deal with some of
the problems.
12.      Should the measures Government is taking effectively deal with the
above-mentioned problems, prospects for respectable growth and more equit-
able distribution of income are quite good. Real increases in GDP could
well average 5.5 percent per year in 1980-85. Thereafter growth could
slow, perhaps, to an average of four percent per year, as investments are
made in longer-gestating programs with a more even distribution of assets.
Much of the burden of achieving these growth and equity goals must fall on
the agricultural sector. In the past, the commercial farms accounted for
most agricultural production. However, the development of smallholder
agriculture has been assigned the highest priority.
13.       Zimbabwe emerged from 15 years of sanctions and the war with
relatively low external indebtedness. In December 1981, foreign debt
totalled Z$948 million (US$1,318 million equivalent) and the country's
gross international reserves equalled about Z$150 million, or an estimated
two months of imports. The external debt figure was equivalent to about
24 percent of estimated GDP. The debt service ratio, which was about four



percent in 1980, is estimated to have risen to 8 and 15 percent in 1981 and
1982, respectively. This rapid rise reflects the fact that nearly all
Zimbabwe's present debt must be repaid in the next six years which will
exert pressures on the short-term balance of payments situation. However,
so long as the country avoids recourse to large amounts of short-term
commercial borrowing, the debt service ratios should begin to decline after
1984 even with large amounts of additional external borrowing. In light of
this and the country's potential for growth and expansion, Zimbabwe is
creditworthy for Bank lending. However, given the country's massive
external resource requirements for the next few years and the expected high
level of international interest rates and relatively hard repayment terms
of non-concessionary borrowing, it is clear that Zimbabwe needs to receive
part of its external assistance on concessionary terms.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
14.       Before 1965, the Bank made five loans totalling US$140.3 million
benefiting Rhodesia -- two directly to the Government for agriculture
(US$5.6 million) and power (US$28.0 million), two loans totalling
US$87.7 million to the Central African Power Corporation (CAPCO), and a
US$9.0 million loan to the Rhodesia Railways. As a guarantor of each of
the loans, the United Kingdom serviced them after 1964. The loans for
agriculture and railways have been repaid, and CAPCO resumed servicing its
two loans after the lifting of sanctions on December 21, 1979. During
FY81, the Bank and the Association approved a loan of US$50 million and a
credit of US$15 million for the Manufacturing Rehabilitation Imports Pro-
gram. The loan (1959-ZIM) and the credit (1120-ZIM) financed priority
import requirements of raw materials, spare parts, and components and bal-
ancing equipment needed to utilize idle capacity in the manufacturing sec-
tor. The Bank also approved a loan (1944-ZIM) of US$42 million to finance
import requirements of spare parts, track maintenance equipment and tools
for the railways, equipment for the Central Mechanical Equipment Department
and 'technical assistance. A summary statement of Bank Group operations and
notes on the execution of ongoing projects are provided in Annex II. Proj-
ect implementation thus far is satisfactory and disbursements have kept to
schedule.
15.       IFC's first investment in Zimbabwe, approved by its Board in
March 1981, was in the Wankie Colliery Company Limited, to help finance a
project for producing coal for a thermal power station, now being con-
structed, and other uses. The investment was in the form of a US$38 mil-
lion loan (552-ZIM), of which US$20 million was for IFC's own account, and
US$18 million comprised commercial bank participation in the loan. IFC was
also responsible for arranging a further US$10.3 million of commercial bank
financing related to a proposed loan by the Export-Import Bank of the
United States (Eximbank).
16.       The Bank is identifying and preparing projects for power, rail-
ways, manpower development and training, agriculture, rural development,
forestry, and industrial development through a development finance com-
pany. A Small Farm Credit project, approved by the Board in September
1982, will provide the Agricultural Finance Corporation with funds for



-5-
million loan (552-ZIM), of which US$20.0 million was for IFC's own account
and US$18.0 million comprised commercial bank participation in the loan.
IFC was also responsible for arranging a further US$10.3 million of
commercial bank financing related to a proposed loan by the Export-Import
Bank of the United States.
16.       The Bank is identifying and preparing projects in agriculture and
rural forestry development, power, railways development, manpower develop-
ment and training and industrial intermediation. Meanwhile, a national
agricultural extension and research project and a rural afforestation
project are scheduled for Board presentation in May 1983.
17.       The Bank has reviewed or is reviewing the energy, agricultural,
urban, education and manpower, population, health and nutrition, and
telecommunications sectors; reports either have been completed or are being
written.
18.       Since Bank lending to Zimbabwe is very recent, Bank Group
exposure is still very low. At the end of 1981, the Bank accounted for six
percent and IDA and the Bank combined, for about eight percent of
Zimbabwe's public external debt.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
General
19.      Zimbabwe emerged from the war of independence with a relatively
good transport system, albeit inequitably distributed by services and
infrastructure among the regions and population. The transport system is
extensive, including 85,600 km of roads, 3,374 km of railway and eight
airports (three international). The entire system was built in pre-
independence days to serve the country's urban areas, commercial farms, and
industrial and mining centers. Parts of the system had deteriorated
because of the damage caused, directly and indirectly, by the war.
20.      The country's transport network has an international importance as
well: Zimbabwe sits astride key railway and road routes which provide
Zambia, Botswana and parts of Zaire access to the sea. Because of the
close interdependence, Zimbabwe and its neighbors are making a coordinated
effort to develop regional transport services and facilities. This has
been given the highest priority by the Southern African Development
Coordination Conference (SADCC), which established the Southern African
Transport and Communications Commission (SATCC), to promote and coordinate
the development of regional transport and communications among its nine
member countries.
21.      The Government's main objectives in the transport sector are:  (a)
to improve and rehabilitate those parts of the transport system where the
need is greatest; (b) to extend transport services to the most
disadvantaged areas of the country; and (c) to cope with a growing scarcity
of skilled personnel. The Government's transport policy and objectives are



- 6 -
sound. However, the current programs are transitional and are only a
beginning in the post-independence development process. Transport policy
and planning are carried out separately by each of the agencies responsible
for a particular mode, namely, railways and aviation within the Ministry of
Transport; road as well as road transport within the Ministry of Roads and
Road Traffic (MRRT). The Ministry of Finance, Economic Planning and
Development assumes the function over all coordination in approving
development budgets and control of rail tariffs and subsidies as does MRRT
in issuing permits for commercial road transport services. MRRT is
developing a capacity to evaluate highway investment proposals but lacks
expertise particularly to deal with transport coordination problems. The
proposed, project will finance a national transport study to address the
problem of transport coordination and to recommend changes in regulatory
and pricing policy to ensure economic transport services in the country, in
addition to preparing transport investment programs.
Railways
22.      The National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ) is a well-managed and
efficiently operated parastatal organization. Of the 3,374 km track, the
mainline portions, except for sections close to Mozambique and the 640 km
stretch in Botswana, generally are in good condition. However, branch
lines need upgrading and the outmoded signaling systems currently in use
will have to be replaced. NRZ plans to change these systems in conjunction
with its electrification program which is phased over a number of years.
In 1981, NRZ carried 13.9 million tons (6.6 billion ton-kilometers) of
freight, of which 62 percent was local traffic made up mainly of coal, iron
ore, fertilizer and agricultural products, 30 percent evenly divided
between imports and exports, and 8 percent transit traffic.
23.      In addition to its internal importance, the Zimbabwe railway
handles transport traffic of Zambia and Zaire. Although the shortest route
is through southeast Zimbabwe to Maputo, this route has become insecure and
inefficient forcing greater dependence on routes through the Republic of
South Africa (RSA). The main rail route is now the line through Botswana
to Port Elizabeth, RSA; the route through RSA to Durban via Beitbridge,
Zimbabwe can handle only a limited amount of traffic.
24.      Availability of freight wagons is high (60 percent), but overall
operations are hampered by low availability of locomotives (55 percent for
diesel, 50 percent for steam) due to the age of the fleet, lack of skilled
labor and shortages of spare parts. NRZ has incurred a deficit in its
operations each year since 1970 which is made up by the Government. The
reason for the deficit is that the Government requires that tariffs for
passengers and coal, coke and some agricultural commodities be kept low.
However, both passenger and freight tariffs were increased in 1981, and
under the Bank's Transport Rehabilitation Imports Program Loan, the
Government is studying NRZ' tariff and cost structure and is expected to
take further steps to improve its financial situation. The most pressing
problem is the critical shortage of skilled manpower. In November 1982,
the Bank appraised a staffing and training project for NRZ.



-7-
Air Transport
25.      In addition to linking its major cities, air transport links
Zimbabwe to other countries in Africa and Europe. The country is served by
several international carriers and by Air Zimbabwe (AZ), a parastatal com-
pany flying eight domestic, five regional and one intercontinental (London)
route. Passenger and ton/km increased 67 and 73 percent, respectively,
between 1980 and 1981, but net profits fell because of high fuel costs, and
wage and salary increases. Affretair, a parastatal company exclusively
handling freight, serves cities in Zimbabwe, Africa and Europe. A merger
of AZ and Affretair is being considered.

26.      The Road Network.  Of the 85,600 km of roads, 14 percent are
paved, 54 percent are gravelled and the remaining 32 percent are earth
roads and tracks. The roads are categorized by the way they are adminis-
tered. State roads (18,200 km), which connect provincial and district
centers and provide international links, are the responsibility of the
Ministry of Roads and Road Traffic (MRRT). Rural council roads (22,200 kmn)
principally serve the commercial farming areas and are administered by the
55 rural councils. Roads located in the 11 urban areas controlled by the
municipalities are designated municipal roads (5,300 km). District roads
(39,900 km) serve the communal lands and are the responsibility of the Dis-
trict Development Fund, a semiautonomous agency; however, the newly estab-
lished district councils are beginning to assume some responsibility for
these roads.
27.      The length of the state and rural council road network is adequate
but the roads suffered from neglect during the war. The district roads
which were given low priority, were seriously damaged when fighting erupted
in the communal lands. The main roads in these areas are now being taken
into the state road network and are being upgraded to all-weather standards
(the proposed project will finance the construction of 315 km of these
roads). Feeder roads are being rehabilitated with financial assistance
from bilateral aid agencies, such as KfW, ODA and USAID. KfW will soon
undertake a study to prepare a feeder roads project to be carried out with
KfW financing seven districts. The national feeder roads study included in
the Bank project will cover areas other than those by KfW.
28.      Institutions.  MRRT has the overall responsibility for road and
road transportation. It has offices in the country's seven provinces for
executing the state road construction and maintenance programs. Seven
provincial engineers direct these activities. While the Ministry's
organization is satisfactory, it has been weakened by the departure of many
experienced engineers. Rural councils have their own road construction and
maintenance crews but rely on consultants and MRRT for technical guidance.
Municipalities have works divisions, usually headed by engineers, to build
and maintain their roads. The District Development Fund (DDF) has offices
in the provinces to carry out maintenance and development of infrastructure
services in the communal lands, including roads, water supply and storage
facilities, and buildings. MRRT provincial engineers assist DDF in
engineering and planning matters. District councils are not yet organized
to carry out construction or maintenance.



- 8 -
29.      The Central Mechanical Equipment Department (CMED) in the Ministry
of National Supplies is responsible for procurement, maintenance and re-
placement of all government equipment and vehicles, which it rents to other
agencies, including MRRT. Although CMED operates on a commercial basis,
its rental rates, set by the Treasury, and which include allocations to a
renewal fund, are about 20 percent lower than private rental rates. The
system is sound but the renewal fund is insufficient to meet replacement
costs of equipment and vehicles. The Government will review the rental
rates charged to MRRT and adjust them to reflect the cost of acquisition,
repair and maintenance of the equipment and vehicles (draft Loan Agreement,
Section 4.04).
30.      Manpower and Training.  There are vacancies in MRRT at all
levels. The situation regarding the engineers is deteriorating and MRRT
has taken steps to recruit expatriates to fill vacancies and to expand its
programs for training engineers at the University of Zimbabwe. Regarding
the subprofessional and artisan levels, MRRT is coping with the problem by
expanding training facilities at Road Training Center (RTC), which also
trains an increasing number of development officers for DDF involved in
feeder roads and rural council road supervisors. However, due mainly to
lack of funds, RTC's equipment is worn out and is inadequate to cope with
increasing training requirements. Provisions have, therefore, been made in
the project to procure RTC's requirements of training aids and equipment.
There are also many vacancies in CMED. Training at CMED has doubled in
size and the Government is recruiting expatriate mechanics to train
apprentices. The manpower situation regarding road administration is not
expected to reach a crisis point as current shortages and future
requirements can be contained partly by the above and also partly by giving
out more work to the private sector.
31.      Construction.  Road construction is carried out mostly by force
account. The works are organized and executed satisfactorily but the trend
is for more works to be given out on contract. There is at least one force
account unit operating in each province; they rent their equipment from
CMED or from private companies. The value of the work executed by each
unit is about Z$1-2 million annually. Almost all contract work is done by
locally-based contractors. Major contracts are usually bridge contracts
where foreign contractors are encouraged to participate in the bidding.
32.      Maintenance.  Road maintenance is carried out entirely by force
account. Maintenance funds are adequate for the state roads and rural
council roads. The state road system is maintained to a high standard by
MRRT and the rural councils also maintain their roads satisfactorily. The
district roads, however, have received relatively little attention. DDF
and the district councils are dependent on annual grants from the Central
Government for rehabilitation and construction of district roads. Both DDF
and the district councils lack staff, training facilities and secure
funding. The proposed feeder roads study in the project is expected to
make recommendations for resolution of these problems.
33.      Planning.  Planning for the state road network is carried out by
the Planning Branch of MRRT. It prepares a three-year development plan,
which provides a basis for the annual estimates of expenditures. The plan
in turn is based on a ten-year program prepared by the Planning Branch.



- 9 -
The current highway investment program covers the period 1982-84 and the
Government is considering extending it for another year. Future program-
ming is expected to be based on the outcome of the proposed national trans-
port study to be financed under the project.
34.      Expenditures and Financing.  The total expenditures on state roads
have increased from Z$25 million in 1977 to Z$40 million in 1981 and they
are adequate. Although expenditures on rural council roads have not been
consolidated, judging from the condition of these roads they have been
satisfactory. By contrast, the district roads have received meager funds
in the past for their development and maintenance. Road users contribute
to Government revenue through taxes and duties on vehicles, fuel, lubri-
cants and spare parts and through fees for vehicle registrations, vehicle
inspections, road service permits, driving tests and licenses, abnormal
load permits and a surcharge on licensing fees for all heavy vehicles. The
major part of road user revenues comes from taxes on fuel, which in FY81,
totalled Z$22.9 million compared to an estimated Z$13.0 million from other
sources. With the doubling of gasoline taxes in July 1981, revenue from
this source is expected to about double. On the basis of the Bank Energy
Assessment Report (Report No. 3765-ZIM of June 1982), the Government is
expected to undertake an energy pricing study including petroleum products;
the study will recommend appropriate price/tariff structure for each energy
source for implementation. Since the demand mix of fuel use has been
highly distorted due to the growing disparity between gasoline and diesel
prices, any substantial changes in price/tariff structure may have a
significant impact on the road transport industry and railways operation
and on resource mobilization. The energy study is expected to be under-
taken under the power project approved by the Board in December 1982.
35.      Vehicle Fleet.  From a peak of about 20,000 in 1971, new
registrations of motor vehicles declined to about 8,000 in 1979 due to the
shortage of foreign exchange caused by UN-imposed economic sanctions and
the war. However, between 1976 and 1980, the vehicle fleet increased from
206,193 to 247,130 as owners of trucks and cars kept their vehicles in
service longer. The truck fleet with one vehicle per 450 inhabitants is
the second highest among the East African countries after Kenya. The light
vehicle fleet, with one vehicle per 32 inhabitants, is the largest.
36.      Zimbabwe has a motor vehicle manufacturing industry consisting of
the manufacture of some parts and assembly of cars and trucks of foreign
origin. The local content is 40 percent and 50 percent for passenger cars
and trucks, respectively. Almost all cars and trucks sold in the country
are produced locally. The industry was hurt during the war by shortage of
foreign exchange, but the situation has improved greatly since independence
with increased allocations of foreign exchange to the industry.
37.      Traffic and Road Transport Industry.  For seven years following
the unilateral declaration of independence in 1967, traffic grew at about
nine percent annually on state roads until 1972 when volumes for light
vehicles began to decline because of the intensity of the war. Since
independence, traffic has grown 60 percent, approaching the peak levels of
1971. Traffic on the paved road network outside urban areas averages about



- 10 -
600 vpd, of which about one-third consists of trucks and buses. MRRT has
been making regular automatic and manual traffic counts for several years.
38.      About 90 percent of freight transport is handled by manufacturing
enterprises and businesses which have their own vehicles. The remaining
10 percent is carried by commercial haulage contractors who own about 150
tractor units plus 150 trailers and 200 semi-trailers. The commercial
haulage segment is dominated by a few large haulage firms which operate
very large trucks. About 55 percent of the total fleet is 10-12 years old;
that part of the fleet used to transport agricultural produce is even
older. This has led to high vehicle operating costs which, coupled with a
shortage of spare parts, makes truck operators unwilling to travel on bad
roads, most of which serve the communal lands. There is a critical short-
age of 8-12 ton trucks suited to serve the areas of low productivity in the
communal lands.
39.      The industry is governed by the Road Motor Transport Act (RMT)
which is administered by an agency of MRRT whose function is to protect the
railways and curb unhealthy competition between truck operators. In addi-
tion, the shortage of foreign exchange has acted as a further brake on the
free expansion of the trucking industry. Total freight transported by road
in 1980 is estimated at 2.8 billion ton/km compared to 6.9 billion ton/km
by rail. The national transport study will review the Road Motor Transport
Act and the operation of the road transport industry and make recommenda-
tions.
40.      The passenger transport industry is operated by private operators
under franchise agreements with the municipalities and a rural system regu-
lated by the RMT. The bus fleet numbers about 2,200 and is equally divided
between urban and rural systems.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Project Background
41.       The proposed project was identified by a Bank mission which
visited Zimbabwe in February 1981. An Appraisal Report entitled "Zimbabwe
Highway Project" (No. 3961-ZIM, dated April 18, 1983)is being distributed
separately to the Executive Directors. Negotiations were held in
Washington from September 13-17, 1982. The government delegation was led
by Mr. Austin T. Copeland. Annex III contains supplementary project data.
42.      There was a risk that foreign contractors bidding for civil works
mighthave quoted unusually high bid prices because of lack of familiarity
with the country, which had been effectively closed to the outside world
for many years. This might have affected the economic feasibility of the
project. Consequently, receipt of bids for the construction of the
Pamushana -Birchenough Bridge road and strengthening of the Birchenough
Bridge was made a condition for Board Presentation. However, there was a



- 11 -
delay in receipt of bids due to requests from international contractors for
extension of time within which to return bids in order to familiarize
themselves with conditions in Zimbabwe. This accounts for the protracted
time lag between negotiations and Board Presentation.
Objectives
43.       The project is designed to support Zimbabwe's three-year
(1983-85) transitional development program for the highway subsector. A
main goal of the program is to integrate the hitherto neglected communal
lands into the country's economic mainstream. The project's specific
objectives are to: (a) upgrade high-priority sections of the basic road
network, the improvement of which had been deferred during the war for
independence; (b) extend the basic road network into the communal lands;
(c) assist in planning the development and maintenance of feeder roads in
communal lands; and (d) improve transport coordination and planning.
Project Description
44.       The project would comprise the following:
(a) construction of the Pamushana-Birchenough Bridge
road (88 km) to two-lane bituminous standard;
(b) widening and strengthening of the Birchenough
Bridge;
(c) construction of three state roads in communal land
to all-weather gravel standard the Chivhu-Lothian
(132 km), Ndanga-Triangle (100 km) and the Range-
Mharadzano (83 km) roads);
(d) procurement of training aids and equipment for
MRRT's Roads Training Center; and
(e) consulting services for (i) construction supervi-
sion of (a), (b) and (c) above; (ii) detailed
engineering of 172 km of (c) above; (iii) a na-
tional transport study; (iv) a national feeder
roads study; and (v) feasibility studies and de-
tailed engineering of about 400 km of state roads.
45.       Pamushana-Birchenough Bridge Road.  The road, which is now a
single-lane sand-seal, is part of the 175 km Masvingo-Birchenough Bridge
road -- an important link in the domestic and regional road network. About
half (87 km) of the road is already two-lane paved standard. Under the
proposed project, the remainder of the road -- Pamushana-Birchenough Bridge
section, will be constructed to two-lane bituminous standard. The existing
road generally follows the ground line over rolling terrain and was not
designed to any specific geometric standards. Pavement failures are
apparent over the whole length of the road which will be reconstructed. A
bridge across the Nyangura river, partially constructed before the war,



- 12 -
will be completed under the project.
46.       Birchenough Bridge.  The bridge, a two-pinned arch structure with
steel trusses, is well maintained and is in excellent condition. However,
it was constructed in the mid-1930s to an old standard and cannot carry a
gross truck load in excess of 44 tons. The weight restrictions enforced on
the Birchenough Bridge due to low design strength has seriously deterred
transport operators from using the much shorter Birchenough-Masvingo road
to serve the central, east central and southeast central areas of the
country, resulting in costly diversions of long-distance freight traffic.
The bridge will be strengthened to permit the passage of the heavier trucks
and the roadway widened from the existing 18 feet to 24 feet.
47.       State Roads in the Communal Lands.  The Government has embarked
on an urgent program to improve infrastructural services in order to
develop the communal lands which were neglected by previous governments,
and has designated MRRT responsible for the primary roads in communal
lands. Consequently, about 6,000 km have been added to the state road
network. These earth and gravel roads, which were poorly designed and
constructed, were seriously damaged by the war. Work has started on
improving about 1,600 km of these roads to all-weather gravel standard.
The proposed project would finance the improvement of three of those roads
consisting of Chivhu-Lothian (132 km), Ndanga-Triangle (100 km) and
Range-Mharadzano (83 km) roads.
48.      Training Aids and Equipment.  RTC offers courses in drafting,
soils and materials technology and surveying designed to train techni-
cians. At any one time about 30 MRRT technical trainees attend each of the
three courses in addition to DDF development officers and rural council
supervisors. Due to the shortage of foreign exchange, RTC is operating
without proper training aids and equipment necessary for effective train-
ing. The proposed project would help finance some of the urgently needed
aids and equipment.
49.       Consulting Services.  Consultants will be employed to (a) super-
vise construction of all project roads, including detailed engineering of
172 kms of gravel roads, and strengthening of the Birchenough Bridge; (b)
undertake the national transport study; (c) a national feeder roads study;
and (d) feasibility studies and detailed engineering of about 400 km of
state roads. Except for (a) above, the consulting services will be finan-
ced by the Government which is expecting assistance from bilateral aid
agencies. Altogether, the project will finance about 641 man-months at an
average base cost of US$8,800 per man-month. In addition to these
personnel costs, the consultants costs will include local transportation,
local office costs and other minor operating expenses. Assurances have
been obtained from the Government that suitably qualified consultants will
be employed under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Borrower and the
Bank (draft Loan Agreement, Section 3.02) in respect of the services to be
financed by the Bank. With regard to the other services, the Government
has agreed that it will appoint qualified and experienced consultants, that
the terms of reference will be agreed with the Bank and that the Bank will
be consulted throughout the progress of the various studies (draft Loan
Agreement, Section 3.04).



- 13 -
Project Cost and Financing
50.       The total project cost, excluding a capitalized front-end fee of
US$0.39 million, but including contingencies, is estimated at US$70.6
million with a foreign exchange cost of US$38.0 million or 58 percent.
Total cost net of taxes and duties is US$66.0 million. The base cost
estimate is in April 1983 prices. Local costs are expected to increase 15
percent per annum for 1983 and 12 percent per annum thereafter. Foreign
cost escalation during the project period has been estimated at 8.0 percent
for 1983, and 7.5 percent for 1984 and 1985, and 7.0 percent for 1986.
51.       The Government will finance all local costs, US$1.6 million of
foreign exchange costs in respect of consulting services for the national
transport study, the national feeder roads study and feasibility studies
and detailed engineering. The balance of the foreign exchange cost esti-
mated at about US$36.4 million will be financed by the Bank (US$26.4
million) and BADEA (US$10.0 million). BADEA's participation is expected to
be as follows: (i) joint financing with the World Bank Group for
construction of the Pamushana-Birchenough Bridge road; and (ii) parallel
financing of the full foreign exchange costs of civil works for the
widening and strengthening of Birchenough Bridge and construction of the
Ndanga-Triangle road.
Implementation
52.       MRRT will be responsible for the execution of all project compo-
nents except for the feeder roads study which will be implemented by the
MLGTP. The two agencies will be assisted by consultants. The National
Transport Study will be supervised by a steering committee comprising the
secretaries of MEPD, MRRT and MT. The project will be implemented over a
three-year period beginning March 1983.
Procurement and Disbursement
53.        Construction of the Pamushana-Birchenough Bridge road, estimated
to cost about US$20.3 million, will be executed under two unit price
contracts bid in one package. The Birchenough Bridge will be under a
separate unit price contract, estimated to cost about US$1.4 million.
Construction of the state roads in communal lands, estimated to cost about
US$28.5 million, will be executed under seven unit price contracts, two to
three to be awarded each year in one bid package. The size of the
contracts was determined to provide a number of small contracts to
encourage participation by local contractors. All the above contracts will
be awarded after international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with
Bank Group guidelines (draft Loan Agreement, Schedule 4, Section A(2)).
Bidding for the strengthening of the Birchenough Bridge and the
construction of Ndanga-Triangle road, which will be wholly financed by
BADEA, would be subject to BADEA rules. Bids were received for the
construction of the Pamushana-Birchenough Bridge road and widening and
strengthening of Birchenough Bridge on April 14 and the bid prices have
been found to be about the same as the estimates. In view of the
specialized nature of the training aids and equipment and relatively small
cost (US$0.2 million), they will be procured through limited international
bidding. Contracts and related documentation for all civil works would be
subject to review by the Bank.



- 14 -
54.       Contracts for consulting services financed by the Bank will be
awarded in accordance with Bank guidelines for the use of consultants
(draft Loan Agreement, Section 3.02). The Government has a policy of using
price as a factor in the selection of the consultants, but has agreed that
this policy will be applied only to consultants for construction supervi-
sion.
55.       The proceeds of the proposed loan will be disbursed as follows:
(a) 40 percent of the total costs of construction of the Pamushana-
Birchenough Bridge road; (b) 50 percent of the total costs (including taxes
and duties) of construction of the Range-Birchenough and Chivhu-Lothian
roads in the communal lands; (c) 100 percent of foreign costs (CIF, Harare)
of directly imported training aids and equipment, 100 percent of exfactory
price if manufactured locally and 85 percent of local costs if locally pro-
cured; and (d) 85 percent of the total costs for consulting services. All
disbursements will be fully documented. It is expected that disbursements
would be completed by September 30, 1986.
Accounting, Auditing and Reporting
56.       MRRT and MLGTP will maintain project accounts with separate ac-
counts for each project component. Not later than six months after the
close of each financial year, the project accounts would be audited by an
independent private auditor who would prepare a report for submission to
the Bank. In addition, the Government will submit to the Bank quarterly
progress reports and a project completion report not later than six months
after the project closing date (draft Loan Agreement, Section 4.02).
Project Justification, Benefits and Risks
57.       The project will enable the Government to develop urgently needed
transport facilities in areas where the majority of Zimbabweans live, but
which hitherto had been neglected -- the former tribal trust lands --
thereby removing a major constraint to the development of these areas. RTC
equipment will enable it to increase the number of trainees and improve the
quality of training which will benefit road construction and maintenance
operations. In addition to the benefits to vehicle operators and consumers
arising out of lower vehicle operating costs on the project roads as a
result of the proposed improvements, the project will enable the Government
to reduce gasoline and diesel fuel consumption by providing roads with
better alignments and surface conditions and by reducing the travel
distance.
58.       Construction of the Pamushana-Birchenough Bridge road to two-lane
bituminous standard is expected to yield an economic rate of return (ERR)
of 21 percent and the strengthening and widening of the Birchenough Bridge,
42 percent. Construction of three state roads in the communal lands to
all-weather gravel standard is expected to yield an ERR of 14 percent. The
overall ERR for these project components is estimated to be 18 percent.
59.       An analysis was made for a 20 percent increase in construction
costs for the Pamushana-Birchenough Bridge road to allow for the
uncertainty in estimating price trends in a country which has only recently
become independent and accessible to the outside world. Such an analysis



- 15 -
showed that the overall ERR would still be 18 percent. A similar analysis
was made for a 30 percent drop in traffic-related benefits; the result is
an ERR of 15 percent. Combining a cost increase of 20 percent and a
decline in traffic-related benefits of 30 percent would give an ERR of 12
percent.  A similar analysis was carried out to test the effects of a ten
percent increase in construction costs of the three state roads in the
communal lands, a 10 percent decrease in benefits and a combination of
both. The results show that even under these conditions the ERRs would be
10 percent.
60.       A major risk to the project is the possibility of sudden depart-
ure of the remaining non-indigenous staff in government departments, who
expect changes in policies governing salaries and conditions of employment
which may erode their benefits. This would slow project execution and
generally weaken administration of the transport system, particularly its
maintenance. However, it is unlikely that the non-indigenous staff now in
government departments would leave all at once. Moreover, the Government
has already started a campaign to recruit expatriates to fill vacant posi-
tions in the MRRT and it can be stepped-up if the situation warrants.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
61.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Zimbabwe and the
Bank and the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section
4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank are being distributed to
the Executive Directors separately.
62.       Special conditions of the project are listed in Section III of
Annex III.
63.       Effectiveness of the BADEA loan agreement would be an additional
condition of effectiveness of the Bank Loan Agreement (draft Loan Agree-
ment, Section 6.01).
64.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
64.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C. STATUS OF BANK AND IDA PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
(As of March 31, 1982)
Loan No. 1959-ZIM    Manufacturing Rehabilitation Imports Program:  US$50
Credit No. 1120-ZIM  million and US$15 million, respectively, of April 9,
1981; Effectiveness Date: April 9, 1981; Closing
Date: March 31, 1982
The loan and credit have financed priority import requirements of
raw materials, spare parts, components and balancing equipment needed to
utilize idle capacity in the manufacturing sector. The program was
implemented by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe. The loan and credit are
already fully disbursed. It is too early to assess the full impact of the
loan and credit, nevertheless, during the loan and credit period,
manufactured output increased by almost 10 percent. However, because of a
shortfall in the availability of foreign exchange, full reconstruction of
the sector is unlikely to be achieved.
Loan No. 1994-ZIM    Transport Rehabilitation Imports Program:  US$42 mil-
lion, of June 22, 1981; Effectiveness Date: June 26,
1981; Closing Date: December 31, 1983
The Transport Rehabilitation Imports Program Loan is providing
for locomotive and wagon spare parts, electrical spare parts, general spare
parts, machines and tools, signalling equipment, service vehicles, track
tools and equipment, and technical assistance for the National Railways of
Zimbabwe and the Central Mechanical Equipment Department. The departure
rate of skilled staff has increased far beyond the level expected at loan
appraisal, resulting in additional need for technical assistance. Conse-
quently, in addition to the US$6.8 million for technical assistance estim-
ated at loan appraisal, another US$7.1 million has been reallocated to that
category. Since NRZ anticipates a considerable long-term technical assist-
ance requirement from 1984 onward, a special railway technical assistance
and training project, for which Bank assistance has been requested, is
being processed.
Credit No. 1291-ZIM Small Farm Credit Project: US$30.4 Million, of
November 17, 1982; Effectiveness Date: February 10,
1983; Closing Date June 30, 1986
The project is providing through AFC seasonal credit for seeds,
fertilizer and chemicals, medium-term credit for farm improvement and
equipment; plus facilities and technical assistance to AFC in support of
its expansion of small farm credit.

Credit No. 1296-ZIM Petroleum Fuels Supply Technical Assistance Project:
US$1.2 Million, of November 17, 1982; Effectiveness
Date: April 14, 1983; Closing Date: June 30, 1984
The project provides for economic and engineering studies of
petroleum fuels supply options available to Zimbabwe, recommending the
preferred system, taking into account cost, suitability and reliability of
supply. The study also would recommend improvements in the procurement,
pricing and internal distribution of petroleum fuels, plus financing
training.
Loan No. 2212-ZIM    Power Project: US$105 Million of February 9, 1983;
Effectiveness Date: Not Yet Effective; Closing Date:
June 30, 1982
The project provides for enhancing electric generating capacity
through extension of the Hwange Thermal Power Station. It also includes
construction of a transmission line, technical assistance and training.
Loan No. 2239         Manufacturing Export Promotion Project: US$70.6
Million of March 9, 1983; Effectiveness Date:
March 28, 1983; Closing Date: December 31, 1985
The project provides foreign exchange to finance priority import
requirements of raw materials, spare parts components balancing equipment
and export promotional services for export manufacturing industries.

D. STATUS OF IFC PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
(As of September 30, 1982)
Wankie Colliery Company Limited (HCCL)            552-ZIM
IFC's first investment in Zimbabwe, a loan of US$38 million
(gross) together with US$10 million arranged by IFC to cover the medium-
term maturities on an EximBank package, helped finance a US$191 million ex-
pansion of HCCL's coal mining operations, principally to supply a thermal
power plant. The financial plan included US$51 million of cash generation
and US$14 million to be raised by a rights offering. In view of the diffi-
culty a rights offering would face in the current stock market environment
in Zimbabwe, the Government has agreed to make an equity investment in the
Company to replace the rights issue. Under the terms negotiated, the Gov-
ernment will subscribe to 40 percent of the Company's equity and will nomi-
nate five out of the ten directors, including the chairman.
