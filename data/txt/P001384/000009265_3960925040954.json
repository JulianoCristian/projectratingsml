The project has been a major force in\n            introducing lower cost, affordable standards for housing and\n            related infrastructure, and these standards have been\n            generally accepted. However, the experience in building\n            roads and drainage suggests a need for deeper analysis of\n            the traffic patterns prior to undertaking work in an\n            existing residential area. Standards in this case were too\n            low considering the then current and expected future levels\n            of traffic, and from the viewpoint of recurrent cost\n            implications. A more realistic assessment would have avoided\n            the need for substantial maintenance of roads constructed\n            during the project and an eventual upgrading of these roads\n            to permanent surfacing also during the project, incurring an\n            additional cost of about 0.5 million."}, "docdt": "1989-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
