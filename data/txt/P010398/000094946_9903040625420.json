project was\n            partially unsatisfactory, and sustainability for project\n            activities in the long-haul is considered poor.\n            Nevertheless, the Bank's performance in project design,\n            appraisal and supervision was diligent. On the other hand,\n            the government's performance was weak, due to premature\n            methodology extension in the pilot area, overlaying the\n            project with a broad rural development approach , and, a\n            weak administration. The key lessons learned from this\n            project show that: 1) currently, the public sector extension\n            system results in a meager response to farmers' needs,\n            thus, attempts should be made for the private sector and\n            Non-governmental Organizations, to provide useful extension\n            services; 2) the Government needs to ensure a consistent and\n            long-term agricultural policy as a pre-requisite for\n            extension projects to become successful; 3) a single\n            extension methodology is hardly successful in a country with\n            substantial diversity in farming systems, hence, various\n            factors, such as climate, access to resources, education and\n            commercial aspirations, require consideration for a\n            successful extension program; and, 4) the community\n            acceptance and feasibility of new extension methods, should\n            be considered prior to implementation of such methods,\n            particularly where technological change at the farm level is scarce."}, "docdt": "1998-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
