increase\n            farmers' income and agricultural production by\n            improving farm productivity through, inter alia, promotion\n            of innovative technology.  To achieve this objective, the\n            project will:  (a) strengthen agricultural extension\n            services (except for tree crops); and (b) develop a national\n            seed policy.  The nationwide project will consists of:  (a)\n            a multifaceted program to improve agricultural extension\n            services, including closer integration of existing extension\n            services, improved use of mass media, strengthened plant\n            protection, quarantine and pest control, safer and more\n            effective use of pesticides, training, and a private sector\n            pilot extension program; (b) improved seed policy; and (c)\n            establishment of a project management unit."}, "docdt": "1992-05-12T00:00:00Z"}
