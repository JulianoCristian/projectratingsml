transactions. The exchange rate was reunified at the beginning of March 1993 at the free market rate.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
INDIA
EXTERNAL SECTOR AND INVESTMENT REGIME LIBERALIZATION
(LOAN 3627-IN)
PREFACE
1.    This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the External Sector and
Investment Regime Liberalization project in India, for which loan 3627-IN in the amount
of US$300 million equivalent was approved on June 24, 1993 and made effective on June
25, 1993. The loan was fully disbursed and closed by its original closing date in December
1993.
2.    The ICR was prepared by Mr. Roberto Zagha, Country Operations, Industry and
Finance Division, Country Department II, South Asia Region and reviewed by the
Procurement Advisor and the Legal Department. Because of the one-tranche nature of
the operation, the preparation of the ICR required no mission to India. The Borrower
provided no comments on the ICR.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
INDIA EXTERNAL SECTOR AND INVESTMENT REGIME
LIBERALIZATION (IESIRL)
[LOAN 3627-IN1
EVALUATION SUMMARY
The operation reviewed in this report was approved by the Board in June
1993 and was the Bank's third adjustment operation in support of the economic program
India started implementing in July 1991. The content of India's economic program and
its achievements have been discussed in detail in the last Country Economic
Memorandum (May 1995), and the last Country Assistance Strategy (May 1995). In a
nutshell, the economic program aimed at reducing serious fiscal and external imbalances
and ending four decades of centrally planned development. The latter was to be achieved
through a comprehensive program of structural reforms focused on five priority areas:
(i) the investment regime; (ii) the trade regime; (iii) the tax system; (iv) the financial
sector; and (v) public enterprises. Over the last four years, significant progress has been
achieved both on the stabilization and structural reform front.
The June 1993 IESIRL loan came in the sequel of a US$500 million
structural adjustment operation (half IBRD and half IDA) approved in December 1991,
and a US$500 million IDA adjustment operation in support of India's Social Safety Net
in December 1992. The IESIRL was part of a broad Bank program of support to India's
economic program. As highlighted in the December 1992 first Country Assistance
Strategy for India, of a combined IBRD-IDA lending plans of US$3 billion per year, 25-
30 percent were intended to be adjustment operations in support of reforms in the areas
of investment and trade liberalization, financial sector, public enterprises, social policies,
and sector-level policy and institutional frameworks.
Because of the one-tranche nature of this operation, it achieved its
objectives before it was presented to the Board, and was thus successful by definition.
The operation also achieved a broader goal, however, which is support for India's
investment and trade liberalization. As documented in the main text of this report, after
this operation was completed, the authorities have continued to take significant measures
to liberalize the trade and investment regimes with the result that India now has one of
the more liberal investment regimes in Asia and the trade regime is significantly more
open than it was in the past. Therefore, the operation supported a process at a moment
when access to external finance was critical for maintaining the momentum of reform.
Contrary to earlier expectations, however, there was no follow-up operation.  As
discussed in the main text of this report, this was because the improvement in India's
balance of payments situation has exceeded the most optimistic forecasts and rendered
unnecessary further adjustment operations.






PART I: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BANK'S PERSPECTIVE
1           Project Identity
Name:         External Sector and Investment Regime Liberalization
Loan Number: 3627-IN
RVP Unit:    South Asia
Country:      India
Sector:       Trade and Industry
2           Background
2.1          The Government that came to power on June 21, 1991 inherited an
economy in crisis. The central government fiscal deficit had reached 8.4 percent of GDP
in 1990-91 and, if not corrected, would have reached 10 percent of GDP in 1991-92.
At double digits since November 1990, India's historically low inflation rate continued
to increase and reached 17 percent in August 1991. With reserves at about US$1 billion
(two weeks of imports) and no external finance available from commercial sources, the
country was on the verge of defaulting on its external debt. On the structural front, the
various liberalization efforts in the 1980s had addressed India's most important structural
problems only very partially, and had left basically intact the complex system of controls
and interventions built over several decades of planned development.
2.2         In the last three years, the new Government has not only overcome the
balance of payments crisis and reduced fiscal imbalances, but has also introduced
comprehensive structural reforms aimed at ending four decades of a development strategy
based on central planning and transforming India into an internationally competitive
economy. The Government's structural reform program focuses on five priority areas:
trade, investment licensing, the financial sector, taxation and public enterprises.
2.3         The government's adjustment efforts have been supported by substantial
fast-disbursing assistance from official development agencies-notably, the IMF (US$4.9
billion), Japan (US$1.3 billion), the World Bank (US$1.3 billion), the ADB ((US$550
million) and Germany (US$500 million). This support has been critical to bolstering
external confidence, and has allowed for stabilization of the economy without excessively
contractionary financial policies.
2.4          The Bank extended three fast-disbursing loans in support of India's
adjustment efforts. The first structural adjustment loan to India (US$500 million
SAL/SAC in December 1991) supported the Government's efforts in liberalizing the
industrial and trade regimes, reforming the financial sector, and restructuring public
enterprises. The SAL objectives were generally fully met in all these four reform areas,
and in fact the delicensing of imports of intermediates and capital goods and the
introduction of a free foreign exchange market in March 1992, meant that the SAL



2
targets were significantly exceeded. In December 1992, the Bank extended a US$500
million IDA to support the government's safety-net program. In June 1993, the present
one-tranche US$300 million loan was extended to India to support its continuing efforts
to liberalize the trade and investment regimes. The loan was cofinanced by a US$250
million loan from the Export-Import Bank of Japan in September 1993.
3            Project Objectives and Design
3.1          The objective of the present loan was to support trade and liberalization
measures taken prior to June 1993, including: (i) the amendment of the Foreign
Exchange Regulations Act in January 1993; (ii) the reunification of the exchange rate in
March 1993; (iii) the reduction in tariffs in March 1993; (iv) the limited measures taken
to liberalize imports of consumer goods in October 1992-March 1993; and (v) the
investment deregulation measures of March (mining) and April 1993 (automobiles,
leather, and white goods).
3.2          Amendments of the FERA in January 1993 removed all restrictions which
previously prevented companies with more than 40 percent foreign equity (called FERA
companies) from borrowing funds or raising deposits in India, from taking over any
business interest from an Indian resident, from acquiring or disposing assets (including
land), from appointing technicians or managers without clearance from the Reserve Bank
of India (RBI), and from using their trade marks without RBI clearance. Except for
restrictions on acquisition by FERA companies of enterprises in the agriculture and
plantation sectors, FERA companies (regardless of proportion of foreign equity
participation) are now treated at par with domestic investors and are permitted to remit
dividends abroad without limitations or restrictions.
3.3          Reunification of the exchange rate in March 1993 moved India to a
floating exchange rate regime with all permitted current and capital foreign exchange
transactions taking place at a rate determined in the interbank market. Foreign exchange
dealers can now maintain balances in convertible currencies domestically and abroad, and
deal spot and forward in all major currencies. Except for some services such as purchase
of insurance abroad and some imports still subject to licensing restrictions (see para.
3.5), all current account transactions are now permitted and do not require government
approval.
3.4          The March 1993 reduction in tariffs continued India's tariff reforms and
further reduced the maximum tariff to 85 percent (from a maximum of 350 percent
before the July 1991 reforms). Together with steeper tariff cuts on selected capital
goods, the import-weighed tariff was reduced from 77 percent prior to the reforms to
41 percent.
3.5          A limited liberalization of consumer goods imports was initiated in October
1992 with the introduction of the Special Import License (SIL) scheme. The SILs,
granted to exporters as shares of their gross export earnings (ranging from 2 to 4



3
percent), are tradable and can be used to import a specified list of consumer goods. In
addition, in February 1993, the government reduced from 255 percent to 150 percent
tariffs on consumer goods imported as baggage and abolished restrictions on the resale
of these imports.
3.6          The new National Mining Policy introduced in March 1993 aimed at
removing all mining products (except hydrocarbon, uranium and coal) from the reserve
of the public sector.  This opened for the first time in decades mining (except
hydrocarbon, uranium and coal) to the private sector. Foreign equity participation of up
to 50 percent was also permitted.  Aside from those mining sectors, only railway
transport, uranium production and processing, coal extraction, and defence industries
continue to be under public sector reservation. In April 1993, investment licensing
restrictions were removed for three important sectors: leather, automobiles and household
appliances. Together with the earlier delicensing measures taken in July 1991, only less
than 15 percent of value-added in manufacturing (mostly agro-industries) still remains
subject to licensing requirements.
3.7          The aforementioned measures supported by the loan form part of the
Government's medium-term trade and investment reform program which aims to remove
all import licensing restrictions (except for those related to environment and safety),
reduce tariffs to an average of 25 percent, and eliminate licensing for all industries
except defense, explosives and hazardous chemicals by the end of its Eighth Plan (1996-
97). In support of these medium-term objectives of the Government, the President's
Report of the loan also underlined the importance for India to make further progress over
the next few years to liberalize imports of consumer goods, reduce tariffs, and eliminate
remaining export controls and investment licensing requirements to lay the basis for
increasing the export orientation of India's industrial sector and integrating India into the
world economy.
3.8          The loan was conceived as a one-tranche operation because, given India's
parliamentary system, the Government found it difficult to make commitments--with the
degree of explicitly required in a Bank loan--on national policy issues which typically
require prior parliamentary discussion and approval. Because the government had well-
articulated medium-term objectives, and its track record demonstrated commitment and
full ownership, the one-tranche operation was appropriated to the circumstances.
3.9          The Bank stands ready to continue supporting India's ongoing efforts in
reforming its trade and investment regimes. However, in view of India's much
strengthened balance of payments position which has resulted in part from these reform
measures (paras. 4.7-4. 10), this support will not take the form of adjustment lending, at
least for the foreseeable future. It will consist of economic and sector work, and other
forms of assistance, such as a recently approved Institutional Development Fund to help
the codification and consolidation of all the laws and regulations governing India's
investment regime.

4           Achievement of Objectives
4.1         Since the loan is one-tranche, the loan objectives had already been fully
met at the time of Board presentation in June 1993. In a broader sense, the loan has also
achieved the broader objective of supporting the momentum of reform as the Government
has continued to take measures to liberalize India's trade and investment regimes after
June 1993, in the following areas.
4.2         First, the Government has taken further measures to liberalize the external
payments regime such that by August 1994 India has achieved current account
convertibility according to Article VIII of the Articles of Agreement with the IMF.
There are now no limits (except indicative ones) on foreign exchange allowances for all
permitted current international transactions including travel, education and medical
treatment; the multiple currency practice sustained through exchange rate guarantees on
Non-Resident Indian deposits has been eliminated; and the rules on repatriation of
dividends and interest have been liberalized.
4.3          Second, the Government has further liberalized consumer goods imports
with the expansion in March and July 1994 of the list of items that can be imported using
Special Import Licenses (SILs), and with the higher value of licenses now granted to
exporters ranging from 3 to 10 percent (compared to the previous 2 to 4 percent). As a
result, the share of consumer goods items in the harmonized classification importable
using SILs has increased from 4 percent to 20 percent.
4.4         Third, the Union Budget for 1994-95 has continued the process of
reduction and rationalization of custom duties. The budget has further reduced the peak
rate of custom duty from 85 percent to 65 percent. Together with steeper cuts on tariffs
of some capital and intermediate goods, the import-weighted tariff has been reduced from
41 percent to 32 percent.
4.5         Fourth, the Government has further liberalized the investment regime.
In January 1994, the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act, 1957 was
amended in line with the new National Mineral Policy of March 1993, opening mining
(except for hydrocarbon, uranium and coal) to the private sector for the first time in
decades. In February 1994, the Air Corporation Act of 1953 was repealed allowing
private airlines to compete on an equal basis with public airlines. And in May 1994, in
a landmark decision, the Government opened telecommunications to private investment.
Even in sectors still reserved for the public sector (including hydrocarbons, coal, and
postal services), the government has taken a more liberal stance towards private
investment. In February 1994, private investment in "captive" coal mines was allowed.
In March 1994, the Coal Ministry offered 13 proven coal mines to private power, iron
and steel companies and power companies including foreign companies. Private courier
services have been allowed to compete with the government postal service; railways
container depots and container stations have been opened to the private sector; and the
inland waterway was opened to private vessels in December 1993.

4.7          Impact on the economy. While the process of stabilization and reform
(of which the measures supported by the present operation are an integral part) has yet
to be completed, and the full benefits of the reform measures already taken will not be
realized for some time, some positive results can already be discerned. These include
the recovery of export and industrial growth, and the substantial increase in foreign
capital inflows.
4.8          The recovery in export growth has been remarkable, reaching 20 percent
in dollar terms in 1993-94 after the -2 percent performance in 1991-92 and the modest
recovery of 2 percent in 1992-93. This strong recovery in exports can be attributed in
part to the improvement in export incentives arising from the reforms, in particular the
substantial real depreciation of the exchange rate and improvement in export promotion
schemes. Improvement in export promotion schemes (supported by the SAL and still
ongoing) have also increased diversification of India's export products. This should
boost the resilience of India's exports against external market shocks which had been
partially responsible for the collapse of these exports in 1991-92, as well as help sustain
the high export growth necessary for the continuation of the reform process.  This
remarkable export recovery has contributed to the major reduction in the deficit of the
current account from US$10 billion (3.5 percent of GDP) in 1990-91 at the beginning
of the crisis to US$0.8 billion (0.3 percent of GDP) in 1993-94.
4.9          The success of the government's stabilization program and the credibility
of its reform agenda have also led to a major surge in foreign capital inflows. Foreign
investment reached an unprecedented high of US$4.7 billion in 1993-94, of which
US$4.1 billion was portfolio investment. These remarkable improvements in the current
and capital accounts have led to an accumulation of foreign exchange reserves to reach
nearly US$17 billion in August 1994.
4.10         These developments in India's external payments situation have drastically
reduced its needs for exceptional balance of payments financing.  The previously
projected exceptional financing need of US$1.8 billion for 1993-94 (of which US$300
million were scheduled to be met by the current operation) had declined to US$900
million. Projections of exceptional financing needs for 1994-95 and beyond have also
been revised downwards from US$2.3 to US$2.5 billion to US$500 million in 1994-95
and zero thereafter.
4.11         The recovery in external investors' confidence has been followed by
similar recovery on the domestic side. After declining to 1 percent in 1991-92 and the
modest recovery of 2 percent in 1992-93, industrial growth has recovered to reach 5
percent in the last four months of 1993-94 and higher rates in the first half of 1994-95.
4.12         Impact on the poor. Although not conceived as an operation directly
focused on the poor, the poor can be expected to benefit from the higher growth path
resulting from the overall program of stabilization and reform.

5            Bank Performance
5.1          The Bank's performance has been highly satisfactory in the identification,
preparation and appraisal of the project. Discussions with the authorities on a policy-
based loan in support of the liberalization of India's trade and investment regimes had
begun in June 1992, shortly after the second tranche review of the SAL.  These
discussions have been underpinned by analysis of India's trade and investment regimes
based on the earlier comprehensive reviews of these two sectors in the India: Strategy
for Trade Reform report (November, 1990) and the India: Industrial Regulatorv Reform
report (May 1991) and updated during the preparation of the SAL.
5.2          Subsequent to the present operation, the Bank has undertaken a
comprehensive review of the progress in trade liberalization in India in the India: Issues
in Trade Reform report (August 1994). In addition to recommendations for future policy
reforms, the report also provides a detailed treatment of export administration issues in
recognition of the importance of high export growth in sustaining the reform process.
The recommendations of the report would provide the basis for future adjustment
operations in this area should the need for balance of payments support arise in India,
and also the basis for a potential investment operation which could include technical
assistance to GOI for the strengthening of its export promotion institutions.

6.1          The commitment of  the government to its  program  of trade and
investment liberalization has been amply demonstrated by the reform measures it has
continued to pursue after the present operation in the areas of external payments,
liberalization of consumer goods imports, tariff reduction and investment delicensing
(paras. 4.2-4.5).
6.2          There were no disbursement issues associated to the loan. Of the US$300
million total loan amount, US$58.6 million was disbursed on June 30, 1993, shortly after
loan effectiveness, and the balance was completely disbursed by January 14, 1994.
7            Project Sustainability
7.1          The trade and investment liberalization measures supported by the loan
are part of the government's carefully prepared program of reforms which also cover the
areas of finance, public enterprises and taxation. The government had appointed expert
committees to formulate proposals for reforms in all these areas. These reform proposals
have been made public and amply discussed with academics, industrialists and unionists.
By adopting this approach to reform, the government has built consensus around the
economic program, anticipated public reactions to reform measures and avoided the
reversals that have sometimes derailed adjustment programs elsewhere in the world. The
commitment of the government to the completion of its reform program, as underlined



7
by the continuation of reform measures in trade and investment after the adjustment
operation, further reinforces the sense that the government fully owns the program of
reform.
7.2          Sustainability of trade liberalization will also be contingent on success in
tax reforms and public expenditure restraint, promotion of high export growth, continued
recovery in investment and industry, and enhanced effectiveness in poverty alleviation
programs.
7.3          Success in tax reforms is essential as further tariff cuts to achieve the
government's medium-term target of a 25 percent average tariff will reduce fiscal
revenues. This reduction in fiscal revenues would need to be offset by alternative
revenue sources, particularly in light of the need for further fiscal consolidation. This
fiscal pressure could be mitigated to the extent that the government makes significant
progress in restraining public expenditures.
7.4          High export growth would allow for continued import liberalization
without risking a major exchange rate devaluation which would jeopardize the fiscal
stabilization program. To this end, it is important that the government strengthens the
existing export incentive schemes, particularly those which guarantee free-trade access
to exporters, provide easy access to trade finance, facilitate foreign-domestic
collaboration for export market access and product development, and provide access to
overseas market networks (discussed in the Bank's India: Issues in Trade Reform
economic report, August 1994, see para.5.2).
8            Lessons Learned
8.1          The key lesson derived from the External Sector and Investment Regime
Liberalization operation is the central importance of government ownership of and
commitment to the adjustment program for its success. The reforms of the trade and
investment regimes, while not yet fully completed, have already generated positive results
(major improvement in the balance of payments and recovery in growth) without adverse
social consequence largely due to: (i) the wide-ranging consensus built by the government
over its reform program (see para.7. 1); and (ii) the government's adherence to a schedule
of reforms, the ultimate objectives of which have been pre-announced. The other
important lesson derived from this operation is that in the presence of a government
committed to reform, with clearly articulated medium-term objectives, and an established
track record, a one-tranche operation is an appropriate form of support to an adjustment
process which avoids the political complexities inherent in a situation where a sovereign
government needs to make commitments on national policies with a foreign lender.
