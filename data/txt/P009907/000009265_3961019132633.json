The objective of the\n            present loan was to support trade and liberalization\n            measures taken prior to June 1993, including: (i) the\n            amendment of the Foreign Exchange Regulations Act in January\n            1993; (ii) the reunification of the exchange rate in March\n            1993; (iii) the reduction in tariffs in March 1993; (iv) the\n            limited measures taken to liberalize imports of consumer\n            goods in October 1992-March 1993; and (v) the investment\n            deregulation measures of March (mining) and April 1993\n            (automobiles, leather, and white goods). The Bank's\n            performance has been highly satisfactory in the\n            identification, preparation and appraisal of the project.\n            Borrower\u2019s performance was satisfactory. The key lesson\n            derived from the project is the central importance of\n            government ownership of and commitment to the adjustment\n            program for its success. The other important lesson derived\n            from this operation is that in the presence of a government\n            committed to reform, with clearly articulated medium-term\n            objectives, and an established track record, a one-tranche\n            operation is an appropriate form of support to an adjustment\n            process which avoids the political complexities inherent in\n            a situation where a sovereign government needs to make\n            commitments on national policies with a foreign lender."}, "docdt": "1995-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
