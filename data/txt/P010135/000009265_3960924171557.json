The International Development\n            Association (IDA) efforts have had some success. The\n            National Development Bank of Sri Lanka (NDB) and the\n            Participating Credit Institution (PCI) have developed into\n            active promoters of the Small and Medium Industries (SMI)\n            development, a situation which SMI II has continued to\n            support. The involvement has been through provision of\n            technical assistance, frequent supervision, and more\n            recently in developing arrears recovery program to improve\n            the level of collections under the project. NDB and the PCIs\n            have developed into active promoters of SMI development, a\n            situation which SMI II has continued to support, the areas\n            which require most attention in view of the pending\n            completion of SMI II are: (i) the development of a program\n            to assist enterprises financed under the project to\n            streamline their initial operations (thus avoiding the\n            deterioration of the PCI portfolio); (ii) and the\n            development of a program to promote the use of SMI credit in\n            the changed economic environment (extension and\n            modernization of existing enterprises rather than the\n            creation of new ones). This would imply that the cost of\n            finance is brought more into line with the commercial risks\n            of lending to SMI."}, "docdt": "1987-05-22T00:00:00Z"}
