will provide improved access to credit for a wide range of\n            small and medium scale manufacturing and service industries\n            by providing a structure and additional resources for\n            refinancing and by developing the appraisal and supervision\n            capabilities of the major credit instituitions. The project\n            will also strengthen the promotion, technical, marketing and\n            management services for SMIs, by developing\n            subsector-specific programs extending the coverage of\n            existing technical services and training programs, and\n            improving the coordination among service agencies. It is\n            expected that the 1,000 subprojects to be financed will\n            result in incremental direct employment of at least 20,000,\n            with the coverage of the improved technical services to\n            reach about 1,500 firms."}, "docdt": "1979-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
