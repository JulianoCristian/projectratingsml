Some lessons learned\n            included: 1) privatization timetables should present a\n            realistic and attainable schedule reflecting the fact that\n            successful privatization hinges on a number of variables,\n            such as political ownership, country economic situation,\n            market trends, and public opinion support; 2) in situations\n            where the privatization agenda is not advancing, other\n            options for state-owned enterprise (SOE) reform should be\n            considered in order to achieve the desired development\n            outcome; 3) besides dealing with sector-specific issues,\n            privatization/reform of SOEs should be part of a broader\n            private sector development agenda which should include\n            improving the business environment and removing the barriers\n            that inhibit local investors and limit domestic financial\n            markets; and 4) project extensions should be well-planned\n            and agreed with the counterparts before they are processed."}, "docdt": "2007-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
