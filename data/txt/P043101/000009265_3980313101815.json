  resources. The reform measures supported by the FSAC are\n            designed to: 1) improve the enabling legal and regulatory\n            framework for the banking sector; 2) increase compliance\n            with international standards of capital adequacy and loan\n            loss provisioning; 3) strengthen the monitoring,\n            supervision, and enforcement functions of the central bank;\n            4) improve bank accounting and auditing standards; 5)\n            improve the governance of banks and accountability of their\n            board of directors; 6) introduce measures to improve bank\n            loan recovery; 7) undertake diagnostic reviews of public\n            sector banks to enable the government to decide on their\n            future; 8) take urgent steps to reduce the risk exposure of\n            two main public sector banks and to privatize one of them;\n            9) establish an Accounting Standards Board to improve the\n            timeliness and quality of borrowers' financial\n            statements; and 10) develop a legal and regulatory framework\n            for financial leasing. The FSAC is disbursed in two\n            tranches; the first will be available for disbursement upon\n            credit effectiveness, the second upon completion of the\n            agreed actions."}, "docdt": "1997-10-07T00:00:00Z"}
