Two\n            key lessons emerge from the analysis of the project. 1) For\n            a sector suffering from significant distortions and in a\n            country with relatively low technical capacity, a\n            policy-based adjustment credit needs to be complemented by\n            technical assistance that supports both affected agencies\n            and implementation capacity. Lack of a reliable source of\n            technical assistance funds caused IDA staff to spend an\n            unusual of time trying to recruit outside donors, writing\n            terms of reference and recruiting consultants, and\n            re-prioritizing assistance based on immediate needs and loan\n            conditionality. A related lesson that needs to be stressed\n            is that full-time advisors are probably the greatest\n            prerequisites to successful institutional development. 2) It\n            is important to set realistic objectives that are clearly\n            associated with credit conditionality. In this instance the\n            level of \"prepare and adopt action plan\"\n            conditionality could have little effect on the achievement\n            of objectives. Had such conditionality been tied to a first\n            or second tranche release, with the achievement of\n            particular actions or indicators conditionality for a final\n            tranche release, fuller achievement of objectives would have\n            been more likely. Designing the credit in such a way would\n            have enforced a more realistic time frame as well."}, "docdt": "2001-05-16T00:00:00Z"}
