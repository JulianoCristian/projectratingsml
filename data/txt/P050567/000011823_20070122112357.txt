ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
Non-Technical Summary
1.    INTRODUCTION
1.1   Background
Energy and En'6ironment Consultant (E&E) was commissioned by the New and Renewable
Energy Authority (NREA) to prepare the technical documents and procedures required by the
Global Environmental Facility (GEF), and the World Bank (WB)lIFC as well as the Egyptian
Environmental Affairs Agency (EEAA) concerning the environmental and social assessment
of the proposed Integrated Solar Combined Cycle Power Plant at the Kuarvmat location.
N'REA is seeking financial assistance from the GEF/WB for the construction and operation of
this 150 MWe power plant.
The proposed facility has been designated as a Category B project under World BankiTFC
rules and as a black listed project under EEAA regulations and therefore requires a full
Environmental Impact Assessment (ETA). Financing from any other intemationallregional
investors is conditional upon obtaining the environmental clearance from both the Egyptian
regulatory authorities and the WB.
1.2   Project Overview
New and Renewable Energy AuLthority (NREA), an organization incorporated in Egpt and
affiliated to the Minsitry of Electricity and Energy (MEE), proposes to build, and operate the
power plant at within an existing fenced area of uncultivated land in the eastern desert about 2
km distant from the Nile river at the kuraymat area in the southern part of Giza Govemorate,
approximately 95 km south of Cairo and 30 km north of Beni-sueif and about 750 m east of
the existing residential community of the present Kuraymat thermal power plant. The overall
proposed site area is 660 Feddans. Construction of the plant is due to commence in 2005 and
will last approximately 34 months. Operation of the power plant will begin in 2007.
The proposed power facility will consist of an integrated solar combined cycle power plant
consists of a solar field and a combined cycle power block. Solar field basically composed of
parabolic trough collectors and Heat Transfer Fluid (HTF) heat exchangers to generate steamn.
Combined cycle block mainly consist of two industrial heavy-duty type gas turbines (GT)
each with a nominal electricity generation capacity of around 43 MWe at ISO conditions,
unfired Heat Recovery Steam Generators (HRSGs) and steam turbine generator (STG) sized
to match the maximum steam output from HRSGs and solar steamr generator with capacity
rated at about 67 MWe. The overall generating capacity of the power plant will be 150MfWe.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
The power plant will utilize natural gas as its primary fuel, and also have the capability to
operate using sollar (fuel oil # 2). The ability to "dual-fuel" the power plant (with natural gas
or sollar) will provide security of electricity supply in the event that gas supplies are
unavailable for any reason.
The power plant will incorporate a closed circuit cooling system using water abstracted from
either the Nile river or the underground aquifer. The abstracted water will also be used
following pre-treatment dcmineralization. to provide process water make-up in the HRSG
systems. Potable water supplies as well as other service waters will also be drawn from this
water after treatment to support the plant water requirements.
The main demand for water is due to the closed circuit system. The use of a closed circuit
cooling system minimizes the capital cost and maintains the electrical efficiency of the power
plant at a good level. Only make-up water will be required to compensate water losses.
Evaporative cooling towers are required; hence there is opportunity for water drift and the
formation of visible plumes of water vapor and ground fogging.
To provide the make-up and service water, a pumping facility will be constructed either on the
Nile intake or on the proposed site. In case of abstracting water from the Nile river
underground pipelines will be extended from the site across the bank line and out into the Nile
river.
The location of the proposed site is shown in Figure 1.

2.    THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
2.1   Contributors to the EIA Report
The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) report is prepared by E&E, based on
information provided by NREA and their sub-contractors. Public consultation activities are
being undertaken by E&E and NREA. The EIA report draws heavily on the environmental
assessment documentation prepared by group of local and intemational multidisciplinary
consultants and submitted to E&E, for preparing the EIA report for local permitting and GEF
or international financing purposes. Most of the relevant local permits for the construction of
the power plant have now been received.
2.2   Scope of the EIA Report
The EIA has been carried out in accordance with IFC "Thermal Power - Guidelines for New
Plants" (July 1, 1998), Egyptian 'Law 4 of 1994, Law for the Environment" and the Egyptian
Environmnental Affairs Agency's "Guidelines for Egyptian Environmental Impact
Assessment".
The EIA has assessed the impacts of the construction and operation of the Kuarymat ISCC
power plant and has also considered the cumulative impacts of the plant and other existing
sources, particularly tbe existing Kuraymat tbermal power plant, in the project area. Pennits
will be required from the relevant Competent Administrative Authorities.
The EIA report presents the full assessment of the environmental, health and safety impacts of
the Kuarymat ISCC power plant. This Non-Technical Summary presents a short resume of
the findings of the EIA report. For further details, reference should be made to the full EIA
report.
3.    PROJECT.DESCRIPTION
3.1   Overview of the Power Plant
The power plant site will occupy an area of approximately 2,772,000 m7 irregular-shaped
piece of land and will include the following main elements:

energy first and then to mechanical energy via a ihemiodynamic cycle to drive an
electromechanical energy conversion device to generate electrical energy.
*  conventional combined cycle power plant, comprising two combustion turbine
generators capable of delivering an output of about 2x43 MWe (ISO), two Heat
Recovery Steam Generators (HRSGs) and one steam turine generator capable of
delivering an output of 67 MWe, which will be fed into the Egyptian unified grid
system. Two gas turbines, fired by natural gas or light fuel oil in emergencies, will
feed the generators and exhaust gases will be expelled through a stack 35 m high;
*  cooling and process water intake structures, with buried pipelines across the Nile
river bank or groundwater intake structures, with demineralization and storage
facilities; and
*  supportinig site infrastrucrure, switchyard, offices and workshops.
The layout for the power plant is presented in Figure 2.
3.2   Process Description
The key steps of the generating process of the proposed power plant are as follows:
*  The HTF passing from one end of the SCA to the other collects the heat absorbed by
the heat collecting elements (HCEs). Header pipelines at the cold and hot ends of the
SCAs connect these to the HTF-boiler integrated into the power block. The HTF-
boiler is a conventional steam generating heat exchanger similar in design to boilers
used for industrial process heat applications. Depending on the integration design of
solar steam supply into the power block, the HTE-boiler may generate saturated steam
or superheated steam. The common HTF in parabolic trough solar fields is a thermal
oil. The operation pressure is below 20 bar and temperature of the HTF is limited to
400°C to avoid cracking. Typically the upper temperature in the HTF circuit is 390°C.
*  Natural gas (or light fuel oil (sollar) in emergencies) will be mixed with air and
combusted using low NOx technology, to generate power and hot exhaust gas, which
will be used to generate steam from demineralized water to drive one turbine serving
electrical generator. The process results in the generation of electricity and also
produces hot exhaust gases.
*  The steam is cvcled from Heat Recovery Steam Generators (H-IRSGs) through the
turbine to condenser. The condenser is cooled by a closed circuit system using cooling
towers, abstracting water from the Nile river or the underlying aquifer via a ground
well to be digged at site, and discharging the used effluent to, a nearby drainage
basin/wadi or a ground well. The condensate is then returned for recirculation within
the HRSGs.

* The final exhaust gases will be discharged to the atmosphere via two 35 m high stacks
connecting both gas turbines. In operating in an open cycle, final exhaust gases will be
discharged to the atmosphere via two separate stacks in accordance with emission
standards set by the EEAA and IFC.
3.3   Operational Releases from the Power Plant
During operation, the key releases into the environmnent from the power plant will comprise
the following:
*  Exhaust gases, will be emitted into the atmosphere, normnally from the HRSGs stack as
result of fuel combustion. Emissions from the combustion of natural gas are carbon
dioxide (CO2), water vapor, carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). Sulfur
dioxide (SO2) and particulates, which are typically associated w,ith coal and oil
combustion, will only be produced in trace quantities during natural gas firing. In
emergencies when light fuel oil (sollar) is used instead of gas, SO2 and particulates
will however be key emissions from the power plant.
*  Heated blow down from cooling towers and process water will be discharged into the
ambient environment (drainage basin/wadi or a ground well) via the discharge systenm
at a temperature of no more than 8-10°C above ambient. Any oil, chemicals and
residual solids will be removed before discharge and the pH of discharged water
maintained at between 6 and 9.
* Small volumes of solid wastes will be segregated. collected and disposed of by
licensed waste disposal contractors.
The power plant incorporates a rang of measures to eliminate or reduce operational releases
within its design and layout, such as low NOx combustors in the gas turbines, oil interceptors
fitted to the site drainage system and effluent treatrnent facilities to treat wastewater prior to
discharge. As a result, the power plant is designed to meet high enviromnental standards and
comply with the emission limits of the Arab Republic of Egypt and the World Bank.
4.    ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVES
4.1   Current Situation ('No Action"s Option)
The no action altemative to the proposed Kuarynat ISCC power plant would result in the
demand for electricity exceeding supply, with an increasing dcficit as demand increases in the
future. Hence the lack of a secure and reliable electricity generation and supply system, would
have significant social, economic and environmental implications including constraining
existing and future economic development and restricting socio-economic development. As a

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
result, the "no action" option is not considered to be a viable or acceptable alternative to the
proposed project.
4.2   Alternative Technologies and Fuels
On the basis of security of supply, response to demand and economic advantages, the Mlinistrv
of Electricity & Energy with its affiliate New and Renewable Energy Authority (NREA) have
specified that the Kuarymat ISCC project should be an integrated solar gas/oil-fired combined
cycle plant of 150 MWe nominal generating capacity. The NREA's rationale for choosing this
technology in preference to other electricity generating technologies as follows:
*  The parabolic trough distributed collector system is selected. More proved technology
to be used for the first time in Egypt. It is the major type utilized today of linear
concentrating system.
*  The system is commercially available from several suppliers.
*  The higher concentration ratio of this system compared to lower temperature systems
leads to higher temperatures and higher efficiencies.
*  No significant advers environmental impacts are predicted to occur with this system
compared to potential localized environmental changes associated with heliostat fields.
*  Accidental spills or potential leakages of the thermal fluid are manageable.
*  Water use for mirror washing and cleaning is very limited and the resulting water
drains are controllable.
*  Existing and planned generating capacity using gas/oil-fired steam units is already
considered sufficient and further reliance on this particular technology is not preferred
for reasons of security of supply, response to demand and economics.
*  An existing labor force is available which is competent in the construction, operation
and maintenance of combined cycle units, whilst experience in other technologies are
more limited. Hence, the selection of combined cycle units alloxws greater local
employment benefits to be obtained and should be economically advantageous.
Hence, the technology chosen for the project is an integrated solar combined cycle syslem.
Natural gas has been selected as the main fuel for the power plant and compared to other
fossil fuels generating technologies, gas-fired combustion turbine generators have one of the
lowest emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and
particulates.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
43    Power Plant Design
There are a wide variety of potential designs for the proposed power plant. On the basis of the
most proven solar thermal technology for the solar field and the key design features selected
for the power plant, together with the adoption of general good practices within its overall
design and layout, fuel and chemical storage facilities and pollution monitoring equipment,
the power plant minimizes its potential impacts on the environment whilst ensuring safe,
secure and efficient operation. Key aspects of the design, which have been compared with
alternatives, are as follows:
*  Parabolic trough distributed collector system is selected for the solar field, where no
pignificant adverse environmental impacts are predicted to occur with this system
compared to potential localized environmental changes associated with heliostat fields.
*  the stack has been designed to maximize buoyancy and dispresion of emissions and its
height meets good engineering practice;
*  the gas turbines will be equipped with low NOx combustors, minimizing emissions of
NOx which is the key pollutant associated with combustion of natural gas;
*  closed circuit cooling water will be used to maintain generating efficiency within a
relatively good order. Alternatives such as air cooled condensers (open, whilst using
lcss water, result in lower generating efficiencies). The potential for visible vapour
plumes or ground fogging is acceptable since prevailing wind in the NS and NE
directions and the site is about 1.2 km distant from the road. Noise level will decrease
to acceptable level at the power plant boundary and visual impacts will be
accommodated within the wider landscape surrounding the site. The avaibility of water
is not considered an issue for this project given the use of water from the Nile river or
the underlying aquifer;
*  cooling water will be supplied from a sustainable water supply, namely the Nile river
or the underground aquifer, and the intake structures can be constructed and operated
without significant impacts.
4.4   Alternative Sites
The NREA designated the proposed Kuarnmat site for power plant construction from a group
of four alternative sites, namely: Red Sea coast, Sinai Peninsula, West Desert and Kuraymat.
The site area was allocated to NREA by the Government of Egypt. In selecting the required
site, consideration was given to the following criteria:

Economic Factors:
*  capital costs;
*  operation and maintenance costs;
*  requirement for natural gas;
*  requirement for cooling and service water;
* demand loads for electricity. and
*  requirements for electricity transmission lines and sub-stations.
Aon-economic Factors:
* potential environmental impacts; and
* site development.
Following negotiations with the concerned authorities, the planned location of the Kuarymnat
power plant was found to be the most cost effective site for the following reasons:
* minimal additional infrastructure would be required;
* desirable benefits for development of the site area; and
* no workers' colony is required as a local workforce is available.
In addition, the power plant site will bring socio-economic benefits to the wider Kurayrnat
Region (i.e. south of Giza and North of Beni-sueif), through employment opportunities,
supply contracts and the effects of project expenditure within the local economy.
5.    KEY FINDINGS OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
5.1   Introduction
A thorough assessment of the impacts of the proposrd plant has heen caried out based on
information provided by NRAE, E&E and their sub-consultants. A combination of
quantitative and qualitative assessment techniques, ranging from computer modeling for air,
water, noise and traffic impacts to ecological and aquatic surveys and visual evaluation, have
been undertaken. The results of the assessment work have been compared with the
environmental standards set by the Govrnment of the Arab Republic of Egypt and the World
Bank, whichever is the more stringent.
The conclusions of the assessment are that (with suitable mitigation measures described in
Tables 2 and 3) the project is in compliance with the environmental requirements of both the
Government of Egypt and the World Bank with respect to stack emissions, ambient air
quality, discharge quality and noise. Table I provides a summary of anticipated impacts in
relation to the Egyptian and World Bank environmental guidelines for stack emissions,

ambient air quality, liquid effluent and noise. The following discussion highlights some of the
key considerations and results of the assessment.
5.2   Air Quality
Construction Dust
Construction activities will result in locally high levels of dust however no residential
receptors or sensitive environments lie in the imrnmediate boundaries of the power plant.
Existing concentrations of airborne dust are already high in this area. Potential impacts from
dust emissions on site will be significantly reduced by careful management and the
implementation of mitigation measures to reduce dust generalion
Stack Emissions
The power plant will burn natural gas as its primary fuel. As a result, the principle pollutant
during normal operation will be NOx. During emergency operation ( and for not more than
2% of operating time ), the burning of light fuel oil (sollar) will result in emissions of
particulate matter and SO2 along with trace amounts of other pollutants. Emissions from the
plant will meet Egyptian and World Bank Guidelines.
In order to analyze the potential impacts of the plant's emissions during normal operation
(firing gas) on ambient air quality in the project area, dispersion modeling has been
undertaken.

New & Renewable Energy Autority (NREA)         150 MWe Kuraymat Integrated Solar C.C. Project
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
The assessment indicates that maximum 1 -hour ground level concentrations of NOZ (Lhe key
pollutant) from the ISCC-KPP, are predicted to occur on about 145° at a distance of 430 m
from the power house site. The majority of 24-hour maximum impact areas due to the
operation of the two ISCC Kua2rymat gas turbine units occurred between 1500 and 160° at a
distance between 500 and 550 m. The highest value of these both maximum values, including
background level, didn't exceed 55% of the corresponding national permissible limits. The
majority of the 24-hour maximum combined impact areas due to the operation of both
Kuraymat power plants (existing thermal power plant including its proposed extension and the
proposed ISCC-KPP) occurred at SWW direction to the plant at distances between 2400 m
and 2500 m. The highest impact area is at SWW direction about 2450 m from the origin of the
modeling grid network (i.e. the power house of the proposed ISCC-KPP). The maximum 1-
hour impact levels are very similar among the same years of meteorological data considered.
The majority of the maximum impact areas occurred far from the site boundary to the SWW
of the plant at a distance of about 2580 m from the origin of the modeling grid network. The
results further indicated that the maximum combined impact area for each of the five years
considered all occurred at the samne location. The maximum combined concentrations reached
at these locations, including background level, didn't exceed 74% of the national permissible
limits and their monitoring will be the responsibility of the Upper Egypt Electricity Production
Company (UEEPC) which operates existing Kurymat thermal power plant and already owns a
fully operational monitoring system. It is quite obvious that for the ISCC-KPP, the maximum
concentrations reached expressed as an annual mean and daily mean concentrations, and
shown in Table 1, are a relatively small fraction of the value required to equal that which
cause an exceedence of either World Bank or Egyptian guidelines.
5.3   Aquatic Environment
Cooling water and process water for power plant operation will be drawn from the Nile river
or the underground aquifer via an intake structure. Potable water will be supplied to the power
plant via same source. Waste cooling water will be treated before discharge to a nearby
drainage basin/wadi or a ground well. Also, process water will be disposed of after treatment
via the same discharge pathway. Sanitary waste water will be treated and re-used for the plant
plantation irrigation program. No ground water or other surface water will be used during
power plant construction and operation. The key potential impacts of the power plant on the
aquatic environment will therefore be limited impacts to the aquatic flora and fauna during
power plant construction and operation.
The aquatic environment surrounding the project site is characterized by generally fair water
quality. The aquatic flora is characterized by poor biodiversity and no sensitive ecosystems.
No commercial fishing and no artisanal fishing occurs in the vicinity of the project.
During construction of the power plant dredging and construction of the intake structures-if
water decided to be abstracted from the Nile river- could lead to potential impacts on physical
aquagraphy, water quality and removal of, or disturbance to, aquatic habitats, flora and fauna.
Given that the area of impact is very localised, losses are in many cases temporary and field

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
survey data available do not indicate significant or sensitive habitats, the impacts of power
plant construction on the aquatic environment are not considered to be significant In
addition,, good site management and engineering practices during construction will ensure
that any residual impacts are reduced to a minimum.
Power plant operation will result in a heated blow down water from cooling towers being
discharged after treatment into the ambient environment. Process water will, also, be disposed
of the same way. All discharges of process water will be treated prior to discharge to ensure
that the Egyptian and World Bank waste water quality guidelines are met. Treatment includes
neutralisation, oil separation, and filtration. Effects on ambient water quality will be further
reduced through implementation of good site management practies including adequate site
drainage.
Physical aquagraphy, Nile bank access, fishing and navigation are not predictcd to be
significantly affected by the presence of the intake structures.
5.4   Noise Impacts
The construction of the Kuarymat integrated solar thennal combined cycle power plant is
expected to generate a maximum noise level of <60 dB(A) during the day at the fence of the
power plant and <55 dB(A) at night. These worst-case construction noisr level are both within
Egyptian and World Bank(') guidelines, and for most of the construction period, the noise
levels will be lower than these values. There are no residential or sensitive receptors within
0.5 km of the plant.
Construction traffic on local roads will also generate additional noise, however noise levels on
local roads predicted for peak construction activity (during 2005/2006) is expected to be only
0.3dB(A) above arnbient levels. This magnitude of increase is generally not perceptible to the
human ear, consequently no construction traffic impacts are predicted.
The potential noise emissions from the Kuarymat ISCC plant during operation have been
modeled to provide noise contours in the area around the site. The predicted opertaional noise
levels at the site boundary and at all receptors are below the Egyptian and World Bank
guidelines during daytime and nigh-time.
5.5   Flora and Fauna
No areas protected for their conservation value are located on, or in the vicinity of, the project
area. The proposed site itself and the majority of surrounding land is poorly vegetated (desert)
with no much of the area having been distrbed by urban developments. Given that the
(1) There are no World Bank Guidelincs for construction noise, therefore Operational noise guidelines are
applied here.

potential impacts of construction and operation on power plant area likely to be localized, and
good site management practices will be implemented, no significant effects are predicted.
5.6   Land Use, Landscape and 'Visual Impacts
The land use at the project site is un-used, infertile land. The loss of this land to the power
plant development is therefore not significant.
The surrounding land use is generally industrial and commercial. As the land is not urbanized
with limited vegetation, all existing views will be in significantly infuenced by the power
plant and given the surrounding industrial context, due to the existence of the present
Kuraymat thermal power plant and enormous number of scattered lime quarries, the visual
intrsion of the power plant will be minimal.
Visual impacts of the power plant from the residential community to the west of the proposed
plant site are also not expected to be significant given the orientation of the apartments. The
potential landscape and visual impacts of the project are therefore expected to be minor and
not significant.
5.7   Soils, Geology and Hy.drology
Due to the characteristics of the soils and geology of the site, in particular the lack of any
sensitive features, and the mitigation measures proposed as part of the construction and
operation of the power plant, no significant impacts are predicted to occur. In addition,,
geotechnical investigations confinned the site as being uncontaminated.
5.8   Trafric
The assessment of traffic and transport covers the changes in traffic conditions in terms of
delay and congestion during construction and operation.
The greatest potential for traffic impacts to occur arises during a short period at peak
construction. There is some potential for increased congestion on the main roads to the power
plant, however the impacts will only occur during the peak construction phase and during
peak hours. The overall impact is therefore predicted to be insignificant. Mitigation measures
will be put in place to reduce the potential for impacts to arise.
During operation, a small number of workers and HGVs are associated with operating the
power plant and no impacts are predicted to occur.

5.9   Socio-economics and Soico-cultural effects
It is anticipated that the power plant will provide a net positive socio-economic impact
through the provision of emplovment opportunities and attraction of economic investmncnt into
the area. In addition., the use of local labor (95% during construction), will maximize these
positive impacts ihrough the development of the local skill base and will also generate
increased demand for local services, materials and products.
5.10  Archaeology, Historical and Cultural Heritage
No available information was found which identified any archaeological, historic or cultural
remains on the site or in the surrounding area. Consequenily, no impact is predicted to occur
on any known archaeological, historic or cultural resources.
N REA have incorporated mitigation measures into the construction program to ensure that
any potential finds of significance are recorded and are accorded the required protection in
consultation with the Competent Administrative Authority
5.11  Natural Disaster Risks
An assessment of the risks to the power plant from seismic activity has concluded that given
the engineering measures incorporated into the design of the power plant, the potential
environmental impacts of a seismic event during power plant operation are not anticipated to
be significant.
The risks of flooding during power plant construction and operation were also examined.
However, site drainage will be constructed to minimize any risks of contarninted water
reaching the surroundings, no significant flood risk impacts are anticipated.
5.12  Major Accident Hazards
Given the land uses surrounding the proposed Kuarymat ISCC power plant site and the
measures incorporated into the design of the plant to minimize [he risk from fire and
explosion, the plant is not anticipated to pose a potential risk of any significance to any third
party facilities.
5.13 Solid Waste M1anagement
The management of wastes during construction and operation of the powr plant will include
mitigation measures to collect and store waste on-site, record all consignment. of hazardous

or contaminated waste for disposal and pefriodically audit waste contractors and disposal sites
to ensure that disposal is undertaken in a safe and envirom-nentally acceptable manner.
During both construction and operation, all wastes including general waste, packaging waste,
commercial wastes, raw-water pre- treatment sludge, tank sludge and interceptor sludge will
be disposed of by licensed waste contractors.
Solid waste management is not predicted to cause any significant impacts.
5.14  Occupational Health and Safetv
With the provision of a high standard of health and safety management on site, construction
and operation of the power plant in accordance with good industry practice, the occupational
health and safety risks associated with construction and operation of the power plant will be
minimized and are not significant.
5.15  Associated Infrastructure
Connections to existing gas and electrical facilities will be the responsibility of GASCO and
the N REA respectively. In regard to the gas connection with the gas reducing station of the
site no environmental or social impacts are anticipated.
Connection switchyard will connect the plant to the 220/500 kV substation already existed to
the immediate west of the site at the present Kuraymnat thernal power location. No significant
impacts are anticipated.
6.    ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT AND MIONITORINGG-
THE ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION PLAN (EAP)
The En% ironmental Action Plan (EAP) includes mitigation measures, design of monitoring
programs where appropriate, and specification of management measures (including
institutional responsibility and training requirements).
The key features of the EAP relate to air quality, aquatic discharge and implementation of
good site management practice. The EAP is summarized in Tables 2 and 3 which relate to
construction and operational phases respectively.

7.    PUBLIC CONSULTATION AND DISCLOSURE
Public consultation has been carried out according to the WB/IFC guidelines and the EEAA
regulations which require coordination with other govemrnment agencies involved in the EIA,
obtaining views of local people and affected groups. This coordination based on discussions
with local stakeholders and interested parties during prepation of the environmental
documents for local permnitting requirements as well as discussions with local stakeholders
during scoping and preparation of the ElA. However, Public Consultation and Disclosure Plan
(PCDP) for the project is prepared to be implemented. This PCDP is defined in accordance
with IFC guidelines. In addition to discussions mentioned above, the main elements of public
consultation and disclosure include:
*  press advertisements describing the project and inviting interested parties to attend the
public meeting and review the Draft Final EIA Report;
*  the organization of a Public Meeting in the Giza Govemorate with the full
involvement of the Govemor;
*  preparation of this non-technical summary in Arabic, describing the project, its
potential environmental impacts and the measures to address them and disclosure of
this document, together with disclosure of the ETA report locally in NREA and/or Giza
for 60 days; and
* on-going consultation through an "open-door" policy during construction and
operation of the pos-er plant.
The process and results of the public consultation activities held to date are docwnented in the
ETA, Chapter 9 and Annex A.
A number of environmental concerns were raised during consultation activities undertaken.
The concems raised included:
* the potential for additional pollution problems in the Giza southern zone as a result of
the power plant discharge;
* compliance with air quality standards and the effect that non-compliance and
subsequent plant closure could have on security of employment in the area;
* underlying concern regarding compliance with environmental regulations, and
* the potential impacts of the power plant on the local industrial and commercial
activities as well as tourism.
These issues have been taken into account and addressed in the ETA through assessment and
the inclusion of mitigation, management and monitoring requirements which are detailed
within the EAP.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 BACKGROUND
1.1.1 The Power Plant
The New and Renewable Energy Authority (NREA) proposes to construct and operate an
Integrated Solar Combined Cycle (ISCC) Power Plant at Kuraymat. The site is within an existing
fenced area of uncultivated land in the eastern desert about 2 km distant from the Nile river at the
kuraymat area in the southern part of Giza Governorate, approximately 95 km south of Cairo and
30 km north of Beni-sueif and about 750 m east of the existing residential community of the
present Kuraymat thermal power plant. The overall proposed site area is approximately
2,772,000m2.
The proposed power facility will consist of an integrated solar combined cycle power plant
consists of a solar field and a combined cycle power block. Solar field basically composed of
parabolic trough collectors and Heat Transfer Fluid (HTF) heat exchangers to generate steam.
Combined cycle block mainly consist of two industrial heavy-duty type gas turbines (GT) each
with a nominal electricity generation capacity of around 43 MWe at ISO conditions, unfired Heat
Recovery Steam Generators (HRSGs) and steam turbine generator (STG) sized to match the
maximum steam output from HRSGs and solar steam generator with capacity rated at about 67
MWe. The overall generating capacity of the power plant will be 15OMWe. The power plant is
intended to be fully operational by the year 2007.
The power plant will utilize natural gas as its primary fuel, and also have the capability to operate
using sollar (fuel oil # 2). The ability to "dual-fuel" the power plant (with natural gas or sollar)
will provide security of electricity supply in the event that gas supplies are unavailable for any
reason.
1.1.2 The Proposed Site
The proposed ISCC Kuraymat power plant site is located within 660 Feddans (i.e. 2,772,000 mi2)
fenced uncultivated compound, which also does not contain any structure or activity, around 95
km south of Cairo. The site is surrounded by desert land and agricultural and residential
properties. The Nile river is located to the west of the site area at an average distance of 2 km
from the site boundaries.
The site of the proposed power plant is shown on Figure 1-1.
1.1.3 Fuel Supply
Natural gas will be delivered to the power plant by GASCO via an existing underground gas
pipeline passes through the immediate north of the site boundary and supplying gas to the

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
Existing Kuraymat power plant from Suez region. The pipeline will link the power plant with
a pressure reducing station within the northern part of the site land.
1.1.4 Water Supply and Cooling
The power plant will incorporate a closed circuit cooling system using water abstracted from
the Nile River. The abstracted water will also be used following pre-treatment
demineralization, to provide process water make-up in the HRSG systems. Potable water
supplies as well as other service waters will also be drawn from this water after treatment to
support the plant water requirements.
The main demand for water is due to the closed circuit system. The use of a closed circuit
cooling system minimizes the capital cost and maintains the electrical efficiency of the power
plant at a good level. Only make-up water will be required to compensate water losses.
Evaporative cooling towers are required; hence there is opportunity for water drift and the
formation of visible plumes of water vapor and ground fogging.
To provide the make-up and service water, a pumping facility will be constructed on the Nile
intake, the water will be abstract from the Nile river underground pipelines will be extended
from the site across the bank line and out into the Nile river.
1.1.5 Electricity Supply and Transmission
The electricity generated by the proposed power plant will be exported via the 500 kV
electricity transmission system of the existing Kuraymat power plant. The power plant will be
connected to the 220/500 kV switchyard via step-up transformers. A 220 kV switchyard is
proposed for the power evacuation considering the size of the power plant and the existing
220 kV/500 kV substation at a distance of about 2 km from the project site in the nearby
steam power plant. A 220 kV switchyard will be located in the ISCC-KPP. Interconnection of
this switchyard with the nearby switchyard at the existing thermal power plant, and providing
additional outgoing line feeder for evacuating the power, if required, is to be decided in the
course of further engineering in consultation with the concerned authorities. The generated
power will be evacuated to the national grid via an overhead transmission line. The 500 kV
lines are tied to Cairo via two single circuit overhead lines.
1.1.6 Access
The direct route to be taken to the site from Cairo starts with the Cairo/Beni-sueif road. This
main road passes through Tebbin and Es-Saff leading to the Kuraymat site. There is another

Path which is around 60 km longer than the previous one. This path starts from Giza to El
Badrashein, then to El-Ayyat, El-Wasta and finally Beni-sueif via Upper Egypt agriculture
road along the west bank of the Nile River. From Beni-sueif, it crosses the Nile to the east
bank and then follows Beni-sueif desert road 30 km to the north till the main entrance of the
power plant. This path could be used as an alternative road only when Beni-sueif road is
blocked for traffic.
The power plant has access from the Cairo/Beni-sueif Road from the west. A second access to
the site is available from Beni-sueif Cairo Road from the west too. Third access road to the
site is available from suez and El-Soukhna ports, direct to Zafarana and then to kuraymat site
1.2 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF THE PROJECT
1.2.1 Requirement for an Environmental Impact Assessment (ELA)
The Guidelines for Egyptian Environmental Impact Assessment published by the Egyptian
Environmental Affairs Agency (EEAA) specify that a " ... thermal power plant with a capacity
greater than 30MTWe" falls within the category of "Black List Projects" which, due to their
potential and substantial environmental impacts, must submit a full EIA to the Competent
Administrative Authority (CAA) (the Govemorate of Giza) in order to obtain permission for
development.
1.2.2   The EIA Report
This Environmental Impact Assessment Report (EIA Report) presents the findings of an
assessment of the likely environmental impacts associated with the construction and operation
of the power plant and associated cooling water infrastructure. The EIA report has been
prepared to accompany the applications for consents from the Egyptian Government and local
authorities to construct and operate the power plant.
1.2.3   Specified Information
The Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency (EEAA) has published guidelines which require
that certain information is provided in an ETA report (i.e. specified information).
Table 1-1 summarizes the required content of the EIA report which is indicated by the EEAA
guidelines, and establishes where the information is provided within the EIA report. For

ISSUES
The environmental policy, legal and administrative framework which is relevant to ihe
permitting of the power plant comprises the following
* Requirement to conduct an EIA to accompany the development of the power plant;
* Regional development planning, which must be addressed in the development of the power
plant, in particular-
-  land use planning and control;
- siting;
-  protection of environmentally sensitive areas;
-  protection of endanyered species.
* Environmental standards which must be considered in the design, layout, construction and
operation of the power plant, including:

- emissions to air,
- generation and disposal of liquid effluents including cooling water;
- generation and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes;
- ambient environmental quality;
- health and safety.
Each of these aspects is reviewed in the following sections. In each case both Egyptian and
Intemational Fin3nce Corporation (IFC) / World Bank (WB) standards and guidelines are
considered, to reflect the relevant national requirements and those which may be expected
from international financial institutions.
2.3   REQUIREMNIENT FOR AN EIA
2.3.1  Egyptian Requirementforan EIA
The development of a new power plant can only commence if a permit has been granted by
the appropriate Competent Administrative Authonrt) (CAA). Egyptian Law 4 of 1994, Lawfor
the Environment (hereinafter referred to as Law 4) stipulates that applications for a license
from an individuals company, organization or authority, subject to certain conditions, require
an assessment of the likely environmental impacts.
The Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency (EEAA) is the authorit) responsible for
determining the type of development that requires an environmental appraisal and the level of
detail at which the study should be conducted. The EEAA publication Guidelines for EgDptian
Environmental Impact Assessment stipulates that ....... thermal power plant with a capacith
greater than 30 MWe" falls within the category of "Black Listed Projects". This category
requires a full E1 A to be submitted to both the Competent Administrative Authority (CAA)
(which, for thermal power plants, is the Egyptian Electricity Holding Company (EEl-C) of the
Ministry of Electriciry & Energy) and the Licensing Authority (Which, for such type of project
in the designated area, is the Giza Govemorate) in support of any application for a permit to
develop a power plant).
Since the proposed power plant has a nominal generating capacity of 150 MWe, a full ETA
must be prepared and submitted to the Giza Governorate and EEHC for consideration prior to
development of the plant.
2.3.2 IFC /   'orld Bank (WB) Requirement for an E1A
The IFC follows a policy which stipulates that all operations are carried out in an
environmentally responsible manner and that projects must comply with appropriate IFC
guidelines or, if these have not been specifically de% eloped. World Bank guidelines.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
The WVorld Bank sets out its procedures and policies with regard to conducting environmental
assessment in Operational Directive 4.01: Environmental Assessment (October 1991). Annex
E of the Directive identifies the process by which the level of investigation required in the
environmental assessment is determnined. It provides an illustrative list of Category "A"
developments which require a full EIA, which includes thermal and hydro pov% er projects.
Accordingly, if WB funding is sought, a full ELA for the power plant following World Bank
L-uidelines must be conducted and submitted to the WB for consideration as part of any
application for funding.
Other international banks and financing institutions also follow a similar approach and use the
IFC I World Bank guidelines as a benchmark for the environmental assessment of
intemational power projects prior to provision of finance. Hence, an ELA of similar scope is
likely to be required to obtain commercial funding for the po%%er plant from international
institutions.
2.4 SCOPE OF THE EIA
The Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency (EEAA) has published guidelines which require
that certain information is provided in an EIA report (i.e. specified infornation).
Table I-1 summarizes the required content of the EIA report which is indicated by the EEAA
guidelines. and establishes where the information is provf ided within the EIA report. For
information purposes, Table 1-J also includes the equivalent requirements for an EIA report
from the World Bank.
The requirements for the scope of the EIA under Egyptian and IFC procedures, as
described in Section 1.2, include the following:
* description of the proposed power plant;
* description of the baseline environment at the site;
* identification of the environmental standards which will be applied to the project, including
those applying to protection of ambient environmental quality and specific conditions on
the construction and operation of the power plant;
* identification of potential environmental impacts associated with the project:
* description of alternatives to the power plant, in terms of options for electricity supply in
Egypt, design of the power plant and operating systems;
* development of proposals for mitigation and management of any potential environm-
ental impacts;

* description of monitoring plans proposed to provide surveillance of the environrin-
ental impacts of the power plant during construction or operation; and
* demonstration that consultations with interested parties have been caried out as part of the
EIA process.
In addition, both Egyptian and IFC/World Bank guidelines specify the broad organization of
the ElA report, requirement for a non-technical summary for local, especially public,
information and clear referencing of sources of data used in the assessment.
2.5   REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLANNING
The guidelines for EIA produced by the EEAA specify that the power plant should
demonstrate compliance with national regional and local development plans with respect to
the follo % ins' key aspects:
* Land use planning and control: a new industrial zone, and surrounding developments.
* Siting.
* Protection of environmentally sensitive areas.
* Protection of endangered species.
The proposed site lies on a land planned for development of power generation facilities by the
\ RE A within the Giza Govemorate, next to the present Kuraymat thermal power plant, at a
distance of about 2 km east of the thermal power plant site.
2.6 INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL
STANDARDS! GUIDELINES
2.6.1 Introduction
The Egyptian and IFC/World Bank environmental standards and guidelines relevant to the
construction and operation of the power station cover the following issues:
* Atmospheric emissions and ambient air quality.
* Liquid effluent discharges to the Nile River environment.
* Noise emissions and ambient noise levels.
* Solid waste management.
* Solid hazardous waste management.
* Operation management: health and safety, air quality and noise levels.
* Construction management.
* Other environmental manaivement issues.
The Egyptian standards have been drawn from the range of provisions in Law 4 and the Primne
Minister's Decree No. 338 of 1995, which promulgate the Executive Regldutions ofLaw 4, as

well as in the Law 48 of 1982 regarding the protection of the River Nile and waterways from
pollution and its Implementary Regutlations.
The IFC guidelines have been taken from the IFC Pollution Prev,ention and Abatement
Handbook - Part III (July, 1998). Supplementary to the guidelines set out in the IFC Pollurion
Prevention and Abatement Handbook, reference has also been made to the World Bank
guidelines as set out in the World Bank Environment, Health and Safety Guidelines: Thlermnal
Power Plants (I1994).
2.6.2 Atmospheric Emissions and Ambient Air QualitN
The Egyptian Government and [FC.AU'orld Bank have established ambient air quality
standards applicable to power projects. The Egyptian standards and the IFCIWB guidelines on
ambient air qua lItr are shown in Table 2-2.

Notes:
(a) The Egyptian regulations for fuel burning sources (Law 4, Article 42) do not specifically state
whether emission limits refer to emission under standard or actual flow conditions. For
consistency with other standards it has been assumed that the limits refer to standards flow
conditions.
(b)lFCOWB guidelines for gas turbines differ than those for steam ones, whether the Egyptian
standards are the same for both kinds of turbines. These guidelines should be achieved for 95%
of the operating time of a plant.
(c) Total S02 emissions from the power plant must not exceed 118 tone per day, calculated by WB
approach of allowing 0.2 tpd per MWe for first 500 MWe and 01 tpd per MWe for each
subsequent MWe. If two or more power plants are operating in the same airshed then the
combined S02 emissions must not exceed 500 tpd.
(d) Law 4, Article 42 states that emissions of suspended ashes in urban I residential areas should
not exceed Ringlemann Chart 1, which Article 42 states is equivalent to an emission
concentration of 250 mg/m3.
(e) Law 4, Article 42 states that emissions of suspended particles far from inhabited areas should
not exceed Ringlemann Chart 2, which Article 42 states is equivalent to an emission
concentration of 500 mg/m3.
Law 4 also applies specific conditions to the buming of fuels in power plants, as follows:
* Fuel / air mixtures and the combustion process should provide full burning of the fuel.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
* The use of mazout and heavy oil is prohibited in residential areas.
* The Sulfur content of fuels is restricted to equal or less than 1.5% in or near urban and
residential areas. The use of high Sulfur content fuels is permissible in regions far from
inhabited urban areas provided that suitable atmospheric factors are present and adequate
distances are observed to prevent these gasses from reaching residential and 3gricultural
areas and watercourses.
* Emissions of carbon dioxide should be through stacks of sufficient height to ensure that the
gases are dispersed before reaching ground level.
* Stack height should reflect the volumetric flow of flue gases. Law 4 states thal for emission
rates of 7.000-15.000kg hri the stack height should be between 18-36m. Ii emission rates
exceed 1.00W kg hr', then the stack heizhl should be at least 2.5 times the height of
surraunding buildings.
IFC W B guidelines reinforce the Eg-ptian requirement of minimum stack heights by requiring
plants to use stack heights not less than the Good Engineering Practice(1) values unless impact
analysis has taken into account building downwash effects.
2.6.3  Liquid Emuent Discharges
Law 4 states that all establishments are prohibited from polluting the marine enviromnent.
Subsequently, no permit will be granted for an establishment on, or near, the coastline, which
may result in discharges of pollutinlg substances.
Annex I of the Executive Regulaiions of Law 4 sets out the Eg)ptian standards
concerning the concentration of pollutants in effluent discharged to the marine
environment. A selection of the standards, relevant to thermal power plants, is shown in
Table 2-4. In addition. the table also presents the equivalent World Bank guidelines. It
should be noted that WB guidelines relate to all liquid effluent discharges. not solely to
those to the marine environment.
Decree No. 8 of 1983 promulgating the Implementary Regulations of the Law 48 of 1982
regarding the protection of the River Nile and uaterways from pollution provides the
standards set by the Ministry of Health for permits to discharge treated industrial liquid
cffluents into the fresh water bodies and groundwater reservoirs (Article 61). Table 2-4
also presents these standards.
(1) US Code Or Federal Regulations Title 40, Part 51.100. Good Engineering Practice Stack Height = H + 1.5 L
where H is the height of nearby strutures and L is the lcsser dimension of height or projected width of nc3rb%

* Any measures which are likely to cause changes in the natural coastlinc (erosion.
sedimentation, coastal currents and pollution from the project or associated works) are
restricted, except with the approval of the CAA.

2.6.4  Noise Emissions and Ambient Noise Levels
Law 4 stipulates that a Owner must ensure that an establishment is compatible with the
character of its setting. Amongst other issues, this involves limiting the effect of combined
noise from all site sources on the surrounding environment to acceptable ambient limits.
Guidance levels for ambient noise is dependent upon the land use surrounding the site, and
Egyptian ambient noise guidelines are set with respect to five different land use categories.
The Egyptian ambient noise guidelines are shown in Table 2-5, together w ith the related land
uses.
The IFC'WB ambient noise guidelines differ from those of the Eg)ptian Government in that
they only differentiate between two land use categories, as presented in Table 2-6.

2.6.5  Solid and Hazardous Waste Management
Law 4 stipulates that handling of hazardous substances and waste is prohibited unless a permit
has been issued by the competent authonity.
The handler of wastes must:
* possess a permit issued by the appropriate CAA to handle wastes;
* store and dispose of wastes in designated sites agreed with the CAA;
* maintain appropriate systems of storage, including packaging and labeling, containers and
storage duration;
* operate appropriate transportation systems to authorized disposal sites;
* maintain a register of all hazardous wastes and disposal methods; and
* develop an energency plan in case of spillages.
Further to the Egyptian guidelines, the World Bank requires that the individual I company
operating the power plant must ensure that:
* all hazardous materials are stored in clearly labeled containers;
 storage and handling of hazardous materials is in accordance with national and local
regulations appropriate to their hazard characteristics; and

fire prevention systems and secondary containment should be provided for storage
facilities, where necessary, to prevent fires or the releases of hazardous materials to the
environment.
2.6.6 Occupational Environmental Management and Health & Safety
IWorkplace Air Quality, Temperature and Humidity
Egyptian regulations require that the owner of the power plant must ensure that air quality in
the workplace is maintained within fixed limits. Accordingly, the owner is obliged to ensure
the protection of the work force lhrough implementing healthl and safety measures on-site,
including by the choice of plant and equipment. process substances. types of fuels, ventilation
of working areas or other air cleaning methods.
The IFC/World Bank requires thaT any individual / company -nanagling or operating a power
plant must:
* conduct periodic monitoring of the workplace air quality with respect to air contaminants
relevant to employees tasks;
* maintain ventilation and air contaminant control, and provide protective respiratory and air
quality monitoring equipment; and
* ensure that protective respiratory equipment is used by employees when levels of welding
fumes, solvents and other materials exceed international, national or local accepted
standards.
Egyptian and [FC/World Bank threshold limit values for carbon monoxide. nitrogen dioxide,
sulfur dioxide and particulate in the workplace are provided in Table 2- 7.
In addition to air quality, under Law 4, the owner of the power plant must also ensure that
temperature does not exceed maximum and minimum permissible limits, as set out in
Table 2-8. In case of work in temperatures outside these limits, the owner must provide
suitable acclimatization to workers and/or protective measures.

on regular based measurements.
Law 4 also stipulates that the owner of the power plant should maintain an Environmental
Register of written records with respect to the environmental impacts from the establishment.
The written records should identify the characteristics of discharges and emissions, details of
periodic tecting and its results, procedures of follo%%-up environmental safety, and the name of
the person in charge of follow-up. The owner of the power plant, or its representatives, are
responsible for informing the EEAA of any emitted or discharged pollutants deviating from
prescribed standards and any appropriate procedures taken to rectify them.
Also, the IFCAVB guidelines require the operator monitors tile site in order to optimize
performance. Direct measurement of .ltmospheric concentrations of particulate matter, NOx
and S02 and heavy metals in the exhaust emissions is preferable. A:veraging times for direct
emissions should be based on an hourly rolling, avcrage.
The IFCAV1B guidance requires ambient air quality to be monitored at least at 3 locations
where there is: a) least pollution expected; b) maximum pollution concentration expected; and
c) sensitive receptors. The ambient air quality parameters that require monitoring for gas fired
plants arc NOx, SO2 and PM10.

3. ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVES
3.1 CURRENT SITUATION ("NO ACTIONt" OPTION)
3.1.1 Electricity Demand
Egypt has a rapidly expanding economy that is dependent on the availability of reliable
and low cost electric power. The annual average rate of growth of electricity demand in
Egypt is expected to range between 6.5-7.5% during this decade. Peak demand is
expected to rise from 14,400 MWe in 2003 to 22,000 MWe by 2010 and installed
capacity is expected to increase from 17,750 MWe to 25,000 MWe during the same
period.
In 2003, about 98.5% of the population was served by the Egyptian electricity grid. Of
total demand of 88 TWh on the interconnected system, about 17% was met by
hydropower, principally the High Dam and Aswan 1 & 2, and the remaining was met
with thermal plants, of which 90% were supplied from natural gas and 10% heavy oil.
The rate of growth in demand for electricity is forecasted to continue at the aforementioned
level before gradually decreasing to a growth rate of 5.7% per year over the subsequent 10
years.
In order to meet the forecasted demand, the Ministry of Electricity & Energy (MEE) estimates
that an additional 10,000 MWe of new generating capacity will be required during the next
12 years.
3.1.2 Electricity Generation and supply
The Ministry of Electricity & Energy (MEE) is responsible for all aspects of the power sector
in Egypt. The Egyptian Electricity Holding Company (EEHC) is responsible for power sector
administration. The Egyptian Electricity Transmission Company (EETC) is responsible for
ultra high voltage and high voltage transmission, system control and dispatching in Egypt and
export-import contracts of energy.
The EETC owns and operates the electricity transmission system, which consists of over
36,000 kIn of 500 kV, 220 kV, 132 kV, 66kV and 33 kV transmission lines. Further
developments of the transmission system is also planned.
In addition to EEHC, the power sector consists of a few IPPs selling to EETC: New and'
Renewable Energy Authority (NREA) Zafarana windfann and three privately-owned power
plants under Build, Own, Operate and Transfer (BOOT) financing schemes; and few IPPs
selling power in the isolated markets.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
3.1.3 Increased Need for Promoting Renewables for Power Generation
Earlier work by the New and Renewable Energy Authority, in cooperation with the World
Bank-UNDP Energy Sector Management Assistance Program, identified wind and solar as the
resources most likely to be economically exploitable for electricity production over the
medium term.
Egypt's resolve to increase use of renewables is driven in part by environmental
considerations, and in part by an interest in diversification of energy supply. The country has a
powerful interest in climate change mitigation since it stands to suffer severely in the event of
sea level rise by losing up to 20% of its inhabited area and is already affected adversely by
land loss phenomena in the Nile Delta's coastal fringes. The power sector also plays a role in
generating local air pollution though not as significantly as the transport and industrial sectors
due to maximizing the use of natural gas as a primary fuel. The recognition of the need to
maintain diverse energy sources remains important, given that Egypt is becoming increasingly
dependent on a local single source-gas-which also has export market potential. The country -
also sees renewables as an important potential industry worthy of development, and one which
plays well to its comparative advantage of a large, well educated and comparatively low-cost
workforce, and to its strong trade links throughout the Middle East and North African regions,
as well as Europe and United States.
Need for promoting renewables for power generation arises, also, from the social perspective
of energy within the context of sustainable development.
Energy is of vital importance to the satisfaction of basic needs. Energy services constitute a
sizable share of total household expenditure in developing countries such as Egypt. People
living in poverty spend a higher proportion of their income on energy.
The substitution of modern energy carriers would confer sizable gains in purchasing power on
poor urban households. Improvements in energy supply have considerable potential to reduce
poverty in all of its key dimensions, and to facilitate development.
Policies and programs that directly address the creation of opportunities for people living in
poverty to improve the level and quality of their energy services (by, for instance, shifting to'
higher quality energy carriers such as the ISCC project) will allow the poor to enjoy both
short-term and self-reinforcing long-term improvements in their standard of living.
Policies which provide a better balance between conventional sources and renewables and
efficiency improvements will have powerful direct, and indirect, influences on solving many
of the national or global issues such as poverty, climate change and sustainable development.
In fact, energy renewables, such as ISCC project, are an instrument for the achievement of
sustainable development.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
This conforms with Egypt's follow-up to the Johannesburg WSSD which underscored the
poverty alleviation benefits of energy by highlighting the merits of renewable energy and
calling for parties to:
take joint actions and improve efforts to work together at all levels to improve access to
reliable and affordable energy services for sustainable development..., bearing in mind that
access to energy facilitates the eradication of poverty. This would include actions at all levels
to .... improve access to reliable, affordable, economically viable, socially acceptable and
environmentally sound energy services and resources.
3.1.4 The "No Action" Option
The no action alternative will result in the demand for electricity exceeding supply, with an
increasing deficit as demand increases in future years. A lack of secure and reliable electricity
generation and supply system has significant social, economic and environmental
implications, since it will:
* constrain existing and future economic development and investment;
* restrict socio-economic development; and
* inhibit provision of public health and social services.
In addition, the no action alternative will result in inhibiting Egypt's ambitious program,
supported internationally by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and the World Bank.-
(WB), to promote the supply and use of renewable energy, and in retrogression of the national
efforts for combating climate change.
As a result, the "no action" option is not a viable or acceptable altemative to the proposed
project.
3.1.5 MEE's Generation Expansion Plan
The Ministry of Electricity & Energy (MEE) has established a generation expansion plan
which is intended to achieve the following:
* meet future demand for electricity,
* maintain and improve generation and transmission reliability, and
* introduce new technologies (fresh knowledge and modem know-how).
In adherence with this strategy, the MEE has identified the Kuraymat ISCC power project to
help implement its expansion in generation capacity. Hence, the proposed generation project.
is compatible and an essential component of the MEE generation growth plan to meet present..
and future demand for electricity.

3.1.6 Selection of the Proposed Technology
The MEE has an objective to provide a secure, reliable electricity generation and distribution
system for Egypt. A key element in meeting this objective is the establishment of a diversity
of technologies to avoid over-reliance on any particular technology, which may adversely
affect the ability to provide electricity or meet the fluctuations in demand which occur on a
daily basis or seasonally.
The MEE generation expansion plan includes provision of the following:
* gas/oil-fired steam units;
* gas/oil-fired combined cycle units;
* gas/oil-fired simple cycle combustion turbine units;
* pumped storage;
* wind farms; and
* hybrid solar-thermal generation.
Consistent with the plan, the NREA has specified that the Kuraymat power project should be
integrated solar thermal gas/oil-fired combined cycle power plant of 150 MWe. nominal..
generating capacity. The reasons for the selection of this technology are as follows:
* Existing and planned generating capacity using wind farms is already considered on
the run, given the greater commercial maturity of wind and the interest of bilateral
donors which permitted a more rapid build up of experience in developing wind farms.
* Further step forward in promoting diverse of energy sources is important for the future
of economic development of the country as well as the future diversification of
renewable energy sources.
* There must be room for the development of new energy forms that would compensate
for the finite nature of some types of existing energy supplies or would use
technologies in new ways to reduce harmful side effects of current energy production
or utilization. Energy diversification and GHGs minimization are relevant strategies.
* An existing labor force is available which is competent in the construction, operation
and maintenance of combined cycle units. Hence, the selection of combined -cycle
units, integrated with a solar field to generate more steam for the combined part of the
plant, allows greater local employment benefits to be obtained and should be
economically advantageous.
Hence, the technology chosen by the NREA for the project is an Integrated Solar Combined
Cycle system.

3.2 ALTERNATIVE DESIGNS OF THE POWN'ER PLANT
There are a wide variety of potential designs for the proposed power plant which considers
technical, economic and environmental issues. Key design features of the power plant that are
associated with environmental impacts are summarized in Tale 3-1.
On the basis of the key design features selected for the power plant summarized in Table 3-1,
together with general good practice included within its overall design and layout, fuel and
chemical storage facilities and pollution monitoring equipment as a whole, the power plant
offers a range of environmental benefits which minimizes its potential impacts on the
environment whilst ensuring safe, secure and efficient operation.
33    ALTERNATIV'E SITES
The NREA selected the ISCC project site for the power plant from a group of alternative sites:
* Zafarana;
* 6"' of October City;
* Borg El-Arab; and
* Kuraymat Desert.
The key criteria used in the evaluation of the altemative sites by the NREA were as follows:
* Economic factors:
-  capital costs;
-  operation and maintenance costs;
-  requirements for cooling water;
-  requirements for electricity transmission lines/sub-stations; and
-  Requirements for natural gas.
* non-economic factors:
- potential environrmental impacts;
- site development.
Table 3-2 provides with the conclusion of characteristics comparison and evaluation of
potential sits selected by NREA for the ISCC project.
The key findings of the consideration of altemative sites are summarized in Table 3-3. The
consideration of alternative sites by the NREA indicated that Kuraymat has no significant
disadvantages and has several beneficial aspects and desirable site development
characteristics. Therefore, Kuraymat was selected as the preferred site for the power plant.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
Item             Discussion of Alternatives                Selected Design
The heliostat field associated with a solar
thermal power plant could produce localized
changes in the net albedo, energy balance,
moisture-balance, low-level wind-flow
patterns, and air/surface temperatures. The
impact of such changes on microclimate
within and immediately surrounding the solar
thermal power plant remains to be adequately
assessed.
It is commonly stated that a major draw-back
of solar power plants is the extensive land
requirement. However, the amount of land
required for a solar plant is comparable to
what required by the system which provides
electricity from fossil fuels. While the area
requirements are comparable in the case of
fossil fuels, operation of the solar unit would
actually involve a more benign use of the
land.
However, it is claimed that heliostat fields
might disrupt the ecology of the area,
especially if located in desert areas. Although
this might be the case in certain locations, the
location of heliostat fields in some deserts
(e.g. in North Africa) would have beneficial
effects by creating centres of activities in
such barren areas, attracting, for example,
nomads to settle down near such centres.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
4.1.1 Site Location
The ISCC site is located next to the Kuraymat power plant (KPP) (Figure 4-2), a gas fired
steam power plant with 2 x 625 MW capacity which was installed during the l990's on the
eastern shore of the river Nile. Nearby a housing complex was built in year 1996 for the
staff of the IS CC KPP.
The buildings are not yet fully occupied. The next public tar-road is an interconnection
between the village of kuraymat and Beni Suef and crosses the area between the ISCC KPP
ground and the ground of the housing complex. The site is located to the eastern side of the
existing ISCC KPP. The land is owned by ministry of agriculture and is about 2.7 km2 area.
The site is an unused desert land.
4.1.2 Fuel Source
Natural gas is the main fuel source for this project. Gas pipeline supplying gas to ISCC KPP
which is running from the suez region to centers of use for further south of kuraymat runs
across the site from eastern side to north western side. Fuel for ISCC will be tapped from
this gas line.
Gas is available at a pressure of about 40 bar.
4.1.3 Water Source
Water source for plant will be from river Nile, which is about 2.5 km away from the eastern
side of the site.
4.1.4 Grid Interconnection
The evacuation of power is proposed at 66 kV voltage level. The 66 kV outgoing line from
the Power Plant sv6itchNard will be interconnected to the nearby 66 kV substation at a
distant of about 2 km and additional outgoing line to be planned for routing the power to the
other substations in consultation with the authorities.

4.2     DESIGN OF THE INTEGRATED SOLAR COMBINED CYCLE POWER
PLANT
4.1.5 Overview of the Power Plant Technology
An integrated solar combined cycle power plant consists of solar field and a
combined cycle power block. Solar field mainly consists of parabolic trough collectors
and Heat Transfer Fluid (HTF) heat exchangers to generate steam. Combined cycle
block mainly consists of Gas Turbines (GT), unfired Heat Recovery Steam Generator

cycle block by means of feeding the steam generated in the HTF heat exchanger
into the HRSG module for further super heating and then injecting into the steam
turbine along X%ith steam generated in the HRSG. Hence the overall efficiency of
the plant will be higher than the combined cycle power plant efficiency. Solar block
consists of Parabolic Trough collectors, HTF Heat exchangers, HTF pumps and its
associated piping, valves, fittings, etc. Combined cycle block consists of two (2) no. of
identical Gas Turbine Generators (GTG) with dedicated HRSG for each GTG feeding a
common Steam Turbine Generator (STG).

4.3 PROCESS DESCRIPTION
4.3.1 Electricitv Generation Process
The typical steps in the generating process at the power plant are illustrated on Figure 4-7,
and the key features are as follows.
General
A conventional combined cycle system generally is designed for the generation of 2/3 of the
total electricity output by the gas turbine and 1/3 by the steam turbine. The total efficiencies
achieved by modem combined cycle systems vary in the range from 50 to 55%, depending
mainly on the type of fuel and available source for cooling and on ambient temperature.
The Integrated Solar Combined Cycle (ISCC) plant integrates the solar thermal cycle into the
combined cycle power block. The thernal output delivered by the solar systems is always
supplied to the steam power section of the combined cycle in the ISCC. The integration
increases the conversion efficiency of the solar thermal input, saves fossil fuel and reduces the
specific emissions of the overall system compared to the conventional combined cycle.

Solar Thermal Cycle
The solar thermal cycle consists of two subsystems; the solar field and the solar heat transfer
system. In HTF-Trough System these are the solar collector field and the HTF boiler
subsystem for steam yeneration. The basic element of the solar field is the parabolic trough
collector. Parabolic trough-shaped mirrors are used to focus sunlight on thermal efficient
receiver tubes, called heat collecting elements (HCE), that contain the heat transfer fluid
(HTF). Typical operation temperatures of parabolic trough HCEs are in the range from 240 to
400°C. Figure 4-8 depicts the flow scheme of HTF system.
The solar collector field is composed of a large number of solar collector arrays (SCA). One
SCA is a line of several parabolic trough collectors, which may be arranged in a straight line
or in a loop with U-turn. The axes of the SCAs are horizontal and oriented from North to
South. Each collector in an SCA is equipped with a hydraulic drive and an individual control
unit for tracking. As tracking is done by rotation of the trough around its gravitational axis,
the tracking is denominated as "one-axis tracking".
The HTF passing from one end of the SCA to the other collects the heat absorbed by the
HCEs. Header pipelines at the cold and hot ends of the SCAs connect these to the HTF-boiler
integrated into the power block. The HTF-boiler is a conventional steam generating heat
exchanger similar in design to boilers used for industrial process heat applications. Depending
on the integration design of solar steam supply into the power block, the HTF-boiler may
generate saturated steam or superheated steam. The common HTF in parabolic trough solar
fields is a thermal oil. The operation pressure is below 20 bar and temperature of the HTF is
limited to 4000C to avoid cracking. Typically the upper temperature in the HTF circuit is
3900C.
Combined C)ycle Block
The Combined Cycle power block consists of two (2) no. of Gas Turbine Generator (GTG)
with two (2) no of Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) and a Steam Turbine Generator
(STG).
The unfired HRSG will be coupled to the GTG exhaust through bypass and isolation dampers.
The gas turbine exhaust, after passing through respective HRSG, will be discharged to
atmosphere through HRSG main stack.
Steam generated in different pressure levels (HP & LP) from the HRSG is fed through
respective pressure level supply headers to the steamn turbine. A bypass station will be
provided across the steam turbine to facilitate starting'partdoad'load throw-off conditions.
Steam turbine exhaust will be condensed in the condenser and the condensate will be pumped
to the integral deaerator of each HRSG through gland steam condenser and ejector condensers
by the Condensate Extraction Pumps. From the integral deaerator, feed water will be pumped
to both the HP circuit of HRSG by HP Boiler Feed Pumps (BFP) and to the LP circuit by LP

4.4.2 Consumption of Process Chemicals
The following chemicals will be used in the water treatrnent plant:
* Coagulants
* Flocculants
* Chlonne gas
* Sodium Hydroxide
* Hydrochloric acid
* Morpholine
* Trisodium phosphate
* Hydrazine
Coagulants and flocculants are added in the raw water during clarification. Chlorine gas will
be injected in the raw water and also in the cooling tower basin for disinfecting the water.
Sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid will be used for the regeneration of the ion
e.xchangers. For ihe neutralisation of DM plant effluent also these chemicals will be used.
Morpholine will be dosed in the DM water for pH boosting in the DM plant area.
Hydrazine will be dosed at the deaerator outlet for oxygen scavenging.
Trisodium phosphate will be dosed at the boiler drum to condition the boiler water and to
increase the pH.
Antiscalants, anticorrosive agents and biocides will be dosed in the cooling tower basin for
conditioning the circulating water. Boiler feed water treatment chemicals will be dosed in the
Boiler drum for conditioning the feed water.
4.5 COOLING SYSTEM
Flow scheme for the main cooling water system and that for the auxiliary cooling water
syetem are shown in Figures 4- II and 4-12, respectively.
The plant cooling water system consists of the following independent system
* Condenser cooling water system.
* Auxiliary cooling water system.
* Closed circuit cooling water system
* GTG fin fan cooling system
The heat sink for the Rankine part of the combined cycle can be established by dissipating the
heat through water circulating through a steam condenser at the exhaust of the steam turbine.
The heat carried by the circulating water is further dissipated to the atmosphere by a cooling
tower. In this process a small amount of water evaporates and hence the same is to be made
up by adding fresh water (wet cooling).

4.6.4 Plant Make-up Water System
Raw water from the river Nile, which is about 2 km will be conveyed to site by means of a
pipe line of adequate size and suitable material. This will be collected in the raw water
reservoir of 20000 m3 capacity which will be sufficient to store three days plant water
requirement. This system consists of Pre-treatment plant and Demineralisation plant.
Pre-treatment Plant
This plant consists of clarifiers, chemical dosing systems and sludge disposal svstems. Plate
type clarifier of I x 100% capacity will remove the suspended particles present in the water
after proper chemical additions. Alum, lime and sodium hypochlorite are dosed to condition
the raw water. Treated water will be collected and used as the feed to the filters / DM plant,
cooling tower make-up water. Clarified water will be used as fire fighting water also.
Clarified water is filtered in the pressure sand filter and activated carbon filter. Chlorine
dosing will be done in the filtered water before using it as potable/service water. Sludge
generated in the clarifier will be collected and treated in a sludge dewatering svstem.
Dewatered sludge will be disposed off site by trucks.
Demineralisation Plant
The DM plant consists of Pressure sand filter, Activated Carbon filter and Demineralising ion
exchangers like strong acid cation, strong base anion and mixed bed exchangers. This DM
water will be stored in the DM water storage tank. It also consists of necessary acid and alkali
tanks required for the regeneration of ion exchangers. Effluent generated in the DM plant will

be neutralised using acid/alkali in a collection pit and it is transferred to the common effluent
tank.
The various requirement of DM water for the power plant is based on the power cycle make-
up and CCW make-up. The DM plant will be of 2x100% capacity each, one work ing, and one
standby. The quality of DM water produced will correspond to the requirement of the boiler
make-up water quality.
Figuare 4-14 provides with the flow scheme of the feed water system.
Waste Water System
The waste collection and treatment system receives, segregates, and transfers all plant process
and liquid waste streams for plant water management and ensures confornance to the local
environment regulations. Figure 4-15 shows the flow diagram of the wastewater system.
The Power Plant effluents are of the following five kinds. They are:
*  Oil) waste
* Water waste
* Chemical waste
* Sanitary waste
* Solid waste (sludge)
The effluent disposal system consists of, floor trenches, sumps/pit and sump pumps to collect
the plant wastes and transport them to the oil/water separator skid or to the common effluent
tank or to off-site disposal.
In general, sump pumps will be submersible (centrifugal type). In the condition where the
sump receives rainwater from a contained area, the pump will be sized to remove the design
maximum rainfall over a 24-hour period. For the Sumps not receiving rainwater, the sump
pump will be of adequate capacity to dispose the waste water collected in that sump.
Oily Wastewater
Oil/water separator will be located in the effluent treatmnent plant area. It receives waste from
Combustion turbine area floor drain, ST lube oil centrifuge, tank farm area, ST area floor
washing and transformer area drain. The wastewater from the oil/water separator skid will be
transferred to common effluent tank. Separated oil from the oily water separator will be
collected in a drum for offsite disposal.

Construction Workers
The NREA and their Consultant will seek to utilize qualified contractors with demonstrated
performance in the construction of power stations and construction of projects in the region.
Wherever practicable, local employment opportunities will be maximized.
Most fabrication will take place prior to delivery to the site and all erection of structures and
installation of equipment will use local crafi labor, including the following professions:
*      engineers;
*      boiler makers and installers;
*      carpenters;
*      cement masons;
*      electricians;
*      iron workers;
*      millwrights;
*      pipefitters;
*      teamsters;
*      laborers; and
*      welders.
Constructiotn Traffic
The traffic generated by construction is estimated as shown in Table 4-10. The amount of
construction traffic will vary throughout the construction period.

Notes:
a. Assume that all HGVs travel to and from the site during the daytime shift.
b. Assurne that 75% of the constructicn workers will reside in site. The remaining 25% of the work force will
travel to and from the site by car at an occupancy rate of 3 per car.
c. The timing of deliveries of abnormal loads will be agreed with the CA; however, it is assumed that these
deliveries will occur during the night shift to minimize road congcstioni Thcre will be approximately 35
abnormal loads during construction.
Construction Safety
The Contractors will be required to develop and implement a construction Quality Control
Program. A key part of the Quality Control Program will be a Health and Safety Plan, which
the construction contractor(s) will be required to comply with as a condition of contract.
Environmental Management During Constructiona
The NREA recognizes that construction activities need to be wvell-managed and controlled to
avoid potential environmental impacts from nois, dust, odor, effluent, traffic and other forns
of disturbance by construction workers and fixed or mobile plant.
The construction activities will incorporate range of mitigation measures to minimize the
potential for environmental impacts to occur (see Seciion 7).

5.    DESCRIPTION OF THE ENVIRONNIENT
5.1   GENERAL SETTING OF THE SITE
The ISCC Kuraymat site is located within an existing fencend area of uncultivated land. It is
situated on approximately 277 hectare piece of land located in a desert area near the village of
Kuraymat, in the Giza Govemorate, on the eastern side of the Nile river. The site locus is
approximately 95 km south of Cairo and 30 km north of Beni-sueif. The project area consists
of two principal facilities-the solar field and the power block area in addition to the area
designated to the balance of the plant (i.e. switchyard, administration building, fire station,
workshop and storage, canteen & park area, main gate, security, visitor center, gas station,
liquid fuel tank and unloading station) (Figure 5-2 (B)). One physiographic zone occupy this
area: a rocky desert plateau east of the floodplain adjacent to the Nile. The site of the proposed
power plant is about 2000 meters wide and has an average length of about 900 meters; in all
the site encompasses 2,772,000 square meters. The site of the existing KPP community
facilities. or colony, is located near the west side of the power plant area, the colony area
measures 670 x 670 meters, or approximately 450,000 square meters.
On the norih west side of the site is the Kurayrnat village (about 3.0 kn) and the Kuraymat
irrigation pumping station (about 3.5 km). The site is about 2.5 km north-east of the Ezbet El-
Hagg Ghanem. On the east side of the site is a wide-extended desert land and on the south
side is an agricultural land. On the west side, and across the colony site, is a two-lane road
running approximately paralle to the Nile river. On the western side of the site, across the two-
lane road is the Kuraymat thermal power plant and then, the Nile river, about 2 km from the
proposed site, where the existing power plant's cooling water intake and discharge structures
are located.
The nearest town of importance is Es-saff, Markaz Es-saff, about 30 km along the road in the
north direction. Towns of importance in the wide vicinity of the proposed power plant site are
Giza, Imbaba, 15h of May, Beni-sueif and El-Wasta. The general site location is shown in
Figures 5-1, A, B and C.
The site consists of approximately flat land, which is owned by the New and Renewable
Energy Authority (NREA), exactly 660 feddan. Localized map of the proposed site is shown
in Fiigre 5-2, A and B.
The land is identified by the north latitude of 290 16' and the eastem longitude of 310 15'.
Figure 5-3 presents the geographical location of the proposed site.
The Kuraymat site is located on the western edge of the North Galala Plateue, a desert
environment ranging in elevation from 330 to 1,275 meters above sea level. The sit itself is at
an elevation of 60m above sea level. Wadis drain into the Nile river from the west slope of the
plateau. The development of the site will not affect the drainage in adjacent areas. The river
bank in this reach of the Nile (El- Wk'asta to Beni-sueif) is generally steep, consisting of small
floodplain areas on the east bank; bowvever, more extensive agricultural lands occur on the

west bank. Flat desert lands above the east bank (Figu(re 5-4) extend some 35 km inland to the
Galala Plateau ridge. This area is not irrigated, but sporadic grazing occurs throughout the
plateau. Figure 5-5 shows two views of the existing site from the 2003 site visits.
Small oases occur about I km south-west of the site, and also to the north-west of the site.
These oases are located on wadis at their confluences with the Nile flood-plain. The oases and
adjacent floodplain are used to grow a variety of fruit, %egetable, and forage crops and to
graze livestock. Agricultural land to the immediate south of the proposed site also grow the
same types of crops. The natural growth of palm trees and shrubs, combined with fig trees and
other cultivated -woody plants, provides habitat for a variety of songbirds and some shorebirds.
At least two different crops are planted annually on the lower areas, and in August, com and
peanuts are the predominant crops. Winter wheat is to be planted after the corn is harvested.
Orchard and perennial crops included grapes, melons, guava. lemon, Indian fig (Opuntia
ficusindica) and castor bean.
Natural stream bank vegetation forms a narrow border to the river and consists of Scirpus.
Juncus, Phragmities, Typha, and other emergent species. Snails are abundant along the
shoreline, as are nematodes and other bottom worms in shallow water. The shoreline also
shows evidence of high siltation and periphytic growth. The shoreline at the reach is already
stabilitized as a part of the existing KPP project. The elevation is on average not changed in
the cultivated area but all areas are of uniform elevation.
The Kuraymat proposed site is within the El-Burumbul local goveming unit, with the city of
Es-Saff as the goveming center of the district. No villages or individual residences are located
on the site. Agricultural workers who farmn the floodplain and the agicultural land to the south
of the proposed site live in nearby villages. Kuraymat village is located some 3 km to the
norih- % est of the site and Figure 5-6 shows the view of the nearest part of the village from the
road to the site.
The site is located within a totally rural/desert landscape with some small scattered residential
communities.
Supply to the site is possible via railroad, road and barge from Alexandria, El-Dekheila,
Damietta, Suez-Gulf or others. The power plant location can be reached by previously
mentioned two-lane road which branches off the agricultural road connecting Alexandria with
Cairo. This access road has a width of about 12 m starting from Helwan. The part of this
access road which passes the Kuraymat site is paved but is full of asphalt pockets.
Another access road to the proposed site starts from Giza to El-Badrashein through El-Ayyat
to Beni -suei f, then crosses the Nile to follow Beni-sueif desert road 30 km to the north till the
main entrance of the proposed site.
The project area lies within the hyperarid climatic province of Egypt characterized by a mild
winter and hot summer.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
Generally, the project area is a rural-desert landscape. In the vicinity of the project site, almost
no human settlements of any significant size occurs.
There is a typical rural housing with many small *villages. The nearest villiage to the site is at
about 3 km. No housing, except the existing KPP's colony, occurs in the immediate vicinity of
the site which is totally surrounded by desert and farm lands. The satellite image taken
recently (Figure 5-1(B)) shows that these lands are as described.
There are no significant habitats within the project's area of influence.
The primary wildlife species observed onsite during the November 2003 and Februray 2004
field reconnaissance were birds. Within the uwetlands, the cattle egret (Bubulcus ibis),
moorhen (Gallinula chloropus), common swallow (Hirundo Rustics), and graceful warbler
(Prinia gracilis) were commonly observed in the Scirpus - Juncus marshes. Most of the avian
activity, however, was centered in the agricultural areas. Swallows were observed foraging the
fields. Catile egrets, spur-winged plovers (Hoploterus spinosus), crested larks (Galerida
cristata), and Senegal stone curlews (Burhinus senegalensis) foraged on the ground in the
fields. Palm doves (Streptopelia senegalensis) were commonly observed foraging on the
ground as well as resting in the trees. No birds were observed in the desert on the site.
In addition, the field surveys have indicated that non-of the floral and faunal communities
and/or species are of conservation value (rare or threatened). Meanwhile, no natural
protectorates exist near the vicinity of the proposed site.
No industry, other than the existing power plant, is present near the site. Thus, the air in the
backsground atmosphere is of appropriate quality.
No archaeological resources are known in this zone. During February 1991 and before the
construction of the existing Kuraymat power plant, Kathryn A. Bard and Ricardo J. Elia of
the Otfice of Public Archaeology, Boston University have conducted "Preliminary
Archaeological Assessment for the Kuraymat", Egypt Feasibility study. Also, the local
archaeological authorities surI eed the whole area around the site and they all proved that no
historical resources exist.
Two water sources are available near the site, i.e. the Nile river and the underlaying aquifer.
The quality of both surface water and groundwater in the Kuraymrat reach of the Nile is
generally good. Only in localized sectors where there are concentrated sources of
contaminants, such as irrigation drainage return waters, would water quality degradation be
expected to occur.
The groundwater basin, which lies both beneath and closely adjacent to the Nile Valley from
Cairo to Aswan, includes an area of about 2 million feddans. Water storage in this linear basin
has been estimated at approximately 27 billion mi3. However, because the hydrologic balance
of the Nile Valley alluvial aquifer is directly connected with Nile surface flows, production
from the aquifer is nominally the same as withdrawing water from the river. In essence, the
valley aquifer is a transmission medium for river surface resources.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
5.2.2 General Physiography
Althoug!h the Nile Valley and the Delta occupy about 3.5% of the total area of Egypt, they
represent, from the geographic point of view, the most important region in Egypt. This is
because most of Egypt's population, most of the cultivated land, most of the water resources
and most of the socio-economic manifestations are concentrated in such a small area. In fact,
the development of the Nile Valley since about six million years was the most significant
geomorphologic event that shaped not only present-d3y geoniorpholoey of Egypt but also its
other geographic aspects.
The project fenced area covers 2,772'000 m2 located on the east bank of the Nile river, about
95 km south of Cairo and 30 km north of Beni-sueif.
This selected site is located at the northern extremity of the Eastern Desert, on the eastern side
of the Nile Valley, obout 2 km distant from the Nile bank, and lies just south-east (about 3.5
km) of the Kura`mat irrigation pumping station and the Kuraymat village (some 3.0 km). The
site is located at the northn latitude of 290 16' and the eastem longitude of 31° 15'.
The planned site can be reached by Es-Saff/ Beni-sueif road which is linked directly by Cirol
Tebbin road. The site can, also, reached by Giza-Badrashein road which passes El-Wasta to
Beni-sueif via Upper Egpt agriculture road along the west bank of the Nile river. It crosses
the Nile at Beni-sueif to the east bank and follows Beni-sueif desert road to the north till the
main entrance of the power plant site. This reach is about 60 km longer than the previous one.
5.2.3 Geomorphology
Topographically, the area is characterized by moderate relief in its eastern part and undulating
low land along the margin of the Nile Valley (Figure 5-8). The low land (plain) extends to the
upper part of the pediplain (foot slopes) of the eastem plateau. The maximum elevation in the
area reaches 10 Im at the extreme eastern part.
The present area is a part of the western margin of the Maaza plateau, which occupies the
central and northern parts of the Eastern Desert.
Geomorphic Units:
The landscape of the study area and surroundings is divisible into three main geomorphic
units, namely: (a) the elevated plateau, (b) undulated pediment, and (c) Nile flood plain.
Followving is a brief description of these units:
The elevated plateau attains a relief ranging between 23 and 434 m above sea level
(Figure 5-9). Generally, the elevation of the plateau increases eastward (Figure 5-10).
The plateau surface is corrugated and cluttered with isolated mesas (flat-topped hills) and
buttes (cone-shaped hills) of limestones of different geological units (Figure 5-11). The
western edge of the plateau has an elevation ranging from 220 to 435 m (as.l.). This

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
scrap extends in an undulating fashion running northerly to northeasterly. The basic
configuration of this scrap is structurally controlled by two major fault sets trending
NNXW-SSE and N-S. The plateau surface is dissected by a dense and well-developed
drainage net, flowing west towards the Nile. Major wadis dissecting the plateau are long
and deep (incised), and in many sectors they are flanked by nearly vertical rockwalls
(cliffs) and are developed into canyon-like drainage channels.
*  The pediment is a slightly undulated plain, that exists at the footslope of the retreated
front of the elevated plateau. The junction of the pediment With the front of the plateau is
marked by a gradual break in slope. It forms an elongated plain with a regional N-S
extension and a gentle slope generally towards the west. Near the Nile ilood plain this
pediment is crossed by the Cairo-Beni Sueif highway and is occupied by villages and
other human activities (Figure 5-12, 5-13 & 5-14). The area is crossed by the lower
reaches of a few main wadis, issuing from the upland plateau. The westem rim of the
pediment is short, irregular in outline and merges imperceptibly westward into the Nile
flood plain.
*  The Nile flood plain is almost flat and occupies a narrow strip north and south of ihe area
of study. This area is covered by Holocene Nile silt, which composes the fertile cultivable
soils of the Nile Valley (Figure 5-15).
Drainage Network
The drainage basins bounding the power plant site and surroundings are: W. Ramlyyah in the
east to north and W. Matin El-Bahri in the south. These two basins are elongate, run
approximately east-west and debouch into the flood plain of the Nile river.
Lithologically, the upper reaches of the basins are carved in the Eocene rocks and their lower
reaches are carved in younger formations (Pliocene-Quatemary) (Figure 5-20)
The map in Figure 5-18 shows that the drainage pattem of this net is predominantly dendritic
in the northern basins and is dendritic to sub-parallel in the southern basins due to structural
controlled by the NW and E-W fault systems. Some of the main wadis of these southem
basins run east-west (Figure 5-18).
The proposed power plant site lies south-east of the outlet of W. Ramlyvah occuPving an
elevated land. On the other hand, the suagested pathways of the proposed new Cairo-
Kuraymat Highway that tends to avoid traffic congestions along the Nile Valley agriculrural
land cuts across the lower reaches of all these basins as it runs virtually perpendicular to the
direction of flow of the basins, In the light of this, special design measures need to be
considered.  In the same way. connecting the proposed power plant to the electrical
transmission network, should be carefully considered in the light of the different prevailing
geomorphic units of the region.

5.2.4 Geology
Stratigraphic Setting,
The rocks that crop out in the investigated area are all sedimentary and pertaining in age to the
Eocene (55 - 38 million years b.p.), Pliocene (5 - 2 million %ears) and Quaternary (2 million
years-Present) (Figure 5-19). The Eocene units represent the oldest outcropping rocks and
form a plateau land. Carbonates (predominantly limestone) %% ith varying amounts of shale are
the main rock types (Conoco Coral, 1978). They are differentiated into four Formations.
These, from oldest to voungest. are:
*  W. Rayan Formation (limestone intercalated with shale and sandy shale).
* Beni-sueif Formation (shale, marl and limestone).
* Observatory Forrmation (bedded limestone).
* Maadi Formation (shale and limestone intercalated with sandstone).
The first three formations belong to the middle Eocene, and the youngest one (Maadi F.) is
considered to be late Eocene (Hermina et al., 1998).
The Pliocene rocks crop out at the footslope of the front edge of the elevated plateau. They
form a long strip. intervening between the scrap face of the limestone plateau on the east and
the Nile flood plain (Nile Valley) on the west. The Pliocene rocks are mainly composed of
sandstone and limestone (Figure 5-20).
Quaternary deposits include wadi alluvium, fanglomerates and Nile silt.
The site of the proposed power plani is underlain by the Pliocene rocks / the Ouaternarv Nile
sediments.
Structural Setting
The main structural elements in the study area are faults and folds. East-west, NW-SE, north-
south and NE-SW faults control the main topographic features (Figure 5-21).
Faults of the east-west set form the northern boundaries of the high plateaux of the study area
and surroundings. e.g., the northern margin of El-Galala El-Bahariya plateau and the northem
side of the Tura-Huf plateau (Figures 5-9 and 5-21).
The north-south faults mainly characterize the eastem escarpment of the Nile Valley. For the
majority of these faults, the down throw side is westward toward the Nile Valley (Abd-Allah,
1988). The Nile itself may be running along a norih-soutb lineament (inferred fault) in this
sector. Shallow (gentle) folds are recorded particularly' in the southern sector with axes
trending NW and form a series of plunging anticlines and plunging synclines (Figure 5-21).

5.2.5  Natural and Man-Induced Hazards
Although the potential natural hazards of earthquakes, flash floods, landslides, and ground
subsidence will be considered, the most significant, with respect to the proposed ISCC
Kuraymat power plant is seismicity. Man-induced problems/hazards include Nile siltation in
the vicinitv and accumulation of Water Hyacinth.
Natural Hazards
Earthquakes:
In Egypt, the distribution of epicenters of moderate to large and small to micro-earthquakes
indicates that earthquake activity tends to occur along three main seismic active trends as
follows (Kebeasy, 1990) (Figure 5-23(A)).
*  Northern Red Sea - Gulf of Suez - Cairo - Alexandria - Clysmic Trend: This trend is
major and active in Egypt and extends along the northern Red Sea, Gulf of Suez, Cairo
and Alexandria as well as along the northwestem part of the Mediterranean Sea (Figure
5-23 (A)). It is characterized by the occurrence of shallow, micro, small, moderate and
large earthquakes. Activity foci are limited within the crmst. The activity along this trend
is mainly attributed to the Red Sea rifting as well as several other active faults.
*  East Mediterranean - Cairo - Fayoum Pelusiac Trend: This trend extends from east
Mediterranean to east of the Nile Delta to Cairo and the Fayoum region (Figure 5-23(A)).
Along this trend, small to moderate earthquakes are recorded and their foci are confined
uwithin the crust.
*  Levant- Aqaba Trend: This trend is a continuation of the Levant active fault and extends
along the Gulf of Aqaba and further southwest into the Red Sea. It bisects the clysmic
trend at about 270 N and 43.6° E (Figure 5-23 (A)). Earthquake occurrences are found
mainly at both ends of the Gulf of Aqaba. Only shallow small-size earthquakes are
detected along this trend.
The Project area and adjoining region are situated near the intersection of the first two
trends (Figure 5-23 (A)). A small number of local micro-earthquake (<3 on Richter scale)
epicenters are located in the general vicinity (Figure 5-23 (A)).
Figure 5-24 substantiates the above mentioned statement (Kebeasy, 1990) that
earthquakes along the East Mediterranean-Cairo-Fayoum Pelusiac trend range from small
to moderate in magnitude. To augment this, a moderate earthquake (magnitude 5.7 on
Richter scale) struck the area near Cairo on October 12, 1992. Its center was located some
20 km SW of Cairo (near Dahshour). It was felt in Cairo, Fayoum, Qaliobya, Giza, Beni-
Sueif and vicinity.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
In the light of this. precautionary measures should be taken against potential moderate
eanhquakes of magnitude 5 - 6 (Richter scale) in the design of the proposed power plant
Flash Floods:
The study area is characterized by quite low mean annual precipitation (< 10 mm). However,
heavy stormy rainfall may take place accidentally in winter and may cause temporary
hazardous flash flooding. Recorded events in the vicinity of the proposed site during the
period 1974-1989 include:
* 22,211975: Strong flash floods that affected Beni-sueif, NlMinia, Assiut and Soha3
Governorates. In Markaz Ihnasia (Beni-sueif G.) 500 feddans were drowned and
buildings in 12 villages were partly destroyed.
*  232,1982  Moderate flash floods that affected Markaz Es-Saff, south of Helwan
partlicularly Oababat village. Some 180 houses were destroyed, substantial cultivations
were damaged and about 1500 persons were displaced.
*  2512.l1978& Weak, flash floods that affected Nlarkaz Es-Saff particularly Arab El-Hisar
village. Damage to houses and fanns was reported.
Explicitl) no flash flooding was reported during this period at the site of the present and
proposed ISCC Kuraymat power plants which is located just to the west and south of Wadi
Ramlyyah (Figure 5-18). Protective measures were taken near the existing Kuraymat plant
site, which is located on an elevated undulated ridge of the pediplain, induding a diversion
canal, demarcation of channel and stone lining of the sides (Figures 5-12, 5-lS and 5-22).
Similat protective measures will be undertaken for the ISCC project proposed site.
Landslides:
The site is not close to the precipitous slopes and so, potential landslides that may affect the
project, are unlikely to occure.
Ground Subsidence:
The site of the proposed plant is underlain by the Pliocene rocks and is adjacent to the
Quarternary Nile sediments. The Pliocene rocks include clastic sandstone and chemical
limestone. The latter is commonly vulnerable to dissolution particularly by acid water (e.g.,
sewage). Dissolution may result in underground vugs and cavities that may later collapse,
causing ground subsidence. The effect, however, is not that serious and the suggested
protective measure involves avoidance of sewage leakage at the site or in its vicinity.
If a surface-cooling pond is to be designed at the site to receive hot effluents of the Station,
the pond should be lined with an appropriate impervious material (e.g., cement) to prevent the
dow-nwvard infiltration of the hot water to the solution-prone limestone component of the
bedrock.

.lfan-!nduced Hazards
Siltation:
It is reported that the water intake tunnel of the present power plant was suffering of silting.
At the present rate of sedimentation, the situation is manageable by periodic mechanical
removal of silt by drag-line type shovels. However, if the situation is aggravated more in the
future, the whole course of the Nile in the vicinity should by hydraulically studied to manage
the diversified local directions and rates of flow of the water as a function of the scattered Nile
islands near to the site.
Water Hyacinth:
The excessive growvth of Water Hyacinth (Ward En-Nile) is a problem of national dimension
because of the nutritive-nature of the Nile water due to excessive fertilizing of the agricultural
land. Mechanical collection of the floating plant and its disposal on land is the common
national remedial practice. The water intake tunnel of the present Kuraymat power plant is
suffering of the accumulation of this Water Hyacinth.
5.2.6 Natural Resources
Mlineral Resources:
In the study area and adjoining region numerous quanies are present (Figure 5-2S and Table
S-l). Their main commodity is building and construction raw materials such as limestone,
clay, sandstone, gravel, and sands, beside decorative stones such as Egyptian alabaster and
crystalline limestone.

Water Resources
The water resources are of prime importance for the development projects in drylands, as
there is generally a shortage in both surface and groundwater resources. The area of Helwan-
Kuraymat, however, has a promising potential for future development projects (Figure 5-26).
Beside the direct access to the Nile water the following is a general view about the
groundwater potential of the region.
Previous regional studies indicated that the main water bearing formnations are those belonging
to Pleistocene, Miocene, Oligocene, Eocene and lower Cretaceous (Diab, 1984).
It is to be noticed that the Nile river acts as an enormous water body to the west of the study
area and hydrogeologically, is of probable effect on groundwater recharge, particularly near its
course.
The constructed regional idealized columnar section (Figure 5-27) of the stratigraphical (rock)
units and hydrogeological characteristics, shows that the rock units of hydrogeological interest
are:
* The Pleistocene (2 million - 10.000 yrs) water-bearing units.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
* The Miocene (25 - 5 million yrs) water-bearing units.
* The Oligocene fluviatile (38 - 25 million yrs) water-bearing units.
* The Eocene (65 - 38 million yrs) calcareous water-bearing units.
* The Cretaceous (144 - 65 million yrs) (Nubian) water-bearing units.
The apes 0i%en between brackets are those of the rocks of the aquifers but the ages of the
waters are inherently much younger.
Brief explanation of the different hydrogeolocal conditions of the mentioned water-bearing
and -water-confining lithological successions follows. The available data are collected from:
natural springs, drilled wells, dug wells and boreholes (Diab, 1984, El-Gindy et al., 1999,
Misak et al., 1989).
The Pleistocene Water-Bearinq Units:
The groundwater of this succession exists in the alluvial deposits of the main wadis dissecting
the area. These deposits are composed of sands, gravels and thin streaks of sandy clays. The
water of this aquifer is present under unconfined conditions.
In areas away from the Nile, the aquifer is of low potential because of reduced thickness of the
succession. Adjacent to the Nile basin, however, the Pleistocene sediments are considered as
the main aquifer (Figure 5-28). They are composed of coarse, massive and thick sands and
gravels. Occasionally, the Prenile sands and gravels are interbedded with clay lenses of
various thickness and extension which may reduce the permneability and effective porosity of
the aquifer. The Pleistocene aquifer, lies unconformabl) beneath the Holocene (10,000 yrs -
present) agricultural silt layer of the fertile land of Egypt and it overlies the Pliocene (5 - 2
million yrs) clay.
The maximum thickness of the sediments of this aquifer in the study area amounts to 200 m in
the areas adjacent to the Nile Valley. The saturated thickness of this aquifer is about 50 m at
the latitude of Helwan. Generally, this aquifer gradually thickens northward. The Prenile
aquifer unit covers the whole area of the old cultivated land, and is extended, in its major part,
to the west of the Nile river. There is a large number of water wells tapping this aquifer and
are distributed throughout the study area. The groundwater exploited from this aquifer is used
as a supplement source beside the Nile surface water, for both domestic and agricultural
purposes. However, most of the wells tapping this aquifer are of partial penetration
conditions. The groundwater occurs under semi-confned conditions, where the sediments of
this aquifer are mostly overlain by a clay cap which acts, in many cases, as an impermeable to
semi-permeable layer. The groundwater of this aquifer attains a depth that ranges between 2 -
6 m. The thickness of the clay cap varies widely between a few centimeters near the cliffs of
the limestone plateau and 20 m at the areas adjacent to the Nile (El-Gindv et al., 1999). The
hydraulic connection between this aquifer and older aquifers in the study area is not
unexpected because of structural (fault) control. However, the wide range in water salinity
(301-2200 mg/I) indicates that this aquifer acts as a transitional medium between the fiesh
surface water and the brackish groundwater of the older Quaternary aquifers.

The Miocene Water-Bearinq Units:
The thickness of the Miocene aquifer is about 20 m and is composed of sands, sandstones, and
gravels with marl interbeds.
The groundwater occurrences uithin the Miocene succession are directly recharged through
faulLs, fractures and cracks in the down dip direction of the different wadis that originate firom
the mountainous and plateau regions further east. The salinity of the Miocene water is tested
(5-35 gm/liter) at Habashi well (Diab, 1984).
It is to be pointed out that there is no regularity neither in depth of the Miocene groundwater
nor in its salinity.
The Oligocene Water-Bearing Units:
The Oligocene rooks are of fluviatile nature (sandstone, sands and gravels).
The following is Kurlov's formula of the chemical characteristies of the Oligocene
groundwater at some localities:
S 1790   C149      HC0332      S0419    pH 7.4
Na4O       Mg39        Ca2l
The present study area is not known to have outcropping Oligocene sediments.
The Eocene Water-Bearing Units:
The aquifer occupies the area lying to the south of the Cairo-Suez road. The Eocene water-
bearing succession is mainly formed of two components, each has its own water
characteristics, namely:
*  The upper part which consists of fissured and even-cracked limestones.
*  The lower part which is composed of sandstones and coarse conglomerates with gypsum
layers. To the north of El-Ayyat and up to Giza, the Eocene limestone is highly fractured
and is probably subjected to a network of deep-seated faults (Abdel Daiem, 1971).
Therefore, the Eocene limestone at Helwan and vicinitiy is considered as a good
groundwater aquifer. The groundwater of this aquifer occurs under unconfined
conditions.
The Eocene upper aquifer is made up of hard snow white, and highly fossiliferous limestone
with shale and marl intercalations. Tamer et al. (1975) mentioned that the limestone and marl
series has a thickness of about 500 m in the wells drilled at Beni-Sueif.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
In January 1992, a number of springs naturally issued in the Helwan district Each is
characterized by a constant discharge of about 90 m3/hr and a temperature of 30°C. The
constant discharge and temperature of these springs point to a deep-seated origin of water and
that it comes to the surface by upward leakage through faults and fractures under high artesian
pressure (Figure 5-27).
Salinity ranges between 600 ppm at Tebbein and 12,000 ppm at Turah. The following are
Kurlov's formulae for some groundwater analyses of the Eocene aquifer:
Bir Youssef        S41.500      S0465  C133 HCO32       pH 8
Na6O Ca2l Mgl9
Bir Maadi          Sl.600 S0445 C137 HCO312        pH 7.7
Na62 Ca9l Mgl9
Bir Tebbein SO-. 1600  C15I  S0426 HCO323     pH 7.3
Na5O Ca29 Mg2l
Nile at Helwan Water HCO375  S0413 C113      pH 8
Ca4l     Na36    Mg23
It is clear that the springs at Cairo (Helwan Spring, Helwan Sulphur Spring, and Ain Es-Sira
Spring) are of the MgC12 type. These waters appear to have penetrated to a sufficient depth to
encounter sea-water and that they have risen to the surface through faults. The chemical
characteristics of some deep-seated springs in the study region are shown in Table 5-2.
Regionally, the groundwater moves from south to north. In the study areas the value of the
Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) of the surface water ranges between 242 and 918 mg/I, whereas
in the groundwater it ranges widely between 301 and 26560 mg/I. The salinity increases
considerably towards the area east of the Nile river, where the Pleistocene and the Eocene
aquifers are mainly represented (maximum recorded value 26500 mg/I, at Kuraymat).
The Nubian Sandstone Water-Bearinq Units:
The Nubian Sandstone is found to be water-bearing at the places of its occurrences (Es-
Sukhna well). The succession is mainly composed of sandstone intercalated with marls,
uncemented sands, dolomitic beds and hard dolomitic limestone. The occurrence of these
intercalations retards groundwater movements and at the same time is responsible for the

However, no deep drilled wells exist along the Cairo-Suez road except for the Es-Sukhna well
at which the Nubian aquifer has been found to be under artesian pressure (Diab, 1969 Abdel
Daiem, 1971) (Figure 5-28). The groundwater of Ain Helwan and Ain Es-Sukhna are of
evidently mixed origin and are not pure Nubian water. Figure 29 shows a regional
hydrogeological map of the northern part of Upper Egypt and the Nile delta (Res. Inst. Ground

Water for the Proposed ISCC Kuraymat power plant
The waler needed for operation (cooling and service purposes) is comfortabl) provided by the
surface water of the Nile riyer. Supplementa     ground water sources, however, are to be
found, if need arises, in shallow wells tapping particularly the Pleistocene aquifers.
The water table is at least a few meters below the surface of the proposed power plant. No
significant water cloggingp problems are foreseen to cause severe impact on the power plant
foundation.

5.3   CLI NIATE AND NIETEOROLOGY
5.3.1  Introduction
Both local and regional climatic characteristics play an important role in the dispersal of
pollutants in the atmosphere. To understand the potential impacts from a given industrial
source, both local and regional climatic conditions and short and long term meteorological
factors must be considered. The principal meteorological parameters, which affect the
dispersal of airbome pollutant,, are the following:
* wind speed, direction and temporal distribution;
* atmospheric stability;
* mixing height (the height below which there is significant mixing within the
atmosphere). and
* precipitation (which affects the deposition of the pollutants).
Both micro and macro meteorological factors affecting the general climatic conditions in the
region of the proposed site have been examnined in this assessment.
5.3.2 Regional Climatic Conditions
This section describes regional climatic conditions in the Kuraymat area. Tables 5-3, 5-4 and
5-5 summarize climatic information available for the area using 35 year monthly average data.
The Egyptian General Meteorological Authority (EGMA) does not locate meteorological
station at/or near the Kuraymat Site. Therefore the onsite sequential hourly meteorological
data are not readily available at this time. The twice-daily mixing height data also are not
available near the plant site. The alternative is to find the suitable data for use in the
dispersion analysis. The proposed site is located about 90 km south of Cairo, and about 30 km
nornh of Beni-sueif. Hourly meteorological data that are required by the dispersion modeling
are available at either site. To select a more representative site, climatological data of Janaklis,
near Kuraymat (Meteorological Climate Summary, 2001) and of Cairo have been utilized.
Accordingly, the Kuraymat site, as considered for Beni-sueif and Cairo weather conditions, is
characterized by a sub-tropical desert climate with predominantly very hot sumnmers, mild
winters, and generally dry and sunny conditions. Rainfall events are rare and occurrences of
gales, thunderstorms, and dust storms are occasional.
The climate of the region is caused primarily by the sub-tropical high pressure belt that is
prevalent in this area, leading to clear skies for most of the time. The prevailing winds are
northerly and can become strong during the winter. The northerly winds are caused by a sub-
tropical high pressure cell in the western desert of Egypt during the winter months and by the
western edge of a huge Asiatic low over northwestern India during the summer. The sparse
rainfall in this area usually falls in the formn of showers during the cold season (December,

January, February) while the region is under the influence of cold upper level troughs to the
north. The highest temperature generally occurs in June through August when tropical
continental air masses arrive from western Syria and Iraq on northeast winds while the lowest
temperatures are recorded in December, January and February as polar continental air masses
to thc north are dragged down in the rear of winter Mediterranean depressions. Relative
humidities remain low for most of the year reaching a maximum in November, December and
January and a minimum in April and May.
Summanres of climatic variables for the site region are available from meteorological data
collected at Beni-sueif and Cairo. The Beni-sueif data furnish wind speed, wind direction,
temperature, pressure, precipitation and relative humidity information that are considered to
be representative of the Kuraymat site. Atmospheric stability information is also available
from the Shoubrah E1-Kheima Phase II Report based on data collected at Cairo.
A 35-year Beni-sueif data base (1967-2002) indicates a northerly wind at the site (63 percent
from north quadrano with a maximum of winds from the North-West quadrant (9 percent)
followed by North-North-West winds (22 percent) and winds from the North-West-West
quadrant (5 percent) and WVesterly winds (3 percent) and then North-North-East winds (12
percent). Calm and variable winds occur approximately 20 percent of the time. Wind speeds
and directions measured for 2001 at Beni-sueif Station and measured for 1997 at Bahtim
Station are shown on the Wind Roses in Figures 5-30 and 5-31. Wind speeds are generally
light to moderate with an annual-average speed of approximately 4.9 meters per second and
rarely exceed 10 m/sec. (Table 5-4 and Table 5-6). The wind pattern affects the direction of
stirred-up sands and sandstorm. The wind derives these sands which accumulate in the
westem desert far from the project site and its vicinity. The source of these sands is generally
located further west in the Westem Desert (Figure 5-32). The temperature data collected at
Beni-sueif for a 35 year period indicate a maximum monthly-average temperature of 37.4AC in
July and a minimum monthly-average temperature of 5.8C in January. Summer time high
temperatures average 37°C while winter lows reach 7.2°C. The annual-average temperature is
22.3°C with record high and low temperatures of 47.7 and -0.2°C, respectively. Rainfall at
Beni-sueif averages 6.12 millimeters per year occurring mostly during the winter months
(December-March) Relative humidity remains fairly low throughout the year, maximizing at
63 percent for December and reaching a low of 38 percent in May (Table 5-3). The dryness of
this climate is further demonstrated by the fact that nearly 80 percent of possible sunshine is
received during the year.
The atmosphere stability information derived from the Shoubrah El-Kheima Phase II Report
indicates that unstable and neutral conditions occur more frequently (63 percent) than stable
conditions (37 percent). However, very stable conditions (Class 7), occur most frequently of
the seven stability classes at a frequency of 24 percent. These data alongwith the climatic
information generally suggest poor dispersion conditions during the nighttime hours.
There are old air quality monitoring stations in the site vicinity (since 1991) from which a
backeround air quality characterization can be made. But due to numerous malfunction
cvents. credibility of these monitoring stations is questionable. However background air

quality data has been collected at site by the National Research Center during September 2003
which demonstrated acceptable background air quality. Site observatrions also have
demonstrated that there are no major sources of air pollutants in the area. Based on the
existance of the present significant industrial source of the Kuraymat thermal power plant in
the v icinity of the proposed site, besides numerous quarries scattered in the surroundings, in
addition to many underground mazout-fired brick-kilns across the Nile, on the west bank of
the river, and the fact that Cairo and Beni-sueif are approximatel) 95 km and 30 km to the
north and the south respectively, it is assumed that the air quality of this region is
characteristic of a moderate-industrialized setting with some anthropogenic sources of air
pollution. Preconstruction ambient air monitoring, which would be conducted during the
project dev'elopment. would verify the background air quality characteristics.

5.4 ANIBIENT AIR QUALITY
5.4.1 Ambient Air Quality Data
Introductioni
Concentrations of ambient pollutants vary according to both time and location. They are
affected by many factors, the most significant being the size, number and location of emission
sources and the prevailing weather.
Nitrogen dioxide is the only significant pollutant emitted to the atmosphere from a gas fired
power plant, with respect to human health effects. The other combustion products of natural
gas are C02 and H2O. When fuel oil is burnt, SO2 and particulate matter become significant
emissions of concern.
iMfonitoring at the Site
National Resech Center, air pollution preclusion unit, undertook air quality monitoring at the
proposed site during March 2004. Monitoning took place at five monitoring points located at
the center of the proposed site and the other four points at around the present Kurayrnat power
plant complex and its residential community as shown in Figure 5-33.
Continuous measurements, over a period of 24 hours, were taken for nitrogen oxides (NOx).
carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (C02), sulfur dioxide (SO,), aldehydes (HCHO),
hydrogen sulfide (H2S), smoke and total suspended particulates. The results of this monitoring
are shown in Table 5-7 and Table 5-8 below. Comparisons with Egyptian Threshold Limit
Values (TLVs) (as stipulated in Law 4/1994) show that the concentration of gaseous
pollutants in ambient air at the proposed site were well below the TLVs for 24 hour a verages.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
The high level of particulate matter, which reached mean value of 744.2 .ig/m3, exceeded the
Egyptian standards for maximum 24 hour mean concentration at the Kuraymat power plant
area. Exceedences are likely to be due to emissions of particles from the quarries as well as
dry surface at the surroundings and vehicle exhausts along the Kuraymat / Beni-sueif road.
This level is likely to decrease as the ISCC Kuraymat power plant construction and plantation
program is implemented.
The level of smoke at measurement points are likely to be due to traffic, especially heavy
trucks.
5.4.2 Existing Sources of Atmospheric Pollutants
The key existing sources of atmospheric pollution in the project area comprise the following:
* existing operating gas/oil fired power plant of capacity 2x627 MW;
*  numerous quarries scattered in the surroundings;
* underground mazout-fired brick-kilns across the Nile, on the west bank of the
river; and
* vehicles using the two-lane road along the eastern edge of the proposed site.
On the basis of the limited monitoring data available for the proposed site and from our
observations at the site, the air shed around the project site is likely to have the general
characteristics of moderate-industriatrialized area air shed.
As a result, air pollution in Kuraymat Zone is appropriately below health standards for major
pollutants.
Ambient concentrations of TSP and PM1o are high, and are not complying with the WB/1FC
guidelines for determining air sheds of good quality. However, the share of the. existing,
Kuraymat power plant of this TSP and PM1O concentration does not exceed 4% of the value
measured and so will do the new proposed power plant project. Also, the share of the
proposed ISCC project will not exceed 2% of the value measured. Short terrn monitoring of
ambient air quality at the site (and as given in Table 5-7), suggests that ambient concentrations
of all other pollutants are well below WB/IFC moderately degraded air shed guidelines.
5.4.3 Particulate Matter Constituents
Use of gas turbines needs a special concern on constituents of particulate matters that exist
within the air shed around the project site.
For providing an adequate database on this inforrnation, an analytical study was undertaken
during May 2004 by the National Research Center. Ihe main outcomes of this study are
summarized as follows.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
Smoke
The smoke particle size ranges, on the average, between 0.07 p,m and 0.1 En at the proposed
site. Due to this very small size, smoke behaves in many ways like a gas and has the same
penetration power as the gas. Also, smoke does not remain in the atmosphere for a long time.
The average time of remaining in suspension was estimated to be 1-2 days.
Suspended Dust
Tables 5-9 through 5-14 give useful information on dust size.

5.5.8 Sediment Transport Rate
Field sediment transport measurements were performed in the Nile river for obtaining
required information about the current flow conditions before the Kuraymat existing power
plant. This data is necessary for hvdraulic modeling to solve the sedimentation problem at the
intake of the present power plant.
The sediment load transport measurements were carried out at three cross sections at
Kuravrnat, located at 811 km (measured downstream the High Aswan Dam). Locations of the
three measuring cross sections is shown in Figure 5-42. The first cross section is upstream the
intake structure of the present Kuraymat power plant by a distance of 1300m. The second
cross section was located in a distance of 1700m, and the third one was located by a distance
of 600m.
The Delft-Niel Sampler which was operated from an anchored boat, was used in the
measurements. This mechanical sampler was designed to measure, in contact to the bed, the
bed load and the suspended load up to 0.5 m above the bed (the sampler height). Three small
propeller meters were attached to the sampler to measure the current velocities at 0.18, 0.37
and 0.50m above the bed. The bed load transport is defined as the transport between the bed
surface and the top of the intake opening of the bed sampler (about 0.055m). This application
of this practical definition may result in some ovcrsamphng. as part of the suspended sediment
is trapped. However, a special patch of 0.5 mm mesh size was used at the upper side of the
bed load bag to allow the suspended sediment to leave the bag. The oversampling error was
estimated to be on the order of 10% to 20%. The suspended sand transport is defined as the
transport between the top of the intake opening of the bed load sampler and the water surface.
Grain Size Characteristics
The results of the sieve analysis for cross section 3 is presented in Table 5-I 7. Comparison of
DIO, D50 and D90 values of bed material and the bed load samples shows that the overall
a% erage values of bed load samples are slightly smaller than those of the bed material samles.
Suspended and Bed Load Transport Rate
Time-averaged suspended sediment load transport rates measured at each cross section were
obtained by integrating the suspended load transport over the cross section. The results are
given in Table 5-18.
Time-averaged bed sediment load transport rates measured at each cross section were
obtained by integrating the bed load transport over that cross section. The results are given in
Table 5-19.
The total load transport rate at each cross section was obtained by summing up both
suspended and bed load transport rates. The measured total load transport rates at each cross
section are given in Table 5-20.

Sediment Transport Rate Before the Intake Structure
Sediment transport rate before the intake structure at the cross section located between the
riPht bank and the small artificial island was obtained from the previous data as follows:
Suspended load transport over the cross section  = suspended load transport over the cross
sections (1+2-3)
= 10.0635+ 13.7022-21.0165
= 2.7492 kg/s
= 90 m3/dav
Bed load transport over the cross section    = bed load transport over the cross
sections (I + 2 -3)
= 1.5007+2.0115-3.11l1
= 0.4011 kgts
= 13. Im3/day
Total load transport over the cross section  = total load tansport over the cross
sections (I + 2 -3)
= 11.5642+ 15.7140-24.1275
= 3.1507 kg/s
= 103 m3/day

5.5.9 Water Qualih
Background
The pollution of surface water in the Nile river at the Kuraymat site is limited because the
Nile river receives a continuous flow of fairly clean water from the lake Nasser and the Nile
upstream, and the pollutants discharge into the Nile water are considerably diluted by this
massive volume of water. No significant discharge of sewage into the Nile occurs at
Kuravmat. Ambient concentrations of pollutants in the river and main canals do not exceed
standard for acute, short-term exposures (DHV Consultants, 1996).
The concentrations of chemicals and bacteria in the Nile's water are well within acceptable
standards for safe irrigation of food crops. The levels of chemical and microbial contaminants
in the Nile are low because the Nile river at Kuraymat site receives constant influx of cleaner
water.
Only limited pollution with fertilizers and pesticides originates at Kuraymat Nile segment
water because of agricultural areas. Leaching and runoff are of little significance because of
very limited rainfall.
I$ ater Qualioy Measurements
Water Quality Measurements as well as sediment samples at five sample locations (intake,
300 m to the south of the Kuraymat existing power plant site, 150 m to the south, before the
Kuraymat plant site, and 300 m to the north of the Kuraymat plant site) two samples were
taken on 25'h of May 2004 (National Research Center Study, June 2004). The results of water
quality detennination include chemical analysis of water samples (physico-chemical
parameters, concentration of heavy metals and identification of organic content),
microbiological analysis (bacteriological examination and algal counts) and chemical analysis
of sediment.
Water Characteristics and Quality
*   Phvsico-chemical Analysis
Table 5-21 presents the results of physico-chemical measurements of water samples collected
at selected sites namely no. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. Values of water temperature, pH and dissolved
oxygen content do not reveal the presence of any significant variation in-between the water
samples collected at given sites and are found within nornal range. In addition, Electrical
conductivity of water ranges between 388 and 401 rmiho/cm and water transparency at
various sampling sites shows values range between 90 cm and 100 cm which is in agreement
with the relatively low values of suspended solids which range between 9 mg/I (Site 4) and 18

mg/I (Sile2 & Site 3). Values of COD were found relatively high especially at sites no. 3 and
no. 4 while values of BOD were found relatively low.
Results of total solids (TS) and total dissolved solids (TDS) are within normal range for water
derived from the Nile river, and no material differences exist in between water quality at
various sites.
Values of total alkalinity are almost in the same range. These results are in agreement with the
general trend of the pH values. Meanwhile, the concentrations of chlorides, sulfate and
nitrates do not reveal significant change in water quality.
Concentration of sodium ions in the Nile waters is generally low and sodium contents of water
samples approach each other. Variation in concentration of potassium do not show material
differences along the 5 sampling sites and range between 4 and 6 mg/I. Concentration of
calcium ions attain higher values compared to magnesium which is general characteristic of
the Nile waters. The concentration and distribution of anions and cations in the water near the
Kuraymat site are within the range of the Nile river water. Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)
shows values range between 26 mg 02/1 (Site 2) and 79 mg 02/1 (Site 3), and values of
Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) are very low at all sampling sites and do not exceed 6
mg/I.
* Organic Content of Nile WVaters at Kuraymat
Results presented in Table 5-22 reveal that water samples collected at all sites are almost free
from phenolic compounds and chlorinated hydrocarbons. Total hydrocarbons show its high
value of 21.2 jig/l at Site 3. Values of polyaromatic hydrocarbons, however, are relatively very
low and range between 1.82 gg/l and 2.5 jg/I Oil and grease content of water samples is
under the Law 48 of 1982 at all sampling sites and ranges between 1.9 mg/I (Site 1) and 3.6
mg'l (Site 3).
* Heavy Metals Content
Table 5-23 shows that iron and copper concentrations are not detected in water samples of
Kuraymat Nile waters. The concentration of chromium amounts to <0.02 mg/l and zinc ranges
between 0.024 and 0.047 mg/I . In general, heavy metals do not present any significant level in
Kuraymat Nile waters.
*   Bacteriological Examination
Results of bacteriological examination of water samples are given in Table 5-24.
Bacteriological indicators of faecal pollution are detected in all samples. Total coliforms range
between 1.7 x 102 / 100 ml (Site 4) and 5.0 x 102/100 ml (Site 3) and faecal coliforms reach
maximum value of 51.1 x 102/100 ml at Site 2 and amount to 0.8 x 102 ml at Site 4. Total
bacterial counts at 22°C range between 1.0 x 102 / ml (Site 4) and 3.0 x 102/ ml (Site 5),
whereas counts at 37°C show a relative counter trend at Site 5 ( 2.5 x 102 /ml) as well as at

Site 4 ( 8.6 x I 021ml). It is seen that the highest values of bacteriological indicators of faecal
pollution recorded at site no. 3 may be attributed to the close of site no. 3 to ihe Nile river
bank.
* Algal Counts
The g!eneral distribution of algal groups and their counts in water samples are given in Table
5-25. In general, diatoms represent the higher counts and range between 4256 and 4360
organismstml. Green algal count ranges between 200 (Site 2) and 260 (Site 4) organisms/ml
whereas blue-green algae represent the lowest algal population and range between 126 (Site 2)
and 148 (Site 4) organisms/ml. In general, total algal count ranges between 4592 (Site 1) and
4768 (Site 4) organisms/mI. Algal counts and genera distribution matches the general trend to
be found in the Nile river.
Sediment Chiaracteristics
*   Organic Content
Results given in Table 5-26 reveal the general characteristics of sediments with respect to
their COD, extractable organic matter, oil and grease, total hydrocarbons, chlorinated
hydrocarbons and polyaromatic hydrocarbons. COD Values of sediments collected at Sites
3, 4 and 5 are very high indicating the presence of high organic content compared to Site 2
and Site I where the least value is attained (47620 mg 02/1). Extractable organic matter ranges
between 425 mg/kg at Site I and 755 mg/kg at Site 3. Values of oil and grease follow the
general trend attained by extractable organic matter where the least value is recorded at Site 1
(328 mg'kg) and the highest value is 600 mg/kg at Site 3. Total hydrocarbons attain maximum
concentration at Site 4 (53.8 mg/kg) and the lowest value at Site 1 (29.8 mglkg). Value of
polyaromatic hydrocarbons range between 2.53 uglkg at Site 1, and 12.73 ug/kg at Site 4. The
concentration of chlorinated hydrocarbons exhibit the lowest value of 4.13 mglkg at Site I and
the highest value at Site 3 (8.39 mg/kg). As a general trend organic content of sediments at
Site 3 attains the lowest level compared to the other sites.
* Heavv Metals Content
Zinc is the major metal to be present in sediments of Kurayrnat Nile waters. The concentration
ranges between 2.0 mg"kg and 3.86 mg/kg as given in Table 5-27. The concentration levels of
lead, chromium and nickel are relatively low and approach each other. Cadmium, however, is
detected to be of the lowest concentrations among all. In general, the presence of heavy metals
is attributed to ihe tendency of sediment to adsorb these components and other pollutants
through a very long period.

5.6 AQUATIC ECOLOGY
5.6.1 Aquatic Flora
Background
The Nile river control structures built during this century and earlier caused certain changes in
the water habitat: rates of water flow, silt load and hence turbidity and erosive power, and
chemistry of water. The development of industry and human settlements, mostly within the
inhabited Nile Valley and the Delta, caused excessive discharge of industrial and domestic
effluents into the water bodies. These ecological changes caused changes in the flora of these
water bodies. For instance the submerged plant Af)riophyllum spicatum was not included in
earlier records of Nile plants (Simpson, 1932; Hassib, 1951; Tackholm, 1956 and 1974;
Moursy, 1976; Tawadrous. 1981 and Fayed, 198S). The evidently vigorous growth of other
submerged species all over the Nile and its branches may be due to reduction of silt load
(especially during the flood) and hence reduction of turbidity. It is also noted that the
composite Ceruana pralensis, once a common plant along terraces and banks of the Nile and
major irrigation canals, is now a very rare species, probably disappearing.
Within the complex of habitat types that may be grouped under this Irrigation Drainage
Network category and its associated habitats, the following sets have been recognized (EEAA,
1993).
.4quaic Habitat Types
*  Aquatic-Submerged (EI-Fiky, 1974):
This includes the following community types: Ceratophyllum demersum, Potamogeton
pectinatus, Potamogeton crispus, Elodea canadensis and Najas armata.
*  Aquatic Floatine (rooted):
This includes the following community types: Nymphaea coerulea, Potamogelon
niodosus, Echinochloa stagninum and Polygonum salicifolium.
*  Aquatic-Floating (free):
This includes the following community types: Eichhornia crassipes and Lemma gibba -
Spirodela polyrrhiza.
*  Emereent Reed Swamp v'egetation:
This group is associated with bank and island habitats, and includes the following
community types: Echinochloa stagninum (also group b), Typha domingensis,
Phragmites australis and Leersia hexanra.

Include: Polh'gonum salicifolium. Phagmites australis and Echinochloa stagninum.
5.6.2 Aquatic Fauna
As the project area is located 2 km east of the Nile river, an overview of the aquatic fauna is
given hereunder.
Rotifera
Rotifers are found in immense number and variety in freshwater lakes, ponds and streams.
Wayside pools, drains, and even the dirty water are prolific sources of rotifers. The free-
swimming members of the rotifers constitute a high percentage of the plankton, which is the
main food for many young and adult fishes.
In Egypt, this group is well represented in freshwater ecosystems. Nearly 118 species of
roti fers have been recorded in the River Nile (EEAA, 1995).
Protozoa
Flagellates which are capable of photosynthesis represent a basic link in the food chain of
organisms. Our knowledge of the Egyptian protozoan fauna is not sufficient and the group is
much less known than other faunal groups. The Subphyla Mastigophora, Sarcodina and
Ciliphora are represented in Egypt. They are well distributed in the River Nile and its
tributaries (EEAA, 1995).
Annelida (Earthworms & Leeches)
Freshwater annelids in Egypt include two families Obligochaeta and Hirudinea. The aquatic
forms are nearly all confined to freshwater. Aquatic oligochaetes play an important role in
reducing the great masses of aquatic vegetation to a finely comminuted condition. Some
leeches, like glossiphoniid members are known to act as intermediate hosts for certain
parasites. Others play an important role as a mean of biological control for the snail vector

parasites infecting man and other mammals. Others provide food sources for insects,
crustaceans, fish and birds. The leech species are limited and until now 19 leech species have
been recorded (E EAA, 1995).
Crustacea
Cladocera constitute the largest group of freshwater crustaceans. They live chiefly among the
weeds, clinging to plants and higher algae. Cladocera have great economic value. Together
w ith the Copepoda, they constitute the chief agency for converting the smaller algae into a
form edible by the carnivorous aquatic animals. They are themselves of great value as food
for young fishes and there is a period in the life of almost every fish when it feeds exclusively
on them. In Egypt, 43 species of Cladocera have been recorded in the River Nile and inland
lakes (EEAA, 1995).
Acarina (Miles)
Freshwater mites compose an important part of aquatic fauna. The majority of water mites are
parasitic. About 84 mite species belonging to 53 genera have been recorded in Egypt
belonging to 37 families (EEAA, 1995).
AMollusca (Bivalhes & Snails)
Mollusca species are well distributed along the Rive Nile and in inland and coastal lakes as
well as irrigation channels. They prefer living among aquatic plants and in mud. On the other
hand, 13 bivalve species have been recorded in the River Nile and its tributaries. The
following species are recorded (EEAA, 1999):
Bellamya unicolor (common), Lanistes carinatus (common), Valvata nilotica (rare),
Gabbiella senaariensis (common), Melanoides tuberulata (common), Cleopatra bulimoides
(common), Lymnaea natalensis (common), L. columella (rare), Biomphalaria alexandrina
(common), Bulinus truncatus (common), Caelatura teretiuscula (common), Sphaerium
hartmanni (common), and Pisidium amnicum (rare and has been collected near the project
site).
Much attention in this organisms was and still is given to the principal snail groups which
transmit Schistosomiasis as Bulinus spp. and Biompholaria spp., as well as Lymnaea spp,
which transmit fascioliasis (liver flukes) to animals and man.
Osteichthyes (Bony Fishes)
During recent decades, the River Nile ecosystem has been subjected to many ecological
stresses that led to significant changes in the physico-chemical properties of the water, and
consequently affected the biological ecosystem. Construction of High Dam in 1967, the
presence of large impoundments and pollution of water by domestic, industrial and
agricultural wastes are the most important factors that atTect the River Nile environment, and
its biodiverqiht The cessation of the flood destroyed many spawning and nursery grounds,

naturally found during the flood, especially for the riverine fishes. In response to these
changes, several fish species disappeared completely, while others began to show marked
decline, especially in the down stream areas, where the water is almost lentic (EEAA, 1997).
Boulenger (1907) mentioned that Loat was the first who made a fish survey of the Nile and he
recorded about 85 species, inhabiting the Egyptian Nile waters. The present number of
recorded species is 70 included under 16 families and 49 genera. Three families (i.e.
Characinidae, Cyprinidae and Siluridae) include about 70% of the species. Of the 85 species
that were previously recorded at the beginning of the present century, 15 species are extinct
and were not recorded during the last 50 years. Furthermore, due to the change in the River
regime most riverine fish are becoming rare and these represent 51 species. Only 15 species
are the most common and contribute to the freshwater production of Egypt. Cichlids (e.g.
Tilapia spp.) especially Oreochromis niloticus, Sarotherodon galilaeus, Tilapia zillui
contributes to the highest percentage of freshwater production.
Reptilia & Amphibia
Aquatic reptiles and amphibians are not well represented in Egypt. Only 4 aquatic reptile
species have been recorded in Egypt, belonging to 4 families. Three of them are considered
rare species, while the fourth one (Nile-Turtle) has disappeared during the last 30 years.
Seven amphibian species have been recorded in Egypt, belonging to 3 families and 4 genera
i.e. Bufo, Rana, Hyla and Ptychadena. Three species are common while the other 4 are rare
(EEAA, 1995).

5.7 FLORA AND FAUNA
5.7.1 Introduction
A landscape ecological approach was adopted for addressing flora and fauna within the wider
area of the proposed site. It depends on the identification of the landscape structure and
function then, determining the ecological relevance to the proposed project.
The landscape ecological approach begins with a broad scale covering the project hinterland
ecological setting, then narrows down the scale to the project area and site. Satellite remote
sensing and GIS were then the technologies of choice as they allow viewing both the broad
and fine scales of the project ecological setting and delineating the area of influence (impact
spatial dimension) of the proposed project.
Information and data on the project hinterland, area, and site were gathered from published
material, reports and Intemet searcb.
Field reconnaissance was carried out to identify area and site-specific ecological settings and
their floral and faunal communities and habitats. Photographs were also taken to illustrate the
environmental senings and to document the landscape within and around the project site.
Interviews with the NREA and the proposed power plant officials and members of the
surrounding communitv also were carried out to collect additional information.
Detailed topographic map (scale 1:50,000) of the project area was obtained to give a broader
view of the environmental setting of the project area.
Satellite image (Figure 5-43) obtained by the Landsat TM in 2000 for the project area was
acquired and processed to help identify the landscape and land use of the area. The image is
multispectral and has a 28 X 28-m spatial resolution. Accordingly, this satellite image was
digitallv  processed  to  delineate  watercourses,  urban/urbanized  features  and
agricultural/vegetation units (Figure 5-43) with the aid of the map and ground surveys.

5.7.2 General Ecology of the Project Area
The project is located on the eastern side of the Nile river at the very south of Giza
governorate.
Giza governorate has 3 main ecological sub-systems. It has some parts within the eastem
desert, a major part within the western desert and central area, which is a part of the Nile
Valley ecosystem (Figure 5-43). The project site is located on the eastem side of the Nlile
close to the road junctions leading to Zaafrana in the Red Sea (east) and to Beni-sueif to the
south.
Similar to other areas of the same nature, the project area is considered as an "edge" habitat
where two main ecosystems overlap. These two main ecosystems are the Nile Valley and the
eastern desert. Thus, such an edge habitat may express characters of both ecosystems and
ones of its own. The flora and fauna of this habitat is a mixture of valley and desert
biodiversity.
Due to limited rainfall, natural vegetation cover is usually limited and *very thin. Vegetation is
distributed along the axes of the different drainage basins in the area. As a result of the
limited vegetation growth in the eastern part of this habitat, faunal diversity is low. Along the
western part of this habitat (Nile Valley), agricultural and man-made sub-systems prevail.
In the following sections, a general account of the flora and fauna of the three sub-systems of
the project hinterland will be given, followed by a description of the biota collected and
observed in the field.
5.73 Nile Valley Subsystem
Terrestrial Flora
The Nile valley forms a densely inhabited riverine oasis of farmlands and human settlements
of all sizes (EEAA, 1993). These farmlands provide habitat for a variety of weeds and ruderal
plants in the fields, canal and drain banks, road and railway embankments, fallow fields, etc.
In addition, a large variety of field and economic crops are cultivated under agricultural
controls.
Terrestrial Fauna
WVith most of the land area of Egypt being either arid or hyperarid (Ayyad and Ghabbouir,
1986), the availability of water as the most critical resource (Noy-Mfeir, 1984), plays a
decisive role in determining the habitability of the desert. Differences in rainfall as well as
landforn features which control the redistribution and availability of water from local or
remote sources, are therefore of extreme importance in determining the nature, distribution
and abundance of plant and animal life. Primary production, which is also greatly influenced
by the water availability, determines the basic food and shelter resource on which the structure
and functioning of animal communities depend.

New & Renewable Energy Authority (NREA)          150 MWe Kuraymat Integrated Solar C.C. Project
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
NW'ithin any given habitat, animal species richness and diversity are mostly determined by the
abundance and diversity of available resources, the extent that species use these resources, and
the degree that these resources are shared (MacArthur and MacArthur, 1961; Pianka, 1967 and
1973).
An attempt to identify habitat types of land fauna in Egypt must therefore be based, not only
on geographical, geomorphological and climatological features of the habitat, but also on the
characteristics of its vegetation cover. Accordingly, the desert vegetation categories suggested
by Kassas (1970) are used herein, with some modifications, to identify four basic habitat
types. Each of these basic habitat types is represented by numerous examples at several
geographical areas in Egypt. Every example, however, may be modified to a greater or lesser
extend by local features which in turn, give each habitat its unique ecological characteristics.
These characteristics are what determine the type of animal habitats that include the
following:
* Run-on-habitats
* Diffuse habitats
* Accidental habitats
* Restricted habitats
The proposed project site is located within the "Restricted Habitat" type which are found in
rainless country but depend on either groundwater, or water transported from remote sources.
Restricted habitats based on water brought to a rainless area by rivers or perennial streams
create river oasis with lush perennial vegetation (the project area). These river oases often
allow the development of settled agricultural societies. The Nile Valley and Delta may be
considered the largest river oasis in the world (Saleh, 1993).
This habitat type often has relatively diverse fauna as a consequence of the diversity of the
available resources, as well as that of the vegetation structure. However, with many years of
intensive human activities, the modern Nile Delta is essentially a man-made ecosystem.
Animals now inhabiting the region are those that are able to tolerate human activities or those
that can avoid contact with man. The intensive cultivation and the widespread use of
agrochemicals have eliminated many of the native animals of the region.
Amphibians and Reptiles
Four species of amphibians and 34 species of reptiles are known from the Nile Valley and
Delta. Characteristic amphibians include Bufo regularis, Ptychadena mascareniensis and
Rana ridibunda. Common reptiles include Hemidactylus turcicus, Chalcides ocelltus, Coluber
florulentus, Natrix tessellata, psammophis sibilans, Telescopus dhara, and Naja haje. Mabuya
quinquetaeniata, Chameleo africanuus, Varanus niloticus, leptotyphlops cairi, Psammophis
sibilans, Natrix tessellata, Dasypeltis scarbra, and are restricted to this habitat in Egypt
(EEAA, 1995).
Birds
Common breeding birds of the Nile Valley and Delta include 66 species (Goodman et al.,
1989). At least 14 of these are not known to breed outside that habitat. Characteristic species

include Egretta ibis, Elanus caeruleus, Milvus migrans, Falco tinnunculus, Gallinula
chloropus. Hoplopterus spinosus, Rostratula benghalensis, Streptopelia senegalensis,
Centropus senegalensis, Tyto alba, Merops orientalis, Galerida cristata, Hirundo rustica,
Motacilla flava, Prina gracilis, Corvus corone, Passer domesticus and others (EEAA, 1995;
1997).
The Nile Delta wvith their abundance of water and food available for birds, provide an
important, relatively, easy and safe route for trans-Saharan, paleartic migration. Huge
numbers of individuals of many species utilize this route during both spring and autumn
migrations. The region also provides wintering habitats for large populations of many
palearctic migratory species (Mfeinertzhagen. 1930; Goodman et al., 1989). However, the
migratory routes don't cross over the project area.
Mammals
Forty mammalian species are known to occur in the Nile Valley and Delta (Osborn and
Helmy, 1980; Wassif et al., 1984 and Qumsiyed. 1985) at the present time. Among these the
most characteristic species are Hemiechinus auritus, Crocidura flavescens, Arvicanthis
niloticus, Rattus rattus, R. norvegicus, Mus masculus, Canis aureus, Vulpes vulpes, Herpestes
ichneumon and Felis sylvestris. Wild camivores have suffered a great deal of decline in the
recent years as a result of intense urban development and secondary poisoning with pesticides
widely used to control Arvicanthis niloticus and other rodent pests (EEAA, 1995; 1993).
5.7.4 Eastern Desert Sub-system (Northern Limestone Plateau)
Flora
Plant life in this area subject of many studies: Sch%%einfurth (1901), Stocker (1926-27),
Montasir (1938), Kassas and Girgis (1970,1972), Batanouny (1963) etc. These studies explain
the close relations between landform and plant life. In this extremely arid territory (average
annual rainfall in the Cairo area = 25 mm.; further south rainfall is much less). Landform
controls the re-distnbution of water. Plant growth maps area that receive runoff water, vigor
and physiognomv relate to amount of available water; revenue depends on catchment area and
storage depends on depth of surface deposits.
Successional development of wadi vagetation (Kassas and Girgis, 1965) seems to follow a
six-stage sequence: barren rock surface (chasmophytes, Slachys aegptiaca), shallow coarse
deposits (succulents, Zygophyllum spp.) deeper mixed deposits (woody undershrubs, Zilla
spinosa), silt terraces (grassland growth, Pennisetum dichotomum), deeper terraces (scrub,
Lycium arabicum), climax (Tamarix sp. on soft deposits; Acacia sp. on coarse deposits).
The boundary between the irrigated farmlands and the barren desert is often abrupt, except for
sites menaced by the encroachment of blown sand.
*  Inland Dunes: Plant life dominated by Urgina maritima, Tlzjmelaea hirsuia, etc.

*  Summits of ridges (rocky sites) with chasmophytes and lithophy tes including
*  Thymus capitatus, Globularia arbica, Heliantheinum lippii, etc.
*  Intermediate slopes with Gymnocarpos decandrumn, Reaumeria vermiculata, etc.

Fauna
This desert extends from the Red Sea mountains in the east to the Nile Valley in the west. The
main groups of animals in this sub-system include:
* Reptiles: In wadis draining the limestone plateau in the northern sector of this
desert, common reptiles include Pt,odactvlus gutatus, .4canihodacnvlus boskianus,
B'romads x aegyptius, and Cerastes cerastes.
*  Birds: Resident avifauna of this desert is composed of 15 species of true desert
birds, such as Cursorius cursor, Pterocles coronattus, Ammomanes cincturus,
Corvus ruficollis and Emberiza striolata.
*  Mammals: Lepus capens is, Gelrbillus gerbillus and Dipodillus dasvurus.
5.7.5 Western Desert Sub-system (The Nliddle Limestone Plateau)
Flora
This part of the Western Desert is extremely arid, practically rainless and perennial plant life
is confined to, and associated with, the oases where water may flow to the surface under
artesian pressure. Pools may be formed around some wells.
Outside the oases plant life, mostly ephemeral, depends on the chance occasion of cloud-
bursts, incidents that may happen once in several years: accidental type of vegetation (Kassas,
1966).
Fauna
Reptiles: Information on the reptiles and amphibians of the western desert is almost non
existent (EEAA, 1993). However, a few species of reptiles are regular dwellers of dry
sabkhas such as Acanthodactvlus scutellatus and Varanus griseus.
Birds: Birds are in greater numbers in the oases and depressions of the westem desert. The
main species include Phoenicopterus ruber, Aquifa rapax belisarius, Locustella naevia naevia
and Oenanthe lugens.
MIammals twelve mammalian species have been recorded from this habitat type in Egypt,
with the two dipodils Dipodillus henleyi and D. amoenus being the most characteristic

species. None of these species, however, is restricted to this habitat type. The Nile Rat
Arvicanrhis niloticus and the Jungle Cat Felis chaus, which are characteristic mammals of
riverine habitats, are found in some of the salt marshes of Ehe WesEtem Desert.
5.7.6 Nature Conservation
No protected areas are found in the vicinity of the proposed development The only natural
protectorate in Giza as a whole is "El Hassanah Dome" along the Cairo-Alexandria desert
road. It is protected for its unique geological structures but no ecological significance. In
addition. no proposals of developing protected areas anywhere near the plant site.
5.7.7 Ecology of the project site
The site is located within an edge environ where 3 habitats overlap abruptly. These 3 habitats
are the Nile, agricultural lands and the eastern desert. The site boundaries are: agricultural
lands to the south, desert to the north and east, Helwan-Beni-sueif road to the west and the
Nile to the west across the Helwan-Beni-sueif road (Figure 5-43).
The site is located within an area of mining and crushing of chalky limestone, characteristic of
the geology/geomorpholoy of the area (Figure 5-44). Several of such activities are scattered
around the site, a few are also considered near. To the western direction of the plant site
located is a residential community. Further south-west is a new orchard field where a major
flood catchment basin is running to its south (Figure 5-45).
To its far west, within the Nile, is a small sandy island where thin vegetation grows along its
boundaries (Figure 5-46). The same figure also depicts the boom that is installed at the
southern end of the existing plant close to the cooling water intake. The boom acts as a
dissipater of the floating vegetation (Eichhornia crassipes) so they do not block the screens of
the intake (Figure 5-46).
Flora
Apart from the man-made agriculture (palm trees, orchards, vegetable, etc.), no natural
vegetation was detected except in the wadi (drainage basins) of flash floods. There are two
main wadis one is running to the north and one is rurming to the south of the plant site. The
southern wadi (Figure 5-45) has green vegetation mainly reed plants (Typha sp.). The wadi to
the north west is bare dry and all vegetation is dead (Figure 5-47). Rodents' burrows were
found in many locations around the westem area with associated arthropod species.
The power plant site itself is a totally within the desert lands. It is suggested that it fully
planted with omamental plants for landscaping purposes including for example: Afangifera
indica, Ficus nitidia and Delonix regia as it is already existed in the present Kuraymar
ihermalpowerplant (Figure 5-48).

Fauna
Animal species diversity in a given habitat is also directly related to the structural diversity of
that habitat (Lack, 1944; MacArthur, 1958; MacArthur and MacArthur, 1961, Pianka, 1967
and 1986). Spatially complex habitats support richer biotic communities than structurally
simpler areas. The more spatial heterogeneity there is, the more micro-habitats and the more
potential resources-use niches into which species can differentiate and specialize and
consequently more species can coexist (Pianka, 1986). As the plant cover can greatly affect
the structural diversity of an area, animal species richness and diversity have been found to
correlate with the structural and life formn diversity of the X egetation. As wider surroundings of
the project site are characterized as a man-made patch, its vegetation cover is considerably
limited. In fact, this is reflected on its low biodiversity and faunal species richness.
The wider site surroundings contain different arthropods; mainly insect species; and birds.
Insects include butterflies, grasshoppers, dragonflies, ants and aquatic insects. The avifauna
includes sparrows (Passer domesticus), doves (Sirepiopelia senegalensis aegiptiaca), Egretta
sp. and spur-winged plover (Haplopterus spinosus). Very few numbers of birds were
observed, and no nesting or breeding was detected. In addition, very few numbers of rodent
burrows were identified.
The highest number of species were those of the freshwater snails collected from the Nile
edge at the water intake point of the existing Kuraymat power plant as well as the arthropod
species collected from the area as a whole. Table 5-28 provides useful information on
Anhropod species.

5.8   AMBIENT NOISE
5.8.1 Noise Sensiti% e Receivers
The major land use surrounding the site is agricultural (to the south) and residential (to the
west), supplemented by the noise that may be generated from traffic on the Es-Saff£Beni-sueif
road to the very west.
Residential properties have been identified by the existing power plant community against the
western side of the proposed site boundaries and there are no other population centers within
one km of the proposed site.
Due to the existing operational power plant and scattered quarries in the wider area around the
site, and irrespective of the rural/desert nature of the proposed site itself. the area is
categorized as "IndustTial areas" with respect to Egyptian ambient noise standards (see Table
2-5 in Section 2.6.4).
5.8.2 Ambient Noise Levels
In view of the presence of residential communit) in the western part against west boundary of
the proposed site and the presence of adjacent rural setting a noise survey was carried out on
the site of the proposed plant by MB Consultant in June 2004. The main existing noise
sources on, and surrounding the site, were found to comprise the following:
Existing operational Kuraymat two 2x600 MWe capacity power plant units;
* vehicular traffic on the Es-Saff/Beni-sueif road; and
* prevailing wind.
Baseline measurements were taken using a calibrated Brnel and Kjaer Type 2260 precision
sound analyser, in a "free-field" location (see Figure 5-49) away from any reflective surfaces
and 1.2m above the ground. The average ambient level recorded at the power plant site in the
absence of moving vehicles on the Es-Saff/Beni-sueif road was LAq 43.9 dB. Table 5-29 and
Figure 5-50 present the results giving the sound levels for each third-octa% e band.

5.9   LAND USE AND LANDSCAPE CHARACTER
5.9.1 The Proposed Site
Field surveys. conducted by NPREA during July, September & December 2003 and verified by
E&E in January and March 2004, were undertaken to exanine the site location and its
surrounding area.
The survey showed that there are no significant terrestrial ecosystems on or near the proposed
site. The ecosystems present are typical of those throughout the rural and desert lands of
Egypt. Moreover, the site currently houses an uncultivated bare area, mostly sand dominated
with spatially heterogeneous vegetation cover. This site is situatated in a irregular-shaped
fenced piece of land (Annex D provides with the land acquisition documents).
Figure 5-43 shows satellite image, with a high spatial resolution 28x28m, of the project
hinterland illustrating the surrounding rural and desert landscape. It delineates the boundaries
of the project site, its relation to adjacent landscape and some details of the field survey.
5.9.2 Overview of the Surrounding Land Use
The site is situated in a generally rustic, low-density rural/desert setting within the Kuraymat
wide-area (Please refer to Figures 5-4 through 5-11 and Figures 5-13, 5-45 & 5-47 for the
photos of the site). Land uses in the immediate vicinity of the site is limited to agriculture in
the south and in the wider area agriculture is limited to the floodplain between the marsh area
and the plateau, and in wadi confluences. There is a cemetery and a small village to the south-
west, and another small village to the north-west.
The cultivated areas around the power plant are utilized by farming families. None of the
families live on the land, but commute or walk to their small plots from nearby villages.
Typical agriculture crops grown in this area of the valley include wheat, com, oranges, grapes,
tomatoes, and other fruits and vegetables preferred by the individual farming families.
Normally, two crops per year produced on a rotational basis. Irrigation water is provided by
canals from central pumping station at Kuraymat village downstream. Water is taken out of
the canal with hand pumps, sluices, or small portable gas-operated pumps. Water is also
pumped directly from the Nile. No potable water supply is located in the immediate area.
Markets for crops are located in Es-Saff, Beni-sueif, Cairo, and local villages. Crops are
transported to the markets by truck or bus.
Because of the sparseness of forage, livestock grazing in the plateau area above the Nile is
extremely limited. Grazing in this area usually occurs only during or following a wet period.
The villaoe south-west about 5.5 kilometer and nearest, from this side, to the power plant site,
Dayr al-Mlaymun. has a population of about 3,000. About 3.0 km north of Dayr al-Maymun is

Ezbet EL-Hagg Ghanem, with its population less than 200. The principal occupation is
construction labor subsidized with farming. Agricultural lands owned by al -Maynun villagers
are far south-west of the site. The cemetery next to the village actually is for the city of El-
Wasta on the west bank of the Nile. Several thousand graves were estimated to occur within
the cemetery boundaries. The north boundary of the cemetery is approximately 2.5 kilometers
from the site boundary. The plant facilities nearest the southem boundary of the site are
located about 0.75 kilometers to the north-east, providing additional distance to the cemetery.
In the Nile upstream of the power plant site is Kurayrnat Island, which has a population of
about 2,500 people. Their chief occupation is farming. Access to the island is by boat only.
Kuraymat village is 3 km north-west of the site and serves as the closest commercial and
go% emment center for the proposed project area. Kuraymat village has almost 7,000 residents
(see Table 5-40) and a visit to the v illage was conducted during March 2004 site visits.
Figures 5-2(A) shows a detailed map for land uses of the proposed site surrounding area.

5.9.3 Landscape Character
The landscape character of the site and its surrounding area is determined and characterized
by:
*  the near to bankal location and the influence of the Nile river;
* the flat terrain and rural character of the Kuraymat zone;
*  the panially' vegetated, partially desert surroundings, and
*  existance of residential urban-style plant community and residential rural-style
spots and road linkages.
The hybrid character of the green cultivation and desert land of the region is the main
influence on the area. However, despite the scale of the rustic development, this would ensure
that the landscape is visually able to accommodate those intrusive features without significant
impact. Given the solar field with its reflector-mirrors, the landscape may gain a quite nice
shape.

5.10 TRAFFIC AND TRANSPORT
5.10.1 Introduction
Road transport provides the main mode of transport in the Kuraymat zone. The proposed
power plant site will be accessed via the Es-Saff Beni-sueif road from the north and
GizaBeni-sueif which crosses the Nile to the east bank and then follow Beni-sueif desert
road to the north. These two roads connect the proposed power plant site to the major
road network as shown in Figure 5-51.
Information on traffic conditions and flows have been obtained from primary
assessment work conducted by the "Egypt National Institute of Transport" (ENIT),
Ministry of Transport, during September 2003, and from observations made during site
visit in early January 2004.
5.10.2 Main Access Roads
Road Network
The road network surrounding the power plant is confined to two access roads.
The shortest path to access ISCC Kuraymat power plant from Cairo is by traveling
along AlCorniche Corridor till Et-Tebbin, then joining Es-Saff desert road till the
intersection of EsSafflBeni-sueif road and El-Zafarana road. The main entrance of the
power plant is about 2km away from the Beni-sueif road.
There is another path which is around 60 km longer than the previous one. This path
starts from Giza to El-Badrashein, then to E1-Ayyat, El-Wasta and finally Beni-sueif via
Upper Egypt agriculture road along the west bank of the Nile River. From Beni-sueif, it
crosses the Nile to the east bank and then follows Beni-sueif desert road 30 km to the
north till the main entrance of the power plant. This path could be used as an alternative
path only when Benisueif road is blocked for traffic, as it sometimes happens when there
is an accident. However, this bath could be shortened by 60km if a new bridge over the
Nile river were constructed at the Kuraymat.
Recently additional stander access desert roads are available from Cairo, Helwan, and
Tebbin direction to Beni-sueif crossing Zafarana- Kuraymat road.
The access paths to the power plant site are illustrated in Figure 5-51.
The ISCC Kuraymat power plant has its unique location concerning the road network
since it lies nearby Giza Beni-sueif regional road, and there is no other regional or local
roads passing nearby. Therefore, it was necessary to examine the geometric
characteristics as well as the available traffic data for this road as part of the traffic
assessment analysis. Moreover, a classified traffic count survey was conducted at a
section of this road and the results are presented in the next sectionL

The roadway section of GizaBerni-sueif regional road is a 2-lane 2-way single carriageway
with a total xx idth of 11 m (including 2 m unpaved shoulder on each side). Its pavement is
generally in a good condition. The road serves both regional passenger and freight tratfic
to/from Upper Egypt. Furthermnore, sections of this road passing through the nearby villages
are heavily used by local traffic. The pavement conditions along these sections are terribly
deteriorated and road humps are recurrent and very close to each other. They are intentionallv
constructed by local authorities as a measure to reduce speed along the sections passing
through the nearby villages. The lane capacity for this regional road is in the range of 1000-
1200 vehicle/hour.
As for traffic data on this road (for the section near El-Ayyat, around 40km from the ISCC
Kuraymat power plant), a time series on Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT) records for
the period 1992 - 2002, was obtained from the General Authority for Roads, Bridges and Land
Transport (GARBLT). Also, monthly traffic variations for the year 2002 as well as hourly
traffic variations dunrng the seven weekdays of September 2002 were obtained from the same
source.
AADT data is presented graphically in FLgure 5-52, while the source data is given in Table 5-
30 below.

Figuire 5-53 represents the average daily traffic for each month of the year 2002 on GizwBeni-
sueif road during 2002. The Figure shows that except for January and April, the average daily
traffic volume for the rest months of the year is 13,000 vehicles/day or more. The month of
September records the highest average daily traffic volume over the whole year i.e. 13,756
vehicles/day). This is followed by July and August wvih an average daily traffic volume of
13,688 and 13,566 vehicles.day respectively. This result indicates that the average daily traffic
volume on GizaJBeni-sueif road increases slightly during summer months. Moreover, the
average daily traffic volume during February, March and May approximately represents the
Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT) for the year 2002.
Hourly traffic variations during the weekdays of September 2002 (which represents the
highest month during 2002) are presented graphically in FigureS-54.
Figure 5-54 shows that the hourly traffic volumes during the seven days of the week on
Giza/ Beni-sueif road almost follow the same pattem with two obvious peaks: morning peak
and evening peak. On the one hand, the moming peak traffic volume is the highest on
Saturday and the lowest on Friday compared with other weekdays. On the otber hand, the
evening peak traffic volume on Thursday is the highest among the weekdays. Also the
evening hourly traffic volumes (after 7:00pm) on Friday are slightly higher than similar traffic
volumes during the same period for other weekdays except for Thursday.
The main conclusion that emerges from the daily traffic pattern along Giza/Beni-sueif road is
that traffic volume obviously increases on Thursday evening because people from different
places along this road return home to spend the week end with their families and relatives. and
on Friday evening and Saturday morning for returning back to their work.

PubLic Transport Service
The only public transport mode serving people living and working in ihis area and the nearby
farms and villages is pick up vehicles, which provides a poor and inconvenient service with a
high occupancy rate. The occupancy rate is almost double the vehicle capacity since some
passengers hang on the back of the vehicle, while some others ride on the top of the vehicle
with half price).
5.10.3 Regional Roads
The ISCC Kuraymat power plant will be supplied by a number of heavy equipment imported
from a number of seaport during construction (e.g. Alexandria and Ain-Sukhna Ports).
Therefore, it was necessary to examine the power plant as part of the tratTic assessment
analysis. This analysis is composed of two elements: description of the physical roads
geometric. and traffic data analysis.
The only regional road providing access to the new power plant from the different parts of the
country is Giza/Beni-sueif Desert Highway. Therefore, access from ports to the power plant
will make use of other regional roads linked to Greater Cairo Region then to GlzaSBeni-suelf
High% av. These roads include Cairo/Alexandria Agriculture Highway, Cairo/Alexandria
Desert Highway, and Cairo/Suez Desert Highway. The location of these roads is shown in
Figures 5-51 and 5-57, and their geometric characteristics are described in Table 5-31.
As for traffic data on these roads, a time series on average annual daily traffic (AADT)
records on Cairo/Alexandria Highways (during the period 1990 - 2003) were obtained from
the General Authority for Roads, Bridges and Land Transport (GARBLT). These data are
given in Table 5-32. The table clearly illustrates that Cairo/Alexandria Agriculture Highway
carries much higher traffic volumes than Cairo/Alexandria Desert Highway (around fourfolds
on average during this period). Table 5-33 illustrates, also, the average annual daily traffic
records on Cairo/Suez, Cairo/Ismailia and Giza/Beni-sueif Desert Highways during the period
1997 - 2002).
Traftic growth on Giza / Beni-sueif Desert Highway during the period 1992 - 2002 is in the
range of 0-18% per annum, with an overall average annual value of 4.5%. As depicted in the
table, AADT also had a sudden drop in 1997. On the contrary, AADT during the period 1998-
2000 was almost the same, then it increased by 18% and 7% during the two successive years
respectively.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
Traffic Sunreys
As part of the evaluation of existing conditions, a 16 hour classified traffic count was
conducted on a typical working day (i.e. Tuesday, September 16, 2003) at Giza / Beni-sueif
desert road across the road segment west to the power plant, i.e. Kuraymat / Beni-sueif
segment.
The counts were manually carried out in order to depict the variation of the daily flow, peak
flow and timing, and existing traffic composition. Traffic was split into the normal vehicle
categories: private car, taxi, microbus and minibus, van and pick up, private / public bus, light
and heavy trucks, and others.
Figure 5-55 illustrates the fluctuation of traffic flow during the 16 hours of the survey on both
directions of travel for Kuraymat / Beni-sueif section.
The total 16 hour traffic flow was recorded as 1280 vehicles in the direction from Kuraymat to
Beni-sueif, and 1307 vehicles in the opposite direction. The traffic volume on this road
section is considered very low compared with the section near El-Ayyat along the same road,
where traffic volume at El-Ayyat section is almost fourfolds that at Kuraymat section. Figure
5-55 depicts that the two directions of travel are almost balanced, yet they don't follow the
same pattern. On the one hand, the direction to Beni-sueif has two obvious peaks, i.e. the
moming peak between 7:00 and 8:00 am and the evening peak between 6:00 pm and 7:00 pm.
On the other hand, the direction from Beni-sueif to Kuraymat has a moming peak between
8:00 am and 9:00 am, and then traffic fluctuates until 7:00 pm before it steadily goes down.
The hourly traffic volume during the fluctuation period could increase the morning peak hour
traffic volume for this direction. The maximum traffic flow during the three peaks is given in
Table 5-34. It can be seen that the highest flow in both directions of travel occurs during the
morning peak.

Figure 5-56 illustrates traffic composition observed over the 16-hour survey period for both
directions of travel for Kuraymat/Beni-sueif Road. It shows that van/pick-ups and heavy
trucks have a significant share of traffic composition along this road (38% and 23%/O of the
total traffic volume respectively). This is followed by ligh trucks, passenger cars and
Micro/Minibuses with 14%, 11% and 10% respectively. Taxis, buses and others only
represent 4% of the total traffic along this road.

Road Inventory Using Video Mf apping System (VMS)
In addition to the classified traffic survey explained above, road inventory sunrevs were
carried out for local roads around the power station in order to assess their existing conditions.
Road inventory surveys were carried out by visual inspection and by video mapping system
(VMS) (Figure 5-57). In the VNIS, the study area map was digitized to a computer and a
process of checking was carried out. Thereafter, the local surrounding roads were video taped
(using digital cameras) and then transferred to the computer. The next step was preparation of
ARCVIEW file data by importing the taped data and carrying out a number of adjustments.
The produced maps were then supported with a database for geometric characteristics of the
road network as well as the current traffic volumes at different survey sites. The result of this
effort is summarized in Table 5-35 below.

Notes:
(1) These figures represent the results of the 16 hour traffic count survey conducted on Tuesday, 16 Sept. 2003.
It is worthnentioning that although the pavement condition along this section of the
Kuraymat/Beni-sucif road is good, there is a great variation in its gradients particularly few
hundred meters before the power plant reach, which would completely obstruct the line of
sight and might cause serious accidents.
Travel Time Survey
Travel speed and travel time are considered the most important operational characteristics of
road links. These two parameters are quite useful in defining the operational efficiency of road
links and the different causes of traffic delay at critical spots, such as road intersections,
pedestrian crossing and railway crossing. This would help analyzing and solving traffic
problems at such critical spots and hence mitigating traffic delay.
In order to measure the average travel time and speed on the access road leading to the power
plant, an observation vehicle moving among the traffic flow with the normal traffic speed was
used. Both travel time and travel distances are recorded using stopwatch and the vehicle
kilometer respectively. Delays at mid-block (if any) were also recorded as well as causes of

delay. These procedures were carried out five times in each direction of flow during morning
peak on a typical working day (i.e. Tuesday, September. 16, 2003) along the section of
Giza Bcni-suei f road between the power plant and its intersection uwith El-Zafarana road.
Table 5-36 summaries the results of travel time survey for this section. These results indicate
that the average travel speed for both directions of travel during morning peak is 70 kmhlr.
This is considered a good speed and would be referred to the lower traffic volume along this
section. Since no mid-block exists along this road section, no travel delay has been
expernenced during the survey period.

5.11 ARCHAEOLOGICAL, HISTORIC AND CULTURAL HERITAGE
There is no available information which identifies any archaeological, historic or cultural
remains of significance on the site. This is supported by the present situation which designates
the wider area of the site as the one that has been thoroughly investigated and surveyed before
since early nineties of the last century as containing one of the candidate sites that have been
exposed to selection process.
Historically, the lower Upper Egypt Region has been occupied by a number of civilizations, in
particular by pharaonic populations, the Greeks, Romans, Copts and Moslems. In the northem
part of lower Upper Egypt at Giza city, which is about 65 km far from the site, there is a
highly rich archaeological and historic center created by the existence of pyramids and sphinx.
Other significant archaeological sites are sprinkled around in surrounding areas such as
sackkara pyramid.
The archaeological sites and areas reflect the importance that the Egyptian Govermment
attaches to preserving the wealth of historical monuments and sites of Egypt's cultural
heritage.
However, a "preliminary archaeological assessment for the Kuraymat, Egypt feasibility study"
was undertaken in February 1991 by "Office of Public Archaeology, Boston University". The
goals of the assessment were: 1) to identify recorded archeological sites within the project
area and its vicinity; and 2) to assess the potential archaeological sensitivity of the project
area. The study outcomes could be summarized as follows (see Annex II):
"Because of major geographical differences, the Fayum and the west bank of the Nile in the
region of El-Kuraymat have much more extensive archaeological evidence than the east bank,
where El-Kuraymat is located. Lake Moeris provided water for extensive irrigation projects in
the Fayum, and to the east of this a very wide strip of land is cultivable between the Bar Yusef
canal and the Nile. In contrast, the east bank has a very narrow floodplain wvith the limestone
fornation of the low desert beginning less than 1 km east of the Nile in some places".
"While the west bank has a rich and well-documented archaeological history, with sites
spanning all periods of Egyptian prehistory and history (and even paleontological specimens
dating back millions of years), the east bank is poorly represented in the archaeological record.
Sites from the Neolithic and Greco-Roman periods have been found on the east side in the
vicinity of the project area, although pharaonic sites seem to be only rarely reported there. An
important track leading to the Red Sea also begins a few kilometers south of the project area;
this track is at least 1500 years old. No sites have been reported within the El-Kuraymat
project area".

5.12.1 Population and Demography
The project site is located at the very south zone of Giza Govemorate, adjacent to the
northern territory of the Beni-sueif Govemorate, on east side of the River Nile, about
2km distant from its bank, and close to the road running approximately parallel to the
eastern bank of the Nile river. The total area of the Giza Govemorate is 85,153 km2, out
of which 1,156 km2 is inhabited by population of 5,427,000 (according to CAPMAS
estimates of population by govemorates in 1/112003). The population at the Kuraymat
village is approximately 7,000.
The total population of Giza Govemorate, including all zones (North, East, Middle,
West, South) was estimated as 5,207,047 in 2002, which indicates, when compared to
estimates of 1/1/2003, an increase of around 4.22% over 2001 figures.
Under the proposals set out in the Govemorate's Development Plan, the population of
the Kuraymat zone is likely to increase with the development of new industrial,
commercial and residential businesses and is expected to reach about 8,200 by 2008.

The labor force of Giza Governorate is around 1,449,922 with unemplovment, including
recently un-employed university and high school graduates, at around 4.49% in 2002. Table
5-41 gives labor force data for Giza Govemorate.
In Giza Govemorate, around 26.59% of the Goverorate total population forms the active work
force, while in the Kuraymat zone this ratio reaches about 50.71 %. This labor pool is
comprised of employees of agricultural activities small industrial activities (extraction of plant
oils, cotton ginning and combacting, primitive chemicals, food, textiles, provender, ... etc.)
and employees of small business operators. Around 19% of the total labor pool can be
categorized as skilled, having been trained as manufacture technicians. Table 5-42 and Table
5-43 present some details on the manufacturing establishments as well as the industrial labor
force of Giza Govemorate in the year 2002.
Portion of the Kuraymat's economy centers on small businesses which comprise a part of the
private activities sector. Table 5-44 indicates these small businesses. Also, Table 5-45 gives
an overiew about new projections for investment in Giza Govemorate.

5.12.3 Income Distribution and Socio-economic Profile
There is no published information concerning the income distribution and socio-economic
profile of the population within the Giza Governorate area. However, fieldwork carried out,
suggests that the local population of the Giza Governorate is composed of a mix of
agricultural and manual workers.
In discussions with Govemorate representatives in February 2004, it was suggested that
manual construction work is generally undertaken by migrant labor as there is little indigenous
labor available (or w illing) to carry out this work. Migrants, often from Upper Egypt, travel to
any other area within Egpt attracted by the employment possibilities in this area. They are not
actively recruited from outside the area by development companies. The migrants remain in
the area until employment prospects draw them elsewhere. This migrant labor process is
common in Egypt. All Govemorate officials consulted expressed that facilities (housing,
public and social services etc.) in the Kuraymat area will be adequate to absorb these migrants
and they with bever create any social problems in the area.
5.12.4 Government and Public Services
Basic services in Giza Govemorate include social affairs, civil defense, Nile-deliverance
force, terrestrial deliverance force, cultural main facilities, youth & sports and food security.
Table 5-46 presents number of facilities in each of these basic services.
Potable Water Supply
The N i le river is the principal source for potable water for almost the entire Giza Governorate
in the year 2002. Other sources include fast filteration and artesian wells.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
Treatment/purification stations as well as fast filtration and artesian wells provide Giza
Governorate with actual production of 1,790,000 m3/day. There are 102 artesian wells, 15 fast
tiltration facilities and 4 treatment / purification stations*.
This water is distributed via a water pipleline network and consumed in a daily rate of about
1,626,900 m3/day.
The per capita potable water consumption in Giza Governorate reaches an average of about
195 m3/day.
Irrigation demands for agriculture in the Kuraymat zone are satisfied by the Nile water
supplies from the Nile river. Irrigation includes overflowing, lifting stations or sprink-ling
irrigation. No irrigation by underground water exists. Geotechnical borings at the Kuraymat
area showed groundwater in the floodplain same depth as the Nile river. Botable water in the
Kurayrnat zone is provided with Atfieh water facility of actual capacity of 41,400 m3/day.
Table 5-47 gives some details on the Giza water resources in the year 2002.

ENVIRON4ENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
6.    ENVIRONMIENTAL IPACT ASSESSMENT
6.1   ENVIRONNMENTAL lIMPACT PROCESS
6.1.1 Introduction
This section identifies and evaluates the primary environmental impacts of the proposed
construction and operation of the ISCC Kuraymat power plant.
For each subject area (i.e. air quality, noise, .. etc.), the nature of the impact is discussed along
with its potential significance, given the existing characteristics of the site and the Egyptian
and World Bank Guidelines for New Thermal Power Plants"'. Where potentially significant
adverse impacts are identified, possible mitigation measures are suggested wherever possible,
to ameliorate the impact to an acceptable level. Where identified, beneficial or positive
impacs/effects of the project are also highlighted.
6.1.2 Assessment Miethodology
Identification and assessment of impacts has been undertaken through a process comprising
consultation, on site observations, literature review and experience of other similar projects. In
addition, several impact models were carried out as follows:
* atmospheric dispersion modeling of the stack emissions (carried out by Energy and
Environment Consultant "E&E");
* comparative study of cooling system alternatives for Integrated Solar Combined
Cycle Power Plant (carried out by the Power Generation Engineering and Services
Company "PGESCo't;
* noise levels modeling of the power plant during operation (carried out by Dr. M. El-
Bardisi, Prof of noise and vibration engineering, Ain Shams University, on behalf
of E&E);
* transport impact modeling (conducted by the Egypt National Institute of Transport,
Ministry of Transport);
* ecological assessment of impacts that may occur due to the power plant operation
(carried out by Dr. A. N. Hassan, Ain Shams University); and
* seismic modeling of impacts which may affect the power plant during its overall
life time and the physical environmental setting of the wider area of the proposed

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
6.2 AIR QUALITy
6.2.1 Introduction
One of the more significant impacts of the power plant on environment is the impact on the air
quality. During construction activities and power plant operation, several pollutants will be
released to the atmosphere including:
* intermittent fugitive emissions of dust during the construction period;
*  emissions from the exhausts of vehicles used for the transport of the workers, the
transport of construction materials and of basic equipment as well as transport during
the power plant operation (fuel trucks); and
*  stack emissions during the power plant operation (particularly of nitrogen oxides
(NOx)).
The power plant will burn natuml gas as the main fuel. As a result, emissions of particulate
matter and sulfur dioxide during )rmal operation of the power plant will be very low.
Atmospheric dispersion modeling of stack emissions has been carried out in order to assess
the impact of the power plant operation on ground level concentrations of nitrogen oxides
NOx, sulfur dioxide SO2 and carbon monoxide CO and to detennine the scale of any impact
on air quality, relative to accepted criteria.
Whilst the plume from the power station may travel ultimately over many hundreds of
kilometers, the impacts in terms of increments to ground level concentrations of nitrogen
dioxide will be confined to an area within a 20 km radius of the power station site. This then
may be regarded as the "aisbed", to use the terminology from the World Bank guidelines on
thermal power plants.
6.2.2 Atmospheric Emissious During Construction Activities
Dsw Emissions
Dust generated during constuction can be significant locally. The following activities have
-the potential to result in the generation of dust during construction:
* "earthmoving" operations on site (excavation and removal of superficial sands);
* earihworks engineering.
* site stripping.
* wind blow; and

* circulation of vehicles and trucks for the import of the construction materials, for
the export of excavated soil, for the transport of the workers and the transport
of the equipment. This is a particularly significant source of dust emissions on
unmade roads.
In the climate type experienced in this region as well as the relatively high suspended
matter concentrations of background air, existing concentrations of airborne dust are
somehow high. Relative to these existing levels, the contribution of additional dust
from construction will be low and temporal.
Other Emissions
The movements of vehicles will also result in the emission of airborne pollutants,
from the exhausts of the vehicles. The amount of such emissions will depend on the
number of the vehicles concerned, vehicle type and the volume of traffic.
Mitigation Measures
In order to limit the impact of the construction activities on air quality, the
following mitigation measures will be implemented
*  land transfers and stock piles of material will be carefully managed to
minimize the risk of wind blown material and dust;
*  the construction phase will begin with the construction of the access roads (in
order to minimize dust from vehicle movements;
*  roads during construction will be compacted and graveled if necessary;
*  roads will be maintained in good condition;
*  access to the site will be regulated;
*  vehicle speed will be limited on site; and
* vehicles will correspond with Egyptian pollutant emission standards.

6.23 Atmospheric Emissions during Power Plant Operation .Pollutants Emied
The ISCC Kuraymat power-plant will have one mode of operation with regard to
fuel type by firing with natural gas, which will be purchased from GASCO,
Affiliate Company to the Egyptian Natural Gas Holding Company (EGAS) under
a Fuel Supply Agreement.
The principal pollutant when bumnug natural gas will be oxides of nitrogen (NOx). Use of
fuel solar oil will also result in emissions of particulate matter (PM) and sulfur dioxide
(S02), along with trace amounts of some other pollutants.
The emission characteistics for the ISCC Kuraymat power plant are described below
according to the fuel supply (natural gas).
Operation with Natural Gas
The concentrations of S02 will depend directly on the sulfur content in the fuel.
The natural gas used as primary fuel is practically free from sulfur, and
emissions of S02 will be negligible when firing natural gas fuel during normal
operaIio
Egyptian regulations and requirements of the World Bank (1998) for stack
emissions will be complied with when firing with the main fuel, Table 6-2
summarizes this.

MWigation Measures
Several specific measures have been taken to reduce stack emissions from the power
plant and to comply with Egyptian and World Bank standards. The power plant
will fire natural gas as main fuel which is the least polluting fuel available, (with
negligible sulfur dioxide emissions and low particulate matter emissions).
However, low NO. combustors will be' used on the gas turbines for reducing NO,
emissions.
Conclusion
The pollutant emissions of the power plant will comply with all requirements when
firing natural gas.

EWIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
The exceedence of air quality standards would be due to any other background levels
and could not be attributed to the plant. The costs of reducing these emissions would not
be economically viable given the minor benefits to air quality that measures would
bring. The World Bank Guidelines for New Thermal Power Plants states that all of the
maximum emissions levels should be achieved for at least 95% of the time the plant is
available operating. The remaining 5% is assumed to be for start-up, shut down or
emergency fuel use. This is the stance also taken by the Egyptian practice (i.e. EEHC).
6.2.4 Atmospheiic Dispersion Modeling
The proposed units will be installed in the proposed ISCC Kuraymat plant site, which is
located on the eastem land of the Nile River approximately 2 km far from the Nile bank
and 95 km south of Cairo in a ruralidesert setting. The proposed plant will contain two
gas turbine generator units of industrial heavy-duty type with gross output of around
2x43 MWe at ISO conditions.
The height of the stack will comply with Egyptian requirements and World Bank
guidance on Good Engineering Practice (GEP). The stack of 35 m was defined
according to the atnospheric dispersion modeling undertaken for the ISCC Kuraymat
power plant EIA in June 2004.
Purpose
Atmospheric dispersion modeling has been carried out by E&E in order to determine
power plant impacts on local air quality, when firing natural gas.
This modeling is able to quantify the impact of stack emissions on local air quality,
define the areas where the maximum impact will occur and enable the evaluation of
the concentrations of nitrogen oxdes, sulfur dioxides and carbon monoxide in the air
against the ambient air quality standards.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
As light fuel oil will be used only as emergency fuel, less than 2% of the operaning time, the
modeling has been restricted to the case of firing on natural gas.
Descr4prion of the Model ISC-Prime
The ISC-Prime air dispersion model was used to estimate the onsite and off site air quality
impacts. Onsite impacts were assessed to protect the workers' safety and off site impacts were
investigated to determine compliance of the Egyptian Ambient Air Quality Limits (EAAQLs).
ISC-Prime is a computer program designed to simulate atnospheric dispersion processes over
long periods, in order to estimate ambient concentration levels of air pollutants resulting from
any set of gas emission sources or suspended particulate matter emission sources. It concerns
mainly stack emissions, but can be applied to other stationary emission sources.
It is appropriate for application to a wide variety of problems (in particular regulatory
applications) related to industrial source complexes, with transport distances up to 50 km in
flat or rolling terrain.
The model is mainly based on the Gaussian plume dispersion equations as described by
Pasquill, Gifford and Turner, as well as the Brigg's plume rise equations. It includes several
sets of dispersion coefficients, altenative plume rise equations, and various options
conerning plume downwash, such as buoyancy-induced dispersion and terrain adjustment.
Computations are made with an hourly time step and allow if necessary hourly variations in
the pollutant emission rates. For every day over the period for which meteorological data are
used as input to the model, concentrations are calculated over three different averaging times
including one hour, 24 hours and annual. At the end of the simulation the program output
provides the maximum value of pollutants considered for each of the three averaging times for
each receptor considered over the study zone.
In addition, detailed information about the highest concentrations is computed over the period.
From such results, various levels of pollution can be established and comparisons can be made
with current air quality standards.
Input Data
* Plant Data
The complete design of the ISCC Kuraymat power plant has not been developed yet. Thus no
data on gas turbine generator units is available. Most of the stack parameters and gas turbine
emission characteristics are provided from almost similar gas turbine units in actual operation
within the last five years of capacities range from 4045 MWe each. Plant input data were
selected, on that basis, for a gas turbine generator unit of capacity 41 MWe, which is very
close to the ISCC Kuravmat power plant unit. Dimensions of the turbine enclosure building

Environment) established by the Egyptian Environrmental Affairs Agency (see Section 2.6.2).

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
The representative onsite background air quality concentrations for the ISCC Kuraymat
Project were measured by the National Research Center, air pollution preclusion unit in March
2004 (see Section 5.4.1). These background levels were collected continuously at five
monitoring locations at the Kuraymat site. The averages of the maximum monitored levels, as
presented in Table 6-4 (B) were treated as the air quality levels representing the background
status at the Kuraymat site.
The 24-hour average reported in Tables 5-7 & 5-8 can be converted to the annual average by
multiplying conversion factors obtained by extracting from a log-log curve based on the
conversion factors suggested by the U.S. Environment Protection Agency EPA, 1995).
Methodology
* Dispersion Model
An air dispersion model was used to estimate the off-site air quality impacts which were
investigated to determine compliance of the EAAQLs.
Generally, because of the uifluence of the major nearby structures, power plant stack effluents
might be caught in the wake region downwind of the stack causing adverse air quality
impacts. A stack with Good Engineering Practice (GEP) beight has a minimum stack height
at which significant adverse aerodynamic effects are avoided (EPA, 1981). The U.S. Federal
Government issued the Stack Height Regulation in 1985 (40 CFR 51) to define the GEP stack
height. To be cost effective, sub-GEP stack heights are often built in the United States if the
predicted air quality impacts do not exceed the regulated air quality standards or limits under
plume downwash conditions. However, the Egyptian Law No. 4 (1994), Article 42, Item B
stipulates that "stacks from which a total gaseous wastes reaches more than 15,000kghr, the
beight of the stack shall be more than at least two and half times the height of the surrounding
building, including the building served by the stack." Consequently, the main HRSG stacks
were designed to satisfy the requirement of Egyptian Law No. 4. The bypass stacks will not
be operated on a routine basis; therefore, a sub-GEP stack height was designed for it.
The major onsite structure, which will dictate both the bypass and HRSG stack heights, is the
-14 m high STG building. Based on the dimensions of this building and the proposed stack
Jocations, the U.S. Environrmental Protection Agency (EPA)-approved BP[PPRM model
(EPA, 1997) was used to obtain the building downwash parameters for the bypass stack. The
BPIPPRM is the revised Building Profile Input Program (BPIP, 1995) to be used in
conjunction with the EPA-approved Industrial Source Complex/Plume Rise Model
Enhancements (ISC-Prime) air dispersion model (EPA, 1997).  Building downwash
parameters generated by the BPIPPRM model were used as part of the input data for the ISC-
Prime model. The ISC-Prime model was selected for this study because it has incorporated
enhanced plume dispersion coefficients due to the building wake, and reduced plume rise

caused by a combination of the descending streamlines in the lee of the building, as well as
the increased entrainment in the wake.
* Grid Networks and FlagDole Receptors
In order to assess the onsite impact from the downwash plume, two flagpole receptors were
placed at each of the 12-m height HRSG platfonn where workers perform the routine
maintenance services. Three flagpole receptors at different elevations (22 tn, 30 m, and 34 m)
were also placed along each HRSG main stack to determine the plume impact at the potential
stack platforms. Fifty eight discrete receptors with an increment of about 100 m were placed
along the site boundary (see Figure 6-2). Additionally, 179 near-field off-site Cartesian
receptors with 100 m increment were also placed between the site boundary and the 1 100-m
circle. For convenience, the origin of the Cartesian network is supposed to be placed at the
middle of a line connecting the centers of the two main stacks. As depicted in Figure 6-2, the
I 100-m radius encompassed the entire site boundary.
Beyond 1100 m fim the origin, a polar grid receptor network was further used to assess the
far-field off-site air quality impacts. Using the same origin as the Cartesian network, the polar
network consists of 364rection radials incrementing by 10 degrees with radial distances of
1.1 kI, 1.25 km and beyond. Above 1.25 km, an increment of 250 m was used up to 4 km
downwind. Beyond that, the grid system extends to 7 lkm (4.5 km, 5.0 kmn, 5.5 km, 6.0 km
and 7.0 kIn). The radial distance was extended to 7 kmn in order to identify the maximum
impact locations for different averaging periods.
* Number and Locabon of Monitors
Station Pre-Construction Phase
Based on the U.S. Environmenal Protection Agency guidance (EPA, 1987), air dispersion
modeling sbould first be performed to determine the general location(s) of maximum air
pollutant concentrations from the proposed source. Secondly, the general location(s) of
maximum air pollutant concentation from the existing sources should be deternined.
Thirdly, combined impacts firom the proposed source and the existing sources should be
analyzed. T his approach would provide sufficient information to detemiine the number of
ruonitors required to encompass (a) the location(s) of the maximum air pollutant concentration
increase expected from the proposed source. (b) the location(s) of the maximum air pollutant
concentration from existing sources, and (c) the location(s) of the maximum combined impact
area.
Because of logistic limitations. i.e., security, available power supply, and existing structure,
monitoring should be conducted in or as close to these areas as possible Generally, one to
four sites would cover most situations in multiple settings. For areas in which the permit

granting agency has detennined that. there are no significant existing sources, a minimum
number of monitors would be needed, i.e., one or possibly two at the most.
Station Post-Construction Phase
Air quality monitors should be placed at (a) the expected area of the maximum concentration
fiom the new source, and (b) the maximum combined impact area(s). Locations for these
monitors may be different frm those sites for the pre-construction phase due to other new
sources in the area since the pre-construction monitoring.
In general, two to three sites would be sufficient for most situations in multi-source areas. In
areas where there are no significant existing sources, one or two sites would be sufficient.
Modeing Resuls
* BPIPPRM
The BP[PPRM-generated GEP stack height estimates and building profile parameters is used
by the ISC-Prime. GEP stack height for the HRSG stacks is 35 m above grade. The STG
Building height of 14 m dictates this GEP stack height. Basically, the GEP stack height is
calculated as:
Hg h8+ 1.5L
where Hg is the GEP stack beight, hB is the nearby major building height, and L is the
dimension of the major building height or width whichever is less. Since the existing STG
Building beight (14 m) is less than the STG building width, the GEP stack height was
calculated as Hg = 2.5 ha = 2.5 x 14 = 35 m.
ByPass I and ByPass2 are referring to the bypass stacks, and VENTI and VENT2 are referring
to the HRSG stacks, while VENT3 and VENT4 are referring to the existing 2 x 600 MWe
152-m stacks and VENT 5 and VENT 6 are referring to the proposed by pass I and by pass II
80 m stacks of the proposed 750 MWe combined cycle module in the location of the existing
Kurayrnat thermal power plant (extension) (see Figure 6-1).
The bypass stack height was designed as 25 m. Usually the bypass stack height is designed to
be about 1.5 times building beight. For example, the nearby STG building height is 14 m;
thus, the bypass stack height could be 21 m high. At this beight. the bypass stack would be at
the cavity height created by the STG building. The exhaust plume could be caught within the
cav itr zone, which is formed by enclosed circulations. Once the plume is caught in the cavity
zone, relatively higb ground level pollutant concentration would be expected. To avoid this
type of adverse effect, sub-GEP stack heights are usually designed not too low from the cavity
height. The thernal and momentum plume rise would assist the plume to escape from the

cavity zone even if the stack elevation is slightly lower than the cavity height. The cavity
height induced by the closest CTG building, which is 13 m in beight, would be about 20.5 m.
A bypass stack height of 25 m was determined after several iterative runs.
* ISC-Prime Modeling Results
As described in the former section, using different stack heights, iterative runs were made to
identify the optimum stack height that will satisfy the EAAQLs for the operation of the bypass
stacks. Comparing to the HRSG stacks, the bypass stacks have a higher exit temnperature and
exit velocity. Consequently the bypass stacks are expected to produce a higher plume rise. As
discussed before, the bypass stacks will not be operated on a routine basis. Therefore, the
physical stack height of the bypass stacks can be somewhat lower than that of the HRSG
stacks without creating adverse effects when the plant is under normal operation. However, a
downwash analysis was performed to determine a sub-GEP stack height for the bypass stacks
in order to safeguard the performance of the bypass stack.
Mainly two scenarios were considered in this modeling analysis.
1) Nonnal Operational Mode - two HRSG stacks.
2) Normal Operational Combined Mode - two HRSG stacks + existing 2 x 600 MWe
stacks + proposed 2 x 250 MWe stacks (proposed extention of the existing Kuraymat)
Scenario 2 was studied to determine the combined impact from the operation of the proposed
units under the normal operation and the existing units in addition to their proposed extension.
(see Figure 6-1).
On-Site Impacts
Ambient air quality standards or limits apply to off-site receptors. To safeguard workers'
health, onsite air quality impacts were estimated by placing discrete receptors on the 12-m
high platform sunrounding each of the HRSGs. This platform is crucial because it is where
workers are most likely to perforn routine maintenance works. Also, three potential
platforms around the HRSG stack were assumed to locate at 22, 30 and 34-m levels. Health-
related onsite air quality impacts at these platforms were assessed because workers might need
to perform stack sampling or maintain the stack emission monitoring system occasionally at
these platforms while the plant is under normal operation.
The model-predicted onsite maximum air quality impacts were compared to the time-
weighted average (TWA) concentration for a normal 8-hour workday (40-hour work week)
health-related air quality limit implemented by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA. 1990).

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
The worst-case 8-hour N02-concentration that occurred on the HRSG platform is 8.32 gg/m3,
while the worst-case 8-hour NO2 concentration on the H RSG stack platform is 62.1 Lg/m3
occurred at the 34-m level.
The OSHA limit for NO2 is 6 mg/m3. The OSHA limits are for a 40-hour workweek, while
the model-predicted 8-hour maximum is unltkely to occur continuously for 5 working days.
Unlike the 12-m level HRSG platform where workers might need to perform routine
maintenance, the use of the higher-level platforns along the HRSG stack is an infrequent
event. Since the model-predicted 8-hour NO2 concentrations are relatively small compared to
the 40-hour OSHA limit, no significant onsite air quality impact is expected. Above all, the
nornal operation would involve the combined cycle mode, which uses the HRSG stacks;
instead of the simple cycle mode, which uses the bypass stacks. In conclusion, the health-
related onsite air quality poses no significant impact to the onsite workers during the working
hours due to the operation of the proposed units.
Off-Site IrnDacts
The ISC-Prime modeling results are presented in Table 6-5 and Table 6-6 for cases involving
the normal operation of the HRSG stacks only, and the normal operation of them plus the
existing units (2x600 MW) in addition to the proposed extension (2x250 MW). As noted, the
Egyptian Law #4 of 1994 requires that the main stacks shall be more than at least two and half
times the height of the surromding building, including the building served by the stack.
Section 6.2.4 indicates that the GEP stack height is 35 m. Therefore, the 35-m HRSG stacks
were designed for the project This decision satisfies the Law #4 requirement.
Scenario I
Under the normal operational mode, the NO2 hourly maximum impact (211.4 ,ug/m3) from the
operation of the HRSG stack is about 52.85% of the cornesponding EAAQL (400 gglm').
It is worthmentioning that during maintenance, the plant would operate only one HRSG stack
and one bypass stack.
Scenario 2
Under the normal operational combined mode, the N02 hourly maximum combined impact
(295.0 pg/m3) from the operation of the HRSG stacks and the existing 2 x 600 MWe units in
addition to the proposed 2 x 250 MWe units is about 74% of the corresponding EAAQL
(400 ig/rm3).
It is worthmentioning that during maintenance, the plant would operate only one HRSG stack
and one bvpass stack. The air quality impact during maintenance period is somewhat higher
than under normal operatiom. but the increases do not exceed very small fiactions of the
normnal operation case. This is expected because the bypass stack has a sub-GEP height, which

could induce higher ground level pollutant concentrations due to plume downwash within the
wake zone.
In summary, with the consideration of the representative background air quality level, the
operation of the 35-m HRSG stacks and the 25-m bypass stacks under normal operation will
meet the corresponding NO2 EAAQLs.
Final Results
Air Monitorinq Siting
For monitoring siting purposes, a modeling analysis was perforned to evaluate the combined
effect of the proposed sources and the existing sources. As shown in Tables 6-5 & 6-6, using
5-years (1993-1997) of meteorological data, the maximum 1-hour impact area contributed by
the proposed ISCC sources alone occurred mostly around (250 m, -350 m), while the
maximum l-hour impact area contributed by the proposed and the existing sources occurred
all around (-2190 m, -1375 mi). The maximum impact locations of the proposed ISCC sources
never exceed 400 m from the proposed stacks.  This relatively short distance from the
proposed ISCC sources would result in easier management of the monitoring stations.
These maximum impact areas are presented in Figure 6-3. The origin of the Cariesian
coordinate system is placed at the mid-point of the proposed ISCC stacks. In general, at the
maximum combined impact areas, the contribution from the proposed new sources is
negligible. Theretore, at these maximum impact areas, the contribution from the existing and
proposed Kuraymnat sources is dominating
As a result, monitoring stations are proposed to be installed at the maximum combined impact
areas. There is no need, actually, to monitoring stations at the maximum impact areas
contributed by the proposed ISCC sources alone. The NO2 monitoring stations are to be
installed at shaded areas as suggested in Figure 6-3 which will be the responsibility of
UEEPC.

ENVOPONMENTAL IMPACTASSESSMENr
As can be seen from the Tables, whichever standard is selected, the additional concentrations
are a relatively lower fraction of the value required to equal that which would cause an
exceedence, even allowing for the existing concentrations. Accordingly, no waiver offset
regarding the airshed will be required.
.lfiigarion Measures
On the basis of the dispersion modeling results, no furnher mitigation measures are required to
reduce stack emissions (i.e. beyond the use of natural gas and low-NOx combustors). The
stack height (35 meters) has been designed to reduce pollutant air concentrations and optimize
atmnospheric dilution of the stack plume and is adequate for this purpose.
Conclusion
Although these concentrations of pollutants have been established for the worst case operating
conditions of the plant (continuous operation of the two gas turbines at 75% load during
continuous operation of the existing two 600 MWe thermal steam turbine units at flIl load in
addition to continuous operation of the proposed extention of the 750 MWe module having
two 250 MWe gas turbines at 75% load) using the primary fuel, they still remain below the
Egyptian requirements and the World Bank guidelines corresponding to the air quality
standards. Their addition to the existing background concentrations will not cause these
standards and guidelines to be exceeded. The plant will have no significant impact on the
ambient air quality.
6.2.6 Fugitive Emilssions from Fuel Storage Tanks
There will be two principal fixed-roof fuel storage tanks on the power plant site for storage of
light fuel oil. Fugitive emissions from fixed-roof tanks may occur as a result of evaporation of
the liquid fuel into the space between the roof and the liquid surface. This vapor may be
eminted to the atnosphere through vents during the tank filling process. However, since the
fuel oil consists of low volatility liquid and the tanks will only be filled infrequently (as this
fuel will only be used if natural gas is unavailable), the potential for significant releases
through venting of the tanks is limited and therefore the potential to cause odor nuisance is not
considered to be significant. Additionally, the nearest receptors are far away.

6.3   AQUATIC ENVIRONMENT
6.3.1 Introduction
This section considers the significance of potential impacts to the aquatic environment from
the construction and operation of the ISCC Kuraymat power plant. The section is based on
conceptual desi'gn work undertaken by Fichtner Solar GmbH, and survey and comparison
work and economic analysis for cooling system alternatives undertaken by Power Generation
Engineering and Services Company (PGESCo) in April 2004, delivered to E&E in June 2004.
6.3.2 Potential Construction Impacts
The potential impacts on the aquatic environment during construction are likely to occur as a
result of
*  laying of pipes across the Nile bank;
*  dredging process for the intake structures;
*  construction of the inlet structures;
* construction of the discharge system structures;
*  natural surface drainage of contaminants and sediments; and
*  discharge of solid wastes and industrial liquid effluents into the water body.
The potential impacts that can be anticipated as a result of these activities are summarized in
Table 6-7 below.

Physical A quagraphy
The construction methodology for the intake structures remains to be defined. Dredging will
however, be required for the intake structures. This is likely to result in very local alteration of
the prevailing currents immediately adjacent to the dredging works. This in turn will result in
some local and limited changes to scouring and deposition rates adjacent to the dredging
works.
The impacts identified are considered acceptable and no mitigation measures are proposed.
The construction method for the intake structures will include an acceptable operational
procedure which will minimize the impacts from dredging and construction on sedimentation.
This should be included in any contract which NREA commission.
During construction, arisings from the dredging process will be disposed of on the existing
site of the power plant or via a licensed contrctor. No special permit is required and no
significant impacts are anticipated.

Impacts on Water Quality
Any dredging will mobilize sediments into the water column and result in an increased
suspended sediment load.
Heavy metal concentrations in sediments measured at the site, can be compared with
standards applied in Holland and which are commonly used on a global basis(l). The heavy
metal concentrations measured at the five sample locations before the site of the power plant,
are compared with these reference values in Table 6-8 below.

Explanatory Notes:
Sediments containing metals in concentrations below the -reference value" are considered unconaminated, and
are suitable for general disposal if present in dredged material at these concentrations.
Consaminant concentrations between the "reference value" and the 'xesting value" are considered moderately
contaminated, and can be disposed of in open water under suitable conditions.
Sedimients containing chemical concentrations between the "testing value" and the "signaling value" are heavly
contaminated, and can only be disposed of under controlled conditons
If the 'signa1ing value" is exceeded, then the material is considered toxic waste, and is not suitable for Nile
disposal.
The pollutant concentrations are far below the reference value shown in the Dutch Standards
for all parameters considered in the table. These concentrations are below the "refenmce

value" and are therefore considered un contaminated. The Dutch cuidelines recommend that
un contaminated sediments are suitable for general disposal if present in dredged material at
these concentrations.
It is anticipated that disposal of dredged arisings will take place on the power plant site or via
a licensed contractor (no permit will be required).
Groundwater and Effluents
Construction activities could potentially also result in the release of solid wastes and effluents
to the ground water. This should be limited to a minimum by using the best construction
techniques. A stornwater collection system, which is discussed in more detail in Section
6.7.3, will be provided that will include oil interceptors. Sanitary effluents will be disposed of
via power plant sewage disposal system. Solid wastes will be disposed of by a licensed
contractor.
The impact of construction on groundwater resources will be minimal as no boreholes wil be
located in the area and groundwater abstraction is not required during the construction phase.
The only potential impacts will arise from spillage of chemicals and disposal of wastes and
this has been addressed above.
Reduced infiltration may occur, but this will be low and, as there are no wells in the
immediate area, the impact will be insignificant.
Aquatic Ecology
There are a number of impacts associated with the construction of the intake structures:
*  temporary loss of bank habitat;
* permanent loss of aquatic habitat,
* new bank surface habitat will be generated due to the material used in the construction
of the intake structures and will be colonized by algae and organisms and may
encourage fish species; and
*  disturbance of benthic and mobile fauna and flora as a result of senlement of
suspended sediments through interference with feeding mechanisms, gills and
reduction of photosynthetic activity.
With regard to the loss and disturbance to benthic fauna and flora the following should be
noted:
* the area where losses may occur is relatively small in the context of the Nile river, the
construction of the intake water structures will disturb a very limited area. The

sensitivity of the benthos in this area is low, since much of the riverbed being degraded
with poor biodiversity;
*  much of the losses are temporary in nature and it can be expected that dredged
sediments will be re-colonized within a relatively small period; and
*  field survey information did not identify any fauna, flora or habitats of conservation
importance.
The impacts of the power plant on birds is discussed in Section 6.5.
Fish and Fisheries
The impacts on fish and commercial fisheries, in case of abstracting water from the Nile river,
are expected to include the short tenn and local effects due to clevated concentrations of
suspended sediments and pollutants in the water column. The natural dilution and dispersion
in the area of construction will ensure that the suspended sediment load and elevated pollutant
levels are rapidly reduced to background levels. The survey of the project indicated that the
area was limited in fish populations.
In addition to suspended sediment and pollutant loads there may be physical disruption to
fishing activity due to dredging. However, given that the area adjacent to the power plant is
currentl) limited as used for commercial or artisanal fishing, the overall impact is not
considered significant.
The impacts identified relating to water quality are considered not significant and no
mitigation measures are proposed.
With regard to Nile bank birds, construction activities, if undertaken, will cross landflats from
the Nile river to the steam turbine condenser during laying of water intake pipes. The Nile
bank and landflats affected will however be restored between the site perimeter and the Nile,
using material which has been excavated. Significant impacts to birds in this area are therefore
considered unlikely (see Section 6.5).
Access to Nie Bank
The area of Nile bank potentially to be affected by the construction of the cross bank pipelines
and intake structures is not currently used for leisure or recreation. The construction activities
are not therefore expected to affect Nile bank access.

Cooling Sjstem Alternatives
Based on the comparison study carried out by PGESCo (Annex C), different alternatives for
supplying cooling water to the proposed power plant have been investigated. The study aimed
at analvzing two main options for providing cooling water, namely once through and closed
circuit cooling systems.
Cooling requirements and main configuration for each case were assumed as follow:
* Once Through Cooling Svstem-Option I:
-  The condenser heat duty                 128.96 x 106 J/s
-  Circulating water flow rate             6.2          m3/s
-  Temperature rise across the condenser   5            °C
-  GRP Pipeline

- Make up and blow down from and to the Nile river
The following section presents the conclusion of this comparison.
Once Through Cooling System
* Option I
The length of the cooling water delivery pipeline is about 3500m, depending on routing of
the pipeline and exact location of the condenser. The warm water will flow out of the
condenser through around 3300 m length, 1.4 m inner diameter GRP discharge pipeline to
the discharge structure. The discharge structure will be located downstream the existing
Kuraymat discharge structure.
Figure 6-4 depicts the layout of the proposed once through cooling system.
Calculated power required for pumping pressure for this option is approximately 4.9MWe.

*Option H
The only difference between this option and the previous one (Option I) lies on the
material of the pipeline used to convey cooling water which is selected of Pre-Stressed
pipes instead of GRP.
*  Option HI
In option III, the discharge is limited to 3.9 m3/s and the water vill flow through 1.4 m
LD, GRP pressurized pipes from the pumping station location towards the potential
location of the condenser. The warm water will flow out of the condenser to the discharge
structure through a discharge pipeline of 1.1 m I.D, GRP pressurized pipes.
Calculations proved that the power consuned during pumping process is then 2.3 NI We.
* Option I
The only difference between this option and the previous one (Option III) lies on the
material of the pipeline used to convey the cooling water which is selected of Pre-Stressed
pipes instead of the GRP.
Closed Circuit Cooling Tower System
Wei-cooling towers dissipate heat rejected by the plant to the environment by these
mechanisms: (1) addition of sensible heat to the air and (2) evaporation of a portion of the
recirculation water itself. When operated in the open mode, there is a third mechanism: (3)
addition of sensible heat to the natural body of water as a result of the terminal temperature
difference (TTD).
Wet cooling towers have a hot-water distribution system that showers or sprays the water
evenly over a latticework of closely set horizontal slats or bars calledJi/l, orpacking. The fill
thoroughly mixes the falling water with air moving through the fill as the water splashes down
from one fill level to the next by gravity. Outside air enters the tower via louvers in the form
of horizontal slats on the side of the tower. The slats usually slope downward to keep the
water in. The intimate mix between water and air enhances heat and mass transfer
(evaporation), which cools the water. Cold water is then collected in a concrete basin at the
bottom of the tower where it is pumped back to the condenser (closed or helper mode) or
returned to the natural body of water (open mode). The now hot, moist air leaves the tower at
the top.
In closed circuit cooling tower system, after the excess temperature of the cooling water is
transferred to the ambient air, the water is dripped again to the basin of the cooling tower. The
cooling tower is filled with water once, and then a make up pump provides continuous flow to
compensate for the water volume lost during ventilation process.

Make up water may to abstracted either from a deep well if the ground water reservoir assures
sustainability of providing the required make up water flow or the Nile river. Blow down
water is to be discharged back to the ground water reservoir or to a nearbv drain.
* Option V
Make up water will be pumped from a ground water reservoir and the blow down water will
be discharged to a well.
Design considerations of the cooling tower include the follo% ing:
-  Circulating water flow                     3.1    m3/S
-  Make up water flow                         0.04   m3/s
-  Blow down flow                             0.001 m3/s
-  Ambient air temperature                    20     °C
-  Cooling tower range                         10    °C
-  Wet bulb temperature                        13    °C
-  Warm water temperature to the cooling tower  27   °C
-  Cold water temperature out of the cooling tower  17  °C
-  Blow down water temperature                 17    °C
-  Total fan motor power                      0.77   MWe
-  Cycle of concentration                     5      (-)

-  Structure material                         concrete with internals
of fiberglass
Calculations proved that the overall power consumption in cooling tower operation will be the
sum of 0.85 + 0.1 + 0.77 MWe or 1.72 MWe.
*Option VI
Last option depends on pumping the make up water from the intake structure of the proposed
Kuraymat 750 MWe extension combined cycle project through a GRP pipeline to the cooling
tower. Blow down water will be discharged to a nearby drain located about 5km away from
the cooling tower. Blow down water will flow through a 100mm GRP pipeline to the drain.
Consumed power for make up water abstracted from the Nile river is about 0.034 M We and
consumed power for blow down water to a drainage basin/wadi or ground well is about
0.0001 5 MWe. The overall consumed power on option II is then 1.65 MWe.

Conclusion
The comparative study of the may options for cooling water system demonstrated that at any
cases, the cooling tower option is much cheaper than once through system, hence, assessment
of environmental impacts of the cooling tower system is addressed below.
The least cost option (V) of the cooling tower system is based on the assumption that the
groundwater is available along the lifetime of the power plant at a level of (-150m) under the
ground of the proposed condenser location. This should be studied by appropriate experts and
hydrogeologists. A comprehensive geophysical, geological, bydogeological, and
hydrochemical studies should be carried out to delineate the available water-bearing
formations and their average depths.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
Impact of Plant Operation on Water QuantitY and Quality
Service Water Abstractions
The proposed development will have two major impacts on surface waters during the
operational phase: the requirement for potable and service water, including water for make-up
for the closed-circuit steam generation water svstemii; for general use and fire-fighting
purposes; and the requirement for cooling water.
The make up water for the closed circuit steam generation system will be obtained either from
a well to be drilled on site or from the Nile river. Potable water for the facility will be supplied
from either two sources, also. Once the facility is fully commissioned the total number of
employees will be around 300 persons and this should not place a strain on the existing
resources. Assuming a demand of 30 litres per person per day, a rate of 15 m3/day will be
required from this source. The impact of this additional demand on existing water resources is
considered to be a small part of the available resource and impacts will be minimal.
Cooling Water Abstraction
As detailed before, underground water or Nile water will be used as the main source of
service, potable and make-up water for both the closed-circuit steam generation system and
the cooling tower system. thus will provide cold water for the condenser cooling and heat
exchangers.
In both options, abstraction of water will occur at a rate of 270 m3/h (0.075 m3/s). For the
purpose of illustrating the impact of water abstraction on the Nile, abstraction rates are
compared with the flow rates of the Nile river at the Kuraymat segnent.
The abstraction rate represents a negligible fraction of this flow (see Section 5.5.3) in all
nionths over the year.
For the purpose of analyzing the impact of water abstraction on the groundwater, available
information illustrates that, as previously noted (Sections 5.1 and 5.2), the groundwater basin,
which lies both beneath and closely adjacent to the Nile valley from Cairo to Aswan, includes
an area of about 2 million feddans. Water storage in this linear basin has estimated at
approximately 27 billion m3. However, because the hydrologic balance of the Nile valley
all u% i al aquifer is directly connected with Nile surface flows, production from the aquifer is
nominally the same as withdrawing water from the river. In essence, the valley aquifer is a
transmission medium for river surface resource.
The Research Institute for Groundwater drilled two observation wells in the Kuraymat area
(east and west banks) in 1979. Water quality data from a well close to the power plant site are
shown in Table 6-12. The well near the east bank at Kuraymat village found groundwater at 3
meters below the surface; the second well, located directly across from the old power plant
site near Nile's west bank, found groundwater 1.5 meters below the surface. Well delivery

proposed ISCC power plant. Geotechnical borings at the Kuraymat area showed groundwf ater
in the floodplain at the same depth as the river and on the plateau groundwater was not found
at depths of 40m from the surface.

The quality of both surface water and groundwater in the Kureyamt reach of the Nile is
generally good. Only in localized sectors where there are concentrated sources of
contaminants, such as irrigation drainage return waters, would water quality degradation be
expected to occur.
Water Discharges
There are 3 main sources of water discharges for discharge to the discharge system:
* blowdown of cooling towers from the cooling water system.
* backwash water from the water treatment filters.
* regeneration of demineralization plant.
This section also includes impacts associated with other wastewaters and wastes. The baseline
characteristics of the Nile waters have been provided in section 5.5 (Aquatic Environment).

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
Cooling Water Discharge
The cooling water required for the plant will be cooled in a multi-cell cooling tower. The
cooling towers will be provided with a blowdown pipe which will discharge water to the
discharge system, where the treated water will ultimately be disposed of to a natural flood
drain (drainage basin or drainage wadi) or to a ground well, at discontinuous intervals.
The circulating tower blowdown water is warm and fully aerated, contains suspended solids,
is relatively high in conductivity, and is a good biological nutrient.
It is almost always corrosive, requiring a corrosion inhibitor such as chromates. To prevent
scale and deposits that foul heat-transfer surfaces, it often needs scale inhibitors. Silt washed
off the air by the cooling tower usually is in the form of small colloidal mater and is difficult
to remove, but can be treated by a family of chemicals called polyelectrolytes. These keep the
particles suspended in flowing water but allow them to precipitate in basins where they can be
removed as mud. Microbiological growth (algae, slime, bacteria), besides fouling, contributes
to corrosion by shielding metal surfaces and thus producing oxygen-concentration cells. In
addition, the decomposition of the organisms produces H2S, CO2, and other products,
themselves corrosive. Chlorination, alternated with biocides, is used (organisms can build up
tolerance to chlorine, if used along).
Because of the above additives, cooling-tower bleed or blowdown can be an unacceptable
source of pollution to the natural body of water. (Boiler blowdown is another source of
pollution. It is mainly thermal but also contains small quantities of phosphates and organics).
Bleed may contain chemicals and various minerals contained in or added to the circulating
water, including chromate inhibitors, various phosphates, organic and inorganic compounds,
combined with some heavy metals.
Bleed, therefore, has to be handled with care. Depending upon the size of plant and the extent
of contaminants, it may be discharged to the body of water, treated before being returned, or
allowed to mix with other plant wastes, such as boiler blowdown, etc., and treated all in one
installation.
An example of treatment is the removal of chromates by reducing them from hexavalent form
to trivalent chrome with FeSO4, then precipitated as Cr (OH)3 by elevating the pH with lime
(or an alkaline stream from somewhere else in the plant). The resulting sludge can be disposed
of in various ways or reused. Another altemative is to use nonpolluting inhibitors, but these
are of questionable ability and economics.
Raw Water Treatment
The raw water treatment facility will result in surplus water being produced during the
backwash of the water pre-treatment filters. It is recommended that this water be discharged

w ithout treatment to the plant plantation irrigation system. Separated wastewater from the pre-
treatment plant dew atering system will be recirculted back to the clarifier.
Deminerali:arion Plant
The wastewater produced during the regeneration of the demineralization plant will be
neutralized in a dedicated sump and discharged to a common effluent tank before off-site
disposal.
The waste collected in an R.C.C. effluent tank will be discharged at a suitable disposal point
away from the plant. It is recommended that effluents collected in this effluent tank should be
treated as per local environmental regulations before disposal to any outside point (e.g.
drainage basin or ground well).
Other li'asreoaters
Wastewaters from other sources will include:
* Oily wastewater from collecting pits.
* Sanitarv wastewater.
*  The GT compressor wasbing water and boiler cleaning.
Oily wastewater will be collected to the oil/water separator skid. The wastewater will be
transferred to the common effluent tank and separated oil will be collected in a drun for off-
site disposal by EGPC.
Sanitary wastewater will be collected in local sanitary tanks. It is planned that wastewater will
be allowed to overflow into soak pits and dirt collected over a period of time i, i II be disposed
off-site by sanitary road tankers. It is recommended, instead, that the power plant should be
provided with sanitary wastewater treatment facility where sewage water effluents are treated
and mixed. after treatment, with waters used for the plant plantation irrigation program.
The GTG wash water drains and boiler cleaning will be collected in an individual sump.
These wastewaters, as per design considerations. will be discharged with a portable pump
using flexible hose into a tanker for off-site disposal. It is important that disposal method and
location must comply with stipulated regulations.
Disposal of Other W^aste Effluents
Other waste effluents resulting from the operation of the facility will include:
* Storm water drainage via the site drainage system will feed to a drainage basin. Oil-
contaminated storm water will be discharged via oil/water separator skid. No long-
term impact on the aquatic environment is envisaged.

* All storage areas will be equipped with bunds and any fuel and hazardous
materials spillages will be directed to the oil/water separator and then to the
wastewater treatment system.
*  Oil from collecting pits will be collected by the wastewater drainage system.
Disposal and/or treatment of the oily waste will be by the EGPC.
*  Sludge from potential sources will be collected for appropriate disposal, These
sources include:
* Oil and grit removal tank.
* Wastewater treatment facility.
Management of Operational Discharges
Figure 6-5 shows liquid effluent management measures which is proposed to be
implemented on site. The oil/water separators will operate continuously. Rain waters
containing oil will be routed to the oil separator; rain waters without oil will be
discharged directly to a drainage basin or a ground well.
All the process effluent, in combination with site drainage from areas at risk of
contamination (power block areas, drains and sumps) should be treated and then disposed
of to a drainage basin or a ground well. The discharge from the power plant will comply
with the Egyptian and World Bank standards for discharge to River Nile and its branches
as a minimum (Table 6- 13).

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
In order to ensure compliance with Egyptian and World Bank/IFC water quality
standards, an appropriate plant management system will be developed in order to monitor
the quality of the discharge.
Impacts on PhysicalAquagraphy
When water abstract from the Nile River, the presence of the intake structures will result
m local changes to the current regime and attendant changes in scouring and deposition.
Physical aquagraphy has been investigated by the Hydraulics Research histitute (I).
This work indicates ta the impacts identified are however considered to be minor.
Therefore no mitigation measures are proposed.
Water Qualiy Related Impacts on Aquatc Ecology
Abstractions
The water intake, when water abstract from the Nile river, will result in the entraimnent
of fauna and flora. Because of the presence of grills, entrainment may result in death and!
or damage to larger organisms including fish which may escape entrainment. Once
entrained the fauna are exposed to physical damage, increased temperatures and process
chemicals, including biocides at concentrations intended to be lethal to fauna and flora
whilst in the cooling system.
The potental for damage is related to the escape speed of the particular animal, the intake
velocity and the size of the grills over the intake. It is the younger stages of fish species
that are at particular risk from entrainment and damage.
The relatively low intake flow (approximately 0.075 m3/s even at maximum abstraction
rates) is unlikely to entrain a significant number of fish, though those which impinge on
the intake screens will be removed from the population. Most of the commercially
important invertebrates are benthic and thus less prone to entrainment.
Planktonic larvae may also be entrained, and will suffer increased mortality within the
cooling water system, However, this mortality will be insignificant when compared to the
natural mortality of planktxnic larvae due to predation and other factors.
Discharges
Impacts on aquatic ecology during plant operation will lrgely be due to the quality of the
discharged water.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
Chemicals released into the discharge pipelines could potentially have chronic effects on the
flora and fauna surrounding the discharge point, if released in sufficient quantities. Water
treatment and management system employed at the plant and described above, will however
ensure that effluents released do not threaten the ecosystems.
Whilst the impact of entrainment has the potential to be highly negative, it will occur over a
very localized area. In addition, the velocity of water drawn into the culvert is considered
moderate, which will further reduce the risk of fish entrainment.
Nile Bank Access
Once constructed, the intake structures will be buried in a pipeline across the Nile bank and it
is expected that there will be no impacts on the use of the Nile bank as a result of the
operation of the power plant.
Impact on Fishing and Navigation
The Nile river segment of the Kuraymat site is not considered to be of signiricant importance
as a commercial fishery. The plant is not therefore expected to have any significant impacts on
fishing activities.
Given that the intake structures will be constructed on the bank line, which is far from the
navigation channel, therefore structures are not expected to present any hazard to Nile
navigation.

6.4   NOISE AND VIBRATION
6.4.1  Introduction
The assessment of the potential noise and vibration impacts considers tbe following issues:
* noise and vibration from construction activities on the main site and for the cooling
water infrastructure (pumping station, cooling water pipelines and intakestructures);
and
* noise and vibration during operation, including from the main power plant and the
pumping station.
6.4.2  Noise Sensitive Receptors
No more than one residential complex (Ezbet E-Hagg Ghanem) have been identified around
the ISCC Kuraymat power plant site, which is about 2500 m south-west of the proposed site
boundanes. Only the nearest land uses around the powerhouse will be the old power plant
community housing complex, approximately 750 m to the immediate west of the power plant.
Kuraymat village is about 3 km north-west of the plant site. Figure 6-6 presents these noise
sensitive receptors.
Due to the construction of the power plant, and irrespective of the rural/desert nature of the
proposed site, the area is categorized as "Industrial area", given the existing thermal power
plant, with respect to the Egyptian ambient noise standards and "Industrial commercial" with
respect to the WNorld Bank environmental guidelines.
6.43 Standards and Guidelines for Noise Assessment
In the absence of World Bank or Egyptian standards for construction noise, British Standard
BS5228 has been considered to represent good international practice for assessing and
controlling noise during the construction phase.
6.4.4 Evaluation of Construction Noise and V'ibration
Voise Prediction Methodology
Noise levels from construction activities have been predicted and assessed based on the
methods set out in the UK codes of practice (BS5228). Calculations of the combined sound
power from all construction plant, adjusted for usage time, have been used to predict the
highest potential noise levels for the peak period of construction.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
Traffic noise predictions have been carrmed out using the methodology in the UK Department
of Enviromnent (as was) Calculation of Road Traffic Noise which is the standard method of
predicting noise from roads in the UK and is considered to represent good international
practice.
For the assessment, the following conservative assumptions have been made:
*   fixed construction plant is located close to the center of the site;
*  mobile construction plant has been assumed to use a haul route that follows the
perimeter of the site; and
*  no account has been taken of the attenuation in noise levels due to acoustically soft
ground or due to screening from intervening buildines.
The type and number of plant assumed to represent the worst case during the peak period of
construction, are presented in Table 6-14.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
Noisefrom the Construction Site
Using the worst-case assumptions, the predictions of potential levels of construction noise at
the nearest receptors during peak construction phase are presented in Table 6-15, together
with applicable E_*ptian noise standards. The Egyptian noise standards are applicable to long
tern (i.e. operational) noise levels, but are included for reference in assessing the potential
magnitude of inipacls from short term construction noise. Reference is also, made below to
construction noise criteria used in the UK. It should be noted that no construction noise limits
are published in World Bank guidance.

Notes:
(1) Calegofized as "lndustrial Area" in Egyptian Standards.
From Table 6-1S it can be seen that in the absence of noise mitigation measures, construction
noise levels are predicted to comply with the Egyptian standards. In the UK a daytime
construction noise criteria of LAeq 70 dB is generally used to assess construction noise in
rural areas. This level is not predicted to be exceeded. Hence no construction noise impacts
are expected.
Noisefrom Construction Traffic on the Site Access Road
Assuming that a haul route will pass the residential properties east the power plant site at a
distance of more than 200 m, the resulting predicted noise levels will be less than 46 dB(A).
This noise level is within the Egyptian and UK standards and, hence, no significant impacts
are predicted.

Noisefrom Conistruction Traffic on the Road Network
Noise levels from traffic on local roads have been predicted for the peak construction activity
during 2005-206, both with and without the potential construction traffic. Predicted noise
levels at the roadside are shown on Table 6-16 below.

Notes:
(1) 18 hour traffic flows derived from average hourly flows.
The difference in noise levels at roadside receptors due to the construction traffic is only 0.3
dB(A). Increases in environmental noise levels of less than 2-3 dB(A) are not generally
perceptible to the human ear, consequently no construction traffic noise impacts are predicted.
'ibration from Construction Activities
Measurements of vibration from construction plant have shown that, even from the worst case
activity, i.e. percussive piling equipment. levels typically fall to imperceptibility beyond
approximately lOOm from the vibration source. Imperceptible levels are reached at much
smaller distances from other sources of vibration, such as excavators, bulldozers and heavy
goods vehicles (HGVs). Hence, because there are no receptors within 100 m of the site no
vibration impacts are expected.
6.4.5 Evaluation of Operational Noise and Vibration
Noise Prediction .'fethodology
The potential noise emissions from the power plant have been modeled by Dr. M. El-Bardisi,
Prof of noise and vibration engineering, Ain Shams University using the Bruel and Kjaer
"Predictor" noise model. The noise model breaks the plant down into individual point sources
representing each item of equipment or structure that may produce a significant amount of
noise. Sound power levels were assigned to each point source based on specified noise levels
in the individual equipment purchase order, which should not exceed 85 dB (A). The noise
sources area included in the model is shown in Figure 6-7 and individual noise sources are
listed below.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
The predicted operational noise levels at the site boundary are below the WN'orld Bank
guidelines and the Egyptian Standards for both davtime noise and night-time noise. It meets
not only the heavy industries criteria of the Egyptian Law but also the residential areas
standard limit which does not exceed the 5OdB(A) noise level.
In addition. it should be noted that the predicted noise levels are based on conservative
assumptions for noise attenuation and vweather conditions. Therefore, noise from the operating
plant is not expected to give rise to any significant noise impacts at receptors in the area.
Traffic-related Noise During Operation
The percentage increases in hourly traffic flows during the operation of the power plant are
about 3% on the section of the Es-Saff / Beni-sueif Road about 1200 m to the west of the
power plant. These increases are not sufficient to give rise to any perceptible change in traffic
noise.
Operational Vibration
The design of the power plant will ensure that all rotating machinery is correctly balanced and
that reciprocating equipment is vibration isolated. to ensure that vibration uill be
imperceptible beyond the site boundary. Since the nearest receptor is some distance from the
site there will be no vibration impacts from the operating plant.
6A.6 Conclusion
Predictions of unmitigated construction noise indicate that Egyptian and UK standards are met
at all times and there will be no construction noise impacts. Neither will there be vibration
impacts because the nearest receivers are some distance from the site.
Egyptian and World Bank standards for operational noise are met at all receptors during
daytime and night-time. Therefore, no significant noise impacts are expected.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTASSESSMENT
6.5 FLORA AND FAUNA
6.5.1 Introduction
The assessment has examined the potential impacts of land take and disturbance of the
proposed power plant on flora and fauna.
6.5.2 Potential Impacts
As described in Section 5.7 of this report, the project will be built on a matrix of uncultivated
land and the area surrounding the site is partially cultivated with nonnal plants and crops
usually grown in such area.
The main natural resources within the plant hinterland are agriculture and chalky limestone.
Within the site hinterland, fisheries are considered a minor resource to harvest by the locals.
On the otber hand, the only important habitat within the project hinterland is the Nile. The
project interacts with significant habitat through water intake with the necessary
infrastructure. Therefore the Nile is the most significant ecological concem of the proposed
project.
Within the site itself, no flora, fauna or habitats of ecological or conservation importance were
identified. No natural vegetation or any habitats or ecological components of significance was
found on site.
A large number of insect species were collected on site. They represent Ehe largest number of
the animals collected. This is always the case since insects are one of the richest and most
resilient species found on earth. The insect fauna represents some ecological balance within
this habitat. However, due to the presence of the agricultural lands to the south of the site,
these species would find similar/altemate habitats in such lands.
In general, no significant impacts are expected to occur during the construction phase of the
project since no important habitats or biota were observed. The only important habitat is the
Nile itself. So, care should be taken when erecting any structures close to the Nile. Geo-textile
curtains should be employed around any construction activities to reduce turbidity in water
columns. No dumping of waste whether solid or liquid should be allowed to the Nile.
Several species of fresh water molluscs (snails) were collected at the water intake of the
present power plant along the Nile. Many of them are intermediate hosts/vectors of human
and/or animal disease. They represent harn to workers when they come in direct contact with
them only.

New & Renewable Energy Authority (NREA)         150 MWe Kuraymat Integrated Solar C.C. Project
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
Water vegetation constitute a problem to water intake since they aggregate in large quantities.
They also form a suitable habitat for the snails and other harmful mollusks. So, these plants
require continuous clearance and collection to maintain the water intake and prevent the
collection of large numbers of snails. The present boom installation represents a reasonable
measure to help reduce the quantities of the water vegetation.
Given the relatively small scale of the power plant development, and given that the land flats
are unlikely to be affected after construction of the plant, the impacts will be localized and
should not adversely affect the number of birds using the area.
6.5.3 Effects of Construction on the Proposed Site and Surrounding Areas
Construction of the power plant will remove approximately 2,772,000 m2 of land from the
existing ecosystem (see Annex D: Kurayrnat Project Land Acquisition). The installation of
intake structures will not result in the loss of an area of cultivated landflats, however the
surrounding landflat areas provide areas for birds and significant impacts are considered
unlikely.
Construction works, which are likely to occur over a 37 month period, will generate increased
noise, dust and movements of construction workers and equipment around the site. Any bird
species and other fauna which use or are resident in the area, are likely to be displaced and
will maintain a standoff distance. Areas in the immediate south of the plant provide an
alternative habitat for displaced species. The long-term impacts are therefore not predicted to
be great.
Negative impacts on flora and fauna during construction are not therefore considered to be
significant. Any disturbance during construction will be minimized through the mitigation
measures described in Section 6.5.5 below.
6.5.4 Potential Impacts as a Result of Power Plant Operation
It is not anticipated that there will be any further impacts to fauna and flora as a result of the
operation of the power station.
The stack measuring 35 m in height would not present an obstacle given that the area is not an
area of migrating birds. However, with the inclusion of measures such as lighting, to increase
the v isibility of stack at night or during weather conditions with poor visibility, this impact is
not expected to be significant.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
6.5.5  Mi tigation Measures
The potential impacts of the proposed development on any existing flora and fauna will be
minimized as a result of the following mitigation measures:
*  noise will be controlled during construction and operation, and will dissipate with
distance from source. Any disturbance during construction and operation will
therefore be localized (see Section 6.4);
*  run-off from construction activities and any movement of contaminants disturbed
along the land flats, will be attenuated and disposed of in a controlled manner (as
described in Section 6.3) to ensure that surrounding specieslhabitats are not
significantly affected;
*  Proper mitigation measures will be incorporated in the design of the water intake to
avoid negative impacts. Such mitigation measures are currently standardized
worldwide (e.g. World Bank, 1991 & 1996);
*  Appropriate measures should be adopted, in cooperation with UEEPC, to reduce
sand erosion off the island facing the water intake since the sand interferes with the
operations of the intake system. This may be in the form of sand stabilization,
planting or lining; and
*  Continuous collection and clearance of water vegetation around the water intake
should be carried out to prevent accumulation of snails and other harmful molluscs.
6.5.6 Conclusion
Since the site itself is poorly vegetated and southern areas are normally cultivated, the
significance to flora and fauna is considered to be limited. Given that the potential impacts of
construction and operation of the proposed power plant are localized, there are no predicted
significant effects.

6.6   LAND USE. LANDSCAPE AND VISUAL IMPACT
6.6.1 Land use
The surrounding land uses in the area constitute normal desert, limited agriculture, small low-
rise urban-type residential community and a small discreted low-rise rural-tpe residential
buildings in the wider area. To the immediate north of the site runs a 20 inch gas line from the
north of old Kuraymat power plant, parallel to the existing mazout line, to the highway
running through the Eastem Desert to Zafarana (Figure 6-9). Across the gas line to further
north of the proposed site is the 500 kV transmission line corridor associated with the old
ISCC Kuraymat power plant from its site to new Tebbin south of Cairo. Kuraymat / Zafarana
road runs to the very north of the site, beyond transmission lines. and across beyond it some
small villages (e.g. El-Burumbul). To the south of the site is an agricultural land and to the
west, about 750 m from the western fence, a little bit to the south direction, is the boundary of
the residential community associated with the old (existing) ISCC Kurayrnat power plant.
In general, land use conflicts between the proposed power generating facility at Kuraymnat and
adjacent land uses will be minor. Agricultural lands along eastern side of the HelwaniBen-
sueif road immediately south of the site boundary may be subjected to minor amounts of
construction dust but will not be affected by any land use conflicts after operation is initiated.
No access restrictions or interruption of existing activity practices will occur on adjacent
lands. No land use conflicts, encroachment, or interruption of services or access will occur
around the site area at Ezbet-EI-Hagg Ghanem and Dayer al-Maymun and the El-Wasta
cemetery, as a result of the presence and operation of the facility.
No adverse impacts to the residential spots are anticipated. Potential impacts to the
surrounding land uses include the effect of air emissions and the discharges to the aquatic
en% ironment, including any wastewater or thernal discharges. These impacts are addressed in
the air quality and aquatic environment sections (Sections 6.2 and 6.3). Landscape and visual
impacts are discussed below.
6.6.2 Landscape and Visual Impact
The power plant will be a substantial structure with a stack height of 35m, which, within the
surrounding flat desert or agricultural land, will be highly visible for 3km along the main
Helwan1Beni-sueif road, and few kilometers inland.
All existing views in the area may be strongly influenced by the construction of the power
plant. The proposed power plant will emphasize an industrial appearance and scale of the
local area complex. However, the potential visual impact is acceptable by the local people
given the advantages that the power plant project will bring to their life. The wider character
of the area may also absorb that visual intrusion due to wideness and expanded landscape.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
The one sensitive receptor in the area is the residential complex of the existing thermal power
plant. From these premises the power plant will be seen in context with the new intruded
industrial nature of the area created by the existence of the power plant, given the future plans
for Kuravmat as an investment area, therefore although visible from this area the power plant
may not regarded as being intrusive.
Also, the plumes from the cooling towers, will extend beyond the height of the plant
buildings. The visibility of the plumes from the cooling towers will greacly depend on the
prevailing meteorology, but might extend up to 20 m beyond the mouth of the towers. Given
other features such as the existing transmission lines as well as plans for industrial
developments, the visual impact of the power station is not expected to be significant.
Thus, while the power plant will be visible and the sensitivity of the landscape is not limited,
it is anticipated that the large scale of the flat land surrounding the power plant will be able to
visually accommodate the structures of the plant in an acceptable context.
6.6.3 Conclusion
Due to the large scale of the flat land surrounding the project, the new industrial infrastructure
of the power plant that will be created in the area would be acceptable from local people,
given the benefits they will gain from the project. Thus the potential landscape and visual
impact of the project will be minor.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
6.7 SOILS, GEOLOGY AND HYDROGEOLOGY
6.7.1 Introduction
The assessment of the impact of the proposed development on the soil, geology and
hydrogeology has considered the following issues:
* physical effects of construction activities on the soil profile;
* potential contamination from construction and operation of the proposed power
plant; and
* effects on groundwater resources.
The risk of seismic activity is discussed in Section 6.11.
The assessment is based on information obtained from reports prepared by National Research
Institute of Astronomy & Geographics, Struc. & Geotec. Research Center, and Enviro-Pro
describing the geology and geophysical structure of the site and its surroundings.
6.7.2 Effects on Soils and Geological Features During Construction
There are no special, sensitive or protected soil or geological features or mineral deposits
within the site, hence the development of this area of land will not have any significant
impacts on soil or geological features or on mineral resources.
Construction activities can potentially alter the physical make up of the soil through a numnber
of construction processes, including:
*  site preparation;
*  top soil removal and temporary mounding;
*  excavation for foundations;
*  provision of temporary drainage systems;
*  excavation for laying of pipes; and
*  excavation of trenching.
These activities can alter the soil's make up through compacting the soil (reducing infiltration
and aeration) and by changing the surface topography. These changes to the site may also
potentially affect recharge and drainage rates to local groundwater resources. However, given
that ground water recharge rates at and around the project site are minimal and groundwater if
abstracted in the project area will be under good engineering practice considerations, the
impact of power plant construction on local water resources is considered to be insignificant.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
The potential for the direct impacts on the soil mentioned above, is however largely dependent
on the management of the construction site and construction activities. A range of mitigation
measures will be implemented to protect soils and, as a result, the groundwater resources,
from the direct impacts of constructing the proposed power plant. These measures include the
following:
* engineered site drainage systems will be provided to collect, balance, treat as
required and control the discharge of site run-off;
* vehicles and personnel will be restricted from accessing areas not designated for
construction to prevent accidental or unnecessary disturbance or compaction of the
soil;
* spoil from construction activities will be monitored and controlled; waste materials
which are unsuitable for reuse on-site, will be disposed of by a licensed contractor
and the procedures for disposal will be audited by the N REA or their consultant.
The inclusion of the above mitigation measures means that there will be no significant direct
impacts on soils or geological features from construction activities.
6.7.3 Risk of Ground Contamination
Following geotechnical investigations carried out earlier, according to the Dutch Guidelines
(Table6-8), the topsoil cover has been investigated to a nornal depth and found clean. The
site, accordingly is considered to be uncontaminated (being an unused area). However, the
construction and operation of the proposed power plant has the potential to cause some
contamination through spillages and leaks, especially around fuel storage areas during
construction and fuel and chemical storage areas and supply lines for any hazardous
substances during operation.
Potential contaminating substances which will be present on the site during construction and
operation will include fuels, lubricating oils, hydraulic fluids, water treatment chemicals, plant
cleaning chemicals, sanitary effluent and detergents.
The risk of land contamination will be minimized through a range of mitigation measures.
These are considered below as appropriate to the construction and operation phases of the
power plant.
During Construction
Land contamination will be minimized through the following mitigation measures:

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
*  provision of engineered site drainage syslems during construction and operation to
collect, balance, treat as required and control the discharge of site run-off;
*  protection of the soil from accidental pollution by bunding around proposed storage
areas for fuel and chemicals with the capability to store at least 110% of the volume of
the storage facilities;
*  provision of oil interceptors, such as oil/water separators for the removal of pollutant
loading from the site drainage and for the retention and containment of an) accidental
discharges during construction and operation;
*  removal of waste materials unsuitable for re-use on site during construction to
appropriate licensed sanitary landfill sites;
*  management of excavations during construction so as to avoid the generation of
drainage pathways to underlying aquifers; and
*  provision of impermeable bases in operational areas to prevent absorption of any
spillage of process materials.
The potential for contaminated sediments to be excavated during construction of the water
intake structures is discussed in more detail in Section 6.3.2.
During Operalion
Ground contamination during operation will be minimized through implementation of the
following mitigation measures:
*  Bunds or sumps will be installed on-site to isolate areas of potential oil or other
spillages, such as transformer bays, from the site drainage system.
*  Oil and chemical storage tanks will have secondary containment structures that will
hold 110% of the contents of the largest storage tank.
*  Areas for unloading oil and hazardous chemical materials will be isolated by curbs
and provided with a sump. Removal of such material will be via manual action, and
not via an automated control..
*  The transformers will be provided with pits to retain 110% of the coolant capacity
of the transformers which will include fire fighting water quantity in accordance
with NFPA criteria. Alternatively, each oil-filled transformer foundation will drain
through a corner sump directly to an underground oil collection chamber sized to

retain 110% of the coolant capacity of the transforrners plus deluge water (for the
worst single catastrophic failure). Adjacent to this collection chamber an oil
separator will be constructed which will normnally fumction to separate any oil from
the storTn water collected within the transformner foundations and the clean water
drained to the discharge facility. The transforrners will not contain PCBs.
* Storrnwater runoff from equipment slabs that may be subject to oil contamination
exposure will be collected and channeled through an oil/water separator prior to
discharge into the discharge facility.
With these mitigation measures in place, the construction and operation of the proposed
power plant is not predicted to cause any ground contamination on-site or of the surrounding
land.
6.7.4 Groundwater Quality and Recharge
The volume of water entering the aquifer from the proposed site is currently considered to be
negligible. Creation of areas of impermeable hardstanding on the site will not therefore
significantly affect groundwater recharge in the area.
The mitigation measures set out in Section 6.7.3 will minimize the risk of contamination of
groundwater from the proposed power plant during its construction and operation. As a result,
no significant impacts on groundwater resources under the site are predicted during
construction or operation.
6.7.5 Conclusion
Due to the characteristics of the soils and geology of the site, in particular the lack of any
sensitive features, and the mitigation measures proposed as part of the construction and
operation of the power plant, no significant impacts are predicted to occur. In addition, after
thorough geotechnical investigations for the site topsoil cover has been found
uncontaminated.

6.8   TRAFFIC
6.8.1 Traffic Assessment M1ethodology
Analysis of traffic impacts during construction and operation of the power plant utilized both
historical and field data. The statistical analysis, undertaken and reported in detail in baseline
study performed by the Egyptian National Institute of Transport (ENMT) for this EIA report
requirements, considered an analysis of traffic speed and growth.
The assessment considers the main roads linking the site with the surrounding road network as
well as the regional roads, as indicated in Section 5.10.
There are no Egyptian standards or World Bank guidelines with respect to assessing the
significance of changes in traffic flow on road networks. The analysis presented here and
undertaken by ENIT compares the anticipated impacts with guidance reported in the Highway
Capaciry M\fanual (HCMI), 2000 of the US Federal Highway Administration (FHWA).
6.8.2 Traffic Analysis During Construction
The schedule for construction works, the anticipated volume of traffic generated and the
routes used, is discussed in Section 4.7 of this report.
Three mathematical models were developed in order to estimate projected growth of the
existing traffic flows to the year during which peak construction activity is likely to occur
(2005-2006) and the year of completion 2007. The traffic growth rates derived from the
models were used to estimate traffic volumes for 2005i2006
Current Level of Service (LOS)
The traffic analysis is based on estimating the Level of Service (LOS) of the Kuraymat / Ben-
sueif Road and Giza / Beni-sueif Road. LOS is a qualitative measure that describes the
operational conditions within a traffic stream and the perception by motorists and passengers.
The LOS analysis was carried out by EN1T, as described by the Highway Capacity Manual
(HCM), last edition, published by the US Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) in 2000
for two-way two-lane highways. In addition, speed analysis was used to estimate the average
travel speed along the two roads and to assess the variation of the average speed.
The LOS is classified using a lettering system as set out below.
To conceive the traffic operating conditions under any of the levels A, B, C, D or E the
following descriptions are used by the HCM.

* LOS A; describes completely free-flow conditions, i.e. the operation of vehicles is
virtually unaffected by the presence of other vehicles.
*   LOS B; describes free flow, although the presence of other vehicles begins to be
noticeable.
*   LOS C; average speed is about 85 km/hr on level terrain; unrestricted passing demand
exceeds passing capacity, percent time delay up to 60%; service flow rate starts from
750 up to 1200 passenger car per hour (pcph) in both directions.
*   LOS D; average speed of 80 km/hr can still be maintained under ideal conditions;
unstable traffic flow is approached; passing becomes extremely difficult because
passing capacity approaches zero; percentage time delay approaches 75%; maximum
service flow rates of 1800 (pcph) in both direction.
*   LOS E; Speeds will drop below 80 km/hr under ideal conditions; passing is virtually
impossible; capacity is 2800 (pcph) in both directions; percentage time delay exceeds
75%.
A volume-to-capacity ratio is calculated and related to the level of service. This analysis is
carried out for two different sections of Giza / Beni-sueif Road, which is the only road
concemed in this study: the first section is between Kuriemat and Beni-sueif while the second
section near El-Ayyat.
For the regional roadway sections, the general peak hour rate is given as 10% of the daily
traffic volume. This rate is applied to be the section of Giza'Beni-sueif Road near El-Ayyat,
after expanding the year 2002 data to the year 2003 using a nominal growth rate of 4.5%. This
rate is based on the average annual growth rate of the AADT during the period 1992-2002
(presented in Section 5.10). For the road section between Kuraymat and Beni-sueif, the 16-
hour traffic count conducted was adjusted (i) to estimate the AADT on this section for the year
2003. Then, peak traffic was taken as 10% of the AADT. Since the percentage of heavy trucks
along this road is very high (23%), Peak traffic volumes are tberefore expressed in Passenger
Car Units (PCUJ) based on the equivalent factor (1) for each vehicle type and its percentage in
the traffic composition along that road (presented in details in Section 5.10).
(1) The adjustment process is based on three different correction factors estitnated from the AADT, monthly
variations and hourly variations during the weekdays for the road section near El-Ayyat in the year 2002
(which were presented in Section 5.10). The estimated values for the 16-hour traffic count correction factor,
the weekly adjustment factor for Tuesday, and the monthly adjustrnent factor for September are 1.32, 1.026,
and 0.948 respecti,elh.

Table 6-19 illustrates the volume-to-capacity ratio (V/C) for two different sections along this
road. The values of V/C rations indicate that Kuraymat / Beni-sueif section currently operates

Notes:
(1) The capacity or these two sections is estimated as 2800 vehicles per hour in both directions of travel.
As for the regional roads, the general peak hour rate is giv.en as 10% of the daily traffic
volume. This rate is applied to the two regional roads providing access to the study area, after
expanding the year 2001 data to year 2003 using a nominal growth rate of 6%, as an expected
gross domestic product (GDP) annual rate of growth Table 6-20 illustrates the volume-to
capacity ratio for both Cairo/Alexandria Agriculture Highway and Cairo/Alexandria Desert

It can be seen that Cairo/Alexandria Desert Highway operates at a level of service "C", which
is considered acceptable at the regional level, while Cairo/Alexandria Agriculture Highway
runs near its capacity.

Traffic Generation
An important step in conducting the traffic impact analysis is to estimate the traffic generated
from the new ISCC Kurayrnat power plant during peak hours. The anount of traffic
generation is directly related to the type and characteristics of the new power project of the
Kuraymat.
In this respect, two cases of generation: during construction and post construction (i.e. during
normal plant operation) should be considered. Summary of peak construction traffic is given
in Table 6-21.
The distribution of traffic generation to the surrounding street network is related to location
context within the study area.as well as the entry/exit points from the site to the surrounding
access roads (i.e. local roads).

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
Traffic Impact Analysis
The impact assessment usually establishes the peak hour situation with the project after
completion in the inauguration year. In this case, the results of the traffic data for
regional and local roads (previously detailed) are expanded to the construction and
opening years of the power plant (2005-2007), and then combined with generated
traffic from the power plant. The roads level of service wilh the site traffic is then
estimated for these years. A comparison of the level of service would show the amount
of impact envisaged by the power plant during and post the construction phase.
The analysis is conducted for the two regional roadway sections along Giza / Beni-sueif
road, which provides access to the power plant (i.e.Section 1: the section between
Kuraymat and Beni-sueif, and Section 2: the section near El-Ayyat). Roadway or traffic
operational improvement would be addressed as alternative site improvements, and
would be evaluated for peak hour effectiveness.
"During Construction" case, the traffic associated with the plant project will be
superimposed on the existing traffic during construction years (2005 and 2006) (l) as
summarized in Table 6-22. The amount of peak hour traffic generated during
construction is given as 10 trucks/hour and 82 vehicles/hour (i.e. 92 vehicles/hour in
total). This would increase peak traffic for Section 1 during 2005 by 25%. Thus, the
value of (V/C) ratio increases from 0.21 to 0.26, and consequently its current LOS
would remain unchanged at LOS (A). For Section 2, construction traffic would increase
the peak traffic by 6% for year 2005. Thus, the value of (V/C) ratio increases from 0.84
to 0.89, and consequently its LOS without the plant construction for the year 2005
would also remain unchanged at LOS (E). Accordingly, this section is recommended to
be doubled by before 2005.

New & Renewable Energy Authority (NREA)           150 MWe Kuraymat Integrated Solar C.C. Project
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
"Post Construction" case indicates that the existing traffic on the two sections along
Giza/Beni-sueif road is forecasted for the year 2007 (inauguration year). Therefore, all
the base year counts (year 2003 counts) are expected to year 2007 by 4.5% per annum.
The expected peak traffic for 2007 for with and without the power plant project is
depicted in Table 6-22.
Generally speaking, the peak plant-generated traffic in the post construction case (i.e. 29
vehicles per hour) is considered very small. Moreover, this figure represents only one-third the
peak traffic generated during the construction period. Hence, the traffic impact of the power
plant project on the two road sections in this case is less critical than the construction case.
However, the forecasted peak traffic for the year 2007 on Sections 1 and 2 is expected to
increase by 7.7% and 1.9% respectively as a result of the peak plant-generated traffic in the
post construction case. This small percentage of increase would have a limited effect on the
existing level of service of the two sections. For Section 1, V/C ratio would increase from
0.21 to 0.23, and the LOS would remain unchanged at LOS (A). For Section 2, V/C ratio
would slightly increase from 0.88 to 0.89, and the LOS without the plant also remains
unchanged at LOS (E) afler the plant is put for full operation in 2007. As such, no significant
changes in the tratTic operation would be expected due to the construction and operation of the
power plant.
6.8.3 Traffic Assessment Conclusion
The expected traffic generated from the power plant project (in both cases: during
construction and after inauguration) is then superimposed on the existing flows on both
roadway sections. It was concluded that the additional traffic would have a little effect
on the level of service of two roadway sections particularly in the morning peak during
the second year of construction (i.e. year 2006). Accordingly, the current LOS of
Section I would remain unchanged at LOS (A), whilst LOS for Section 2 would reduce
from its current LOS (D) to (E). However, this reduction is mainly referred to the
normal traffic growth during the two peak construction years and the inauguration year
(i.e. is not referred to the power plant generated traffic). Therefore, it can be concluded
that the traffic will continue to operate at a good level of service on the Kuraymat/Beni-
sueif section until the inauguration year of the power plant (year 2007).
(1) This is based on a total space of 35 sq m required for each parking space, taking into consideration the
standard dimension of vehicles (private cares, buses and trucks) as well as the spaces needed for isles and
other concemed services associated with car parks, e.g. toilets, kiosks, etc.

New & Renewable Energy Authority (NREA)        150 MWe Kuraymat Integrated Solar C.C. Project
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
Concerning parking demand, some 70 more parking spaces are required to
accommodate the additional traffic generated from the power plant. These spaces are
expected to occupy a total area of around 2500 square meters (i.e. only 3.5% of the total
area assigned for the project).
In order to increase accessibilit) to the power plant, it is recommended to extend the
two bus lines operated by Greater Cairo Bus Company (') to end very close to the power
plant instead of ending at Es-Saff (an additional distance of around 30km). This would
also help people staying the at employees' camp to be connected with Kuraymat village
and Es-Saff town.
Traffic Management System and Mitigation Measures
Although the effects of construction traffic are likely to be limited, a number of good
management measures will be undertaken. These comprise:
*  construction workers will be transported to the site by minibuses;
*  prescribed routes for construction traffic will be agreed with the appropriate
authorities, particularly with respect to HGV traffic and abnormal loads if required by
the CAA; and
*   abnormal load movements will adhere to prescribed routes to be agreed with the
appropriate authorities - these will be scheduled to avoid peak hours on local roads and
published in advance to minimize possible disruption if required by the CAA.
With the inclusion of the mitigation measures, the potential impacts upon the affected roads
will not be significant.
6.8.4 Operational Traffic
Construction and commissioning of the power plant is expected to be complete in 2007.
Operational U orkers
The power plant will operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and will employ
approximately 300 people. During a normal working day it is understood that 225-265
employees will access the site at the beginning and end of the working day. Peak
vehicular activity of 67 movements will occur at the start and end of the normal
(1) These two lines are operated from Helwan and Et-Tebbin to Es-Saff Citv.

working day, assuming that all workers travel to the power plant by private motor
vehicle with a vehicle occupancy rate of 4 . During night-time and official holidays, 48-
55 employees will be on-site.
Heavy Goods Vehicles (HG 's)
All delivery of gas will be via a pipeline. Therefore, the only HGV movements arising
from the operation of the power plant will be associated with the delivery of fuel oil
(sollar), process materials or maintenance equipment. Delivery of these materials is
estimated to generate approximately three HGVs, or five HGVs movements, per day.
A.ssignment of Operational Traffic
Operational statT are likely to originate from Es-Saff and surrounding areas (wider Giza
Govemorate) and will mostly access the site via the GCizaBen-sueif road.
A summary of generated traffic is given in Table 6-23.

6.8.5 Operational Traffic Impacts
Percentage increases in hourly traffic flows during the operation of the power plant are about
7.7% on the Giza'Beni-sueif Road to the site of the power plant.
These small increases in road usage are insufficient to cause any noticeable impacts on traffic
conditions, cyclists or pedestrians and, therefore, no significant effects are predicted.
6.8.6 Conclusion
The assessment of traffic and transport covers the changes in traffic conditions in terms of
delay and congestion during construction and operation.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
The greatest potential for traffic impacts to occur arises during the short period of peak
construction. There is some potential for increased congestion on the main roads to the power
plant, however the impacts will only occur during the peak construction phase and during
peak hours. The overall impact is therefore not predicted to be significant. Mitigation
measures will be put in place to reduce the potential for impacts to arise.
During operation, a small number of workers and HGVs are associated with operating the
power plant and no impacts are predicted to occur.
Overall, the traffic impacts associated with the construction and operation of the power plant
are considered to be mninor and not significant.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
6.9   SOCIO-ECONOMIC EFFECTS
6.9.1 Introduction
The administrative structure within which the power plant is situated is explained in Section
5.12 of this report.
This section addresses the socio-economic impacts associated with the construction and
operation of the ISCC Kuraymat power plant. The nearest permanent settlements to the
boundaries of the proposed plant is about 750 m west of the power plant site,
residential community of the existing Kuraymat plant, and about 2.5 km south-west of
the site, Ezbet El-Hagg Ghanem as well as Kuraymat village (3km) and El-Burumbul
village (3.5 km) north-west and north-north-west of the proposed power plant site
respectively. The cities and towns around the site (e.g. Es-Saff and Beni -suei f)are likely
to experience the greatest positive and negative socio-economic impacts from the
construction and operation of the plant due to its proximity to the plant.
The assessment of impacts draws upon baseline data collected and provided by E & E and
New and Renewable Energy Authority (NREA) during preparation of their documentation for
local environmental permitting requirements and preparation for this EIA report. No
infornation on existing income levels was available from the Giza Governorate, Kuraymat
zone (Es-SafT& Atfieh) authorities.
6.9.2 Resettlement
As there will be permanent staff settlements within the Kuraymat project region, no
resettlement or displacement of people is envisaged. People will not be displaced by
construction therefore there is no resettlement associated with this project.
Conversations between E & E, NREA and the World Bank have resulted in a strong
commitment to resolve any compensation based on fair and equitable value for the loss of the
use of the land if it were happened.
6.9.3 Land Acquisition
The plant is sited on land given by Presidential Decree to NREA who have assigned the land
for development of the power plant. Historically, all land in Egypt belongs to the state and is
assigned to specific owners via Presidential authorization (see Annex D).

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
6.9.4 Employment Generation
A key positive socio-economic impact of the development of the power plant will be
ihe generation of employment during it's construction and operation. NREA proposes
to operate a policy of preferential employment of locally resident workers depending on
skills and availability in order to maximize local employment benefits. This local
workforce will be drawn from the wider Kuraymat zone and the neighboring
cities-towns in the Giza and Beni-sueif Governorates.
It should be noted that construction work within the Giza Governorate is traditionally
undertaken by migrant labor from Upper Egypt. Migrants are attracted to the area by the
availability of manual work which is traditionally not undertaken by indigenous
residents. Mligrants find accommodation within Kuraymat zone and its surrounding
zones and remain in the area until employment prospects elsewhere draw them away.
Given the growth of construction activity ongoing in the Giza Governorate, the number
of workers available for construction of the power plant, is likely to be reasonable.
Available employment data described in Section 5.12 of this report, suggests that
unemployment in the whole Governorate of Giza lies around 4.49% and in the Giza
Govemorate, around 1,449,922 people form the active workforce. Statistics suggest that
approximately 30% of this labor force is comprised of industry and construction workers and
around 65% of the Giza's workforce are categorized as skilled, having been trained in various
disciplines.
The estimated employment generated b) the plant is anticipated to be as follows:
*  80 workers provided bv the Architect Engineer;
* 600 local employees for the civil work; and
* 700 local employees for mechanical and electrical work.
Local workers will represent approximately 75% of the civil and mechanical construction
work.
In addition, the Architect Engineer will provide approximately 45 persons who will manage
45 other local personnel who will in turn manage local teams. Local employees to cover
management activities will represent approximately 60% of the staff.
No worker housing or associated facilities will be erected on site during construction or
operation of the power plant to accommodate workers. Following general practice in the area,
minibuses will be provided to bring construction workers to the site from Kuraymat area and
surrounding cities.

New & Renewable Energy Authority (NREA)         150 MWe Kuraymat Integrated Solar C.C. Project
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
Following construction of the power plant, the majority of manual jobs will become
redundant, however given the large number of other construction activities in the wider
area. this is not anticipated to present any negative impacts to the local workforce.
During operation of the power plant, both skilled and unskilled staff will be recruited
from the local workforce. Unskilled positions will include drivers, cooks, cleaners,
clerks and secretaries and security guards. Women could fill many of these jobs. The
NREA Authority will employ people with due regard to their equal opportunities
policy.
The construction and operation of the power plant is therefore anticipated to provide
significant employment opportunities within the Giza Governorate, including Kuraymat area.
The employmnent generated by the power plant will be an important positive impact of the
proposed project.
6.9.5 Direct and Indirect Income Effects
Direct Income Effects
The potential direct income effects during construction and operation of the power plant
include:
*  income from the permanent and temporary jobs that will be provided during the
construction and operation of the plant. Market rates will be paid to all workers who
will, in turn, spend a considerable portion of the money in the local economy through
goods and services bought in the area;
*  income from locally placed orders for goods and services during construction and
operation phases including contracts for the provision of construction materials and
services, maintenance repairs and equipment servicing, and the establishment of
supply contracts (e.g. security, waste disposal, food, cleaning, catering, transport,
laundry etc.).
The average wage of an unskilled and skilled employee is 40 and 120 Egyptian pounds
per day ($6.15 - S18.46). Typically about 30% of the capital cost of the plant is likely to
be expended in the region, covering payroll, civil construction materials, erection
works, local plant and equipment hire/ purchase, general construction materials etc.
The typical annual operational expenditure of the power plant will be in the region of
USS 2 million, although in years where substantial maintenance is carried out,
expenditure can be expected to rise to US$ 3 million.

New & Renewable Energy Authority (NREA)          150 MWe Kuraymat Integrated Solar C.C. Pmject
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
Approximately. 70% of this operational expenditure will be spent locally on labor,
consumables, equipment and general maintenance.
Indirect Income Effects
Indirectly, the power plant is likely to raise the profile of the region, and in securing the
supply of power to the region will attract economic and social investments resulting in
jobs, improved infrastructure and service provision. Whilst this could be perceived as
having potential negative long-term effects on local culture, the area has a long
established local culture associated with small manufacturing activities of the Kuraymat
Region. In addition, long term development plans of the Government of Egypt may add
some future expansions.   The power plant is therefore central to attracting this
investment and the positive income-generating potential of these developments is likely
to out"seigh any negative impacts.
6.9.6 Public Services
A potential adverse effect of the power plant is increased demand for public services,
such as water and wastewater provision, housing, education, health services, etc. An
assessment of these impacts however does not suggest that any negative effects will be
experienced.
During plant construction, sanitary water will be provided also via local water system.
During operation, all water for sanitary purposes will be supplied by the plant water
system. Sewage generated at the power plant will be disposed of via the plant sewer
system.
As discussed in Section 5.12.3, migrant labor is traditionally attracted to the region and
public services are considered by public officials to be more than adequate to absorb
them. No provision of additional services is therefore considered necessary duing
construction or operation of the power plant.
6.9.7 Cultural Effects
As the larger project area (South Giza & North Beni-sueif) is already dominated by large scale
agricultural activity, no significant cultural impacts are anticipated as a result of the power
plant development. In addition, migrant manual labor is traditionally welcomed in the region
resulting in no social or community problems.

6.9.8 Conclusion
It is anticipated that the power plant will provide a net positive socio-economic impact
through the provision of employment opportunities and attraction of economic investment
into the area.
In addition, the use of local labor wherever practicable, will maximize these positive impacts
through the development of the local skill base and will also generate increased demand for
local services, materials and products.

6.10  ARCHAEOLOGICAL, HISTORIC AND CULTURAL HERITAGE
6.10.1 Introduction
This section assesses impacts on archaeological, historic and cultural resources as a result of
the construction and operation of the ISCC Kuraymat power plant.
6.10.2 Known Archaeological, Historic and Cultural Remains
The baseline study completed previously, found no available information to identify
any archaeological, historic or cultural remains on the site or in the surrounding area.
No buildings or remains of archaeological, historic or cultural significance are known
to exist along the access road to the site or in the surrounding area. This is supported by
consultation undertaken by E&E and NREA with officials of the Supreme Council of
Antiquities, indigenous people, local officials and experts, during which it was stated
that there are no identified archaeological monuments at the proposed power plant site.
6.103 Conclusion
It is concluded that the construction and operation of the power plant will have no impact on
any known archaeological, historic or cultural resources. Consultation undertaken with local
officials and experts in Cairo and Giza verified that the site is not of archaeological interest.
In the event however, that remains being found construction will cease and the advice of the
Supreme Council of Antiquities will be sought. Appropriate measures will be put in place to
protect and/or excavate the remains, including the following procedures:
*  where possible, remains will be protected in-situ;
* where identified remains cannot be protected, an excavation of the indicated area will
be undertaken prior to the commencement of construction activities to record and
remove vulnerable remains and features;
* any finds of archaeological, historic or cultural significance will be given to the
Supreme Council of Antiquities; and
* preparation of a Chance Finds Procedure which lays out the steps to be taken if
archaeological, historical or cultural remains or finds are discovered during
construction activities. The procedures will clearly set out how the construction team
will be briefed so that they are aware of what to look out for and the actions which
must be taken should a potential find be uncovered.
The incorporation of these precautionary measures into the construction program will ensure
that all potential remains of significance are recorded and are accorded the required protection
where considered necessary.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
6.11  NATURAL DISASTER RISK
6.11.1 Seismic Risk
The Power Station site is vulnerable to small to moderate kinds of earihquakes (<3 - 5.7 on
Richter scale). This should be taken into consideration in selection of the appropriate building
code and in engineering designs (Figures 5-23 and 5-24).
The power plant has been designed to conform to the Uniform Building Code (UBC),
Division V-Earthquakle Design, for Seismic Zone 2A, according to US regulations for
earthquake. These design criteria are therefore considered sufficient to withstand the level of
seismic activity experienced in the Area.
The potential environmental impacts of a seismic event during power plant operation are not
anticipated to be significant.
6.11.2 Flood Risk
The risk of flash flooding in the project area, as indicated in Section 5.2 of this report, is
considered to be low, hence the proposed power plant is largely located in an area classified as
not representing significant flood risk.
The site of the present Kuraymat power plant is conveniently protected against flash flooding
(Figure 5-12 and 5-22). However, if further need arises to protect the site of the new ISCC
Kuraymat power plant against potentially more severe floods, special measures need to be
taken at the lower reach of Wadi Ramlyyah and possibly Wadi Atfieh (Figure 6-10). These
measures commonly include construction of man-made dykes or gabions at selected sites of
the larger tributaries of the wadi basins. Dykes may be constructed by bulldozing large stones
and cobbles of the wadi bed or bedrock foot slopes (wadi banks) either into several lines of
heaps across the main tributaries or into successive incomplete stone dykes arranged in a
zigzag fashion. After a strong flood these structures may need limited or major restoration.
Instead of these loose stone dykes, gabion stacks may be constructed. A gabion is a box made
up of wire mesh and filled in situ with large stones and cobbles of nearly the same size. They
are arranged side by side in raws. The height of the barrier may be increased by construction
of other tiers of gabions at higher levels.
In order to further reduce any potential impacts of flooding during construction and operation,
the following measures will be implemented:
during the early stages of construction, a site drainage system will be built, equipped to
protect the site against potential flooding;

*  site drainage will be constructed in such a way as to dissipate flood waters away from
the main plant areas and to discharge clean waters to a natural drainage basin or
drainage wadi in the area or to the treatment system of the power plant, with any
potentially contaminated waters, via the oil interceptor;
* the access road will be culverted to allow adequate transit of flood waters.
With these provisions for controlling the impacts of the plant as a result of heavy rainfall, no
significant flood risk impacts are predicted to occur.

6.12   MAJOR ACCIDENT HAZRDS
6.12.1 Introduction
A major accident is defined as a physical situation with a potential for harm to
individuals, infrastructure and buildings, or for impairment and environmental damage.
Major accident hazards of concern with respect to the construction and operation of the
power plant are those with the potential for injury, impairment and/or damage external
to the power plant perimeter.
6.12.2 Assessment of Mlajor Accident Hazards
An assessment of major accident hazards associated with the construction and operation of the
power plant should consider the following issues:
* the potential risk to third party hazardous industry, facilities or populations of the
operation of the power plant; and
*  the potential risk to the power plant posed by third party hazardous industry or
facilities.
Given the land uses surrounding the ISCC Kuraymat power plant and the measures
incorporated into the design of the plant to minimize the risk from fire and explosion, the
plant is not anticipated to pose a potential risk of any significance to any third party facilities.
Furthermore, none of the third party commercial or manufacturing facilities and activities
within 2 km of the site represent a significant risk of a major accident hazard to the power
plant e.g. from fire, explosion, release of toxic gases etc.
In addition, since natural gas will be delivered to the plant by pipeline, there will be no natural
gas storage facilities on site. Furthermore, no hazardous chemicals will be held on site in
quantities sufficient to pose a major hazard.
Potential accidents may however occur as a result of ruptures to the gas pipeline during any
future development of the area. Whilst the pipeline connection is the responsibility of
GASCO, the following mitigation measures are recommended to avoid damage to the
pipelines:
* the minimum reinstated cover should be 1.2m above the pipeline;
* above ground markers should be installed so as to clearly indicate the routes for all
pipelines; and

* valves should be located %% ithin the pipeline so that flow can be halted in the event of
a rupture.
6.123 Risk of Major Accidents on the Power Plant Site
Fichtner Solar GmbH identified fire risks during design of the power plant and in particular
with regard to the following areas of the plant:
*  the gas turbines;
*  the Heat Recovery Steam Generators (HRSGs);
* fuel oil storage tanks(]);
*  transformners;
*  turbine oil tank;
*  electrical rooms.
* administration building, and
*  yard area.
The power plant has been designed to be in conformance with the international code of
the National Fire Protection Authority (NFPA), which requires particular specifications
for fire protection 2) and compliance with local fire protection systems. A Fire Safety
Plan is currently being developed and will be implemented prior to power plant
commissioning. A permnit from the Egyptian Civil Defense Authority is required prior
to plant operation.
An Industrial Hazard Assessment has not been undertaken and is not considered necessary
since:
*  measures have been incorporated into the design of the plant to minimize the risk from
fire and explosion; and
* the third party commercial or manufacturing facility within 2 kmn of tbe site does not
represent a significant risk of a major accident hazard to the power plant e.g. from fire,
explosion, release of toxic gases etc.

6.13   SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT
A natural gas power plant produces no ash and only a low quantity of other solid wastes
during construction and operation. These include the following:
*  Construction waste: contaminated spoil, oil druns etc.;
*  General plant wastes: oily rags, broken and rusted metal and machine parts, defectIve
or broken electrical parts, empty containers, miscellaneous refuse;
*  Raw water pre-treatment sludge: from build-up of solid residues in the raw water pre-
treatment system;
*  Tank sludge: solid residues which build up in process chemical storage tanks;
*  Oil Interceptor sludge: from drainage interceptors used to remove solids and oils and
grease from efuent;
*  Packaging waste: from operational consumable supplies; and
*  Commercial wastes: from offices, canteen and staff facilities.
Wastes generated at and by the plant will be evacuated from the site by licensed contractors.
Final disposal of wastes will be to waste treatment plants or local landfill sites, as agreed by
the relevant competent administrative authority.
To ensure that impacts from solid waste generation and disposal are successfully avoided, the
following mitigation measures will be undertaken during plant construction and operation:
*  all waste taken off site will be carried out by a licensed waste contractor and NPREA
will audit the disposal procedure;
*  all solid waste will be segregated into different waste types, collected and stored on
site in designated storage facilities and areas prior to release to off-site disposal
facilities;
*  all relevant consignments of waste for disposal, will be recorded, indicating their type,
destination and other relevant information, prior to being taken off site; and
*  standards for storage area, management systems and disposal facilities will be agreed
with the relevant parties.
The environmental engineer of the power plant will be responsible for solid waste
management at the site and will ensure that all wastes are managed to minimize any
environmental risks.
With the adoption of these mitigation measures, the impacts of solid waste generated by the
construction and operation of the power plant are not predicted to be significant.

6.14 PUBLIC HEALTH
6.14.1 Air Pollution
The key issue in relation to public health is the potential effecls of air pollution from the
plant's stack emissions. The assessment of air quality impacts presented in Section 6.2
demonstrates that ground level pollutant concentrations as a result of emissions from the
power plant will not significantly affect air quality. Hence, the health risks from stack
emissions are not considered to be significant.
6.14.2 Disease Vectors
The proposed power plant includes a range of mitigation which will prevent the
encouragement of disease vectors, such as rodents or insects. These measures include the
following:
* provision of sanitation during construction and operation;
* control and management of solid wastes;
* provision of potable and process waste supplies; and
* disposal of site drainage and effluent.
With these mitigation measures, the potential for encouragement of disease vectors is low.

6.15  OCCPTATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES
6.15.1 Safety Issues
The proposed ISCC Kuraymat power plant site is currently unused and no environmental
features or characteristics have been identified which could cause special occupational health
and safety impacts. In particular, as an unused area, ground cover to a depth of more than 2m
is clean, therefore no soil contamination is present and no special construction techniques are
expected to be required to build the power plant.
In addition, there are no commercial or industrial activities bordering the site and therefore no
safety issues associated with third-parties are anticipated.
The NREA will establish and integrate policies and procedures on occupational health
and safet) into the operation of the power plant. Emergency and accident response
procedures will also be included in the operation manual for the power plant. In
particular, construction and operation activities will be carried out on the following
basis:
* compliance with international standards for good construction and operational
practices;
* adherence to local and international guidance and codes of practice on EIIS
management during construction and operation;
*  management, super'ision, monitoring and record-keeping as set out in the plant's
operational manual;
*  implementation of EHS procedures as a condition of contract with contractors and
their sub-contractors;
*  clear definition of the EHS roles and responsibilities of the companies involved in
construction and to individual staff (including the nomination of EHS supervisors
during construction and an EHS coordinator during operation);
*  pre-construction and operation assessment of the EHS risks and hazards associated
with construction and operation, including consideration of local cultural attitudes,
education level of workforce and local work practices;

* provision of appropriate training on EHS issues for all construction and operation
vorkers, including initial induction and regular refresher training, taking into account
local cultural issues;
*  provision of health and safety information;
* regular inspection, review and recording of EHS performnance; and
*  maintenance of a high standard of housekeeping at all times.
Given the provision of this high standard of health and safety management on site,
construction and operation of the power plant in accordance with good industry practice
and the lack of any adverse features/characteristics of the site, the occupational health
and safety risks associated with construction and operation of the power plant will be
minimized.

6.16  ASSOCIATED INFRASTRUCTURE
Connections to existing gas and electrical infrastructure will be the responsibilitv of GASCO
and NREA, in collaboration with EETC, respectively. The first w'ill not require pernit from
the EEAA as the gas pipelines already pass adjacent to the immediate north of the power plant
boundarv and will provide the proposed ISCC power plant with natural gas. Key potential
impacts that will be considered include:
* land use; and
* existence of residential communities.
6.16.1 Gas Pipeline
An existing gas pipeline network runs to the gas pressure reducing station of the present
Kuraymat power plant at the north-east point within the plant boundary. It is intended that a
new connection pumping station will be taken from this pipeline network to feed the proposed
ISCC power plant with natural gas. Any environmental impacts will be identified and
mitigated / managed by GASCO.
The potential impacts of a seismic event rupturing the gas pipeline have not been assessed in
this EIA report, as the pipeline does not form part of NREA's project. However, it is
recormrnended that at a minimum, automatic shut-off valves should be fitted at regular
distances along the length of the pipeline allowing gas flow to be halted in the event of
seismic activity.
6.16.2 Transmission Lines
The ISCC Kuraymat power plant will be connected to the existing transmission facilities of
the Egyptian Electricity Transmission Company's (EETC) (an affiliate company to the EEHC)
network via connecting Transmission lines.
As mentioned earlier (Section 4.6.5), 220 kV switchyard is preferred for the power evacuation
considering the size of the power plant and the existing 220 kVI500 kV substation at a
distance of about 2 km from the project site in the nearby steam power plant. A 220 kV
switchyard %kill be located in the ISCC-KPP. Interconnection of this switchyard with the
nearby switchyard and providing additional outgoing line feeder for evacuating power if
required is most probably be decided in the course of further engineering.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
The 220 kV substations are of the outdoor type. Generally, normal two winding transformers
are used for the generator units and autotransformers in the network substations (interbus
transformers). The autotransformers are equipped with hieh-side load-changing taps which
can be operated also off-load and manually. The circuit breakers, are of the air-blast type.
As can be seen on the ISCC Kurayrnat General Site Description, the overhead lines going out
from the power plant encounter mostly desert area typical for the Upper Egypt zone. Land
acquisition for connecting line construction does not present any problems. High attention
must be paid to line route access during the transmission connecting line construction because
of the exiting land uses and the road. No line route problems which are specific to the ISCC
Kuraymat site are to be considered in the implementation phase.
The proposed tie in overhead lines in the case of the ISCC Kuravmat site will terminate into
existing substations which have to be correspondingly extended.

7.    NIITIGATION OF ENVIRONNMENTAL IMPACTS
7.1   INTRODUJCTION
The New and Renewable Energy Authority (NREA) is committed to constructing and
operating the ISCC Kuraymat power plant to high environment, hcalth and safety (EHS)
standards.
This section provides a summary of mitigation measures. as well as environmental
enhancement opportunities, for the key EHS impacts which have been identified through the
EIA process. The mitigation measures represent a synthesis of those measures which are part
of the basic pow&er plant design and those that have been recommended in Section 6 of this
report for both the construction and operational phases of the power plant.
The mitigation measures discussed in this section are summarized in Tables 8-land 8.2 in
Seciion 8, together with respective environmental monitoring and management arrangements.
It should be noted that many of the mitigation measures presented below for the construction
phase, will be carried forward into plant Operation.
All the mitigation, monitoring and management measures proposed below and in Section 8 of
this report (the Environmental Action Plan (EAP)), will be adopted by the NREA and
imposed as conditions of contract on the contractor and any sub-contractors employed to build
or operate any part of the power plant. Since many of the mitigation measures presented are
considered an essential, integrated component of the construction and operation works, it is
not possible to separate the specific costs of their implementation from the overall
construction costs.
7.2  1MITIGATION MEASURES DURING DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION
7.2.1 Dust Emissions during Construction
As described in Section 6.2.2, dust generated by construction activities could be significant
locally, not only in terms of air quality, but also with regard to visibility and traffic safety. To
minimize dust nuisance, certain good site practices will be employed as follows:
*  roads will be kept damp through use of water bowsers;
*  stockpiles of friable materials will be sited and maintained appropriately (including the
use of sheets) so as to minimize dust blow (such as balancing of cut and fill
operations);
*  drop heights for material transfer activities such as unloading of friable materials shall
be minimized;

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
*  the construction phase will begin with the construction of access roads;
*  roads created during construction will be compacted and graveled if necessary,
*  roads used on site will be maintained in good order;
*  access into the site will be regulated;
*  vehicle speed limits of less than 35 km/hr on unmetalled roads will be enforced on
site; and
^  lorries and vehicles will be sheeted during transportation of friable construction
materials and spoil.
In addition, to ensure that pollutant levels resulting from transport operations are kept to a
minimum during construction activities, all vehicles being used on site will meet pollutant
emission standards.
7.2.2 Aquatic Environment during Construction
Construction impacts on the aquatic environment are likely to arise as a result of:
*  dredging;
* construction of the intake facilities;
* surface water runoff; and
* pipeline construction across the Nile river bank.
As discussed in Section 6.3, these activities are likely to result in impacts to water quality and
aquatic ecology.
Given the mitigation and management measures described below, impacts will be minimized
and are not expected to be significant.
For construction activities in the Nile river:
* dredged areas will be limited to the minimum area required for construction purposes;
and
*  dredged sediments will be disposed of at a site agreed between the NREA's developers
and the relevant local authorities prior to the commencement of construction activities.
For construction activities on site:
* no effluents will be discharged into the water body during normal construction
activities, unless effluents quality has been checked and meets the Egyptian
environmental Law 4 requirements as well as the requirements of Law 48 /1982;

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
* a site drainage plan will be developed to ensure that if any erosion occurs during storm
events, minimal amounts of sediment will result by reducing the flow velocity and
sediment load before discharge;
* temporary stockpiles of soil should be protected from erosion by using a reduced slope
angle where practical. This can be addressed by a site drainage plan as described
above; and
* good site management practices will be enforced to ensure that the construction site is
kept clean and tidy.
In addition, to ensure access to the Nile river bank is not restricted for public use (as decreed
by Egyptian Law) and navigation activities are not jeopardized, the following measures will
be implemented:
* the bank across which the intake pipes are constructed will be returned to its original
state following construction; and
* warning signs will mark the intake structures.
All construction teams employed and contracts commissioned will incorporate these
mitigation measures as part of Operational Procedure in contracts and briefs (see the EAP
Section 8).
7.23 Noise Emissions during Construction
Specific noise mitigation measures for the construction phase reflect standard good site
management practices and include:
* enforcement of vehicle speed limits, strict controls of vehicle routing and prohibition
of heavy vehicle movements during night;
* diesel engine vehicles and compression equipment will be equipped with effective
silencers;
* activities with highest noise emissions (e.g. piling) will be undertaken only during the
day shift (0700 hours - 1800 hours) and between Saturday and Thursday and not
during official holidays; and
* personnel will use hearing protection when using or working in the vicinity of noisy
equipment.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
7.2.4 Flora and Fauna during Construction
Negative impacts on flora and fauna during power plant construction were described in
Section 6.5.2 and are not considered to be significant. However, species on or close to the
site may be disturbed and displaced as a result of increased noise, dust and human
activity. Good site management practices as discussed elsewhere in this section, and
implementation of the following mitigation measures, will ensure that any disturbance is
reduced to a minimum:
*  run-off from construction activities will be attenuated to ensure that surrounding
species/habitats are not significantly affected;
*  sediments removed during construction across the Nile river bank and river bed which
may be contaminated, will be disposed of in a controlled manner, as described in
Section 6.3; and
*  personnel and vehicles will be restricted to within the boundaries of the construction
site, lay down areas and access roads, and will not be permitted to enter surrounding
land.
7.2.5  Soils and Hydrology during Construction
The potential for direct impacts on soil and groundwater during construction, is largely
dependent on the management of the construction site and construction activities. A range of
mitigation measures will be implemented to protect soils (and, as a result, any of the
groundwater resources) from the direct impacts of constructing the proposed power plant.
These measures include the following:
*  engineered site drainage systems will be provided to collect, balance, treat as required
and control the discharge of site run-off;
* vehicles and personnel will be restricted from accessing areas not designated for
construction to prevent accidental or unnecessary disturbance or compaction of the
soil; and
* spoil from construction activities will be monitored and controlled; waste materials
which are unsuitable for reuse on-site, for example for landscaping, will be disposed of
at an appropriately licensed sanitary landfill site.
In addition, the potential for any transfer of existing contamination will be minimized through
the following mitigation measures:

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
* protection of the soil from accidental pollution by bordering around proposed storage
areas for fuel and chemicals with the capability to store at least 110% of the volume of
the storage facilities;
* provision of oil and interceptors, such as oil/ water separators for the removal of
pollutant loading from the site drainage and for the retention and containment of
any accidental discharges during construction and operation;
* removal of waste materials unsuitable for re-use on site during construction to
appropriate licensed landfill sites;
* management of excavations during construction so as to avoid the generation of
drainage pathways to underlying aquifers; and
* provision of impermeable bases in operational areas to prevent absorption of any
spillage of process materials.
7.2.6  Traffic and Transport during Construction
Construction activities will generate additional traffic on local roads and in particular,
significant volumes of heavy plant traffic and occasional abnormal loads. To minimize
any inconvenience, hazards and damage caused to other road users, local people and the
local road network, the following mitigation and management measures shall be
implemented:
* abnormal load movements will be confirmed with the Competent Administrative
Authority (CAA) and will adhere to prescribed routes. Their movement will be
scheduled to avoid peak hours and notices will be published in advance to minimize
disruption if required by the CAA;
* consideration will be given to staggering construction shifts to split arrival and
departure times;
* scheduling of traffic will be undertaken to avoid the peak hours on the local road
network wherever practicable; and
* construction workers will be transported to the site by contract bus.
7.2.7  Socio-economic Effects During Construction
The assessment of impacts showed an overall positive impact on the local society, culture and
economy. Given that the use of local labor will be prioritized during construction, no
mitigation measures are proposed.

7.2.8 Archaeology During Construction
Whilst careful examination of existing literature and data did not reveal any sites of
archaeological or cultural heritage importance on or around the site, the existence of
archaeological remains cannot be ruled out. Remains could be unearthed and damaged during
construction of the power plant and ancillary buildings, pipelines, cables and the intake and
discharge facilities.
Construction works will therefore be monitored to ensure that in the event of remains
being found construction activities will be stopped and the Supreme Council -Of
Antiquities will be consulted on the most appropriate measures, which could include
the following:
* where possible, remains will be protected in-situ from construction activities, by
relocating non-essential activities;
* where identified remains cannot be protected, an excavation of the indicated area will
be undertaken prior to the commencement of construction activities to record and
remove vulnerable remains and features;
* any finds of archaeological, historic or cultural significance will be given to the
appropriate CAA; and
* preparation of a Chance Finds Procedure which lays out the steps to be taken if
archaeological, historical or cultural remains or finds are discovered during
construction activities. The procedures will clearly set out how the construction team
will be briefed so that they are aware of what to look out for and the actions which
must be taken should a potential find be uncovered.
7.2.9 Flooding During Construction
Section 5.11.2 identified that as the site lies on the western edge of the eastern desert, there is
a potential for the power plant site to be affected by occasional flash flooding. In order to
reduce any potential impacts of flooding during construction, the following measures will be
implemented:
* during the early stages of construction, a site drainage system will be built, equipped to
protect the site against potential flooding;
* site drainage will be constructed in such a way as to dissipate flood waters away from
the main plant areas and to discharge clean waters to a natural drainage basin or a
ground well and any potentially contaminated waters to the surrounding land and any
potentially contaminated waters to the discharge facility via the oil interceptor;

* desert lands to the east of the site will be re-inforced to ensure that erosion does not
take place; and
*  the access road will be culverted to allow adequate transit of flood waters.
7.2.10 Solid Wastes During Construction
To ensure that impacts from solid waste generation and disposal are successfully avoided, the
following mitigation measures will be undertaken during plant construction:
*  all waste taken off site will be carried out by a licensed waste contractor and NREA
will audit the disposal procedure;
*  all solid waste will be segregated into different waste types, collected and stored on
site in designated storage facilities and areas prior to release to off-site disposal
facilities;
*  all relevant consignments of waste for disposal, will be recorded, indicating their
type, destination and other relevant information, prior to being taken off site;
and
*  standards for storage area, management systems and disposal facilities will be agreed
with the relevant parties.
An engineer with responsibility for environmental aspects will be responsible for solid waste
management at the site and will ensure that all wastes are managed to minimize any

7.2.11 Occupational Health and Safety During Construction
NREA will ensure that construction activities are undertaken in a manner which does not
present hazards to workers' health and safety. In particular, the NREA will establish and
integrate policies and procedures on occupational health and safety into the construction and
operation of the power plant. Emergency and accident response procedures will also be
included in an EHS manual for the power plant.
The following measures will be carried out in both the construction and operational phases:
* compliance with international standards for good practice;
*  adherence to local and international guidance and codes of practice on EHS
management;

7.3   MITIGATION MEASURES DURING OPERATION
7.3.1  Introducdon
Mitigation measures introduced into the design and construction phase of the power
plant will be carried forward into the operational phase by the NREA. Many mitigation
measures, as described in Sections 4 and 6 of this report, have already been integrated
into the design of the power plant in order to minimize any operational impacts on the
environment. Mitigation measures such as low NOx combustors, noise silencers and
water discharge controls are for example considered integral to the design of the power
plant.
The following section builds on the design criteria for the power plant in order to reduce to a
minimal level any further potential negative impacts. Areas where positive impacts can be
introduced or maximized are also considered.

EWNIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
7.3.2 Air Quality During
Operation
Emissions Guidelines
Several specific measures have been taken to reduce stack emissions from the power
plant and to comply with Egyptian and World Bank standards. The power plant will
fire natural gas as its main fuel which is the least polluting fuel available, (with
negligible sulfur dioxide emissions and low particulate matter emissions).
In order to reduce NOx emissions when firing natural gas, low NOx combustors are
used on the gas turbines. In addition, a stack measuring 35m high has been designed
to allow maximum dispersion of emissions into the surrounding atmosphere.
Stack emissions to the air from the proposed plant are therefore within the Egyptian,
as well as the World Bank guidelines' . However, the IFC has indicated that its
emission guidelines must be met for at least 95% of operating time. Given that
NREA is committed to burning natural gas only, the plant will operate well within
the s02 emission guidelines, and no further mitigation is proposed.
Air Qunliy Guidelines
To investigate the issue of atmospheric emissions from the power plant and their
impact on ambient air quality, dispersion. modeling has been undertaken and the
results of the modeling were presented earlier in Section 6.2. The modeling indicates
that the predicted off site maximum annual and 24 hour mean ground levels of N02
and PM concentrations, do not exceed the Egyptian as well as the World Bank
ambient air quality guidelines when natural gas is burned. As described above,
NREA is committed to using natural gas for more than 100% of operating time in a
year.
No further requirement for mitigation of the emissions to air from the power plant is
proposed.
7.3.3 Aquatic Environment During Operation
The main impacts of the power plant on the aquatic environment during power plant
operation are likely to derive from:
discharge from cooling towers and discharge of process water into the
ambient environment;

* disruption of navigational transport due to intake structures and water
abstraction from the Nile.
* entrainment of fish and mobile organisms of the Nile water in the intake
structure
The design of the intake structures has incorporated measures to reduce impacts on the
Nile environrnent. Other measures include:
* wastewaters including drainage from treatment plant HRSG blow down, HRSG
area equipment drainage, cooling towers blow down and sample cooler will be
treated first in a conmmon effluent tank for treatment before off-site disposal
through discharge, by means of 2x 100/o effluent disposal pumps, to a natural
drainage basin/wadi or a ground well;
* effluent treatment plant will receive wastes from combustion turbine area floor
drain, ST lube oil centrifuge, tank farm area, ST area floor washing and
transformer area drain and process them into an oil/water separator where waste
waters are channeled to the commnon effluent tank for treatment before discharge
to a natural drainage basin/wadi or a ground well;
* GTG wash water will be collected in an individual surnp and discharged with a
portable pump to a tanker for off-site disposal via a licensed contractor,
* Waters contaminated by chemical wastes will be channeled from neutralization
pit and combustion turbine compressor wash effluent to the common effluent
tank for treatment before off-site disposal;
* Sanitary wastes will be collected via plant sewage and sewerage lines in a local
sanitary treatment plant where the treated waters will be re-used in the plant
plantation irrigation program while the dirt will be collected for off-site disposal
by sanitary road tankers of a licensed contractor;
* Solar field will be provided with an emergency strategy for immediate response to
any accidental spillages, operational leakages or droplets of thermal oil to allow
collection and control as required;
* Water spillage from mirror washing and cleaning will be monitored and
controlled;
*  bunds or sumps will be installed on-site to isolate areas of potential oil or other
spillages, such as transformer bays, from the site drainage systemn;
*   oil and chemical storage tanks will have secondary containment structures that
will hold 110%/o of the contents of the largest storage tank;

* areas for unloading oil and hazardous chemical materials will be isolated by kerbs and
provided with a sump; equipped with a manually operated valve;
*  transformers will be provided with pits to retain 110% of the coolant capacity of
the transformers which will include fire Fighting water. Alternatively, each main
oil-filled transformer foundation will drain ihrough a corner sump directly to an
underground oil collection chamber sized to retain 110% of the coolant capacity of
the transformers plus deluge water (for the worst single catastrophic failure).
Adjacent to this collection chamber will be constructed an oil separator which will
normally function to separate any oil contaminated to the storm water collected
from within the transformer foundations and the clean water drained to the
discharge structure. The transformers will not contain PCBs; and
*  stormwater runoff from equipment slabs that may be subject to oil contamination
exposure, will be collected and channeled through an oil/water separator prior to
discharge into the discharge structure.
In order to minimize potential impacts to water qualitv, NREA will ensure implementation of
good site management practices including the following measures:
* wastewater will be collected and treated before being discharged into the discharge
system, the main water treatment steps include:
- neutralization of any wastewater that has a pH outside the range of 6 to 9;
- oil separation of any wastewater that may be contaminated with oil or grease; and
- filtration of any wastewater that may contain high concentrations of suspended
solids.
* no solid wastes will be discharged into the drainage basin/wadi or the ground well;
* drainage systems have been designed on site to prevent any contaminated surface run-
off from being discharged into the discharge system without prior oil separation and
neutralization of any other contamination; and
* all effluent discharges will comply with local Egyptian and World Bank standards.
7.3.4  Noise Emissions During Operation
A number of noise mitigation measures have been built into the design of the plant in order to
ensure that noise levels are minimized and that all items of plant are operating to local and
international standards.
Specific design mitigation measures include:
* gas and steam turbine generators, air compressors, pumps, and the emergency diesel
engines are enclosed in sound enclosure;

* air compressors are equipped with air silencers; and
* noisy outdoor equipment have been designed to a noise limit of 85 dB(A) at one meter.
In addition, all personnel working in noisy areas will be required to wear hearing protection.
7.3.5 Flora and Fauna during Operation
The potential impacts of the proposed development on any existing flora and fauna will be
minimized as a result of the following mitigation measures:
* noise will be controlled during operation, and will dissipate rapidly with distance from
source. Any disturbance during construction and operation will therefore be localized
(see Section 6.4); and
*  personnel and vehicles will be restricted to within the boundaries of the site and access
roads, and will not be permitted to enter surrounding land.
7.3.6  Visual Impact during Operation
Landscaping will include tropical shrubs (trees, grass, palm groves) around the site. All plants
will be indigenous species.
7.3.7 Soils and Hydrology during Operation
During plant operation, the main potential for impacts to occur to soils and hydrology
(including run-off into the surrounding lands), are likely to arise as a result of spillages and
storage of chemicals and fuels on site. Good site management practices such as those
described under Section 7.3.3 "Aquatic Environment" will minimize potential impacts.
7.3.8 Solid Waste Impacts During Operation
The mitigation and management measures during construclion described in Section 7.2.10
above relate to both the construction and operation phases.
7.3.9 Health and Safety During Operation
The following mitigation and management measures will ensure that the health and safety of
staff and any visitors on and to the site is not jeopardized during operation of the plant:

will be complying with drinking water standards published by the World Health
Organization
In addition, the operational health and safety measures during construction described in
Section 7.2.11 above, will be carried forward into the operational phase of the power
plant.
7.4   COMPENSATION FOR AFFECTED PARTIES
No indigenous populations or legally entitled landowners will be affected by the development
of the power plant, therefore no affected parties require compensation. Day to day practice
normally confirms fair compensations that should be paid to people who are likely to be
affected by of site associated infrastructure including cooling water intake and discharge
pipelines as well as overhead transmission lines going out from the power plant and
connecting it to the national unified power system.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
8.     ENVIRONMENTAL          MITIGATION,        MANAGEMENT          AND
MONITORING PLAN:
ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION PLAN (EAP)
8.1 OBJECTIVES OF THE PLAN
The NREA is committed to implementing an environmental management and monitoring plan
which will ensure that the construction and the operation of the ISCC Kuraymat power plant
(ISCC-KPP) involves full implementation of all proposed mitigation measures and complies with
high environmental standards, the requirements of the environmental legislation and guidance
notes as applicable in Egypt, and the procedures and guidelines of the World Bank/ IFC.
Previous sections of this report have outlined the baseline environmental and socio-economic
conditions in the area of the proposed development, have identified the potential impacts on these
baseline conditions which could result from both construction and operational activities and have
proposed measures to minimize and mitigate against any negative impact identified. To complete
the environmental evaluation, this section presents an Environmental Action Plan (EAP) which
summarizes the mitigation measures suggested and discusses initial and ongoing monitoring and
management of significant impacts of the proposed plant.
The EAP covering construction and operation of the power plant is summarized in Tables 8.2
and 8.3 respectively. For further detail on the mitigation measures to be undertaken, reference
should be made to Section 7 of this report. Details of pre-construction/operations monitoring and
management activities summarized in the tables are discussed in more detail below.
The EAP includes the definition of the following measures to minimize environmental effects:
* construction management, including control of construction traffic, site drainage,
construction waste and spoil etc.;
* engineering design measures directly incorporated into the power plant as good design
practice, through the selection of appropriate plant and equipment and choice of
construction materials;
* specific mitigation measures designed to prevent or minimize releases from the process,
such as the use of low NOx Combustors, closed loop cooling system;
* operational control systems, such as the use of water treatment chemicals; and
* operational management, which includes staffing levels and staff training.
The effectiveness of these environmental management and mitigation measures will be
monitored throughout the construction and operation of the power plant.
Monitoring will be carried out by NREA using standard techniques and equipment agreed with
the Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency (EEAA), which will be calibrated, operated and
maintained in accordance with the manufacturers specifications.

8.4 BASELINE MONITORING OF THE PRE-CONSTRUCTION NVIRONMENT
8.4.1 Baseline Air Quality Survey Using Air Quality Monitoring System
Objectives
Monitoring of air quality parameters such as NO2 and SO2 offers an appropriate method of
obtaining hourly, daily, monthly and annual mean pollutant concentrations over a wide spatial
area. A continuous monitoring program continued over an extended period, enables measured I
hr, 24 hr and annual mean pollutant concentrations to be compared with relevant Egyptian and
World Bank guidelines as well as regulations of involved lending agencies. It provides a baseline
against which to evaluate short-term impacts measured using continuous NO2, SO2, CO and TSP
analyzers.
The main objective of the proposed air quality monitoring program is to determine the effect of
effluent emissions from the Kuraymat Station. Prior to the commencement of a monitoring
program, the number and location of monitors that are required to provide adequate aerial
coverage need to be determined. Consideration should be given to the effects of existing sources,
nearby terrain, meteorological conditions, and the pollutant to be monitored as well as their
associated averaging times.
Natural gas will be used as the primary fuel. And for the siting study, the normal gas-fired
scenario was analyzed.
Methodology
Based on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency guidance (EPA, 1987), air dispersion
modeling should first be performed to determine the general locations(s) of maximum air
pollutant concentrations from the proposed source.
To determine the magnitude and locations of maximum background air quality impacts, the EPA-
approved Industrial Source Complex (ISC-Prime) atmospheric dispersion model was used for the
study. The ISC-Prime mode was also used for a stack height determination analysis conducted
for the Kuraymat Project (see Section 6.2).
In addition, as indicated in Section 5.4, there were five existing background air quality monitors
located within the Kuraymat plant area. These five monitors have collected sufficient ambient
records to form a good base of representative background data (National Research Center, 2004).
In general, air quality monitors should be placed at (a) the expected area of the maximum
concentration from the new source, and (b) the maximum combined impact area (s).
Generally, two to three sites would be sufficient for most situations in multi-source areas. In
areas where there are no significant existing sources, one or two sites would be sufficient.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
For convenience, the maximum impact locations derived in Section 6.2 are presented by the
polar coordinate and the conventional x-y coordinate. Both coordinates use the same origin as
shown in Figure 8-1.
Only I -hour and 24-hour maximum impact areas were considered in the design of the monitoring
network.
The majority of the 24-hour maximum combined impact areas due to the operation of both
Kuraymat power plants (existing thermal power plant including its proposed extension and the
proposed ISCC-KPP) occurred at SWW direction to the plant at distances between 2400 m and
2500 m. The highest impact area is at SWW direction about 2450 m from the origin of the
modeling grid network (i.e. the power house of the proposed ISCC-KPP).
Therefore, a monitoring station is required at this high combined impact area in order to collect
the maximum 24-hour impact. The maximum 1-hour impact levels are very similar among the
same years of meteorological data considered. The majority of the maximum impact areas
occurred far from the site boundary to the south west of the plant at a distance of about 2580 m
from the origin of the modeling grid network. The results further indicated that the maximum
combined impact area for each of the five years considered all occurred at the same location.
Subsequently, another monitoring station is required at this area to collect the hourly maximum
impact. The suggested monitoring locations are presented in Figure 8-1. Areas, instead of the
precise points, are suggested because in some cases, it is simply not practical to place monitors at
the indicated modeled locations. However, it is recommended that an air quality monitoring
system composed of 2 monitoring stations will be utilized. The monitoring station equipped with
meteorological monitoring system will be located within the designated site, the other station will
be located on the other designated area.
These monitoring stations and the corresponding monitoring program will be the responsibility of
the existing Kuraymat thermal power plant and their company, i.e. the UEEPC. provided that the
power plant is already operating an ambient air qualitv monitoring system composed of three
monitoring shelters, fully equipped to monitor NO, SO, and PM-o short-term and long-term
concentrations on a continuous basis. One of the analyzer stations includes a continuous monitor
of meteorological conditions (temperature, wind speed, wind direction, 60 and mixing hei_ahts).
However, NREA/ISCC-KPP may undertake ambient air qualitv measurements using third partv
(e.g. Ain Shams University or the Air Pollution Preclusion Unit of the National Research Center)
in the area predicted to have the highest impacts resulting from the only ISCC-KPP (on the SE
direction to the power house at a distance between 430 m and 520 m), for once a year during the
first 3-years of normal operation.
Also, NREA will initiate baseline air quality survey before, and during, construction of the plant
in cooperation and coordination with existing KPP and the UEEPC using their existing
operational monitoring svstem.
Reporting
Reports will be prepared by NREA/ISCC-KPP on an annually basis, and be prepared as
monitoring concentration summaries.

8.4.2 Aquatic Environment
A field survey was undertaken by Hydraulics Research Institute representatives and by National
Research Center staff of the Kuraymat Nile segment area at the power station site. The results of
this survey shall be retained as a baseline comparison for Nile River monitoring during power
plant operation. This will be done in cooperation and coordination with existing KPP and
UEEPC.
In addition, site management practices and site drainage systems will be continuously monitored
by the site Assistant Plant Manager to ensure that no pollutants reach the aquatic resources.
8.4.3 Archaeology and Cultural Heritage
Throughout construction, activities will be closely supervised by personnel trained to recognize
potential archaeological finds. Should a potential find be uncovered, the mitigation measures
described in Section 7.2.8 will be employed.
8.5 MONITORING OF IMPACTS DURING POWER PLANT OPERATION 8.5.1
Stack Emissions
Stack emissions will be monitored continuously during plant operation at a representative point
in the stack. Operational monitoring of stack emissions shall comprise monitoring the levels of:
* Oxides of Nitrogen;
* Sulfur Dioxide; and
* Carbon Monoxide.
The automatic monitoring system used will be linked to an alarm to wam when emission limits
(as stated in Section 2) for each pollutant are being approached.
Concentrations will be recorded as hourly rolling averages and reports on stack emissions
monitoring will compare recorded emissions against predicted levels and Egyptian and IFC
guidelines (as given in Section 2). Reports will be submitted to the EEAA, the WBY and any other
concerned authority on an annual basis (or as required).
8.5.2 Ambient Air Quality - Validation of Modeling Predictions Using Continuous NOx,
S02 and TSP/PM10 Analyzer
Objectives
The use of a continuous NOx, S02, CO and TSP/PM1o analyzer allows for baseline air quality
monitoring on a continuous basis. The provision of two continuous monitors will provide the
basis for "validating" the predictions made in the EIA. The monitors will also include a weather
station providing data on air temperature, wind speed, wind direction and mixing heights on a
continuous basis. This will be the responsibility of the existing KPP and UEEPC as stated
before.

8.5.3 Aquatic Environment
Monitoring of impacts of the power plant on the aquatic environment will include monitoring of
the quality of the discharge water, Nile bank and benthic sediments, ambient water quality and
the impact on aquatic flora and fauna. The survey techniques and areas will be comparable to the
survey undertaken by both of the Hydraulics Research Institute and the National Research Center
during 2003 and 2004. The survey will include the area affected by the intake process and
structures.
The operational monitoring of cooling towers and effluent discharge will include the parameters
summarized in Table 8-4 below.
Monitoring data will be analyzed and reviewed at regular intervals and compared with Egyptian
and World Bank guidelines (as given in Section 2). Records of monitoring results will be kept in
a suitable format and will be reported (in summary format with any exceptions identified) to the
responsible govemment authorities and the WB or any other concemed authority as required. As
a result, the NREA, in discussion with the EEAA and the WB or any other concemed authority,
will review the need to implement any additional mitigation features, such as provision of further
water treatment facilities on site and also on the need to continue monitoring.
8.5.4 Waste Monitoring
Wastes generated on site and collected for disposal by skilled firms will be referenced, weighed
and recorded. Environmental audits will be undertaken which will assess the quality and
suitability of on- and off-site waste management procedures.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
9.    CONSULTATION AND DISCLOSURE
9.1 INTRODUCTION AND GENERAL APPROACH
In order to ensure that the views and interests of all project stakeholders are taken into
accounts, a Public Consultation and Disclosure Plan (PCDP) was prepared in accordance with
IFC requirements as part of the Environmental Impact Assessment process. This also included
Public Consultation that has been carried out according to the EEAA guidelines which require
coordination with other government agencies involved in the EIA, obtaining views of local
people and affected groups. This consultation has been also undertaken as part of the
Environmental Impact Assessment process.
This section summarizes the activities which were undertaken as part of phase I consulation.
It, also, summarizes Phase II consultation, namely the Disclosure of the draft final EIA
Report, which comprises the activities that will be undertaken as a complementary procedure.
It, also, highlights the activities which may be undertaken, under this condition, during the
construction and operation of the Kuraymat ISCC power plant.
9.1.1 Public Consultation Regulations and Requirements
In accordance with World Bank/ IFC requirements, namely the Bank's Operational Directive
(OD) 4.01 Environmental Assessment and other key documents, affected groups and NGOs
must be consulted as part of the environmental assessment of projects. The primary purpose of
this provision is to protect the interests of affected communities. Therefore, the ETA process
should include consultation and disclosure of infornation to key stakeholders involved in
and/or affected by the Kuraymat ISCC power plant project.
The objectives of consultation and disclosure are to ensure that all stakeholders and interested
parties, are fully informed of the proposed project, have the opportunity to voice their
concerns and that any issues resulting from this process are addressed in the ETA and
incorporated into the design and implementation of the project.
Egyptian Law number 4 of 1994, which addresses the environment, does not stipulate or refer
directly to public consultation within the ELA process. However, its importance may be
inferred from the inclusion of representatives of environmental non-governmental
organizations on the Board of Directors of the EEAA. Furthermore, the EEAA's "Guidelines
for the Basis and Procedures of Environmental Impact Assessment (EEA) - Sector
Guidelines" suggest discussions with local stakeholders and interested parties during scoping
and preparation of the EIA.

notices locally.
9.3   PHASE 1 CONSULTATION
9.3.1 Undertaken Consultation
During the preparation of an EIA-Report for local permitting requirements, consultations were
undertaken with a variety of organizations to assist them in the identification of environmental
and social concerns and the overall development of the project. These stakeholders included
the Egyptian Electricity Holding Company (EEHC), Upper Egypt Electricity Production
Company (UEEPC), Existing KPP, Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency (EEAA), the
Giza Govemorate and the District Council of Atfieh (Kuraymat zone), the Supreme Council
of Antiquities, Egyptian General Authority for Shore Protection, Hydraulics Research Institute
and local population leaders.
The different steps of this process comprised the following:
*  Several mini-meetings were undertaken with the mini-groups contacted during project
preparation and completion of environmental documentation for preparing the EIA
study-Report.
* An extensive description of the project was presented to individuals of each group at
the beginning of each meeting. This presentation included positive and negative
aspects of the project, neutrally introduced with no bias.
* Several visits have been conducted to concerned groups in their premises or locations.
The majority of these visits, particularly to the governmental agencies and research
institutions, were prepared for in advance, and rest of visits were undertaken without
advance dating or preparation, such as those undertaken to local population and farm
owners.
* Research groups were contacted and accompanied with during site reconnaissance,
where extensive discussions and deliberations were made.
The purpose of these consultations was primarily to provide infonnation regarding the project,
identify published and non-published sources of relevant data and information relating to the
site and surrounding area, obtain views on the scope of the project, and open channels for
ongoing discussions.
The key environmental issues raised during this consultation process are summarized in
Table 9-2 and these issues were subsequently taken into account in the preparation of ETA
documentation both for local permitting requirements and this EIA report.
The environmental documentation for local permitting purposes, will be presented to the Giza
Govemorate (the Competent Administrative Authority (CAA) and the EEAA.

9.3.2 Consultation during the EIA process
A Scoping Consultation for this EIA undertaken by E&E and NREA, took place during the
period September 2003 - May 2004, during which mini-meetings were held with government
and municipal agencies, research institutions and commercial entities. The key objectives of
this consultation were to identify primary and secondary stakeholders, ensure that they had
received sufficient information about the project during earlier E&E and NREA Consultation
activities and to identify their immediate concerns. The issues raised during the scoping
consultation are summarized in Table 9-3 below.

Key Issues Raised During EIA Scoping
Key issue discussed                           Comments
Overall Project    All parties consulted expressed their overall approval for the project.
Local Stakeholders commented that the power plant will be central to
securing power supply for the industrial and commercial activities in the
area, provided that many industrial activities will be established due to
designating Kuraymat as an industrial investment zone, and will benefit the
local economy through labor opportunities.
Social and Economic  Local stakeholders and council leaders considered the social and economnic
Impact             impact of the plant to be wholly positive.
They also very much appreciated compensation rules for loss of land if any
agricultural activities need to be stopped for the sake of the project
infrastructure.
They considered that the existence of solar field with reflective mirrors will
create an attractive area for tourism within the Kuraymat area.
Wastewater         All local stakeholders expressed concem about the quality of discharge
Discharge and the  water from the power plant to a drainage basin/wadi or well. It was
Aquatic            however acknowledged that there are no significant aquatic ecosystems in
Environment        the immediate vicinity around the power plant. The suggestion was made
that treated wastewater could be used for irrigation of landscaped areas.
Air Quality        There was concem over compliance with air quality standards and the
effect that non-compliance and subsequent plant closure could have on
security of employment in the area.
There, also, was concem about the potential damage to vegetation in the
immediate south of the power plant resulting from emissions of pollutants
from power plant operation.
Environmental      An underlying concern expressed by all local stakeholders was compliance
Compliance         with environmental regulations. Assurances from NREA are sought to the
effect that NREA will guarantee implementation of the environmental
compliance measures which are stated in the Environmental Action Plan.
Other Discharges   There was concern over other discharges of the power plant, particularly
water vapour dissipated from cooling towers into the atmosphere and the
potential impact of ground fogging on transportation along the Cairo/Beni-
sueif road.

New & Renewable Energy Authority (NREA)         150 MWe Kuraymat Integrated Solar C.C. Project
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
9.3.3 Conclusions from Phase I Consultation
The main results of Phase I consultation were to successfully raise the level of local awareness
about the plant, to identify the immediate local concerns and to seek stakeholder involvement
in the implementation of the project.
The three issues of key concern to the stakeholders consulted were the impact of the plant on
pollutant loads in the Kuraymat zone, compliance with environmental standards particularly
with regard to air and wastewater discharge quality and the potential economic impacts on the
local community. These concerns have been addressed within the EIA process and measures
to ensure compliance are incorporated into the Environmental Action Plan (EAP). The EAP
will be implemented by NREAIISCC-KPP as a condition of compliance with the EEAA
regulations and of financing from the WB.
9.4   PHASE II CONSULTATION AND DISCLOSURE
Phase II of the public consultation and disclosure process includes the disclosure of
information about the project (leaflet, advertisement, invitation including a copy of the Non
Technical Summary and public access to the Draft Final EIA Report) and organization of a
public meeting.
The leaflet, describing the project, technical features, possible benefits, common concerns and
other related information, will be sent to all stakeholders identified for this project together
with invitations to the Public Meeting. The leaflets will also be made available for collection
in the Govemorate's Environmental Management Unit and to all people who come to review
the Draft Final EIA report.
The Draft Final EIA report, together with the Non-Technical Summary in Arabic, will be
disclosed locally for 60 days at the offices of the NREA's Environmental Affairs department.
In order to make people aware of the disclosure of the Draft Final EIA Report, an
advertisement will be placed in the national newspaper Al Ahram in Arabic and English. The
advertisement will also draw readers attention to the date and venue of the proposed public
meeting.
Finally, a public meeting will be held in the Governorate of Giza. The aim of the meeting will
be to present and explain the results of the Draft Final EIA Report to local stakeholders, to
provide them with the opportunity to raise any further or additional concerns and to ensure
that all issues are taken into account in the Final ELA Report and corresponding EAP.
The results of this Phase II Consultation and Disclosure activities will be reported separately
and annexed to the Final EIA Report.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
9.5 ONGOING FACILITY FOR PUBLIC CONSULTATION AND DISCLOSURE
The World Bank/lFC and other international and regional lending agents also require that the
consultation process is ongoing during the construction and operation phases of the project.
To this effect, NREA/ISCC-KPP has stated its commitment to maintaining long term and
mutually beneficial open dialogue with local authorities, industrial and commercial interests
and local people, through its Safety and Environment Officer during construction and
Assistant Plant Manager during operation. A key role of this post consultation will be to
ensure that local stakeholders have an opportunity to raise questions, comments or concerns
and that all issues raised are answered promptly and accurately.
Disclosure of information will also continue throughout project construction and operation.
The primary emphasis here will be to assure stakeholders that the environmental mitigation,
monitoring and management practices established in the EIA and its EAP are being
implemented and the environmental standards and guidelines dictated by the Egyptian
government and the World Bank/lFC are being met through a comprehensive monitoring and
reporting process. NREA/ISCC-KPP is required under Egyptian law, to maintain an
Environment Register of written records with respect to environmental impacts from the
power plant. In addition, an annual report containing technical data relating to the monitoring
program will be prepared by the NREA/ISCC-KPP and submitted to the EEAA, and the WB.

PRELIMINARY ARCHAEOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT FOR THE EL-KUREIMAT,
EGYPT FEASIBILITY STUDY
1.1 GENERAL
The project area for the proposed facilities is located near the village of El-Kureimat,
on the east bank of the Nile River The site locus is approximately 95 km south of
Cairo and 30 km north of Beni-Suef.
The project area consists of two principal facilities-the power plant and its colony
(Figure 1). Two physiographic zones occupy this area: a floodplain adjacent to the
Nile, and a rocky desert plateau east of the floodplain. The site of the power plant is
750 meters wide and has an average length of 1150 meters; in all the site
encompasses more than 860,000 square meters. The site of the community facilities,
or colonyv is located near the northeast corner of the power plant area; the colony
area will measure 670 x 670 meters, or approximately 450,000 square meters.
1.2 METHODOLOGY
The goals of the preliminary archaeological assessment are 1) to identify recorded
archaeological sites within the project area and its vicinity; and 2) to assess the
potential archaeological sensitivity of the project area.
Research for the project consisted of a review of the published literature to identifv
archaeological sites in the region. In addition, archaeologists who are familiar with
recent archaeological work in the area were consulted for information about
archaeological sites that may not appear in the literature. At present, recorded site
distributions suggest a relative paucity of sites on the east side of the Nile in
comparison to the west side; for this reason, the research concentrated on
identifving archaeological site distributions on the east side of the Nile.
An archaeological field reconnaissance of the project area was not conducted at this
stage of the project.
1.3 ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITE DISTRIBIUTIONS
Tne literature review identified recorded archaeological sites in the vicinitv of the
project area. The discussion is divided into three areas: 1) archaeological sites near
El-Kureimat; 2) archaeological sites on the east bank of the Nile; and 3)
archaeological sites on the west bank of the Nile.
1.3.1 Archaeological Sites Near El-Kureimat
Althouah there are hundreds of recorded archaeological sites on the west bank of
the Nile opposite El-Kureimat and in the Fayum region, the east bank of the Nile in
t



this region is one of the many areas in Egypt that has not been systematicallv
examined for archaeological remains. The east bank in Lower Egypt has a much
narrower floodplain than the west bank, so farming villages are more concentrated
on the west bank and in the irrigated lowlands of the Fayum. This would not
always have been the case, however, as the Nile has shifted its course eastward over
the past 4000 years. Therefore it is likely that prior to ca. 2000 B. C.-including the
Neolithic period, ca. 5000-4000 B. C.-earlv farming communities may have been
located along the low desert of the east bank, just as they are found in abundance in
the Fayum.
1.3.2 Archaeological Sites on the East Bank
South of Cairo, on the east bank, early farmring villages have been excavated at
Maadi and El-Omari, 3 km NE of Helwan (Debono 1948; Rizkana and Seeher 1989),
which were discovered as a result of urban development earlier in this century, and
it seems likely that similar sites may be found farther south. The settlements at
Maadi and El-Oman date to the fourth millennium B. C. (during the Predynastic
period). Prehistoric cemeteries were found in association with these settlements.
Archaeological evidence at Maadi suggests a center which had the earliest known
trading connections with southern Palestine, and Maadi may have been a very early
center of copper production (Hayes 1965). At Tura, 2 km south of Maadi, over 500
burials from the First Dynasty, at the dawn of pharaonic history, have also been
excavated (Junker 1912). About 28 km north of El-Kureimat, at El-Saff, a prehistoric
cemetery, which is also related to the Maadi culture, was excavated in 1935 (Habachi
and Kaiser 1985).
W-hile it is possible that there would be evidence of Neolithic sites on the east bank
in the vicinity of El-Kureimat, pharaonic period sites on this side of the river have
not been reported, with the exception of isolated small finds. At Atfih, about 6 km
north of El-Kureimat, a town is known from pharaonic times that probablv was the
location of a temple dedicated to the goddess Hathor (Baines and Malek 1988: 212).
During the Ptolemaic period (i.e., after the Greek conquest of Egypt bv Alexander the
Great, ca. 332-30 B. C.), Atfih was known as Aphroditopolis. Sir Flinders Petrie
reported a finely painted Ptolemaic tomb at Atfih, measuring 15 x 12 ft with a
'Vaulted roof (Petrie and MacKay 1915: 38). The pavement of this tomb was made of
limestone blocks taken from an earlier monument of Ramesses II. A second
Ptolemaic tomb at Atfih was reported by Bertha Porter and Rosalind Moss (1960: 76).
In this tomb were paintings from the "Book of the Dead" and an astronomical
ceiling. About 75 km south of El-Kureimat also on the east bank is another
Ptolemaic site (Ancvropolis) at El Hiba investigated by Robert Wenke in the earlv
139S0s (Robert Wenke, personal communication).
A few kilometers south of El-Kureimat is the beginning of a desert track to the Red
Sea which has been in use for at least 1500 years and probablv much longer. This
track leads to the Monastery of St. Anthony in the eastern Red Sea Hills. St.
Anthonv founded the monastic movement, and this monastery has been an



important center for the Coptic faith after Egypt accepted Christianity in the 4th
century A. D.
In summary, early farming sites (Neolithic and Predynastic) are recorded on the east
bank of the Nile south of Cairo, and there are also isolated finds dating to pharaonic
times. The remains of a Greco-Roman period town and cemetery are located just to
the north of El-Kureimat at Atfih (Porter and Moss 1960: 75-76).
1.3.3 Archaeological Sites on the West Bank
The Fayum region, south and east of Lake Moeris, and along the west bank of the
Nile in this region, is one of the richest archaeological areas in Egypt. Fossil remains
of the earliest known species of ape (Aegyptopithecus zeuxis, ca. 32,000,000 years old)
have been found in the Fayum (Tattersall, Delson, and Couvering 1988: 485), and
the earliest known farming communities in Egypt are located around the shorelines
of the lake (Caton-Thompson and Gardner 1934). An important Predynastic
cemetery was excavated at Gerza, about 5 km downstream from Atfih (Petrie,
WVainwright, and MacKay 1912). From this cemetery is derived the termn Gerzean,"
which refers to the middle Predynastic period (ca. 3600-3300 B. C.) when complex
society can first be attested in Egypt; this period was followed by the emergence of the
early Egyptian state and civilization. Another large Predynastic cemetery was also
excavated at Abusir el Meleq, SW of Gerza (Mollers and Scharff 1969). In 1911-1912
Petrie excavated a large cemetery dating to the First Dynasty at Tarkhan, northeast of
Gerza (Petrie 1914).
Mevdum is the site of the earliest true pyramid; it was built at the beginning of the
Fourth Dynasty (ca. 2575-2465 B. C.), but was never finished because it collapsed
during construction (Mendelssohn 1986: 88). Several important early Fourth
Dynasty tombs have been excavated at Mevdurn, from which come the painted
statues of Prince Rahotep and his wife Nofret, and the painting of "Geese from
Mevdum," now in the Cairo Museum (Smith 1986: 83, 88).
During the Middle Kingdom (ca. 2000-1785 B. C.) hundreds of acres of land in the
Favxum were reclaimed for irrigation (Butzer 1976: 36-37). The Middle Kingdom
capital was at a site known from texts as Herakleopolis (not discovered
archaeologically), and the royal pyramid tombs were built at Hawara, El Lahun, and
El Lisht. At El Lahun are the remains of a Middle Kingdom town built to house
construction workers and supervisors of the royal pyramids and their families
1 Pe:rie 1891). Numerous papyrus texts have been found in this town including a
census list, and literary, medical, and veterinary texts.
The town of Ihnasya is covered with ruins dating mainly to the New Kingdom
(ca.1551-1070 B. C.), and there are a number of important tombs from the Eighteenth
and Nineteenth Dynasties (Kees 1977: 218). During the Ramesside period (later New
K'nzdom) a large garrison was located there. Medinet Gurob, north of Ihnasya, was
the site of the roval harim in the New Kingdom, and a finely carved ebony head of
3



Queen Tiye, mother of Akhenaten and grandmother of Tutankhamen, comes from
there (now in the Berlin Museum). Tuthmosis III built at stone temple at Medinet
Gurob, but much of this town was disassembled during the reign of Ramesses 11 in
order to built his new capital in the eastern Nile Delta (Kees 1977: 227).
During the Ptolemaic period and the Roman occupation of Egypt, the Fayum was
once again a region of dense occupation, mainly due to its great agricultural
productivity, which declined after the third century A. D. Well-known mummy
portraits painted realistically on wooden panels have been found on burials of the
Roman period at Hawara (Petrie 1911). Large Greco-Roman towns in the Fayum
were located at Crocodilopolis (the modern El Fayum also known as Arsinoe, once
covering an area of 558 acres), Philadelphia, Narrnouthis, and Qasr Qarun (Kees
1977: 229). In a cemetery at Tebtunis, 15 km SE of El Fayum, papyrus texts were
found on mummified crocodiles, and many late papyrus texts dealing with religion
and medicine have been found within the temple precincts at Tebtunis (Baedeker
n.d.: 187).
1.4 SUTMMARY
Because of major geographical differences, the Fayumn and the west bank of the Nile
in the region of El-Kureimat have much more extensive archaeological evidence
than the east bank, where El-Kureimat is located. Lake Moeris provided water for
extensive irrigation projects in the Fayum, and to the east of this a very wide strip of
land is cultivable between the Bar Yusef canal and the Nile. In contrast, the east
bank has a very narrow floodplain with the limestone formation of the low desert
beginning less than 1 km east of the Nile in some places.
While the west bank has a rich and well-documented archaeological history, with
sites spanning all periods of Egyptian prehistory and history (and even
paleontological specimens dating back millions of years), the east bank is poorlv
represented in the archaeological record. Sites from the Neolithic and Greco-
Roman periods have been found on the east side in the vicinity of the project area,
although pharaonic sites seem to be only rarely reported there. An important track
leading to the Red Sea also begins a few kilometers south of the project area; this
track is at least 1500 years old. No sites have been reported within the El-Kureimat
project area.
1.- RECOMMiE\NDATIONS
Despite a wealth of archaeological sites in the region, our present understanding of
the distribution of sites in the vicinity of El-Kureimat indicates that the east bank of
the Nile, with its narrow strip of floodplain, was less intensively occupied than the
west bank. Archaeological sites have been found here, however, and the project
area is considered to have a moderate sensitivity for containing archaeological sites.
The limited information available suggests that sites of the Neolithic and post-
haronic periods are more likely to be found in the project area than pharaonic sites.
4



Although the preliminary assessment indicates a moderate archaeological
sensitivity for the project area, only a systematic archaeological survey can identify
whether or not sites exist there. In this region of Egypt, archaeological sites can
generally be detected on the basis of evidence on the ground surface. For this
reason, it is recommended that an archaeological field reconnaissance of the project
area be made to deternine if archaeological sites are present in the project area. The
field inspection should include the proposed site of both the power plant and the
colony.

EL KUREIMAT INTEGRATED SOLAR COMBINED CYCLE
COOLING SYSTEM ALTERVATIVES
1.   INTRODUCTION
PGESCo was directed to study different altematives for supplying cooling
water to the proposed Kureimat Integrated Solar Combined Cycle Power
Plant.
Contacts with the Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation led to providing
inforTnation about the water levels and discharges in the River at the existing
Kureimat Power Plant site in addition to carrying out preliminary geophysical
investigation on the ground water availability at the site of the solar plant.
This report presents the cooling systems options that were considered for the
projects; technical specifications; cost estimate for installation of each option;
cost estimate for the operation of each option; and the required studies for
each alternative.
The report aims at presenting and analyzing the different methods for cooling
the proposed Solar Power Plant in order to facilitate the process of selecting
which alternative to sponsor for detailed studies and engineering
2.   ALTERNATIVES FOR COOLING SYSTEM
Two main options are available in order to cool the Integrated Combined
Cycle Solar Power Plant, namely once through and closed cycle cooling
systems.
The Project comprises two gas turbines of about 40 MW each, two heat
recovery steam generator (HRSG), one steam turbine of about 70 MW, one
parabolic trough solar field capable to generate about 200 GWh/a (thermal) of
solar heat plus all associated balance of plant equipment.
The cooling options considered are once through cooling system and closed
cooling system with cooling tower.
The cooling requirements and main configuration for each case are listed as
follow:

-     Blow Down Flow Rate                   =0.01      m3/s
-    Make up and Blow Down from and to the River Nile
The following section presents the technical characteristics of each alternative
and its advantages and disadvantages.
2.1  Once Through Cooling System
The intake and discharge structures are constructed to the River Nile East
Shoreline. The position of the intake structure will be to the southern most
boundary of the Kureimat Power Plant.
The intake structure will be equipped with pumping station to lift water for
about 60 m to overcome head losses and elevation difference between
3



EL KUREIMAT INTEGRATED SOLAR COMBINED CYCLE
COOLING SYSTEM .4L TER ..4 TIVES
The pumping station will be equipped with an anti water hammer devise to
overcome any transient induced pressures, which might affect the safety
of the cooling system.
A pipeline will deliver water to the condenser from the pumping station.
Two options of the pipeline material were considered; namely G. R. P. and
Pre-stressed R. C. pipe.
2.1.a   Option I
The water will flow through 1.8m I.D. pressurized G. R. P. pipes from the
pumping station location and by the southem boundary of the Kureimat
Power Plant, then crosses the Road under a bridge. The pipeline will
extend northward toward the existing colony of the Kureimat Power Plant,
then toward the potential location of the condenser.
The length of the cooling water delivery pipeline is about 3500m,
depending on the exact location of the condenser.
The warm water will flow out of the condenser and guided to the discharge
structure through a discharge pipeline of 1.4m inner diameter G. R. P.
pipeline, which has a total length of 3300m depending on the exact
location of the condenser and the discharge structure.
The discharge structure will be downstream of the proposed combined
cycle project, i.e. downstream of the existing units discharge structure.
The attached drawing represents the layout of the proposed once through
cooling system.
In order to estimate the total require pump head; the head losses have to
be evaluated.
The head lost due to friction in the 3500m-delivery pipeline could be
evaluated from the following equation:
fLQ2
Hf =                                                     (1)2
2gDA2
In which:
Hf is the head lost due to pipe wall friction
f is the Darcy-Weissbach friction factor
L is the length of the pipeline
Q is the cooling water flow rate

COOLING S YS TEA JAL TERA7A TI 'ES
g is the gravitational acceleration
D is the l.D. of the pipeline
A is the cross sectional area of the pipeline
Based of a cooling water flow rate of 6.2m3/s and a pipeline length of
3.5km with an internal diameter of 1.8m, the head lost due to friction in this
reach will be 12.6m.
Secondary losses due to intake structure characteristics, elbows, and
fittings are estimated to be about 2.4m.
Head difference between the condenser and the intake water level in the
River Nile is about 45m.
The required pumping head is then 60m
The warm water, which is discharged from the condenser, has a head
difference of about 45m over the water level in the River.
In order to overcome the high difference in attitude between the condenser
discharge level and River water level, the pipe wall friction will be exploited
by contracting the inner diameter of the discharge pipe. The contraction
will increase the flow velocity and consequently the friction head lost.
The selected discharge pipe diameter is then 1.4m
The head lost in the discharge segment could be calculated from equation
(1).
The value of the head lost is then 35.6m. The secondary losses in the
discharge reach will be about 1.4m. The total head lost in the discharge
pipe reach is then 37m.
A water box will be installed in the pipe reach mid point in order to over
come the remaining 8m head difference and to maintain pressurized pipe
flow in the system.
The power consumed during the pumping procedure could be estimated
from equation (2)
PtOce_ Through -Cooling Sy-on  PgQH wul                   (2)
In which:
P is the consumed power
p is the water density

H is the total head lost
rl is the overall efficiency
D is the l.D. of the pipeline
A is the cross sectional area of the pipeline
From above, it becomes clear that the pumping pressure required for the
once through system will be approximately 4.9 MW.
2.1.b   Option II
The only different between this option and the previous one (Option I) is
that the pipeline material used to convey the cooling water is selected to
be Pre-Stressed pipes instead of the G.R.P., which was used in the
previous option.
2.1.c   Option Ill
In option Ill, the discharge is limited to 3.9m3/s. The water will flow through
1.4m I.D, G.R.P. pressurized pipes from the pumping station location
toward the potential location of the condenser.
The warm water will flow out of the condenser and guided to the discharge
structure through a discharge pipeline of 1.1m 1.D, G.R.P. pressurized
pipes.
In order to estimate the total require pump head; the head losses have to
be evaluated.
The head lost due to friction in the 3500m-delivery pipeline could be
evaluated from equation (1)
Based on a cooling water flow rate of 3.9m31s and a pipeline length of
3.5km with an internal diameter of 1.4m, the head lost due to friction in this
reach will be 12.6m.
Secondary losses due to intake structure characteristics, elbows, and
fittings are estimated to be about 2.4m.
Head difference between the condenser and the intake water level in the
River Nile is about 45m.
The required pumping head is then 60m
The warm water, which is discharged from the condenser, has a head
difference of about 45m over the water level in the River.

The selected discharge pipe diameter is then 1.1m
The head lost in the discharge segment could be also calculated from
equation (1).
The value of the head lost is then 37m. The secondary losses in the
discharge reach will be about 1.4m. The total head lost in the discharge
pipe reach is then 38.4m.
A water box will be installed in the pipe reach mid point in order to over
come the remaining 7m head difference and to maintain pressurized pipe
flow in the system
The power consumed during the pumping procedure could be estimated
from equation (2). The consumed power is then 2.3 MW.
2.1.d    Option IV
The only different between this option and the previous one (Option ll) is
that the pipeline material used to convey the cooling water is selected to
be Pre-Stressed pipes instead of the G.R.P., which was used in the
previous option.

2.2   Closed Cycle Cooling Tower System
The cooling tower is operated based on the dosed circuit cooling process.
The cooling water is pumped from the cooling basin to the condenser via a
pumping station. Warrn water is collected from the outlet of the condenser
and guided to the cooling tower were it is cooled down by means of an air
ventilator. After the cooling water excess temperature is transferred to the
ambient air, the water is dripping again to the basin of the cooling tower.
The cooling tower is filled with water once, and then a making up pump is
providing continuous flow to compensate for the water volume lost during
the ventilation process.
The make up water is coming from either a deep well if the ground water
reservoir will assure the sustainability of providing the required make up
water flow or from the River Nile. The blow down water will be discharged
back to the ground water reservoir or to a nearby drain.
2.2.a   Option V
The make up water will be pumped from a ground water reservoir and the
blow down water will be discharged to a well.
The design conditions of the cooling tower are as follow:

The power consumed in the operation of the cooling tower process is
calculated from the following equation:
p               pgQH condnse                            (3)
11
From equation 3, the power consumed in the circulating process is about
0.85MW.
The consumed power for make up and blow down will be about 0.1 MW,
as could be calculate in the same way as in equation (3).
The consumed power for fan motor operation will be 0.77MW.
The overall power consumption in the process of the cooling tower
operation will be 0.85 + 0.1+ 0.77 MW or 1.72 MW.
2.2.b   Option VI
The make up water will be pumped from the intake structure of the
combined cycle project and pumped through a G. R. P. pipeline to the
cooling tower.
The blow down water will be guided to a near by drain estimated to be
about 5km away from the cooling tower. Blow down water will flow
through a 100mm G. R. P. pipeline to the drain.
The consumed power for make up from the River Nile is about 0.034 MW,
as could be calculate in the same way as in equation (3).
The consumed power for blow down to the drain is about 0.00015 MW, as
could be calculate in the same way as in equation (3).
The overall consumed power on option 11 is then 1.65 MW.

4.    CONCLUSION
The design and cost analysis of the Cooling Tower-Option V was based on
the assumption that groundwater is available all year long at a level of 150m
below the condenser bottom level.
A detailed hydrological study is required to confirm the assumption.
From the demonstrated analysis it could be seen that the cooling tower-
Option V would have the least installation and running costs.
When adding the running cost to the installation cost the once through cooling
system it could be seen that the installation and operation of the cooling tower
is by far cheaper than the once through cooling system to the River Nile.
5.    RECOMMENDATIONS
It is recommended to contact the irrigation authorities to initiate a detailed
hydrological study about the ground water reservoir and validate the
assumptions that were adopted in Cooling Tower-Option V in the study. A
comprehensive geophysical, geological, hydrogeological, and hydrochemical
studies should be carried out to delineate the available water-bearing
formations and their average depths.

EL KUREIMATINTEGRA TED SOLAR COMBINED CYCLE
COOL I VG SYSTEMf ALTERNA TIVES
It is recommended to select the Cooling Tower-Option V as a cooling system
for the Kureimat Solar Power Plant.
If the hydrological study indicates that the ground water availability is not
sustained or the quality is not suitable, then Option VI should be adopted.
It is recommended to contact the general consultant to discuss the outcomes
of the study with him and confirm all the assumptions and data that were used
in the current study.
Detailed engineering and designs should follow the study.
