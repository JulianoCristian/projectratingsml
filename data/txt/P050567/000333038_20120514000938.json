"abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Kureimat Solar Thermal\n            Hybrid Project for Egypt were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: demonstration projects can be highly effective as\n            tools for 'visual learning' with respect to new\n            technologies such as CSP. The Kureimat Project has made\n            significant impact as one of the first Concentrating Solar\n            Power (CSP) projects in the region and contributed to\n            learning and greater awareness for CSP technology within\n            Egypt, in the region and globally. Site selection for an\n            Integrated Solar Combined Cycle (ISCC) project is of\n            critical importance. While most of the important site\n            selection criteria were applied to the Kureimat site\n            selection, it is apparent that air quality (and in\n            particular it's potential for accelerating equipment\n            surface corrosion and mirror soiling) must be added to the\n            high priority list for future projects. The Solar Island at\n            Kureimat is operating well and effectively in this early\n            stage. The performance levels are high and compare well with\n            design projections. On hot summer days, the enhanced output\n            of the solar field counteracts the typical diminished gas\n            turbine performance due to high compressor inlet dry bulb\n            air temperatures. The gas turbine power reduction is due to\n            the reduced inlet air density under such conditions. The\n            Solar Island costs are pushed higher for the smaller solar\n            fields typical of an ISCC project in comparison to a\n            solar-only steam power plant project, due to fixed\n            infrastructure costs in construction and operation and\n            maintenance (O&M) of the Solar Island. Larger solar\n            configurations approaching practical limits set by\n            performance and economics are encouraged in future projects.\n            CSP market has evolved considerably since the time this\n            project was bid with revival of interest in this technology\n            in the U.S and Europe."}, "docdt": "2012-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
