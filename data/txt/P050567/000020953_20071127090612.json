The design,\n            construction and operation of the Integrated Solar Combined\n            Cycle Plant; 2. Capacity building to NREA through\n            construction management services during project\n            implementation to ensure the smooth integration between the\n            solar and the combined cycle portions of the plant; and 3.\n            The implementation of the environmental monitoring plan."}, "docdt": "2007-11-13T00:00:00Z"}
