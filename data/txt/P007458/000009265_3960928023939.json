More specifically, the reform program\n            supported by the loan would: 1) improve the sector's\n            incentives framework through rationalization of the import\n            regime for agricultural commodities, reduction of\n            generalized food subsidies, deregulation of the citrus and\n            cocoa industries, and improvements in interest rate policy\n            and related aspects of directed agricultural credit, 2)\n            continue the process of divestment of public assets, and 3)\n            establish the institutional basis for dealing with the\n            improper use of pesticides.
