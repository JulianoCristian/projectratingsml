The project includes:\n            (a) construction of housing, training and research\n            facilities, and provision of transport and equipment for\n            extension and research staff; (b) provision of technical\n            assistance, consultant services and fellowships in the areas\n            of extension and research (through the Bangladesh\n            Agricultural Research Institute and the Bangladesh\n            Agricultural Research Council). The project also includes a\n            pilot scheme aiming at increasing the areas irrigated by\n            about 1,500 deep tubewells (to be implemented by the\n            Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation)."}, "docdt": "1977-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
