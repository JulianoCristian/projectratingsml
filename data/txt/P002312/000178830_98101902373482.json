to be financed by IFC\n            and other major financial institutions, is to upgrade\n            Senegal's phosphate rock to produce phosphoric acid and\n            fertilizers, predominantly for export, thereby assisting\n            Senegal's efforts to promote productive investments,\n            notably in export-oriented industries. The proposed\n            Bank-financed SEFICS rail transport project in support of\n            the ICS project would ensure a safe and reliable service for\n            the transport of ICS raw materials, supplies and products.\n            In addition, it would be a first step towards a\n            reorganization of RCFS with a view to concentrating its\n            limited managerial and technical staff resources on\n            improving traffic operations on the international line\n            between Senegal and Mali. The SEFICS rail transport project\n            would consist of: (i) the upgrading and renewal of a main\n            siding track; (ii) the construction of terminal tracks at\n            ICS plants and at the Port of Dakar; (iii) the provision,\n            operation and maintenance of mainline and shunting\n            locomotives and of wagons; and (iv) the construction and\n            equipping of a workshop to maintain the locomotive and wagons."}, "docdt": "1981-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
