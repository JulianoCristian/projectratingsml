The key lessons learned from\n            this project include: 1) This project has three major\n            components, which were carried out by different\n            institutions. Each organization was responsible for a\n            specific component of the project. The overall coordination\n            of this project was found difficult and showed a delay in\n            some of the activities. Hence, following a decentralized\n            approach along institutional specialization in implementing\n            such a project can minimize the risk of complexity and\n            improve implementation. 2) Bank should have been flexible\n            and ready to review the impact of the privatization issue.\n            3) The studies conducted came up with important conclusions\n            and recommendations which are of importance in solving\n            problems connected with the respective fields of study. 4)\n            The involvement of local experts in the implementation of\n            some studies carried out by international consultants helped\n            them gain experience in their respective fields. 5) The\n            training and procurement of goods and machinery enhanced the\n            capacity of organizations involved in the project to\n            implement their respective activities in an enhanced manner."}, "docdt": "2001-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
