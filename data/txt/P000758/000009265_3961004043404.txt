CALUB GAS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Credit and Project Summar
Borrower:          Ethiopia
Credit             The Calub Company
Beneficharies:     The Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME)
The Regional Govenment of Region V
The Ethiopian Road Authority (ERA)
Guarntor:          Ethiopia
Amount:            US$74.31 million equivalent
Terms:             Standard IDA terms with a maurity of 40 years
On-lending term:   Annual (commercial) rate of 14 percent over 10 years with 3 year giwace period
(ap.plicable only to proceeds to the Calub Compaiy of US$66.31 million)
Project Objectves:   The Project would (i) improve the present unbalanced structure of energy supply
in Ethiopia by increasing the availability of moder fuels; (ii) support economic
growth by expanding petroleum supply from indigenous resources; (iCM) contribute
to the mitigation of peri-urban deforesttion by inducing the replacement of
woodfuels with LPG and kerosene In urban households; (C) develop the
country's technical capacity to commercialize its fossil fuel resources; and (v)
contribute to poverty alleviation through direct measures, induced economic
activity and through the development of Etliopia's remote south-eastern region.
The project will also stimulate and facilitate private sector participation in the
energy sector and enhance MME's ability to promote petroleum exploration and
development. The project has a significant 'pilot' dimension and may be viewed
as the starting point for a comprehensive, long-term development of the country's
fossil-fuel resources. In order for the project to operate In an enabling regulatory
environment, the TGE will implement and maintain a revised LPG pricing policy
based on Import parity, study ways to optmize current pricing policy for all
petroleum products, and establish nationa LPG standards.
Project Description:  The Project consists of:
(a) A commercial component consisting of completion of the gas wells and plant
construction at Calub, privatization promotion, and operation of a petroleum
extraction and processing plant by an independent, newly created, share-capital
company;



(b) A Regional Development Component for Ethiopla's Southeaste  Regon
consisting of (i) rehabilitation of the Shlabo-Har national highway (571 kn);
and (ii) an Environmental Monitoring System and a Community Development
Fund to mionitor, through project life, the project environmental impact withi
the project area, and provide social and economic support to inhabitants of the
concerned areas.
(c) Support Components consistng of (i) technical assistance to the Ministry of
Mines and Energy for supporting a Project Implementation Task Force, and
strengthening MME's capacity to promote private and joint ventre paricipation
in petroleum exploration and development in Ethiopia; (ii) support for LPG
marketng and interfuel substiutdon; (iii) poverty alleviation among poor urban
fuelwood carriers through a program to support income diversification; and (iv)
three studies, namely, a Petroleum Pricing and Market Structure Study to assist
the Government in formulating petroleum pricing policy and optimizing the
petroleum sub-sector, a Regional Electrification Study to supply selected urban
centers with gas-generated electricity from Calub, and a study to assess the
feasibility of a larger-scale exploitation of Calub's gas resources.
Benefits:          The main Project benefits wfll be the expansion in supply of modern fuels and
a reduction in the dependence on woodfuels in urban areas. This is expected to
support growth in the productive sectors and generate employment and income,
and contibute to the mitigation of psri-urban deforestation in an economically
and environmentally sounz manner. Added bendits include local capacity
building in fossil fuel exploitation, promotion of private sector participation in
the petroleum sub-sector, contribution to the development of Ethiopia's remote
southeastern region, and ptomotion of a participatory approach to regional
development.
Risks:              Security conditions in Region V have improved and are not considered a serious
risk. Calub plant implementation and operation riss have been minimized
through a combination of corporate structuing, performance-based private
management of implementation and operatons, appropriate contractul
arrangements for plant design and construction, the inclusion of a road
rehabilitation componaAt, and a pardcipatory approach to regional development.
Regarding risks stemming from the policy and regulatory framework, the
Govrment has introduced a nunber of up-front reforms needed to attract
private capital into the Calub Company and into downstream activities. The
Government's continued commitme  to mainaining an enabling policy
environment is essential for Project success. Potential negative environmental
effects are expected to be minimal and h .ve been addressed in a specific
Environmental Assessment report.

I. TlEE ENERGY SECTOR
A. Economic Overview and Sectoral Impo e
Economic Overviw
1.1    With a poplation of over 50 million, Ethiopia is the second mot populous county in
Sub-Sabaran Africa and, with a per capita income of US$120 prior to the October 1992,
devauation, one of the poorest counties in thv «odd. Over hbaf of is population suffers
from chronic food insecurity, the result of periodic devastafing drought, sigificanlt land loss
due to environmental degaion, a poorly developed and maintained road system that
-everely hampers food markeding and distriuon, and the Impact of long civil conflict and
inappropriae policies which have drastically impaired short term prospects for job creation
and economic opportnity.
1.2   About 60 percent of the popuation lives below the defined level of absoue poverty.
Real per capita income has been declining at an average rate of S percent over the last three
yrs. Average inflao, which had been traditionally low In Ethiopia, reached about 20
percent in both FY91 and FY92. This was mainy the result of contined recowuse to domestic
bank financing of the budget deficit. The price level has also been affected by supply
shortages as agricultura output stagnated and industia production declined by more than 20
percet since FY89. Between FY89 and FY91, decreased production aw leakages due to the
exchange rate overvwuation resulted in a decline in exports to their lowest level sice 1976.
Annualinflation is projected to be 24 perent (FY93), 10 percent (4) and 7 perce
(PY95). In FY92, the deficit on the current account reaced 8 perceat of GD)P, financed to
large extent through accumulaion of exern payment atrears which reached US$716 million
by June 1992. As of the same date, the county's ta outanding debt wouned to about
US$4 brion; scheduled debt service ratio increased from 39 percent in FY89 to 80 percent in
FY92.
1.3   Ethiopi's productive capacity has been severely hampered by a combinaion of
factors involving inappropriate policies, secrity problems, Insufficient in  and loss
of natura assets due to environmenta damage. On the policy front, before the political
change in May 1991, the economy was dominated by massive state control of the productive
secuts, trade, finacial sevces, and iastructure and utilities, oriented to support the war
efort. The private sector was consequendy suffocated by a lack of foreign exchange and
Many monopoly and discriminatory practices that limited access to credit at reasonable aes,
and taxed profits at exorba  levels. Ihe distortions brought about by the overvalued Birr
created additional disincentives for export-oriented production, and encouraged purely
speculative activies. Whfle the TOE bas made great strides in reforming tbis negative policy
framework, it will take time and contimed Government commitment before confidence is
restored among domestic and foreigl investors.
I



1.4   Ieonomic performance under the reform programs has been on the whole positive.
There av favorable signs to suggest that the TGE is beginqing to assert control over basic
macroeconomic management. The budget deficit-on a cash basis and including grants-was
reduced to 10 X: percent of GDP in FY(# from an annual average of 13.3 percent during the
three previous !iscal years. Recourse to domestic bank financing declined to 4.4 percent of
GDP in FY93 from about 9 percent in the early 1990s. The inflation rate for FY93, as
indicated by the Addis Ababa retail price index, is estimated at 10.2 percent. This is well
below the peak inflation rate of over 20 percent in early 1990s. Although subject to
considerable uncertainties caused by impacts of various adjustment measures, the current
account deficit (excluding official transfers) is estimated at 13 percent of GDP annual average
of 3.5 weeks for the past three fiscal years. Improved policy incentives combined with good
weather contributed to 7.6 percent real GDP growth in FY93, compared with an annual
average of -3.1 percent for the past three fiscal years.
1.5   The second phase of the reforms is outlined in the second Policy Framework Paper
(July 1993) for 1993/94-1995/96. The program continues stabilization policies and contains
the reforms of the tax system, prioritizing public expenditures, and restricting monetary
growth. Structural reforms will be intensified and accelerated to cover wide-ranging areas,
including privatizing and reforming public enterprises, reforming the financial sector, moving
toward market determined interest rates, privatizing urban housing, and further reducing the
variance and the level of the effective rates of protection. To sustain GDP growth of about
5.5 percent in the medium to longer term, gross domestic investment needs to increase to near
30 percent of GDP in a few years from the historical level of 15-16 percent of GDP.
Although domestic savings need to rise sharply for stablo and sustainable long term growth,
foreign savings remain critical to Ethiopia's investment in the immediate future. It will take
time and continued Government commitment before confidence is restored among domestic
and foreign investors. This may well continue through the remainder of the transitional period
until the national elections produce a clearer political mandate.
1.6.  Ethiopia's productive capacity has been severely hampered by a combination of
factors involving inappropriate policies, security problems, insufficient infrastructure, and loss
of natural assets due to environmental damage. On the policy front, before the political
change in May 1991, the economy was dominated by massive state control of the productive
sectors, trade, financial services, and infrastructure and utilities, oriented to support the war
effort. The private sector was consequently suffocated by a lack of foreign exchange and
many monopoly and discriminatory practices that limited access to credit at reasonable rates,
and taxed profits at exorbitant levels. The distortions brought about by the overvalued Birr
created additional disincentives for export-oriented production, and encouraged purely
speculative activities. While the TGE has made great strides in reforming this negative policy
framework, it will take time and continued Government commitment before confidence is
restored among domestic and foreign investors.
1.7   Poor infrastructure places serious limits on Ethiopia's economic growth. The greatest
problems lie in the sctnt road network, a ratio of 0.3 km per thousand people, one of the
lowest in Africa. Many roads have deteriorated significantly due to lack of maintenance and
war damage, resulting in high trucking costs. Rural roads are especially scarce, with three-
quarters of Ethiopian farms more than a half-day's walk from an all-weather road. In addition
to poor roads and transport difficulties, Ethiopia also faces other infrastructure problems,
including constraints in energy supply.

1.8 Agriculture is presently the main productive actvity, accounting for about 45 percen
of GDP, 85 percent of total employment, and 75 pert of exports. Ibis sector is threatened
by environwental degradation, especially in the northe  regions, due to land pressure, over-
cropping, overgrazing and excessive dependence on traditional fuels. This bas resulted In
significant soil loss, which if unchecked, could increase the areas unable to susta  crops by
five-folds over the next twenty years. This could result in 15 percent of the population loing
their land, and incomes from crops and livestock could drop by 30 pecent in areas which
already have few economic alternatives. In a 1984 study, Ethiopia was estimated to be losing
its forests at a rate of 200,000 hectares per year resulting in an amnual loss of about S percent
in agricultural production through top soil erosion. The country's forest cover had declined
from an estimated 40 percent at the beginning of the 20th Century to 3-4 percent i 19841.
The deforestation rate is estimaed to have been particuarly significant in the last tlu e years
due to disruptions In the supply of aternate fuels and a breakdown In foestry contrls as a
result of the civil war. The intensive use of dung as an alternmtive fuel is depriving the soil of
fertilization materials and reducing crop yields. Several regions also suffer severe water
shortage due to drought, erosion and deforestation, as well as a drop in the water table
because of poorly planned water wells.
1.9    Over the next decade and more, Ethiopia's central development goal will be poverty
alleviation. The TGE has identified macroeconomic stabilization and adjusmn, social acton
and human resource development, and mcreased production and growth as the three esential
areas of concentration for achieving this development goal. Two importr cross-ctt
themes are emvironmental rehabilitation and conservation, and institution and capacity
building. Improvement in agricultura and industrW output wlll be central components of the
ountry's development strategy to provide food securit, alloviate poverty, and generate
economic growth. Tbis growth strategy will require a number of Importa parallel measures
concerned with fundamental policy reform, and related to inputs for the productive sectors,
infrastucture improvements, ard environmental conservaton and rehabilitation.
Energy Wector Importance and Goals
1.10 Energy Supply and Poverty Alleviatlon. An efficient energy sector, energy
sufficiency and increased diversity of energy supply are essential ingredients for achieving the
objectives of TOE's development strategy, centered on economic growth and povert
reduction. At present, the country is excessively dependent on traditional fuels, consisting
mainly of wood, but also including crop residues and animal waste. Diversifying the supply of
household fuels, improving energy efficiency and reducing the consumption of traditional
fuels is the immediate goal of the energy sector. This will contibute to the mitigation of
deforestation, thereby improving soil productivity and farm output on which a large segment
of the population is dependent, and reduce the time reqired for cooking and increase the dme
available to pursue income generating activities. A second important goal of the energy sector
is the need to increase the supply of modern energy in order to support the development of
the country's industrial and transportation sectors. The industrial sector contributes about 16

Assessment Program (Rteport No. 4741-E1, July 1984).

percent of GDP (1989) and 15 percent of export earnings. Industrial growth is expected to
generate general economic growth, employment, and overall poverty alleviation.
1.11 At the 1989/90 per capita consumption level of 0.29 tons of oil equivalent (toe),
Ethiopia has one of the lowest energy consumption levels in the world. Of this consumption,
only about 0.02 toe (6 percent) was from modern energy sources with the balance being from
traditional fuels. Ibis consumption level may be compared with the 1989 average of 0.472 toe
for all Africa (of which 37 percent is in the form of traditional fuels). Ethiopia's modem
commercial energy conumption patterns are compared with those of other selected developing
countries in Table 1.1. As the table indicates, Ethiopia is one of the countries most poorly
supplied with modern commerci4 energy and is most highly dependent on traditional fuels. In
many areas, including the semi-desert Region V where the Calub natural  s deposit is
situated, wood resources have been largely depleted and lack of access to reliable sources of
energy is a primary mnstraint to self-sustainn development. Agriculture, transportation
(specially for food distribution), buman and animal health care, and other social services In
the region coluld be greatly fWitated by the sufficient and reliable supply of energy.
1.12 Modern Commercal Energy and Economic Growth. Ethiopia's modern comi±1ercial
energy use is comprised essentially of petroleum (90 percent) and electricity (10 percent). In
1989 commercial energy consumption totalled about 860,000 toe (about half that of Kenya),
equivalent to about 19 kgoe per capita (about one-fourth that of Kenya). Tbis per capita
consumption of modern fuels is one-fiteenth the average for Africa. About 22 percent of
modemn energy is consumed by the industrial sector (24 percent in Kenya and about 3'.
percent on average for Africa), 45 percent by the transportation sector (50 percent for Kenya
and 43 percent on average for Africa), and the balance consumed equaly by households and
the government/commercial sectors. Energy shortage has conributed to the sharp decline of
over 20 percent in industrial capacity utilization since FY89. An expanded supply of modern
fuels will help spur industrial growth and, by developing indigenous resources, future
recurring foreign exchange expenditures on energy can be mitigated.
1.13 Sectoral Goals and the Proposed Project. Relative to other available energy
resources (rable 1.2), commercialization of the liquid rroducts (and LPG) associated with
Calub natural gas offers quick and economically and enviromnentally viable means of
increasing the country's supply of modern fuels. Tlhe project's contribution is expected to be
approximately 70,000 toe/year (or about 8 percent of the current consumption of petroleum
and electricity). Approximately 50 percent of this supply (LPG and kerosene) will be used for
household purposes. With their higher energy efficiencies, these modern fuels can potentially
replace about 400,000 tons/year of fuelwood (about 18 percent of current urban
consumption). The balance, consisting of gasoline and diesel, is expected to be used for road
transportation and power generation.
1.14  A major contribution of the proposed project would be to provide experience in
natural gas production and utilization (for local power generation), which will technically and
economically facilitate a larger-scale exploitation of the Calub natural gas reserves in the
futiie. The deposit can potentily supply up to 2 million toe/year in the form of naural gas
for 15 years before going into decline. Ihis supply is best suid for industi and electricity
generation purposes and is equivalent to about double Ethiopia's current supply of modern
energy (Table 1.4). Although the country has substantal hydropower resources, actual capital
costs fur large scae hydroelectric power plas in Ethiopia are esmaed to have ranged from
4



US$2,200 to 2,500 per kilowatt of peak capacit9. Similar gas-based power generadon is
sustaniay less capl intsive, with cost etmatd at US$7-8  pr kiowatt. In
addion, gas-based power offers a reliable backup in case adver  climattic conditions result in
a drop in river water levels and reduced hydroelectric power output.
1.15   An improved supply response requires a comprehensive energy sr   aimed at: )
atrcting the significant capital investment required to develop the country's modern energy
resources; Ci) improving commercial operations through revisions In tariff regulations,
restucg the electricity and petroleum corporaions, ad increasing private sector
participation; and (fii) improving the importationlprocurement, storage, distlibution and
pricing of petroleum products. The proposed project is deigned to achieve these alms in the
petroleum sub-sector. It would also contribute to improving agricultural productivity (by
alleviatig demands on forest products by households), improving access to modern fuels in
some remote areas, supportig industW development, reducing the cure  account deficit,
promoting technology transfer, and supporng infrstructure, instion and capacity building.

1.17           yadropower. Hydropower is Ethiopia's largest sustainable enr  resource.
Sios with an estmaed potentia of 15,000 to 30,000 MW could be developed. Developmeat
of tieso resoces for elecrcity gation has been mdnly capital and technology con-
sdad, ad has reslted in only 368 MWs being devdoped to date. Conmption of this
7



capacity has been limited by the inadequacy of the distribution network, and high capital
reqired to exnd this network. If approved, the proposed Gilgel Gibe hydiopower project,
under bilateral financing, is expected to add 150 MW when it is completed in 1996. As
indicated above (para. 1.12), final costs of large-scale hydro projects have been in the range
of US$2,200 to 2,500 per kW. Medium and small scale hydropower plants (0.5 to 10 MWs)
are getting increasing attention by Ethiopian energy planners. Key advantages include lower
overall costs, shorter construction periods and the possibility of locating these plants closer to
small urban centers not connected to the national grid. The Blue Nile and Omo river basins
are the most economically promising large sites for the generation of hydroelectricity.
Electricity generation, whether based on hydropower, geothermal or natural gas, can make a
major contribution towards meeting the country's rising energy needs as well as supplying the
demand in neighboring Sudan and Djibouti.
1.18         Ptroleum. Although there are indications of indigenous liquid petroleum
(crude oil) deposits, so far there has been no confirmation of commercial levels of these
reserves.
1.19         Natural Gas. Serious exploration of domestic fossil fuel resources began in
the mid 1940s, with extensive exploration by foreign companies in the Red Sea and in the
Ogaden Basin (Region V). These efforts were successfil in discovering natural gas deposits
which were subsequently further developed with Soviet expertise in the 1980s in The Ogaden
Basin. lle  development efforts have confimed com becil quantities of natural gas
reserves at Calub (about 700 kn south of Dire Dawa), estmated at a total of 2.7 trillion
cubic feet (tcl). Natural gas reserves have also been identified, but not yet quantified, at
Hilala, also in the Ogaden Basin, about 70 kms west of Calub.
1.20         In a further effort to promote exploration in Ethiopia, the Government
compiled data on exploration potential and presented it to western oil companies in 1985.
Between 1989 and 1991, four additional exploration conutracts were signed covering the Red
Sea, Ogaden Basin, and Gambela (in the southwest of Ethiopia). Exploration had been
hampered by adverse political developments in 1991 but is slowly getting back on track.
1.21         Commercialization of the natural gas liquids in the Calub deposit is a high
priority for the Government. Natural gas will also be used for electricity generation for the
Calub plant, and possibly for transmission to Gode, the regional capital, and other urban
centers in the region. Naural gas offers the country an environmentally attractive source of
energy. The potential for the large-scale commercialization of this resource is enormous. The
main obstacles to this commercialization are the high cost of gas or power transmission
(owing to the remote location of the deposit) and developmeat of demand. Calub gas reserves
could supply around three times the current level of energy consum.d by industry for at least
15 years. In terms of power generation, Calub gas could supply the fuel needs of a system six
dmes the capacity of Ethiopia's current power system for about 15 years3. While the full
achievement of these targets is not considered completely feasible, they serve to demonstrate
the potential for the natural gas and suggest a need for fiuther investigation. Potential uses,

such as for electricity generation, as an Industrial bel and as feedstock for chemical fertilizer
production, wil be studied under the proposed projecL
1.22          Geothermal Resources. In Ethiopia, these resources are concetrated along
the Rift valley, oriented in the NNE-SSW direction extending from the Red Sea coast to the
Kenyan border. Total geotermal based electricity generation capacity is estimated at 700
MW. The first project, located In the Lake District (Lanno-Aluto pwject) is in the design
phase with an initial capacity of 5 MW and a potenta (proven reserve) capacity of 30 MW.
In 1988, the cost of geotherm  power generation was estimated at aroumd US$3,000/kW4.
1.23          Forest and Biomass Resources. Inteosive deforestation has depleted
Ethiopia's forest and other woody biomass resources. However, these resources are still
available in significant quantities in some areas, but urgently require a new, sustainable
approach to further exploitation. Considering the high level of dependence on these resources,
the Energy Sector Assessment (ESMAP) study of Ethiopia in 1984 highlighted the
development of these resources as an Important component for resolvig the household energy
supply problem. More efficient forestry management, and an estimated 3 million hectares in
reforestation, will be needed to meet demand which exceeds supply by 20 to 1 in highly
populated areas. In a parallel action to the proposed project, the Bank iS supporting the
development of a Forestry Action Plan directed at reversing the growing depletion of the
country's forests. Etiopian projections of wood resource depletion based on present energy

1.24          Coal. A few coal deposits have been found in Ethiopia. Quantified deposits
include about 300,000 tons in the Mush Valley and more than 100 million tons of lignite and
oil shale around Delbi (30 km south of Jimma). Studies indicate that most known deposits are
not economically exploitable. In the case of Delbi, mining on a small scale has begun to
supply coal for the development requirements of the Gilgel Gibe Hydroelectric Project.
1.25          Other Resources. There are some prospects for using solar and wind energy
(windmills) for localized domestic and industrial applications in some areas. Studies for the
utilization of these resources are still at an early stage.
C. Energy Supply anid Consumption
1.26 Final energy consumption in 1989/90 totaled about 14.7 million toe, up from 9.8
million toe which was esthnated in 1982. With an estimated population of 51 million, this is
equivalent to about 0.29 toe ner capita, of which about 0.27 toe per capita (94 percent) was in
the form of biomass fuels usk i most entirely for household cooldng. National energy
consumption (approximately eq. jI to net supply) for 1989/90 is summarized in Table 1.4
(1990/91 data are considered less representative on account of civil war dislocations).

Petroleum fues are derived from refined imported crude (435,000 toe) and from product imports (375,000 toe).
loctricity is mainly hydro-based. A small amount (2,000 toe) was consumed in the form of crop tesidues
briquetes.
1 toe - 2.9 tons of fuelwood, 2.8 tons of residues, 3.0 tons of dung, 1.4 tons of charcoal (derived from 14 tons
of wood), approximatdy 0.95 tons of petroleum (depending on product mix), and 11.8 MWh of electicity.

1.27         A summary of final (excluding conversion losses for decticity generation and
oil refing energy consumption trend for the various fuels between 1985/86 and 1990191 is
prsnted in Table 1.5. From 1985 to 1991, there was an incra  of 13 percent in net eneW
supply (average annual ncrease of 2.1 percen). With the exception of 1990/91, when
petroleum imports showed a marled decline, there was virtuay no change in the distibution
among the forms of energy or the consumption by the various sectors. Acording to the
statstcs, growth in energ consumption paraleled the population growth of about 2.9 percat
per yea. Kerosene consumption has shown the most rapid growth, averaging 21 pet per
year excluding the 1989-1991 period when civil unrest disupted petroleum supply Crable
2.2). Increased kerosene supply, mainly through imports, is believed to have contributed to a
stemming of the demand growth for biomass fuels, particularly in urban areas.
D. Household Energ
1.28         A key issue in the energy sector is the supply of household fuels as this is
direcdy related to the massive deforestation and the resultant insidious depletion of
agicultural resos on which so much of the economy currety depends. Almost 90
percent of energy consumption is for household purposes, mainly for cooking, of whih about
92 percent Is in rural areas C(able 1.4). Available statistics do not indicate any significant
shift in the distribution between urban and rural total consumption over the 1985 to 1991
period. Moden fuels are consumed essentially in the ura areas where their consumption (as
a percentage of total household energy consumption) has grown from 7 to 11 percent in the
1985-1990 period, despite supply constrain. Woodfuels contute the bulk (81 percet) of
energy usage by the household sub-sector although a significant amount of crop residues and
dung are also employed in rural areas.
1.29        Fuel consumption pattrs are dictate to a large extent by cooking habits,
fimily income, fuel avalability and supply reliability, fuel price, usage convenience and heat
efficiency, and appliance (stove, etc.) costs and efficiency. Injera, the staple of most
Ethiopians, consumes some 50 percent of total cooking energy in rural areas and somewhat
less in urban areas. It is generally cooked once or twice a week and, owing to an even heat
distbuio  required for proper cooking, injera is cooked on wood stoves (by the majority of
people) or in electric niads (by those who can afford them and have reliable access to
eectricity). With modifications in stove design, LPG and kerosene could also be employed for
the cooking of injera.
1.30         The growth in the availability and consumpton of modem fuels in urban ar
has been accompanied by changes in cooking habits. Domesticaly manuactured electric
mitads, developed by the Energy Authority, are gradually replacing wood for injera coolkn
in urban areas; kerosene is increasingly used for lighting and for cooking purposes; LPG is
available in limited quantities and essenally only in Addis Ababa (and Assab). Owing to
overall scarcity and unrliability in the supply of modern fuels, many middle and upper class
urban households have the necessary appliances to use woodfuels, kerosene, LPG and
electricity for their cooking and lighti  purposes. Fuel selection usually depends upon the
cooking function and the availability of a specific fuel at any given time.
11



1.31         Traditional fuels are avalable at wholesale centers and  ough retail outlets.
Due largely to supply constraints, kerosene was raioned until November 1992. As availability
of foreign exchange supplies have now increased, the rationing system has been abolished,
and the fuel is available at gasoline stations. In urban areas, a TOE povety alleviation
program is considering the introduction of a cash voucher scheme aimed at supplementing the
income of low income groups. These cash vouchers may be used to purchase certain food
items and kerosene. Supply and distribution of LPG is discussed in Section IV-A.
1.32         It is esdmated that over 80 percent of woodfuels consumed by urban house-
holds are illegally harvested, the balance being supplied by the state-owned Construction and
Fuelwood Production and Marketing Enterprse (CFPAM. Traditfonal fuel prices are set
largely by market forces and reflect increased transportation costs as peri-urban forests
continue to recede. The prices do not, however, reflect costs for replanting or improved
forestry management. ITe 1984 ESMAP study indicated that fuelwood prices in Addis Ababa
soared fom Birr 19 to Birr 190 per ton between 1973 and 1983, by which time household
energy was clahimng up to 20 percent of household income. In 1992, prices were Birr 330 per
ton, representing a substantially higher proportion of income consider  that there has been
almost no increase in per capita income over the last 10 years.
1.33         LPG, kerosene and electricity prices are regulated by the Government and are
curreny priced below their economic values. Ihe TGE is to underake an electrcity triff
study shortly which is expected to lead to a rationalization of the taiff stu re. A petroleum
pricing and market structure study is a component of the proposed project and is expected to
begin at the time of Credit Effectiveness. Kerosene Is not taxed and Its retail price includes a
direct subsidy b, the Ethiopian Petroleum Corporation (EPC). Icreased kerosene supply and
elimnatio of the rationing systekn has vitually eliminated the parallel market price for
ksene where the fuel had commanded two to dtree dmes the offcial price.
1.34         Stoves for traditional fuels are either improvised or available at relatively low
prices (Birr 5-15) in the market. Kerosene stoves are imported and also manactured locally.
They are readily available and priced at around Birr 25. Basic two-ber LPG stoves are
sold in government shops, where they are priced at about Birr 125 but are rarely avalble,
and in the open market where they are more readily available but cost about Biff 300. This
expense of Birr 300 is approximately what a low income urban amily would spend over 3
months on fuelwood for cooking and is approximately equal to the household's monhly
income. Stove efficiencies are 8-15 percent for wood stoves, 29 percent for charcoal, and
around 36 and 55-60 percent for kerosene and LPG respectively.
1.35         Cuetly both LPG and keosene are substantially cheaper than woodfuels in
urban markets. At prevailing urban market prices, switching from traditionai woodfuels to
modern fuels (if these were made available) offers consumers substanti savings. Fuelwood
consumption by a low-income family of five in Addis Ababa is estimated at 8-10 kg/day.
Assuming bulk purchase at current prices, this consumpt  constkutes an expenditre of Birr
3.0/day. On a usefil energy basis, this quantity of wood can be substiuted by about 0.9 kg of
LPG, costing Birr 1.75, or 1.2 kgs of kerosene, costing Birr 1.4. Te pricing policy proposed
for LWG and kerosene under the Project will continue to offer substantal savings over
fuelwood in urban markets as well as ensure increased supply of these modern fuels. Even
ough potial svings are substanti, higher appliance costs, larger cash disbursements per
purchase, and unreliable supply make consumers hesitant to switch to modern fuels. An

intarfel substitution strategy will have to take these fdtors into account if it is to be effective
and the substitution sustainable.
1.36         Surveys conducted by the Bank Project Team In Addis Ababa Indicate that
consumers are generally aware of modern fuels and their relative merits. Kerosene users who
have not used LPG are aware of Its cleaner burning characterisdcs and the fact that the fond
does not have the unpleasant taste often associated witb keosene. Ihe initia sense is that if
LPG were available reliably and priced at a reasonable premium above the price of kerosene
(section IV-B), consumers would place a high priority on using their (scarce) financial
resources to buy L;PG and the appliances to use this preferred fuel. Family income level will,
however, be a significant constraint: Bank studies hae found that policies in developing
countries to promote LPG use by households with incomes less than about $25 (Birr 125) per
capita per month are likely to lead to disappointment. The Ethiopian urban market Is
exceptional in the fact that traditional fuel prices are high and reflect their scarcity value to a
greater extent than in other developing countries. This increases the potential for su:cessfully
subsituting traditional fuels with modern fuels, even among lower income consumers. Urban
markets exist for the modern domestic fuels expected to be made available by the proposed
project. Target markets, marketing mechanisms and pricing policy are discussed in Section IV
and Annex IV.1.
E. Energy for Industry and Transportation
1.37         Industry. As mentioned above (para. 1.10), Ethiopia's supply of modern
energy to the indstrial sector is one of the lowest in the world. Over 50 percent of the
energy consumed by industry is in the form of woodfuels and crop residues with petroleum
and electricity contributing only 28 percent of 1989/90 consumptio (Table 1.4). Biomass
fuels are predominandy used by cottage industries; petroleum products, mainly fuel oil and
diesel, and electricity are mostly used by medium and large scale industries. Total energy
consumption by this sector has increased at an average anmu rate of about 3 percent, with
consumption of petroleum products showing the highest growth (about S percent/year). The
proposed project is expected to lead the way in effecting a major expansion of modemn energy
supply to the industrial sector.
1.38         Transportation. Modern transportation is dependent entirely on petroleum
products. In 1989/90, the sector's use consisted of 47 percent diesel, 31 percent gasoline, 19
percent jet fuel and 3 percent aviation gasoline. The proposed project is expected to supply
about 30,000 tons of gasoline and diesel per year, equivalent to about 9 percent of current
annual petroleum consumption by the transportation sector.
14



F. Sector Justiuos
1.39        Istitutional responsibility of the Energy sector is maly with the Ministry of
Mines and Energy. The Ministry of Agriculture is also responsible, covering the areas of
forestry, renewable energy, and household energy. Sector planniAg and performance by these
institutions has been generally satisfactory.
The MinIstry of Mlnes and Energy
1.40         The Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME) Is the entity responsible for
developing the country's energy strategy, formulaingand implementing the policies govern-
ing mining, petroleum exploration and product sharing agreements, and the exten of private
sector participation in the mining and energy sectors. The MME does not, however, establish
energy and petroleum product prices nor does it establish natl nal quality and safety standards
for petroleum products. Prices are set by the National Price Institute, moved in November
1992 from the Ministry of Plaming to the Ministry of Trade, with varying levels of
consultation with the Ethiopian Petroleum Corporation and the distribution companies. The
autonomous Standards Institute is responsible for establishing product standards.
1.41        The MME consists of six operating agencieslstate corporations. These are the
Ethiopian Petroleum Corporation (EPC), the Ethiopian Electric Light and Power Authority
(EELPA), the Ethiopian Mineral Resource Development Corporation (EMRDC), the
Ethiopian Institute of Geological Surveys (EIGS), the Ethiopian Energy Authority (EEA), and
the Oil and Gas Exploration and Development Organization (OGEDO). These agencies report
directly to the Minister who -is assisted by the vice-ministers of Energy and of Mines. Of the
six agencies, EPC, EELPA, EMRDC and EIGS are legally independent state corporations,
with varying levels of financial autonomy. The EEA and OGEDO are functionaly
autonomous but are essentially offices within the MME.
1.42        At present, and for the past decade, petroleum exploration and development
activities have been handled by two offices, the Oil and Gas Project Coordinating Office
(OGEPCO), now OGEDO, and the Petroleum Exploration Promotion Project (PEPP) within
the Geological Institute. Negotiations with foreign petroleum companies interested in
petroleum activities in Ethiopia are currently handled by a Negotiations Committee comprised
of senior members of the MME, and representatives of both offices. The Negotiations
Committee reports to the Vice Minister for Mines.
The Ethiopian EnerW Authority (EEA)
1.43         The EEA is responsible for compiling the country's energy statistics,
coordinating household energy efficiency enhancement programs and developing alternative
energy resources. The agency also plays an important role in formulating national enemr
policy and strategy.
15



The Oil and Gas Explortlon and Development Orgaition (OGEDO)
1.44         OGEDO has been responsible for conducting and coordinat  the exploration
and development of the Calub and Hillala. At preset, OGEDO Is responsble for
implementing I Calub development activities and preparing the proposed project. The agency
Is most knowledgeable about the Calub deposit and key OGEDO personnel are expeed to be
involved in the commercialization of the deposit. Their cotntbution to successful project
implementation is expected to be significat
lbe Etioplan Petroleum Corporation (EPC)
1.45         At present, the responsibility of oil and gas processing, operation of petoleum
production facilities, and procurement and marketing of all hydrocarbon subs ta    Is
assigned to EPC. The largest part of EPC's responsibility was represented by the operation of
the Assab refinery. The transfer of this refinery to Eritrea, leaves EPC as essealy a
petroleum purchasing, processing, and marketg govenmnent agency.
The Ethiopian Elecic Light and Power Authority (EELPA)
1.46         EELPA is responsible for operating and managing the coutrs power
generation and distribution facilities. It also contributes to the establishment of the electricity
taiff strucre. The use of natural gas for electricity generation under the proposed project
will be the first of its kind for the Ethiopians. Natu gas is expected to play a growing role
in the country's future electrification programs, particularly for supply to areas located close
to sources of natural gas (deposit or pipeline). The opation of the Calub power plant for
intera consumption is expected to make a significant contribution to the counWs techical
capability in opeaating gas-based power generation syems.
1.47        The MME is to be reorganized within the next few months pending the
recommendations of an intnal review. As a first step, two new agencies are to be created
within the MME. The first, called the Petroleum Operations     (POA), wiUl result
from the synthesis of OGEDO and PEPP. It will include a legad deparent and will handle
aU national petroleum opera-ions, including negotiations with foreign petroleum companies,
oversight of petroleum operadons, and implementation of Petroleum Proclamations. The
Calub Company will negotiate its product sharing/gas prcn agreement with the POA. A
second agency, caled the Mining Operations Administon, will be established to carry out
similar functions as the POA in the mining sector.
Distribution of Petroleum Products
1.48        The distribution of petroleum products In Ethiopia is handled by four
intenational offl companies, AGIP, Mobil, Shell and Total. Products are received by the
disrbutin companies from EPC, mainly from the Assab refiy and through the Assab
port, ransported to regional depots and marketed though the companies' own retail outlets,
turough appointed dealers or in partnership with local entpreneurs (Setion THE).
16



Distribudon of Woodfuels
1.49         'he main public sector instituion In the woodfiel maketing system Is the
Consruction and Fuelwood Production and Marketing Enterprise (CPPME). The CFPME is
part of tfie Department of Naura Resources (DNR). within the Ministry of Agriculture.
charged with the production of forest products, especially poles, fuelwood and charcoal, and
with making fuels available to urban low-income groups at prices lower than those prevailing
in the open market. Fuel is sold to the public on presentation of ration cards issued by the
kebeles. Prices are set by a Committee based on CFPME's actual costs plus a profit margin of
IS-20 percent. CFPME's actual supply is determined by the areas being cleared or harvested
(for agriculture, clearways for transmission lines, or as part of state forestry management) and
by seasonal factors.
1.50         CFPME is unable to supply the urban demand for woodfiels. The private
sector in fact supplies over 80 percent of woodfiels consumed in the main cities. A combina
tion of purchased and freely collected fuels is brought into towns either on foot or by camels
and donkeys. The structure of the private sector is complex. Some fuel carriers are also
producers, usually members of peasant associations who collect fuel from the land they
control; other producers sell to local carriers or to carriers who come from the city to pick up
wood. Some of the latter also collect wood themselves. A large proportion of urban fuelwood
carriers are women, often heads of household and belonging to the most desute segment of
urban society. It is esdmated that in Addis Ababa alone there are at least 15,000 women
fuelwood carriers who have to walk an average 20 to 30 kms per round-trip, carrying loads of
about 20 kgs. As their activity is illegal, these women are targets of haassment by forest
guards.
1.51         Some fuel is sold to private wholesalers while the rest is sold by the carrier in
the market or peddled door-door. Wholesale centers stock bundles of wood nd charcoal
which are generally greater than 25 kgs in size, which can be delivered to the house, while
retail outlets, located in residential areas, sell smaller units of wood or charoaL.
G. Energy Pricing
1.52         Prices for traditional fuels are largely established by market forces. Prices and
tariff strucures for petroleum products and electricity are established by the National Pricing
Instite in the Minstry of Trade with inputs from the Ministry of Mines and Energy (EPC
and EWLPA) and the Mnmistry of Planning. An electricity tariff study is to begin shortly with
the aim of rationaling the present elecricity ta   strucatre.
1.53         Petroleum retail prices vary according to geoaphical location to reflect
transportation costs. Product pricing policies have atempted to incorporate the objectives of
subbtituting woodfuels with kerosene, supportig th. road freight tortion, which is
strongly affected by the price of diesel fuel, and enrir: the financia security of EPC, the
procurer and producer of all petroleum products in the country. Under the proposed project,
the Government has welcomed the inclusion of a Petroleum Pricing and Market Structure
17



Study aimed at identifying distortions and recommending sub-sectoral policy reforms. Current
petroleum pricing policy is discussed in Section I-D.
H. Government Energy Sector Strategy
1.54         A national energy policy has been recently (November 1993) formulated by a
special committee in the Office of the Prime Minister, coordinated by the Vice-Minister of
Energy (MME). This National Energy Policy (NEP) is consistent with the general economic
policy of the TGE and its key objectives, (particularly for the petroleum sub-sector) are
reflected in the Letter of Sector Policy (LSP-Annex 1.2).
l.55         The following areas hay: been identified as being particular importance to the
efficient functioning of the energy sector in Ethiopia: (i) development of a comprehensive
segy (including such issues as pricing and the role of the private sector) and investment
plan; (ii) development of an improved strategy for petroleum importation, transportation
(road, rail or pipeline), storage, distribution and pricing; (iii) establishment of clear authority
for enacting the recommendations of various forestrylfuelwood studies; (iv) review and
revision of electricity tariffs to bring them in line with production costs; (v) review of the
Gilgel Gibe hydroelectic scheme to determine Its economic viability, including the faasibility
of the proposed inter-connector to Sudan; (vi) restructure of EELPA and EPC so that their
operations are on a more autonomous and commercial basis; and (vii) improvement In the
planning, policy analysis and project evaluation capacity of the main agencies, and a
separation of their licensing and regulatory functions. The Governmet has already insuted a
new Investment Code which includes investments in the energy sector. Under the proposed
project, commercial operations (producion and distribution of Calub petroleum products) will
be undtaken with substntia private sector participation, LPG and kerosene pricing policy
wI be revised, and a Petroleum Pricing and Market Structure Study will be undertaken aimed
at a comprehensive optimization of petroleum supply, distribution and pricing.
I. Bank Group Involvement in the Energy Sector
1.56         The Bank Group has provided assistance to four energy operations in
Ethiopia, comprised of two power projects, one energy project and one project for the
promotion of petroleum exploration. Loan 375-Er to the EELPA in 1964 helped finance the
Awash H and m hydroelectric plants and associated transmission and distribution. Loan 596-
Er in 1969, also to EELPA helped finance the Finchaa Hydroelectric Project. Credit 1386-ET
in 1983 assisted the Govermment to promote the exploration of the country's petroleum
potetal, acquire and improve seismic data, study potenial uses of naural gas, and study the
commercial potential of geothermal energy. The Energy Project, Credit 1704-ET financed by
IDA and DANIDA in 1986, is assisting the Government in establishing a least-cost expansion
program for the power sub-secor and implementing its highest priority projects, and in
developing and implementing least-cost plans to expand the supply of household energy
products and correct price imbalances.
18



1.57         Ihe Awash H and 1m hydroelectric plants and associated facilities were
satisfactorily completed, though with a delay of two yeats due to construction difficulties. The
Project Performance Audit Report for Loan 596-ET (Report No. 1102 dated March 23, 1976)
concluded that the project, completed in 1973 with minor delays, reained economically
justified. Credit 1386-ET for exploration promotion closed in 1990, three years behind
schedule but achieved, to a satisfacry extent, the goal of attracting foreign exploration
companies into the country (discussed in Section I-B). A substantal amount of usefil seismic
data was generated which will be of great importance for future exploration.
1.58         The Energy Project, which was to close in March 1992, is rumning about two
years behind its appraisal schedule because of delays caused by civil war. The power
component, consisdng of transmission, distribution and generation (hydro and diesel)
expansion and rebabilitation, is well under way with resources being concentatd in the war-
torn North as a result of reallocation under the Emergency Recovery and Reconstruction
Programme (Credit 2351-BI). The main energy component, being implemented by the
Ethiopian Energy Authority (EEA), consists of an extensive crop residue briquetting and
household cooking efficiency reseach and development program. The component is financed
by a DANIDA grant for which IDA is acting as the administrator. Ihe program is begnning
to produce good results and batch-production briquetting and marketing will soon begin.
Energ Sector Assessment
1.59         Under joint UNDP/World Bank Energy Assessment Program (ESMAP), the
only comprehensive review of the Ethiopian energy sector was completed in 1984 (Report
No. 4741-BIT). The report concluded that sector issues which required urgent action were: (i)
the increasing scarcity and high cost of household cooking fuels as a result of inadequate and
inefficient woodfuel production, marketing, management and infrastructure; (ii) the wide
spread and accelerating depletion of high-forest and savamnah-land tree cover as a result of
woodfuel scavenging and the associated mereasing soil erosion (iii) inefficient resource
allocation in the power sub-sector as a result of weak planning leading to economically sub-
optimal major investments; (iv) the need to enhance the availability of skilled manpower
sector-wide, especially in the power sub-sector; and (v) the need to increase the level of
electricity tariffs and rationalize their structre.
Lesons Learned
1.60         Overal lessons learned from past experience indicate that main sectoral
problems in the past have consisted of implementation delays, due maliy to civil unrest, but
also to sub-optimal isttutional capacity. However, technical skills for project implementation
within the institutions concerned, and the effectiveness of training programs, have been
generally satsctory, indicating the availability of a satsfactory human resource base.
1.61         Weakness in reporting and audits have been detected. This however is an issue
not strictly related to the sector. Assment and iniatives in this area are underway widhr
the overall dialogue between the TGE and IDA, and MMB is in the process of brngn up to
date aU outstanding audits. Specific reporting and audit requirements under the project are
discussed in Section m.K.

IH .1IE !PETROLEUM SUB-SECTOR
A. Oon
2.1          The petroleum sub-sector falls under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Mnes
and Energy (MME). he organizational strucure of the MME and Its agencies is described In
Part I-P.
B. Petroleum Exploration
2.2          Petroleum exploration in Ethiopia has been ceate in three main areas:
te Red Sea, the Gambela region, and Region V. Exploration to date has been successful in
the Calub Basin, where major reserves of natral gas have been located in the Calub field. At
the time of project appraisal; two active exploration licenes, incorporating nealy the entity
of the Ethiopian Red Sea, are in a state offorce mejewre pending the resolution of contactua
Implications associated with the possible separation of Eritrea from Ethiopia. Geophysical
exploraon in Gambela is about to begin. In Region V, as the last phase of the bilateral
agrment, the Soviet Petroleum Exploration Expediton (SPEE) is drilling the Calub-10
development weil and the Hillala-4 delineation well. Maxus Energy Corporation (USA) has
completed its seismic survey in the eastern part of Region V; and Hunt Oil (USA) has
completed seismic surveys in the southwestern part of the regio. Detailed information on the
status of exploration in the three main areas of investigation (Red Sea, Gambela, and Region)
are presented in Annex IH.1.
C. Petroleum Supply and Demand
2.3          At the prest time there is no exploitation of local fossil fuel resources in
Ethopia. All petroleum is imported, either as refined products or as crude for the Assab
refinery. Ihe supply and consumption of petroleum products in Ethiopia over the last few
years (particularly 1990/91) has been erratic owing to supply disruptions causd by political
and economic instability. Petroleum is the only imported form of energy and comprises
approximately ten percent of Ethiopia's tol import bill. In 1989/90 (a more typical' year
than 1990191) nationl petroleum fuel (products) supply was 746,000 tons of which product
Import amonted to about 331,000 tons, valued at US$62.5 million. About 240,000 tons of
fuld oil, valued at US$19 million, was exported in the same year and the cost of imported
crude was about US$94 million. Thus the net foreign exchange expendire on petroleum is
estimated at US$13.5.million for 1989/90.
2.4          Presently petroleum imports come maily from the Arab Gulf and trough the
Assab port. Djbouti is used for smaller quantity imports to supply the Dire Dawa area via the
20



rail link between Djibouti and Dire Dawa. Assab is the preferred port of supply because of
the existing infrastructure, developed over the last few decades by the Ethiopians, and its
proximity to the refinery. Additional factors In favor of Assab over Djibouti include foreign
exchange constraints (for payment of Djibouti port charges), port capacity limitations, and the
poor condition of the road and rail link between Djibouti and Dire Dawa. Even though
preferential arrangements regarding the use of Assab port and refinery facilities are expected
to continue between Eritrea and Ethiopia, at the present time both these facilities are
controlled by Eritrea.
2.5          Petroleum Prorment and Reinery Operation. The separation of Eritrea
has resulted in the ownership of the Assab refinery being transferred to Eritrea. The Assab
port has a crude reception capacity of 40,000 tons. Crude is now imprwted and supplied to the
refinery by EPC, the refinery processes the crude and supplies finished products to Ethiopia.
The refinery has a crude oil processing capacity of 800,000 tons/year (17,000 bpd). Its
obsolete technology (basic hydrsmmig) results in a relatively large proportion (45 percent)
of the product slate being low-value fuel oil, the supply of which far exceeds domestic
demand. About two-thirds of this fuel oil is exported. On the other hand, the refinery does
provide some products in small quantities, such as LPG and asphalt, which have a high
economic value and would be substantally more expensive to import Onehird to one-half of
the domestic supply of petroleum products is imported as refined products, comprised
primarily of diesel and jet fuel (part of which is converted to kerosene).
2.6          A recendy completed Bank financed study of the petroleum sector in North-
east Africa revealed substantia procurement, refining and distribution inefficiencies in the
Ethiopian petroleum sector. Areas identified for rationalization were procurement,
representing 64 percent of total potental savings, and refining and distribution, representing
22 and 14 percent of savings respectively. Foreign exchange consraints, low credit
worthiness, and high EPC promre      margins were cited as the primary causes of
procurement inefficiency. Rationalization of procurement practices will be addressed wihin
the scope of the Petroleum Pricing and Market Strucure Study funded under the project.
Petroleum Supply, Consumption Patterns and Demand Forecat
2.7          Supply and Consumption. Supply trends showing the breakdown between
imports and refnery production are presented in Table 2.1.
2.8           Anmnal consumption patterns, by product, are smmarized in Table 2.2.
Anual kerosene consumption increased by an average of 21 percent/year between 1985/86
and 1989/90 while the consumption of other petroleum products has remained relatively
constant, due more to supply shortages than to a lack of demand. Petroleum product
consumption by sector in 1989/90 is shown in Table 2.3. Consumption is predominandy
concentrated in the transportation and industria sectors. Of partiular note is the growth in
the consumption of kerosene, which has doubled between 1985 and 1990. Consumption trends
for each product by sector are available in project files.

2.9          Regional Consumptlon. A Distrbudon Companies report on Petroleum
Marketing in Ethiopia and Eritrea, including the con n patterns, is available in project
files. Table 2.4 below shows the dominant markets for the major ground products (i.e.
excluding aviation gasoline). LPG is consumed mainly in Addis Ababa (80 to 85 percent) and
Assab (15 to 20 percent). About 80 percent of the groud products are consumed in the four
cities of Addis Ababa, Asmara, Assab and Dire Dawa (Hararge), and in the Shoa province.
Addis Ababa alone represents over 35 percent of the consumptioL Suppressed demand in
presently poorly supplied regions (for example Hararge and Region V) wilI result in demand
growth at a higher rate than the national average as supply constraints are alleviated. Demand
in other regions is expected to evolve in line with the national average mar  2.10).

2.10         Consumption Forecat. Restoration of politial stability, alleviation of
foreign exchmge constraints, and general economic recovey are expected to increase
petroleum product demand and consumption. Ihe disttidon companies forecast that aU
products will re-stabilize at 1987188-1988189 levels by 1993 and then increase in the period
1993-2005 at the following annual growth rates: (1) Motor gasoline at a rate of 2 percent, the
increase in private car population being offset by the decrease in Governm    vehicles; (d)
diesel fuel, which had been increasing at about 4 percentlyear, is projected to continue to
increase at 5 percent; (iii) the 21 percent anual rate of growth for kerosene is projected to
stabilize at about 10 percent, owing mainly to foreign exchange consaimnts and demand
stabilization; (iv) fuel oil demand wil increase at 5 percent based upon additional industria
capacity coming into operation and ineased capacity udization of eistng fuel oil consum-
ing factories after 1991; (v) barring sporadic relief activities, aviation fueZs consumption has
stabilized at around 71,000 tons (90,000 mi) in 1992 and is expected to grow at about 2
percent/year, due to the expansion of Ethiopian Airlins and other commercial flights; and
(vi) LPG demand growth, in the absence of the poposed project, is expected to immediately
absorb the increased refinery output of 12,000 tons/year pending a possible refinery expan-
sion/revamping, whose economic justfication is, however, doubtful. Ihe above forecasts are

D. Petroleum Pricing
2.11           The current pricing structre is presented in Table 2.6 below. Current prices
are compared with those in existence in January 1992 (before increase in transpottion tariffs
and the devaluation) and ex-refinery prices are compared with approximate import parity
prices. Prior to 1992, petroleum prices in Ethiopia had been extremely rigid: whereas the
world market price of crude decreased from about $35 per barrel in 1980 to $16 per barrel at
the end of 1991, product prices in Ethiopia remained at the same level.
2.12          In keeping with the TGE's shift towards a market economy, there have been
two price adjustments in 1992 alone. These adjustments reflect first, an increase In the
transportation allowance to distributors, to reflect the 70 percent increase in road tariff rates
effected in April 1992, and second, the currency devaluation from Birr 2.07/USS to Birr
5.01US$ on October 1, 1992, the first devaluation in over 20 years. The recent price
adjustments have resulted in the ex-refinery prices of jet fuel and diesel moving closer to their
import parity prices, while gasoline is subsntally higher and LPG substantially lower. The
price of kerosene (imported as jet fuel) is also substantily lower because of the direct
subsidy of Ec 34.6/iter provided by EPC (Table 2.6). This subsidy is compensated for by
higher margins n other products.
2.13          The highest taxes are imposed on gasoline while kerosene is not taxed, with
the aim of making it affordable to a wider range of Income groups. The significant price
25



differential between kerosene and other petroleum products, particularly diesel, increases the
potetial of kerosene being misused (eg. mixed with diesel). At curent taxation rates and
1989190 consumption levels, net revenues from petroleum taxation amount to approximately
Birr 84 million (US$16.8 million) consisting of Birr 118 million In total revenues (about 3.5
percent of the 1989/90 government budget) and Birr 34 milion in kerosene subsidies.
2.14         It is recognized by the TGE that there is the need for a comprehensive and
systematic approach to establishing a national petroleum pricing policy. Under the proposed
project, a comprehensive Petroleum Pricing and Market Structure Study  ill be financed to
recommend price, taxation and institutional rationalization with respect to petoleum prce
setting. The Terms of Reference for this Study are presented as Annex II.2. In particular, a
new LPG pricing policy is to be insthited based on import parity, taking into account
economic transportation and distribution costs, and linking LPG price to that of kerosene, a
close substitute product. The new LPG pricing policy, and the objective of substituing
woodfuels with modern fuels, is discussed in Section IV-B.
2.15         Ret  prices at the various geographical locations are, for the most part, a
fumction of additional transportation costs from the main depots at Assab, Addis Ababa and
Dire Dawa. Reta petroleum product prices for several locations are presented in Annex II.3.
E. Distribution Arrangements
2.16         Distribution of petroleum products in Ethiopia is handled by the four
inteaional oil companies Shell, Mobil, AGIP and Total. Products are supplied to these
companies by EPC on the basis of existng market share. The distribution companies compete
on large commercial contracts (generally on the basis of price) in order to increase their
market share, and consequently their allocation. Currently Shell has about 40 percent of the
total market share (including aviation gasoline) while the rest is distributed equally among
AGIP, Mobil and Total.
2.17         The distribution companies enjoy a market secure from any additional
competition (as per their distribution agreement with the Government). On the other hand
their financial performance has been hampered by the rigid pricing and labor policies of the
last few years and by the country's macroeconomic problems, which have affected in
particular remittances of dividends by the distributors to their parent companies abroad.
2.18         Tral portation. Inland transportation of petroleum products is mainly by
road. Products consumed in the Dire DawalHararge area are imported by rail via Djibouti
(para. 2.4). Road transportadon of petroleum is almost endrely (about 90 percent) handled by
privately owned tankers sub-contracted by the distribution companies. Only a small percentage
of the country's tanker fleet is owned by the distribution companies. Transportation costs are
the responsibility of the distributors, provisions to cover these costs being included in the
pricing structure (Cable 2.7). Petroleum transportation regulation with respect to vehicle
safety requiements, axle weight, types of vehicles allowed on different road sections, etc.,
are established and implemented by the Ethiopian Road Authority. However, the distribution
26



companies follow international standards (according to parent company policy) which are
often more stringent than current local standards.
2.19          The liberalization of road freight tariffs is expected to attract increased private
investment in this subsector. As a cautionary note, it should be recopized that foreign
exchange shortage and high import duties may continue to be bottlenecks to this investment.
Impact of freight tariff liberaization and duties on investment in tanker capacity will be
monitored during project supervision in order to detect and address investment obstacles in
this area.
2.20          Storage Capacity. Tbe Assab refinery has a crude oil storage capacity of
100,000 tons (about 30 days) and a finished product storage of 49,000 tons, of which 28,000
tons is for fuel oil. The distribution companies' existing storage/depot capacities and number
of days coverage based on 1989 throughput are given in Table 2.6.

2.21         The general view of the distributors is that ideally, a 30 day holding capacity
is necessary for all products to maintain a smooti distribution system. On ftis basis, sorage
capacity expansion is needed in three of the four major centers. A new depot of 16,500 m'
capacity is under constuction at Assab; the distributors had esimaed that 100,000 m3
additional storage capacity was needed to keep pace with the projected increase in consump-
tion in Ethiopia and Eritrea. Mobil is installing about 140 tons of additional LPG storage
capacity in Addis Ababa in conjunction with its new botding plant
2.22         Retai Oulets. Under the distribution agreement with the GOE, the
distribution companies are obliged to set up a sufficient number of retai stations thoughout
Ethiopia to ensure smooth and timely supply of petroleum products. Ihe distribution of the
number of retail stations by region is presented in Annex H.4. Stations are usually owned by
the distribution companies but operated in partnership with local entrne. Often road
conditions, and the transportation cost allowance in the retail price, act as a disincentive for
the distributor to actually supply products to a retail station.

m. THE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives and Scope
1. Project Objectives
3.1          The central objective of the project is to augment the availability of Ethiopia's
indigenous energy resources in an economically viable and commercially and environmentally
sustainable manner. The proposed project is designed to:
(a)   improve the present unbalanced structure of energy supply in Ethiopia by
increasing the availability of modern fuels (Section I-C);
(b)   support economic growth by expanding the supply of petroleum products
needed in the modern sectors of the economy (particularly for road
transportation, thermal power generation and agricultural activities);
(c)   contribute to mitigating the negative envirnment impact of rapidly depleting
peri-urban forests by inducing replacement of woodfuels with LPG and
kerosene in urban households;
(d)   develop the country's technical capacity to prome s and commercialize its
fossil fuel resources; and
(e)   contribute to poverty alleviation through direct measures and induced
economic activities. Direct measures include the facilitation of alternate
income generation opportunities for urban fuelwood carriers and the
implementation of a Community Development Fund targeting areas in
geographical proximity of the project. A sustntial contrbution to poverty
alleviation is also expected through the project's overall economic impact and
through the development of Ethiopia's remote south-easten region.
3.2          Potental negative environmental effects are expected to be minimal and have
been addressed in a specific Environmental Assessment report.
3.3          The project will also stimulate and faciliate private sector involvement in the
energy sector. Production at Calub will be undertaken by a share-capital company, with
expected equity participation of foreign and local investors. Transportaton and distribution of
petroleum products will be handled entirely by private operators.
3.4          The proposed project has a significant 3pilot' dimension and may be viewed
as the starting point for a comprehensive, long-term development of the country's fossil-fuel
resources. Production of LPG and other liquid petroleum products Is ondy the first step to
exploit the Calub 4eposit. A larger scale operation would involve the extraction and
commercialization of the deposit's sWubnti natural gas resources. The potential market for
29



natural gs use for power generatioa, ferilizrs cemen plants and other industri and
domestic usages Is substantial, and expec  to grow further as the economy picks up. Calub
gas reserves could supply arpund thr  tmes the current level of energy consumed by
Industry for at least 15 years. In terms of power generatlon, Calub gas could supply the fuel
needs of a power system six dmes the capacity of Ethiop's currt sysm  for about 15
years. Under the project, a stdy will be conducted to assess the feasbility of this larger scale
exploitation.
2. Project Scope
3.5          The project consists of a centr commercial operaion component (exploitation
of fossil fuels at Calub) and separate development and support components. Th development
and support components are an integral part of the project and are essentia for successfil
project Implemeation and susanability. These components are summaized below and
discussed in Section m-C.
Commddcial Operation at Calub
3.6          Extradion and Proc1  n Plat. lhis component involves a commercia
opeaion consisig of the ewacton of natwul gas, sepation of the associated liquids ad
rinjection of unused natural gas into the reservoir. An independent share-capital company
("the Calub Company") has been formed to operate the Calub gas field and plant facilities.
Tis project component includes the completion of gas wells, the construction of the plant,
camp, ancillary facilities, a 24 km road link from Calub to the Shilabo-Harar highway, and
Tecical Assistance to attract privte equity, supervise pt conuction and manag Ii
plant operation (paras. 3.15-20 and 3.29-37). I1DA would finance the foreign costs of this
Reonal Devopment Components
3.7          Road  ebilitatio. The Sabo-Harar road (571 kn) will be rehabilited.
This road is part of the main artery connecting Region V wita centra Ethiopia and northern
Somalia and although it is essendal for facilitating the tansport of Calub products, its
rehailitation will have a much broader impact on regional development in terms on job
creation and trade facilitation (paras. 3.46-4). Parallel financing for this component is
epected from the African Development Bank. The Government wil provide assurances
satisfcory to IDA for the financig of the Shilabo-Harar road raabbilitadon prior to Credit
Effectiveness. IDA would fiance teccal assistance for contract prqepration, review and
supervision of rehabi on. Inl equipment needed for manten  of this road would also
be financed by IDA.
3.8          Envronmenl Monitorng System and Comm ty Development Fund.
The ptoject includes an Enviomental Monitoring System (EMS) to monitor the impact of the
project on the socio-cultural habits, economic structure and eniroel conditions of the
concerned areas within the region before and during impleion, and in the early years of
comme¢cial operation. Ihe EMS wil provide the basis for the design and Implementation of a
Commiuity Development Fund (CDF), diected at Inhabitants of the concerned areas, to
address possible negative effects on the human evironment and complemeat the economic
30



opportuniies offered by plant installation and road rehabilitation (paras. 3.49-55). The EMS
and CDF are important for ensuring ptoject and envirormental sustunability. IDA would
finance the EMS and the TGE is seeling donor funds for the CDF.
support Component
3.9          Technical Assistance to he MiWstry of Mines and Energy. Technical
assistance (financed by MDA) will be directed at the following (parm. 3.56):
(a,    Supporting a Project Implementadon Task Force (PT) resposible for
coordinafing, supervising and reportng on the various project components;
and
(b)   Stengthening MME's capacity to promote private and joint venure participa-
Ion in petroleum exploration and development in Etpia.
3.10         Market Support and Interhtel Substitution. As LPG from Calub will result
in a four-fold increase in national LPG supply, the Project will support iniatives to acceerate
market absorption by promoting the use of LPG in urban centers, and ensure product safety.
IDA would finance technical assistance to develop a safe, and relible LPG market
infrastructure (para. 3.57).
3.11         Povert Alleviaon. The project includes a program to support diversification
of income generation sources for urban fuelwood carriers through a Fuelwood Carrier Credit
Schm  (FCCS). This will allow the project to address a social issue which has a logical
linkage tO the energy sector. The component will develop and implement a credit-cum-training
program targeting fuelwood carriers, mainly poor urban women, likely to be displaced by the
increased supply of modern domestic fuels (paras. 3.58-62). This component would be
fiaced through a Dutch Government grant.
3.12         Studies. Three studies will be undertaken under the project, namely:
(a)    Petrolum Prlicing and Mrket  ructure: This Study would assist the
Government in enhancing efficiency through reforms in pricing policy refom
and procuream  and distribution practices in the petroleum subseutor (para.
3.6(a)). The study would be financed by IDA.
(b)   Electrifiaion of selected urban centers around Calub: This Study will
evaluate the potential of supplying electricity from Calub to the district of
Gode, the regional capital, and other local urban ceers (para. 3.63 (b)). Ihe
study would be financed by BELPA.
(c)    Second Phase Explitation of Calub deposit: This Study will analyze the
market potential, technical easibility and economic viability of the
commercialization of Calub's natural gas resources (para. 3.63 (c)). The study
would be financed by IDA.
3.13         Changes In Reultory Enviment will be undertaken under the proposed
project to ensure project sustinability, and are discussed in para 3.64.
31



B. Project Beneficiaries
3.14         The Project's credit beneficiaries are: the Calub Company (for the commercial
operation at Calub); the Ministry of Mines and Energy (for supportng the PrIP, for
implementing the TA to strengthen the promotion of petroleum exploration and
commercialization, for Implementing the LPG market support component and for the
execution of the three studies); the regional Goveanment of Region V (for monitoring and
supporting the execution of the ENIS); the ERA (for the implementation of the Shilabo-Harar
road rehabilitation and maintenance); and the Women's Affairs Coorditng Department
(WACD) of the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (for coordinaig the Fuelwood Carrier
Credit Scheme component). The organizational structure of the MME has already been
described in Section I-F. The structure of the other three IDA Credit Beneficiaries (the Calub
Company, ERA and the Regional Govermnent of Region V) is descried in the following
paragraphs. The Dutch Government will fund the Fuelwood Carrier Credit Scheme (FCCS)
component. The WACD's orional structure is discussed in the FCCS Report on file,
and summaized below.
1. The Caku Company
3.15         The Calub Company has been established as an independent, share-capital
company to manage and operate the gas extracdon and processing plant at Calub. This
company wil function as a purely commercial, profit-oriented entity. It is expected to sel its
products at the Calub factory gate to private distribution companies operating in Ethiopia.
3.16         The Government welcomes the participation of domestic and foreign private
capital In the Calub Company and is undertakig a campaign to inialy offer at least 35
percent of the company's equity to the private sector. This process is being aided by the
Government's overall economic policy reforms which are beiLr supported by the Bank and
the donor community. These efforts are reflected in the new Investment Code of May 1992,
refiorms in exchange and interest rate policy (to reflect market conditions and inflation rate),
and deregulation in road freight tariffs. The new Investment Code, governig companies
registered under the Commercial and Public Enterprises Proclamations, outlines tax
incentives, protection against nationalization and laws concening the expatration of profits,
dividends, royalties, etc., associated with foreign capital. The national Labor Code has also
been reformed and is more responsive to the inte  of capitl than the previous one, which
was considered excessively biased in favor of labor.
3.17         Private sector involvement in the petroleum sub-sector is, however, still
hampered by competition for international investment capital (particully from the oil-rich
fields in the former Soviet Union), by negative experiences of the private sector under
previous regimes in Ethiopia, and by past state control of almost all entaprises in the modern
productive sector. In addition to financial investors, other potential investors in the Calub
Company include the international petroleum companies Shell, Mobil, AGIP and Total,
presently responsible for the distribution of all petroleum products in Ethiopir.
32



3.18         In the context of the proposed project, specific measures have been taken
durig project preparation to attract private participation in the Calub Company. Ihese
measures Include:
(a)    Technical Assistance, financed through project preparation funds (PPF), has
been provided to the TGEWIME to draw up the corporate and legal structure
of the Calub Company so as to ensure the Company's managerial, operational,
administrative and financial autonomy. This assistance was provided through
an international management consultancy firm and further supported by an
international merchant banker. The Company has been registered as a share-
capital company under Ethiopia's Commercial Code (rather than under the
State Enterprise proclamation), and its Board of Directors and General
Manager have been appointed. The Company's shares are to be promoted for
sale to the private secor. The appointment and/or replacement of the
company's senior management will conform to principles of professional
experience and competence and be subject to IDA and Borrower approval.
(b)    The MME has hired a qualified local firm to promote the Company to the
domestic and international private investor commwnity. A Prospectus has been
prepared which addresses the critical comfort factors required to attract
private investment. These factors include:
*     Engaging international expertise In Calub plant construction,
operations, management of the Company.
*     Institutng transparent pricing policies, particularly for LPG but also
for other petroleum pioducts, which are in accordance with the
principles of economic efficiency (Part IV-B). Non-distorting, market
based prices will provide the incentives necessary to encourage private
investment in trucking capacity, botting plants and distribution
networks, investment which is essentia for the project to be
successful.
3.19         These initiatives are producing positive results and there has been widespread
interest by private investors to purchase Calub Company shares. The Government has already
offered for sale 35 percent of the Calub Company's declared equity to private investors.
Foreip exchange availability for the repatration of dividends by foreign investors would be
assured under existing Government laws and the Improved availability of foreign exchange in
the country.
3.20         The Calub Company will also isue invitations to bid for a performance-based
operations and management contract, as defined in para. 3.37(b), acceptable to IDA. Ihe
signing of the contract will be a condition of Credit Effectiveness. This cost would be funded
oy IDA under the Calub Company TA component.
33



2. The Etldopian Road Authority
3.21         'he Ethiopian Road Authority (ERA), under the Mnistry of Public Works &
Urban Development (MOPW & UD), is responsible for planning, design, construction,
administraion and maintenance of Ethiopia's roads, including rural roads.
3.22         Under the ERA General Manager, there are a number of tecnical and
administrative divisions. The Chief Engineer is responsible for both the Rural Roads Division
and the Operations Division. The Rural Roads Division uses both machi  intensive and labor
intensive techniques for construction and maintenance of the rural roads. The Operations
Division is responsible for maintenance and constr ction of main roads mainly through force
account and for contract administration. The Road Construction SeWtlon under the Operations
Division undertakes construction by force account. The quality of work is generally good, but
the force account operations are vulnerable to shortages of spare parts and construction
materis. At present, there are 10 brigades comprising of five gravel brigades, four asphalt
brigades and one bridge brigade. Each brigade is headed by a project manager, and is a self
contained construction unit consisting of engneers, technicians, operators, clerks, skldled and
unskilled aborers, equipment, workshop/stores, laboratory and office facilities necessary to
fiouon efficiently in the field. Ihe Road Maintenance Depamn  supevises all mainance
opeations Implementd by the eight districts, headed by the District Managers. The Rural
Road Department is responsible for construction and maintenance of low cost, low standard,
unclassified roads and should be the key institon for promoting the rural roads sub-sector.
3.23         Planming and Flnancing. The Planning and Programming Division (PPD) in
ERA is responsible for road planning and for the preparation of budgets and road sector
programs. Expenditures on road maintenance are financed from the recurrent budget. Capital
expenditures for road construction are financed mainy from exten  sources. In the 1988/89
fiscal year, an Increase in the budget for maintenac brought the allocation up to a level
which would enable the Government to keep its total road network in a reasonable condition.
Tlis was maiained in 1989/90 but declined somewhat in 1990191. The lack of foreign
exchange to purchase new equipment and spare parts for the aging equipment fleet, represents
a more serious problem.
3.24         The revenue generated from road user charges increased from Birr 85.3
million 1982/83 to Birr 230.3 million in 1990/91 with an average annual growth of rate of
6.6 percent. In the same year, total Government expenditures on roads were about Birr 77
million, spread about equally between road maintenance and road construction; the share for
rural road construction was about 32 percent of all investments in roads. While the revenues
generad are considered to be sufficient to cover fnding needed for road maintane, it is
Important that these fund be allocated appropriately.
3.25         Road Enginering and Construction Supervision. ERA is responsible for all
detailed engineing and contract administration for new road construction. ERA has its own
Contracts Admiistration Department. Detailed engineering is sdll performed by the Transport
Construction and Design Enterprise (TCDE) despite the transfer of responsibility for design
and supervision work back to ERA. Although ERA has qualified technical staff, their capacity
and ability may need to be strengthened for the additional workload required in dealing with
contracts awarded under ICB. For that reason, although the design of the main civil works
34



component will be carried out by ERA, additional support will be provided, as required, by
experienced inteional consultants for design review and construction supervision. Actual
contrc adminisation wfll be carried out by ERA itself.
3. The Government of Rqeon V
3.26         Proclamation No. 7/1992 establishes regional governments and empowers
each one to establish, direct and supervise social and economic development, prepare its own
budget, ad collect revenue and taxes. The Regional Govenment of Region V is still in the
process of formation, and its o onal structre is not finalized yet. Technical assist
in institution building is expected, inter alia, from the UNI)P.
3.27         The Regional Governent of Region V wil be the beneficiary of IDA Credit
for the Eviroanmental Monitoring System components of the proposed project. Although these
components will be autonomously managed by specific Project Units (Section M.F), these
units wil report to a Steering Committee comprising the Ministry of National Resources
Development and Enirm ental Protection, the regional Government of Region V, and local
repr.senatives of governent instions dealing at the regional level with health, education,
environmen, agriculture, planning and energy.
4. The Women's Affairs Coordinating Department (WACD)
3.28         The WACD, In the Ministy of Labor and Social Affairs, was established in
1990 to enhance the empowerment of women through education, training and employmen
The duties and responsbilities of the WACD Include collaborating with the Government and
non-governmental and international organizations to secure assistance for urban and nura
women to facilitate their access to credit, fertilizer, and land use and ownship. The WACD
has two divisions responsible for research and documentation, and fllow-up and
coordination, respectively. These divisions are staffed with persoel qualified to carry out
the various functions of the WACD.
C. Project Descriptio
1. Commera Component
3.29         This component centers around the Calub Company and involves completion
of the exisdng wells on the Calub gas field, constrction of a processing plant and ancillary
facilis, and technical assistnce for prtzaion promotion and the supervision of
construction and init  plant opemion.
Development of the Calub Fildd
3.30         The Calub field has major reserves of natural gas in two reservoirs, named
Adigrat and Calub. The shallower Adigw Reserw* is comprised of two thick sandstone
35



beds, Adigrat A and Adigrat B, separated by a 25 foot layer of shale. Original gas-in-place is
estimated at 487 billion cubic feet ( ) for the Adigrat A, 211 BCF for Adigrat B, and
2.000 BCF for the deeper CAlb Sandstone Reservoir. Together, the size of these reserves
compares favorably with commercial-sized gas fields in the United States, and can permit gas
production at a steady plateau rate for at least 15 yearm prior to going into decline.
3.31         The Adigrat gas reserves are virtualy sulphur-fee, and in addition to their
main constitues of methane and ethane, they contain 3 percent propane and heavier gases, as
well as small amounts of natural gasolines. Within the reservoir, the pressure is sJightly above
the dew point4 of the natural gasolines; without immediate pressure manteace, the pressure
drop caused by production would generate In siu condensation of the naura gasolines,
thereby reducing their recovery from approximately 70 percent to 20 percent. Therefore,
reservoir pressure must be maintained if recovery of these liquids is to be maximized.
3.32          The Calub gas reserves contain only minor amounts of natural gasolines and
therefore, unlike the Adigrat formation, reservoir pressure maitenan  is not necessary.
3.33         The field has nine wells drilled, and at the time of appraisal, the tenth well
was being drilled above the Adigrat reservoir. A detailed description of the Calub field and its
development plan is presented in Annex 111. To bring the field into a state of readiness for
natural gas production and process plant operation, the existig nine wells need to be
completed, and production and injection equipment installed and tested. A consultant study,
defining the work program and estimated costs, has been completed and is available in project
files.
The Proesi  Plant
3.34         Only the richer gas reserves of the upper Adigrat reservoir (Adigrat A) will
be produced initially. The natural gasoline will be condensed from the production steam,
separated from the gaseous component, and distilled in a simple refinery to produce gasoline,
kerosene and diesel fuel. After LPG (butane and part of the propane) extraction, the
remaining light gas component will be re-injected in to the Adigrat reservoir for future
utilization and to maintain reservoir pressure. This approach is sophisticated, but commercial-
ly proven and would minize negative environmental effects by eliminating the need to flare
the unused natural gas.
3.35         The plant comprises the following steps. (i) separaion of the entrained
liquids from the gas stream; Cii) dehydration of both liquid and gas product streams; (ih)
extrion of LPG from the gas stream; Civ) distillation of the liquid stm to obtain gsoline,
kerosene and diesel; and (v) re-injection of the dry gas back into the reservoir. The distilsed
gasoline wil be processed in a catalytic reformer to raise its octane number from arnund 43
(RON clear) to the national specification of 79, or higher. The individual compnnents of the
plant are detailed in Annex m.2.

3.36         Product Yield. Based on the compositon of the Adigrat deposit, the plant is
designed to produce 21,000 tons/year of LPG, 16,300 tons/year of gasoline, 15,100 tons/year
of kerosene, and 13,100 tons/year of diesel. Total production is projected to decline from a
peak potent  of 66,000 tons/year to 48,000 tons/year by the 15th year and is dependent upon
optimal reservoir pressure maintenance.
Techniecal Assstance to the Calub Company
3.37         Under the project, training and technical assistce will be provided to the
Calub Company. Technical assistance will be directed at:
(a)    attracting, negotiating and finmng up prvate equt investment in the
Company. The services of a reputable merhat banker, on a part-time but on-
going basis, have been contracted to assist the management of the Calub
Company.
0)    supervising plant implementation and opeaftng the plant under a Supervision
of Implementation and Operational Management (SIOM) contact by an
internationally reputable firm (Annx 11.2). The contract would be in three
phases:
(1)    Phase 1: Completion of basic plant design, preparation of bid documents for
well completion (under a service contract) and plant construction (under a
tukey contract), evaluation of bids and selection of well completion and
plant construction contractors;
(ii)   Phase 2: Supervision of well completion, plant constuction, proJect
management and start-up assistance. lTis phase wil be performance-based and
conaein incentives to ensure at-cost and on-time implemaion; and
(ih)   Phase 3: Operational and commercial management for the first three years,
beginning at the latest three months before plant commissionig. This phase
will also be performance-based to ensure operational and commercial
efficiency.
2. weonal Devdopment Components
3.38        ITis component involves road rehabilitation (paras. 3.4648), an
Environmental Monitoring System (par. 3.49-51) and a Community Development Fund
(paras. 3.52-55).
General Bacgound
3.39         Region V, where the Calub gas deposit is located, is one of the least
developed regions of Ethiopia. It lies in the remote southeastern part of the couty on the
border witi Somalia. The region gets little rain (average annual rainfall is less than 500 mm)
37



but has a river, the Shebelle which has water all year round. Gode is the capital of the region
and its most populated center. Other main towns are Kebridehar, Warder and Kelafo. Official
stadstics place the region's population at 810,000 (1989) and Gode's population at around
2,000 (1989). The 1989 forecast estimated the region's population to grow to around 1
million by 1995. Census figures are believed to be grossly inaccurate owing to the nomadic
nature of the region's inhabitants. In addition, the influx of refugees from Somalia has fiuther
complicated the estimation of current population size. For instance, the Project mission to
Gode in February 1992 was informed that the town's resident population was around 10,000
in addition to which there were about 80,000 refugees from Somalia. Updated estimas place
the region's population in the 3-3.5 million range.
3.40         The region's population is essentialy rural and animal husbandry (camels,
sheep, goats and cattle) provides the economic base of rural life. Crop farming is negligible
owing to the lack of rainfall and inadequate water supply from water wells (which are scarce)
and the Shebelle river (which is in a rift some 300 meters deep). The severe shortage of fuel,
for supplying power and operating pumps, has made it impossible to obtain sufficient watr
for agriculture on a reliable basis. The only apparent non-farm activity is basically
governmen related although there is a significant informal sector involved in trading with
Somalia.
3.41         Ihe civil war in Somalia has driven large numbers of refugees into Region V.
As mentioned above, in February 1992 there were some 80,000 Somali refugees camped in
Giode alone. Due to poor road conditions, the emergency food supply to the region, being
carried out by international relief agencies, depends largely on air transport and is, therefore,
one of the more expensive relief operations in the world (para. 3.46). Ihis situation is
xpected to continue for some time to come and it is possible that a significant percentage of
refugees may settle in the area if food supply and economic activity improves.
3.42         Supply of water from water wells and the Shebelle can dramatically alleviate
the shortage of agricultural products in the region. A major constraint to the reliable supply of
water is the shortage of diesellgasoil to power the pumps and the electricity generator in
Gode. Presently, fuel has to be trucked from Assab, a disance of over 1,500 kn, making
power supply in God. (and the region) one of the most expensive for the Ethiopian Electric
Power and Light Authority (EELPA).
3.43         Gode has two, diesel-based power generators with capacities of 150 kVA and
100 KVA respectively. The two generators are out of synchronization and cannot be operated
simultaneously. The newer (1984) generator is usually the one in operation. For the past year,
disruptions in the supply of diesel fuel (from Assab) have resulted in power being supplied for
a maximum of five hours per day. Other villages/towns in the region are also deprived of
power because of fuel shortages and lack of installed generation capacity. A 250 kVA diesel
generator is insIled at Kebridehar, but is rarely operational due to shortage of diesel.
EELPA has plans to install similar generators in Warder, Mustahil and Kelafo.
3.44         The UNDP is in the process of assembling a comprehensive plan for the
economic development of the Region V with contributions from the African Development
Bank, PAO, UNICEF and UNHCR. The plan is to be comprised of initiatives to develop
agriculture and cottage industries, and upgrade the infrastructure and level of social services
in the region. This plan is several months away from being completed, however the UNDP
38



mission in Addis Ababa has given their unequivocal support to the Calub Gas Development
Project
3.45         The adequate and reliable supply of energy to the region will strongly
influence the development of Region V. The project will supply diesel, for tranportation and
stand-alone diesel operated power stations, pumps, etc., and kerosene, for cooking and
lighting. In addition, the project will study possible investment in surplus power generation
capacity at Calub and transmission lines and sub-stations to supply power to Gods. EELPA
forecasts peak power demands reaching 3.3 mega-watts (MW) by 1996 in the seven win
towns in Region V of which 1 to 2 MW wi be in Gode. A study wi be conducted under the
Project to confirm these demand forecasts and determine the optimal technical and economic
configuration of the electrification scheme (para. 3.63(b)).
The Project's Development Components
Road Rehabilitation
3.46         A specific study carried out by an Ethiopian consulting firm (BACTEC) and
finded undet the project's PPF, has identified the conditions and the need for rehabilitation of
the Shilabo-Harar road (571 kms). Such rehabilitation is necessary to permit smooth delivery
of petroleum products from Calub to the northern markets of Jijiga, Harar, Dire Dawa and
Addis Ababa. The traffic generated by the project is, however, expected to be small relative
to the already substantial commercial traffic on this road, which is the main axis connecting
Region V to central Ethiopia and northern Somalia. The economic importance of this highway
has increased further following the political collapse and widespread destruction in Somalia,
which has disrupted trade between Region V, central Somalia and the Mogadishu port. Ihis
road is therefore the only remaining stuctred trade connection between Region V and
livestock export oudets (Djilbouti, Zeila, Berbera and Baso). In addition, relief ctvivties In
Region V, to serve the massive needs of thousands of Somali refugees and returnees, have
been severely constrained by the bad conditions of the road, making it necessary for relief
agencies to rely heavily on expensive airlifts. The incremental cost of air versus road
uansportaton was estimated by the U.N. at US$2.3 million In 1991 alone. Road rehabilitation
would permit an expanded, less expensive cost of supplying the affected populations with aid
relief.
3.47         The BACTEC study found that at present traffic on this road averages 189
vehicles per day (of which 140 are trucks) in the median section of the axis. This estimate
was confirmed by a special count done by ERA in December 1992 which indicated an average
traffic flow of 209 vehicles per day (of which 153 were trucks). The traffic generated by the
Calub project will amount to 20-25 vehicles per day. Based upon an independent assessment
by an IDA consultant (report on file), an economic analysis of the road rehabilitation
component has been conducted and indicates an attractive rate of retrn (Section V). As road
rehabilitation and maintenance is essential for project success, the ERA will establish and
maintain the appropriate institutional and budgetary amangements in order to ensure the
contimed serviceability of the road. The ERA has already adopted a plan, acceptable to IDA
and the Borrower, to establish the necessary arrangements for road rehabilitation and routine
maintenance and provided assurances to IDA that it will implement such a plan.
39



3.48         Road Maintenance Equipment. Prior to h  o          of road
rehabilitation, two flying crews will be established and equipped (with IDA financing) and
will carry out the maintace of critcal road segmens. After the rad rehabilitation has been
completed, these flyg crews will be strengted and transformed ilto permanent
maintence units to be located in Degahbur and Kebridehar, respectively.
Environmental Monitoring System
3.49         The long-term impact of establishing a center of industria development in an
area traditionally underdeveloped, and historically the fulcrum of a delicate equilibrium
between settled groups and nomadic Somali tribes, will certainy be considerable and will
affect both the physical and human environment. The Calub Gas Development Project has
therefore been given an Environmental Category A classification, meaning that a ful
Environmental Assessment (EA) is required. The EA is summaized in Section MIL and is
available in Project files.
3.50         While the Environment Assement provides eenti baseline information
to guide the planning and implementation of the project, In the case of the Calub Gas
Development Project, it will not be enough. The fagility of the envioment and the derived
risks of unintended damage require a more sustained effort to keep in check the likely
consequences of the proJect. The Environmental Monitoring System (EMS) envisaged under
the project is intended to use the EA as a starting point, and to set up a careful monitoring
system capable to determine the impact of the project on rangeland, animals and people
throughout implementation. This carefl monitoring will make it possible to detect problems
in their early development (possibly, before they develop) and to identify ways to avoid or
contain any adverse impacts.
3.51          he EMS is presented in Annex m.3. Under the EMS, a socio-economic-
eirom ental planning and monitoring scheme will be set up and operated by a team
comprising primarily social scientists and rangeland ecologists. The pupose is to:
(a)   provide base-line information on the living conditions of indigenous people,
their needs and priorities, and on the state of the natal resource base under
present and projected levels of exploitation (this will build on the EA);
(b)   facilitate project implemenaion by docmendng social and environmental
changes caused by the project, anticipating problems caused by such "Wanges,
and identifying appropriate solutions;
(c)   guide the operation of a Community Development Fund provided to address
general environmenta and social concerns, take compensatory actions for
eventa damages, and respond to some of the needs of the communities in the
project area.
40



Community Development Fund
3.52         The new emphasis on local regional autonomy has encouraged local popula-
tions to believe that, after a long period of neglect, they too will soon be able to enjoy the
benefts of development, in particular through greater employmen opporunities and improved
Infrasucture and social services. Any development of the Calub resources cannot be divorced
from this new economic, social and political context. Area residents expect to see tangible
local benefits from the exploitation of what they consider their natural resources. Without
local support for the Project it is difficult to see how the Project could be implemented in
what has historically and geographically been a remote and unstable area of Ethiopia.
3.53         While it is likely that some local residents will be employed by the Calub
Company, and the rehabilitation of the Shilabo-Harar road will provide additional temporary
jobs to others, as well as eventually boost the regional economy in general, it is considered
important that local communities in the Calub area and along the main road, be offered a
wider range of development intventions. The establishment of a Community Development
Fund will ensure that people living in the project impact zone receive some direct benefits as
a tangible result of the Project.
3.54         The Fund will be available to fiance and support a range of locally identi-
fied, and community based and managed, micro-projects, and it will be identified with the
Calub Gas Development Project. The Fund will support three kids of projects:
(a)   small infnstucural projects, such as rehabilitation or construction of wells,
schools, and health clinics, which serve the community as a whole;
(b)   social projects, for the provision of essea  soci services, such as
corununity health and nutritional programs, training in adult literacy
(especially for women) and AIDS prevention; and
(c)   income generaing projects, including the provision of credit andlor small
grants for small-scale and micro-enterprises, preferably mn by community-
based groups.
3.55         Implementation of the Fund will be based upon the preparation of an
operational manual in the early stages of the project and its approval by the Steering
Committee. The fumd would be donor funded and its scope, mechanisms and organizational
arrangements of the Community Development Fund are detailed in Annex 111.4.
3. Support Components
Techi;cal Asitane to Omi MInIstry of Mines and Energy
3.56         During project preparation, technical assistmce was financed by IDA (under
PPF) for corporate stufcturg and registration of the Calub Company and for international
expertise to promote the company to private investors. The following additional assistance
will be provided to the MME under the Project
41



(a)   support for establishing a Project Implementation Task Force (para. 3.69)
within the MME for Project coordination and reporing. IDA financing wiD be
provided for computers, photocopiers, other office support, vehicles, and
training of selected staff mainly in accounting and reporting techniques; and
(b)    strength   of MME capability in promoting private and joint venture
participation in petroleum exploration and development. Assistance will be
provided to update the existing petroleum data base, to put it into an
internationally acceptable format, and to market it effedvely. Training will be
provided to selected persons in seismic data intpretaion and exploratlon
promotion. Detailed descripdon of this component is enclosed as Annex m.s.
Market Support and Interf,el Substitution
3.57         As explained in Section IV, the project does not entail any significant market
rsks with regard to the commercialization of non-LPG petroleum products from Calub. As
for LPG, a large suppressed demand exists for this household fuel. However, market
expansion will need to be prepared for by (i) an adequate increase in related inastructure
(LPG tankers, bottling plant, cylinders, LPG stoves, etc.); (ii) an expansion of WPG supply;
and (ii) the establishment of national standards, including safety sandards, for LPG. Itms to
and (Qi) would be undertaken by the private sector. Under the project, technical assistance will
be provided as needed to the MME's Ethiopian Energy Authority (EEA) to implement LPG
public awareness campaigns, establish national LPG standards, and study and promote
technology adaptation for local production of LPG stoves. National LPG standards, includig
safety standards would be established within 18 months of Credit Effectiveness. Terms of
reference fr the execution of the three above-mentioned iniatives are attached as Annexes
1m.6, m.7 and m.s, respectively;
Poverty Alliation Credit Schem
3.58         The incrased supply and competitive pricing of modern household fuels is
expected to have an Impact on the current fuelwood trade in urban centers and consequendy
on the lifestyle of those currendy engaged in this trade. Surveys conducted by the Bank
during Project preparaion indicate that urban fuelwood carriers ar predominay poor
women, without any assets, and belonging to the most destite part of society. According to
recent surveys, sixty percent of women fuelwood carriers are heads of household, live in
miserable conditions in crowded urban kebeles. With two thirds of them being illiterate and
untaned, they have few other options for earning an income. Their monthly income is
estimated not to exceed 50 Birr per carrier and their work is extremely arduous and
unhealthy: women generally have to walk 20-30 kms (round-trip) to fetch a load of wood on
their backs, typically weighing 20-30 kgs. As their activity is illegal, these women are targets
of harasment by forest guards. Esftimates of the number of women carriers is probably higher
than that indicated in officW reports. The World Bank Project Team assumes that the number
of 15,000 in Addis Ababa alone is not exaggerated.
3.59         As education and access to capital are the most critical elements enabling
women to escape from poverty, the project is proposing a Fuelwood Carriers Credit Scheme
(FCCS) directed at women fuelwood carriers in the urban centes of Addis Ababa, Dire Dawa
42



and Hara, wher modern fuels for domestic use, particularly LPG and kerosee, are beig
Intoduced under the project. The scheme would provide collateral-free soft loans and selected
taining to women fiielwood carriers orgaized in small commuity groups.
3.60         The FCCS is a pilot credit scheme, which reflects in its stunre some
successes achieved in this field such as the Grameen (Village) Bank in Bangladesh and the
Women's Working Forum, a cooperadve credit societ in India.
3.61         The pilot scheme will be implemented accordi  to a flexible approach, with
room for re-directing and modifying organiational arrangements and implementatin
mechanisms whenever required. The following approaches wfll determine the course of the
FCCS:
-     group mobilization;
-     step by step planning of credit interventions;
-     introduction of carefully selected skills, particularly those necessary for
immediate economic survival;
-     provision of family sustenance measures (stipend, day care, etc.);
-     involvement of governmental and non-governmental organizations, paricularly
hose active at the local level; and
-     training (pre-service and refresher) of project staff in fnacia and social
skills.
3.62         The FCCS objectives and mechanisms are described in detafl in a separate
document avaiable in project files. The pilot scheme will be managed by a Project Unit
which wMI be monitored by an inter-minisWial Project Steering Commie  under the overal
coordination and guidance of the Women's Affairs Department of the Mnistry of Labor and
Socil Affairs. This component will be funded sepaaely by the Dutch Government.
Studies
3.63         Ihree sudies will be undertaken under the project according to the
Implementaion arngements oudined in Section M.F. Tlese studies are:
(a)    Petroleum Pricing and Market Structure. This Study would assist the
Government in formulating rational pricing policies for petroleum products,
and defbinig cost-effective procurement and distuon policies (FORs
presented as Annex 11.2). Tne Study will make recommedations aimed at
optimizing the petroleum sub-sector; it wil begin upon Credit effectiveness,
and be completed by Apri 1995. Recomdaons of the Study, upon
Government acceptce will be implemented within 12 monts of completion
of the study.
O)      ectrificatoxn of selected urban centers  aound Calub. This Study will
evauate the potential of supplying electricity from Calub to the district of
Gode, the regional capital, and other local urban centers. Low fuel, capital
and operatg  os make gas-based electricity generation at Calub an
attractive option for regional power supply. An outline of the TORs has beet
discussed and agreed upon. TORs wiU be finalized by EELPA and agreed
upon with IDA within six months from the time of Credit Effectiveness.
43



(c)    Second Phas E xploitation of Calub deposit. This Study wUIl analyze the
market potent, technical feasiblity and economic viability of a larger-scale
exploition of Calub gas resources. Poible uses of nata gas include power
generation, chemical fertilizer production and ndustrid energy, which would
require the construction of a gas pipeline. The study wfll also make
recommendations for a policy and regulatory framework (taking into account
existg reguations) fbr gas commerizatIon An oudine of the TOfls has
been discussed and agreed upon. TORS will be finalized by the PlTF and
agreed upon with IDA by the time of Credit Effectiveness. Policy
recommendations of the study, once approved by the Goverment and subjeat
to availabilty of funds, will commence to be implemented witiin 12 months
of completion of the study.
Chag  in Regultory Environment
3.64         An enabling policy environment is necessary fr project Ysuability and to
attract needed private capital. To that intent, the Government has provided IDA with a signed
Letter of Secor Policy (LSP), agreeale to IDA. Among other Issues, the LSP (Annex 1.2)
addresses policies on the role of the private sector and domestic pricing policy for petroleum
products. The sector policy will be finalized after incorporating the recommendations of the
studies to be fhanced under the project (para. 3.63). With respect to pricing policy, the
Government will base all petroleum prices on import parity, incorporting the economic costs
Of port handling, strage, inland transportation and distibution (economic transaction costs).
Regulated prices for LPG would be set according to the structrr preserved in the Letter of
Sector Policy. The Government will also instite national safety and environmental standards
for LPG. The Petroleum Pricig and Market Strucre Study (under the CGDP) wil provide
details on the pricing and taxation structure for all petroleum products. In addition to

E. Financing Plan
3.66        'Me proposed financing plan is shown in Table 3.2. The proposed Credit
would finance 100 percent of the foreign costs of the following: (i) Calub Company
(US$66.31 million) comprised of project preparation (US$1.17 million), well completion
(US$6.00 million), plant (US$50.11 million including contingencies), Calub-Shilabo link road
(US$0.65 million), and technical assistance covering, training (US$0.Z) million) and a SIOM
conact (US$7.58 million); (ii) road maintenance equipment and other imports to equip two
ERA maintenance units (US$2.50 million), international consultancy requirements for contact
preparation/review and supervision of the road rehabilitation (JS$2.00 million); and (iii) TA
and Waining to the MME for supporting the PJTF (US$0.30 million) and for exploration
promotion (US$1.00 million), and to the EEA for LPG marketing promotion (JS$0.35
million). In addition, the Credit will finance 100 percent of the total costs of the EMS
(US$0.85 million).
3.67         The Dutch Government would fund entirely the Fuelwood Carrier Credit
Scheme (US$4.00 million). Financing for the foreign exchange required for road
rehabilitation (US$20.35 milion) is expected from the Afiican Development Bank.
Finalization of parallel financing for this component would be a conditon of Credit
effectiveness. Fundig arrangements for the CDF would also be finalized and, in the absence
of financing for this component, the TGE has provided assurances that it would fund it Ihe
TGE would finance 100 percent of aU local costs comprised of US$19.65 million equivalent
for the commercial component, which includes US$11.52 million in interest during plant
conuction accruing to the Government, US$6.65 million equivalent for road rehabilitation,
and US$0.85 million for the support component.
3.68         The Credit would be provided to the TGE at standard IDA terms. The
proceeds to the Calub Company (JS$66.31 million) would be on-lent at 14 percent per
m, for a period of 10 years including a 3 years grace period. Ihe Calub Company would
bear the foreign exchange risk. The execution of the Subsidiary Loan Agreements between the
TOE and the Calub Company, on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA is a condition of
Credit Effectiveness. According to the Petroleum Operations Proclamation, investment in the
Calub plant and facilities would be exempt from import duties. The TGE will make IDA
funds available to the other Credit beneficiaries (MME, ERA and the Region V Government)
as a grant under standard central budget allocation practices.
F. Project Organizational and Implemen        n Arrangements
Overal Project Coordinaton
3.69         An Organizadon Chart of project implementation and the Implemeion
Schedule are shown in Annex m. 10 and Annex m.I 1l, respectively. 'Te focal point of project
implementation will be a Project Implementation Task Force PIF) which has already been
established withi the MME. The PITF will utilize services and experise available inside and,
as needed, outside MME. Outside the MME, it will liaise dfrecty with the Calub Company
46



(for the implementation of the Calub plant), the Regional Government of Region V (for the
EMS and the Community Development Fund), the Ethiopia Road Authority (for the Harat-
Shilabo-Calub road rehabilitation and maintenance), and with the Women Affairs
Coordination Department (WACD) of the Mnisty of Labor and Social Affairs for the
Fuelwood Carrier Credit Scheme. As a condition of the Credit, the PITF and all Project Units
must remain adequately staffed during project implemneniation with key personnel whose
qualiftcations are satisfactory to IDA and the Borrower.

Enterprise. The rehabilitation work will be separated into four contracts for the concuret
rehabilitation of the seMn Harar-Jijiga, Jijiga-DegAbur, Deghbur-Kebridehar and
Kebridehar-Shilabo. It is expected that contractor mobilization will be completed by
September 1995. On this basis, completion of road rehabilitation would be achieved by
December 1997, six months after Calub plant commissioning. Implemeon of rehabilition
will be designed so that the sub-segments reqiing greater rebablitation will be implemen_td
first. Prior to road rehabilitaton two flying crews from the ERA Dire Dawa Section wIll be
established and equipped with machinery provided under the project (qipment list in IDA
consultnt report on file). Equipment is expected to be procured by the end of June 1995. The
two crews will be responsible for mantning the road sections not rehabilitated yet. After
rehabilitation is completed, the two flying crews will be strenthened and transformed into
permanent maintenance units, to be located in Degahbur and Kbridehar, respectively.
Technical Asistan  to BRA for contracts preparations and supervision of rehabilita
design and implemention will be provided under the Credit and is esdmated at about 200
manlmonths.
EnyfromeuiW MoItoring Systm
3.77        The EMS would be an ongoing acdvity for the duration of the project and t
will require specialized pernel stationed in the field. A special Monitoring Unit will be
established with responsibility for overall coordination and for the direct implementation of
the ES's soceconomic component, while SERP would be sub-contracted for the natural
resources component. The Monitoring Unit would be adequately staffed, with key peraomel
whos qalifica  are satisfactory to IDA and the Borrower. The Unit woud be attached to
the office of the Commuty Development Fund as this would allow the sharing office spa
and equipment, and facilitate tfe monioring of CDF activities. Ihis arrangement would also
permit easy access to the Adviser who will assist both the CDF and the Monitoring Unit. Ihe
EMS's Mitoring Unit is expectd to be established and begin work by end of June 1995.
Cmnt   Devepment   d
3.78        The Fund wil be managed by a smal Coordination Unit (CU) established and
stafed for that specific purpose. The CU will be insttutionally linked to a Steering
Committee within the Regional Government of Region V, which will ensure adequawte staffing
during project implemenaion with key personnel whose quaifications are satisfactory to IDA
and the Borrower. Ihe Stering Commiee will be comprised of the Ministry of National
Resource Development and Environmental Protection, the PITF, the Regional Govemnt,
and loca repre      of government institutions dealing at the regional level with heath,
education, environment, aicultre, planning and energy. The Stering Committee will meet
quaredy to oversee the workings of the Fund, approve project requests over the CU's
approved financia authority for projects, and review work progams.
3.79        The Coordbition Unit will consist of a Unit Manaer, a Range Ecologist or
Social Scientist, a Wore's Afis  Officer, an Accountant and a Secretary. In addition, the

cost-effectiveness of locally manufactured LPG stoves, safety record of LPG
use, and the speed at which the market is able to conme Calub LP
production. The following should be the imple on status at the time of
the MTR: (i) LPG stove development progam fized and work underway;
and (i) national LPG standards established. Prospects for the import or local
manufacture of LPG stoves, cylinders and rdeed infrastructure would also be

3.91         Well Completon. The work program for well completion has beean prepared
by Triton International Inc. (cosltant report in Project files). Utllizing the Triton report as
the Terms of Reference, the Calub Company, assisted by the SIOM (Phase 1) consultant, will
prepare tender documets for completion of the wells in the Calub field. The Calub Company
will ensure that invitations to bid for well completion are issued within six months of Credit
Effectiveness. A service contract for well completion will be awarded following ICB
procurement procedures. Included in the tender documents wfll be the option for bidders to
lease either or both of the two drilling rigs presently in Ethiopia rather thn mobilizing more
costly equipment from abroad. An independent assessment of the condition of the rigs, and
the terms and conditions for their lease would be incorporated int the bidding documents.
Well completion costs are estiated at US$7.0 million and IMA wll finance 100 percent of
foreign costs, estimated at US$6.0 million.
3.92         Plant Prcuemen. 'he Calub plant, involving detailed design engineerig,
gas processing, liquids separation and treatment, recompresion ad re-injection of gas, power
generation for plant and support services, storage facilities, control room, and housmg and
camp facilities will be implemented under a turnkey contra  To the extent possible, the use
of skid-mounted modular equipment will be maximized. lhe SIOM consultant will assist the
Calub Company in the selection of the plant construction contractor. The Calub Company wil
ensure that invitations to bid for the burnkey contract are issued wihinD six months of Credit
Effectiveness. The turnkey contractor will be selcted through ICB to provide licensed
technology (where applicable), process design, detaied engineering, pocrement, Inspection,
field assembly and constuction, commissiog and start-up. The contractor wil provide
appropriae mecbanical g antees and process performance g  . Tbis urn-key, skdd-
mounted modular arrangement would reduce field construction dme by about 24 months,
reduce cost of project management and construction supervison, and facilitate single point
responsibility for all the major jobs involved. This contract value is esmated at around
US$56.39 million and IDA will finance 100 percent of the foreign costs, estmated at
US$50.11 million.
3.93         Ciiv Works. In view of the relatively small value of this work, foreign
bidders are unlikely to be interested in this package. Therefore, the construction of the Calub-
Shilabo link road will be contracted under LCB as there are a number of qualifled domestic
firms who can execute this contract below international prices. Costs are esdmated at US$1.0
million and IDA wil fiance 100 percent of the foreign costs, esmated at US$0.65 million..
3.94         Other Conslay Services for the Calub Company. Odter consultancy
services for the Calub Company wfll be contracted following IDA guddelines for tle selection
of consultants.
3.95         Road Rebabilittion. IDA wiUl finance initial equipment needed for road
maintenance according to ICB procedures (US$2.5 million). IDA will alo finace consultants
required for preparation of bidding documents for road rehabilitation, evaluation of bids,
contractor selection, and supervision of contract implementation inaccordance with IDA
guidelines for the selection of consultns (US$2.0 million). Detailed design of the
56



rehabilitation work required will be undertaken by the Transport Construction and Design
Enterprise of the Ethiopian Road Authority. Actual road rehabilitation contracts will be
financed through parallel financing expected from the African Development Bank, according
to its procurement guidelines.
3.96         EMS. Consultancy services will be contracted in accordance with IDA
guidelines for the selection of consultants (US$0.85 million).
3.97         LPG Market Support. Consultancy services will be contracted in accordance
with IDA guidelines for the selection of consultants (US$0.35 nillion).
3.98         Studies. Consultants for the two IDA-funded studies included in the project
wil be financed in accordance with IDA guidelines for the selection of consultants.
3.99         General Provisions. Domestically manufactured goods or equipment procured
under ICB would be granted a margin of preference of 15 percent or custom duties as
applicable to non-exempt imports, which ever is lower. To the extent practical, contracts for
goods wiUl be grouped into bid packages estimated to cost the equivalent of US$500,000 or
more. With respect to IDA financed components, all tender documents for goods worth
US$200,000 or more would be subject to IDA review prior to distribution to bidders. All
contracts worth US$200,000 or more would be submitted to IDA for review prior to
signature. It is estimated that about 97 percent of goods, equipment and construction costs
financed by IDA would be procured following ICB procedures and that over 90 percent would
be subject to prior review.

one of the parmeters on which the Operational Management Team performance will be
evaluated. Ihe Calub Comany will submit to IDA a suitable annual Trainig Plan at the
beginnDng of each fiscal year.
3.105        MME. Selective training will be provided to the PITF, particularly in
accountng and reporting, so that accurate Project reports are made available to IDA on a
timely basis. Costs for this training are estimated at US$50,000. Traiiing will also be
provided to selected staff in the MME in the areas of seismic data iterpretation and
exploration promotion. Provisions in the amount of US$150,000 equivalent have been made
under the Credit for limited overseas training in this area.
3.106        ERA. Taining programs within the ERA are already well established and are
being strengthened under other projetrograms. Specialized training which may be needed
for the Road Reabbiltation component, for example for conract preparation and supervision,
will be made available through the TA provided under the Credit.
3.107        EMS/CDF. Training needed for environmental monitoring and credit
extension/qualification etc. wiUl be provided by qualified ets to local members of the
EMS Monitoring Unit and CDF Coordinating Unit through on-the-job training.
J. Project Monitoring and Reportng
3.108        Overal responsibility for project coortination, monitoring and reportg for
the IDA finamced Project components lies with the Project Implementation Task Force in the
MME. Project implementation would be monitored direcdy by the Calub Company for the
Calub component, by the ERA Contract Administraion Office for the road rehabilitation
component and mainteace equipment purchase, by the Steering Committee for the
Environmental Monitoring System and the Community Development Fund, by the MME for
the Petroleum Exploration Promotion and LPG market preparation components, by the
60



Women Affaurs Coordination Department (WACD) of the Mnistry of Labor and Social
Affis for the Fuelwood Carrier Credit Scheme (FCCS), and by the PfTF direcdy for the
studies under the project. Although the FCCS and the road rehabilitation contcs are not
IDA financed, the WACD and ERA will provide the P1TF with regular reports (at least every
six months) to be forwarded to IDA. For the IDA financed components and sub-compones,
the Calub Company, the MME, ERA, and the EMSICDF Steering Committee will prepare
quarterly implementation reports and other pertinent information. Ihe PffF will aggregate
these documents and submit them to IDA in a single report Following Project completion
(that is, not later than six months after the Credit closing date or a later date agreed for this
puipose), the PITF would provide to IDA a Project Completion Report on the Project's
execution and inital operation, costs and benefits, project performnce and the
accomplishment of Credit objectives.
K. Acounts and Audits
3.109        Ihe Calub Company will have its fiancial statemen (mcluding project
accountsiSpecial Deposit Accoums, and Statement of Expenditures as specified in the Credit
Agreement) for each fiscal year audited in accordance with accepted audng stadards by an
independent private auditor satisfactory to IDA. The Calub Company has appointed an
independent audit firm eligible for bidding.
3.110        Audits for the MME, ERA and the EMS will be carried out by Government
appointed auditors in compliance with the country's statutes, according to general accounting
sandards and under TORs acceptable to IDA, and provided that these auditors are capable of
timely performance. The accounts of the Community Development Fund will be audited by
pivae auditors satisfactory to IDA.
3.111        EELPA, the main beneficiary under tha Energy Project has provided to IDA
its audited accounts for FY91 and pardal accounts for FY92. There are no outstanding audits
of other IDA credit beneficiaries under the MME.
L. Project Environmental Impact and Implcations
3.112        A specific Environmental Asesmnt has been carried out for this project.
The EA report is available in project files.
3.113        In summary, the proposed project encompasses sectors and issues which bear
important enmironmental implications, particularly:
(a)    The expanded supply of Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) and kerosene in urban
centers is expected to reduce fuelwood consumptn, thereby mitigating the
nss le rate of deforesion which is particulady acute in peri-urban
areas. Whle pen-urban forests are rapidly disapperng, fuelwood costs
61



represent an ever increasing share of an ura dwelleres budget. The amount
of LPW and kerosene Intoduced by this project is equivalent to about 400,000
tons of fuelwood per year or 18 percent of currt urban fuielwood
consumption. "Tis amount of wood represents a standing forest of some 6.500
hectes but can be obtaned on a sustnable basi, from about 40,000
hecaes of forest. Captuting the benefits of such a contribution to forest cover
conservation has been attempted in the economic anaysis (section V).
(b)    The environmental implications of bringing the Calub gas field into production
readiness and building the processing plant and ancillary facilities have been
addressed in the EA. Driling wastes generated from additional well drilling
and well completion are expected to be minimal and will be disposed
according to internationaiy acceptable pracdces. Similarly, polluti  contrl
measures per intenational industry standards will be incorporated in the
design of the processing plant and product storage and handling facilities. By
maximizing air cooling, the use of process water has been reduced to a bare
minimum thereby minimizing waste water fiom the plant. Also, by re-
njectng unused naural gas into the reservoir, hydrocarbon emisons have
been minimized. Waste water leaving the facilities will be trated to remove
entrained oil, control chemical and biological oxygen demand, and keep total
suspended mattr at acceptable levels. The EA has recommended a number of
sound indust  envronmental practices which wiUl be incorporated in the
design, construction and operation of the Calub plant
(c)    The long-term impact of establishing a center of industrial development, with
facilities, utilities, and irastructure, in an area traditionally underdeveloped
and historically the fulcrum of a delicate equilibriwm between settled groups
an nomadic Somali tribes, should be assessed. Socioeconomic repercusions
on populations living in adjacent areas may be exced, and it is unclear at
this stage wheer thee impact would be exclusively positive. Emerging
ewnomic opporunities introduced or accelerated by industriaization may
cause a departure from the traditional pastoral and agro-pastoral modes of fife
in the region. The project includes an Environmental Monitoring System to
assess the project Impact on the cultural heritage and socio-economic systems
in the concerned area.
M. Project Development Impact
CnDtrbutlon to the Bank's Country Assistance Sta
3.114        The proposed project is an integral part of selected initiatives ta are crucialy
important to supporting IDA's country srate  of promoting economic growth, geering
employment, and alleviatig poverty. The project will expand the supply of modern fuels
(from Indigenous resources) needed to support the modern productive sectors and mitgate the
reiance on woodfuels. This will contribute to mitigating the negative environmental impact of
rapidly depleting forests. The project also contains a significant poverty alleviation and
62



rapidly depledng forests. The project also contains a significant poverty alleviation and
employment creation dimension through its contribution to regional development and the
Fuelwood Carrier Credit Scheme. The policy reform content is consistent with that proposed
under the Structural Adjustment Credit and is designed to stimulate private sector participation
in the energy sector.
Contribution to Diversification of the Energy Sector and Ener Sowues
3.115        With the exception of hydropower for electricity generation, Ethiopia is
completely dependent on the import of all modem energy sources. The project would serve to
diversify the country's supply source of modem fuels in an environmentally and economically
sustainable manner.
3.116        Under the project, a study would help dermine the feasibility of a larger-
scale commercialization of Calub's substantial natua gas resources. f viable, this larger-
scale commercialization would represent a major energy diversification and make an important
contribution to Ethiopia's industrial sector development.
Contribudon to Technology Tranfer
3.117        The exploitation of the Calub natural gas deposit is the country's first
operation involving the exploitation of fossil fuels. The country already has expertise in oil
and gas exploration and refinery operations. New and complementary technology is expected
to be dircty transferred to the country, particularly through dire foreip participation
and/or through the SIOM services. Specific additions to the country's technology base include
gas reservoir management skills, operation of a modern gas processing plant and gas-based
power generation.
Contribution to Poverty Aleviation
3.118        The Project will contribute to poverty alleviation through direct measures and
induced economic activity. Direct measures include the facilitation of alternate income
generation opporuities for urban fuelwood carriers (under the Fuelwood Carrier Credit
Scheme) and a Community Development Fund targeting areas in geographical proximity of
the project. A substantial contribution to poverty alleviation is also expected through the
Project's overall economic impact, through the development of Ethiopia's remote south-
eastern region, and through the creadon of jobs under the toad rehabilitation component.
Conservatlon of Foreign Exchange
3.119        Non-LPG petoleum products made available by the project constitute a direct
substitution of imports amouting to about US$10 million/year at 1992 international petroleum
prices. This is equivalent to about 15 percent of foreign exchange spent on the import of
finished petroleum products and 10 percent of total petroleum imports (1989/90 import
levels). Although LPG is not imported in significant quantities, Calub production of 21,700
tons/year represents an import value (CIP Assab) of US$6.6 million (at 1992 prices).
Recurrent foreign exchange operating expenses are estimated at about US$1.2 million/year for
the Calub Company.
63



Contribution to Institutionil Development
3.120        The project will provide technical assistance to the Ministry of Mines and
Energy directed at strengthening its captcity to promote petroleum exploration activities by
private and joint venture entities. TA provided to the EEA will be directed to establishW
national standards for the use of LPG, which would rationalize and harmonize current
practices and enhance safety conditions for LPG use.
Creating the Enviroment for Private Sector Ptcipation
3.121        Ihe project beneficiary for the central component, the exUraction and
processing plant, will be the Calub Company, which has been created as a joint-ventur, share
capital corporation. In the country's present economic and political condition, private capital
is scarce but is expected to grow. The charter and corporate stmcture of the Calub Company
has been formulated by an international consultant to facilitate private participation as a
favorable political and economic environment is consolidated. Expertise is also being provided
to promote the company to the local and selected international investor community.
3.122        Under the project, proposed changes in the policy and regulatory famework
ae also expected to encourage expanded role of the private sector, and are reflected in the
Letter of Sector Policy (Anex 1.2). Ihe recent liberalization of road transport tariffs is
expected to attract private investment and additional trucking capacity needed to service Calub
requirements.
Faosting Interfuel Substitution and Mitigating Deforestion
3.123        The project will help move the present structure of urban household fuel
consumption toward a more balanced proportion of modern versus traditional fuels. LPG and
kerosene supplied by the project can potentially replace some 400,000 tons/year of fuelwood
consumption in an economically viable and environmentally sound manner. This amount of
wood represents a standing forest of some 6,500 hectares and can be obtained from about
40,000 hectares of forest on a sustainable basis. This is a significant contribution to the
TGE's efforts to mitigate the current rate of deforestation esfimated at a net of 200,000
hectarestyear.
Contribution to Regional Development
3.124        The project is expected to make a significant contribution to the economic
development of Region V, one of Ethiopi's least developed regions. Ihis will be further
complemented with actions (EMS and CDF) to monitor the impact of the project on the
social, cultural, and economic patterns of the regional population, identify positive and
negative project effects, help contain possible negative effects in a timely manner, and
complement the development opportunities direcdy created by the project.
3.125        The project will first of all contribute to regional development by making
available desperaly needed energy resources. In the past, the scarcity of reliably available
energy resources has been a major constraint to regional development. In addition, the project
and concurrent road rehabilitation are expected to generate a significant number of
employment opporunities and direct/mdirect economic benefits.
64



Contribution to Partiipatory Approacbes In Regonal Development
3.126        Through the preparation of the EA, EMS and CDF, the project's objectives
and repercussions have been explained to the local people. This will give them the opporunity
to understand what is planned, voice their concerns and identify solutions acceptable to them.
3.127        Villages and towns within 150 km radius of Calub and within 25 km on each
side of the Shilabo-Harar road have been visted, starting from Shilabo which is a possible site
for the plant township. Group and individual meetings have been held, and would continue to
be held periodically, in each center, first to expln the planned project and subsequendy, to
assess the changes brought about by the project. The Project's Environmental Monitoring
System will explore, togedter with affected groups, remedia measures for any evolving
negative project effects. These meures would be undertaken under the Community
Development Fund.
3.128        In the case of positive changes, the possibility to spread benefits to a larger
number of people should be joindy explored. The EMS will be helpful in understanding
causes, devising solutions and identifying opportmities for improving community welfre. As
special attention would be given to the concerns and needs of women, it is possible that
meetings with women might have to be organized separately or even individually.
N. Rationale for IDA Involvement
3.129        The latest country strategy paper on Ethiopia recommends a comprehensive
ergy strategy aimed at: (i) attracting the significant capital investment required to develop
the country's energy resources; (ii) improving commercial operations through revisions in
tariff regulations, restructuing the electricity and petroleum corporations, and increasing
private sector pardicpation; and (iii) improving the importationlprocurement, storage,
distribution and pricing of petroleum products. Ihe proposed project is designed to achieve
these aims in the petroleum sub-sector.
3.130        The resolution of the issues raised by the ESMAP study, partly being
addressed by the Energy Project (Credit 1704-EI), will contime to be addressed by the
proposed project by helping to reduce the country's enormous dependence on woodfuels, and
exploiting low-cost resources in an economically and environmentally sound manner. The
project will also assist Ethiopia improve its balance of payments by partally substituting
imported petroleum products with domestic resources.
3.131        IDA involvement is considered advisable for a number of reasons: first, the
longternm dialogue between TGE and the Bank would permit the estblishment of a
comprehensive sector strategy and a rational investment programi in a sector which typically
requires long range planning. Second, the importance of the energy sector in the country's
economy is substantial and has strong implications on the macroeconomic stability,
particularly regarding balance of payments and industrial productivity. The Bank is well
positioned to advise the TGE on the integration of macroeconomic objectives with sectoral
development strategies. Ibird, the Bank Group can play a role in creating an enabling
65



economic environment to attract private participation in the energy sector, through areeme
with the Government on sectoral policy changes (contained in the project) and regulary
arrangements. In its design, and through implementation, the proposed project iS apected to
break considerable new ground in expanding private sectr partcipation in nati ly
important commercial activities. The TGE is comnitted to this goal; the project itself provides
important techniques for achieving this goal by seeding, ftering and expanding privae
participation.
3.132        The project also offers a historical opportuity to foster development in
Ethiopia's neglected Region V. Through the combined establishment of a major industrial
facility, the local distrbution of its energy products, and the related infrastructure, paicularly
the rehabilitation of the main road which will allow the region to re-establish its traditional
trade links with Central Ethiopia and northem Somalia. Bank involvement will be beneficial
in catalyzing donors' participation in the co-financing of such a broad scheme.
0. Project Risks
3.133        As regards regional security risks, the situation has shown marked
improvements over the last year (since regional elections were held) and is no longer
considered a significant risk to either the construction or the operation of the Calub plant
While specific project security arangemns are envisaged, a crucial contrilution to local
stability and security depends on the ext  to which Government and project authorities will
be able to include the participation of local inhabints in the project through the creation of
employment, services, and economic opportunities. The perception that the project is bringing
concrete benefits to the local people would be a major factor in fostering stability in the
concerned area.
3.134        A second issue relates to the Government's commitment to market-based
policy reforms. The project includes initiatives to attract private sector involvement, and in
particular: (i) the registration of the Calub company as a share company; (ii) qualified
expertise to assist the Government in attracting private participation in the Calub Company;
(iii) the revision of current LPG pricing policies to provide incentives for private sector
involvement in the distibution of the product; and (iv) maintma    of a liberal road freight
tariff policy. These liberal policies are expected to attract the needed private investment,
pardcularly for the transportation and distribution of Calub products. As a cautionary note, it
should be recognized that foreign exchange shortage and high import duties may continue to
be bottlenecks to this investment. The impact of policy chaDges on nvestment will be
moniored durng project supemsion in order to detect and address investment obstacles in
this area. Similarly, tiough it is recognized that substantl private equity ownership in the
Calub Company may take some time to materialize, promotion of the company to atact this
equity will be pursued by the Government. Project design and Credit conditionalities have
been prepared with substantial aetion to this specific objective.

Techical RiWAS
3.135        Inadequate Reserves and Hydocarb   Compositio   he lare number of
developmet wells that have been drilled so far viruly eliminate the risk of an Inaccurae
assessment of gas reserves. Gas and liquid composition of the Adigrat and Calub layers have
been confirmed by several samples taken during well drilling.
3.136        InablUty of the Reservoir to Produe. As none of the exisfting wells have
undergone extensive production or inJection testing, it is unknown as to how well actual
production of these wells will match their computer simulated production profiles. This is a
common risk in oil and gas field development, and there is an abundance of professional
experience In dealing with this type of production forecasting. it is therefore unlikely that the
wells will produce in an appreciably different m er than was observed In their computer
simulations, but some risk of variation remains.
3.137        Producibility risks stemming from the manner in which the wells were drilled
and cased are more pronounced. The tecniwques used were analyzed in the Triton study and
needed remedial measures have been incorporated in the Wells Completion Program (on fie).
Potential production and injection risks are sufficienty well known within the industry and
efficient remedial techniques have been developed to overcome possible operational problems.
Risk minimization requires a caefl diagnostic evaluation of each weU during the completion
process. These diagnostic evaluations can be time consuming and expensive. Ihe same is true
for any resultig remedial work as it requires the presence on-site of sophisticated
istruments, materals and skilled personnel during the completion period. Project funds have
been provided for these eventualities. There is the risk however that problems more extensive
an predicted wil resut in cost overruns in this category. in the worst case, if a well's
problems cannot be remedied, replacement wells may have to be driled. These risks bave
been reduced to a minimum through careful computer simulation, but a residual risk
nevertheless remans.
3.138        Fre, Explosion, Natural Diasters. A complete evaluation of all avalable
meteorological records for the area has been undertaken and no natura disasters of
significance, such as earthquakes, tornados, monsoons, hurricanes or floods, have been
detected. Ihe specific risk of flash flooding following torrential rains is minimal because the
field is located in a well drained intefuvial area.
3.139        There is always a major risk of fire and explosion in a plant of this type.
Highly combustible gases under very high pressures are being handled in the immediate
vicinity of sources of heat and might, therefore ignite and subsequently explode. Moreover,
Calub products are highly inflammable and are stored in bulk on the plant premises where
they are subject to the dangers of vessel rupture and ignition. These risks are well known, and
plant safety standards and operating procedures well documented. lntrnational safety
standards, appropriate preventive instentation, necessary fire-fighting resources, and pre-
star-Up training in safety procedures will be incorporated into plant and process design,
particularly to acoount for the remote location of the plant.
67



ltal R
3.140        'Me main risk in this area is associated with the possible failure of maintaning
the Harar-Shilabo road after it has been rehabilitated. Establishmet of adequate insttuonal,
organizational and budgetary arrangements for road maintennce is a condition of the Credit.
Enviromuental Risks
3.141        These risks have been filly addressed in the Environmeal Assessment report
and are considered minimal. Ihe possible negative impact of improper disposal of drlling by-
products will be avoided through specific technical arrangements to be finalized during the
design phase. Similarly, gas processing technology will be :-usen to miniize risks of
spillage, gaseous emissions and other plant effluent.
3.142        Risks of explosion or other incidents deriving from improper usage of LPG
storage facilities, bottles, stoves, etc., will be minimized through a public awareness campaign
and the establishment of nadonal safety and qualit standards.
3.143        Possible adverse effects of establishing a large modern infastructure in an
area vulnerable to the disrupion of its traditional, but fragile, socio-culurul equilibrium, will
be minimized through the mechanisms of the Environmental Monitoring System and
Community Development Fund.
68



IV. MARKETS AND MARKETING
4.1          The market for Calub products, investments required to develop the market,
and LPG pricing policy are summarized below. A detaled description is presented in Annex
IV.I.
A. Market for Project Outputs
Non-LPG Petroleum Products from Calub
4.2          At the expected yield level of about 45,000 tons/year, gasoline, kerosene, and
diesel/gasoil from Calub amount to about 6 percent of national petroleum fuel supply and 13
to 15 percent of all petroleum product imports (Table 2.1). These non-LPG Calub products
constitute a small fraction of national supply and no special arrangements are deemed
necessary to absorb them into the Ethiopian market. Market statisdcs indicate sufficient
existing demand within the newly formed Region V (formerly Ogaden) and the province of
Hararge Crable 2.5). For this market area, Calub supply is expected to sats about 90 - 100
percent of projected 1996 demand for gasoline, 80 - 90 percent of the demand for kerosene,
and 30 - 40 percent of the demand for diesel.
[PG from Calub: National Demand Wstmates and Target Markets
4.3          Pending the further development of Calub's substantial gas reserves, LPG is
exected to be Calub's most significant contribution to Ethiopia's energy needs at this stage.
Ihe Calub plant is designed to produce about 21,000 tons/year of LPG, which would result in
over a four-fold increase in current national supply (from the Assab refinery). LPG is
typically used as a cooking fuel in households and commercial establishments (hotels,
rauns, hospitals, etc.). The high consumption levels of woodfuels, suppressed demand
for modern fuels, the fact that woodfuels are a commercal fuel in these markets, and their
geographical locations make Addis Ababa and the Dire Dawa area the logical target markets
for Calub LPG. Distribution to other areas, particularly in the north where woodfuel supplies
have been viualy exhasted, is also possible on an economically sustainable basis. The rate
of absorption will be strongly influenced by market development measures undertaken and the
institution of market-based pricing before the Calub plant goes on stream.
4.4          Historically, LPG supply in Ethiopia (excluding Eritrea) has consisted of
5,000-7,000 tons supplied to Addis Ababa from the Assab refinery. Suppressed national
demand has been estimated by the distribution companies to be in the 50,000 to 80,000
ton/year range with Addis Ababa alone estimated at over 25,000 tons/year. This potential
demand is supported by woodfuel consumption stadstcs, growth In kerosene consumption
(Table 2.5) and the fact that LWG offers considerable savings and convenience to consumers at
current prices (par  1.33) and will continue to be competitve at economic prices (Section IV-
B).
69



4.5         Tihe Ethiopian Energy Authority has estimated that woodfuel demand will
grow at n annual rate of 2.6 percent between 1990 and 2010. As urban populations are
expected to grow faster than the national average, annual demand growth for domestic fuels in
urban areas is expected to be in the 3 to 6 percent range. In the absence of an increase in the
supply of alternae fuels and assuming a demand growth of 3 percent/year, the LPG
equivalent of annual woodfuel demand by 1996 (first year of Calub supply) would be about
60,000 tons in Addis Ababa and 17,000 tons in the Dire Dawa area.
4.6          Substitution Mechanism. Switching from woodfuels to LPG is favored by
lower expenditures on LPG per unit of "useful" heat (even at economic prices) and by the
comfort enhancing and time saving attributes of LPG. Obstacles to the substitution include
higher start-up costs, limitations of using LPG for certain cooking functions, higher
disbursements per purchase, and, in the past, unreliability of supply. At the economic price of
LPG, including cost of appliances, LPG is expected to offer consumers considerable financial
and time/convenience benefits over fuelwood. Lower income segments, unable to afford the
high start-up costs (stove, cylinder, etc.) associated with LPG use will, however, be more
likely to switch to kerosene, which has substantially lower start-up costs than LPG. As LPG
supply expands, higher income consumers will switch from woodfuels and kerosene to LPG,
increasing the availability of kerosene to lower income groups and consequently facilitating
woodfuel substitution among this segment.
4.7          Market Development. Calub LPG is estimated to be able to supply some
200,000 households. Making this quantity available to consumers in the target urban markets
will require investment in additional storage and bottling capacity in the Dire Dawa area, LPG
cylinders, and tankers/trucks for bulk and bottled LPG transportation. Ihe project's success
rests to a large extent on investment in these downstream facilities being made by the private
disbution companies and other entrepreneurs. The government's LPG pricing policy, as
oudined in the Letter of Sector Policy (Annex 1.2) and the continuance of a liberal road
freight tariff policy, are expected to attract the private capital needed to expand and operate
the LPG distribution network.
B. LPG Pridng Policy and Impact on Interfuel Substitution
4.8          In order to ensure economic efficiency, LPG prices are to be based on the
import parity price of LPG. In addition, a rational linkage between LPG and kerosene prices
is to be established. This is necessary both in order to prevent distortions in the demand for
LPG and to eliminate consumer surpluses in the kerosene market.
4.9          A comprehensive assessment of all petroleum prices will be undertaken under
the Petroleum Pricing and Market Structure Study financed under the project. The study is
expected to be completed by April 1995. LPG and kerosene prices established under the
economic efficiency criteria summarized below will be fine-tuned by incorporating the
findings of this study, which will elaborate upon the determination of import parity prices,
provide options for linking the prices of kerosene and LPG, recommend suitable tation
policy, and determine the impact of economic pricing on consumer behavior and on the
70



financial viability of LPG producerslimporters (Assb refinery, Calub Company and EPC)
and the distribution companies.
4.10         When Calub production begins, the Ethiopian LPG industry will be based on
two producers, the Calub Company equaly and the Assab refinery in Eritrea, two or more
bottling companies, and several retafl agencies/oudets. As supply conain  are alleviated,
market forces are expected to set LPG retail prices at the various retail locations. The
monopolistic/oligopollstic structure of the production and botting industries leaves this area
more susceptible to price collusion and therefore may require some form of regulation. It Is
therefore recommended that retail and wholesale prices of LPG be temporarily replated
to reilect Import parity, taxes, and economic costs of transportation and dLsibution.
Economic Efficiency Critefia for LPG Pricing
4.11         In principle, the estimation of the economic price of LPG is straightforward.
If LPG were to be imported, its economic market price as an interationally traded
commodity should be set at the import parity price (IPP), CIF Assab or Djibouti, adjusted
for: (Q) investment in adequate port berthing, unloading and storage facilities to guaraee a
level of continuous supply that is comparable with the domestic (Calub) supply option; (ii) the
scarcity value of foreign exchange; (iii) economic costs of inland tanspoon to the target
market/bottling plants; and Civ) economic costs of bottling and distibution. This basis
establishes the benchmark wholesale price exclusive of taxes; i domestically produced
LPG results In a price higher than this benchmark price, then it would be cheaper to
Import LPG rather than produce it domestically.
4.12         The LPG import parity price for Ethipia may be derived by adding to the
FOB Middle East Gulf price, ocean freight costs for economic order quantites, amortized
investment costs for upgrading port and storage facilities, reasonable transaction (letter of
cedit, etc.) costs, and port receiving and handling costs. Ti IPP Is currny esmated at
$Oton CIF Assab.
4.13         The IPP, adjusted for economic inland t on  costs, and for the
scarcity value of foreign exchange (if there is a variation between official and market
exchange rates) would be the approximate transfer price between the producer/bulk supplier
(Assab refinery, Calub Company or imports) and the bottler/distibutor. This price would
provide the basis of the supply contract to be negodated between producers and distribution
companies. Adding to this transfer price the economic costs (Including an adequate rate of
return on investment) of storage, botding and marketing, will result in the wholesale
(regulated) LPG price, ex-bottling plant gate.
4.14         leomeded Pricing Structure. Based on the above discussion, it is
recommended that the regulated wholesale and retail prices be set according to the following
formula:
Wholesale Price     LPG Import Parity Price + Port Charges + Explcit Taxes +
Inland Transport costs to Bottlng Plant (Addis/DMre Dawa) +
Bottler/itribution Company Operating Margin
71



Retail Price -      Wholesale Price + Tames Of any) + TranSPOrtation Costs + Reta
Distribution Costs and Operating Margins.
The inland transportation costs to the bottling plant to be included In the formula should be
from the least-cost supply source. The above formula asumes that the official exchange rate
coincides with the market exchange rate available to the petroleum importers.
4.15         The economic efficiency criteria for pricing LPG assumes the unrestricted
option to import LPG at import parity prices. This, however, Is not yet the case in Ethiopia as
adequate port facilities do not exist and acual import costs are considerably higher than the
import parity price (Annex IV, Table 2). Since transfer prices between LPG producers and
private distributors are not to be regulated, the potentia exists for producers to raise transfer
prices eeping them below achi import prices) without a corresponding adjustment in
regulated wholesale prices and a consequent squeezing of distributor margins. This risk will
be minized by making iual or bi-annual price reviews and adjustments a necessary aspect
of the pricing policy. In addition, the distribution companies will have the freedom to upgrade
port facil;des (in Assab or Djibouti) and import LPG if this is judged to be their least-cost
supply option.
Derivation of Prices and Impact on Interfuel Substitution
4.16         Comparison of Economic and Actual (Current) Prices. Economic and
acual cost compaisons of LPG, kerosene Ots close substibute) and fuelwood for the Addis
Ababa market are summarized in (Annex IV, Table 2). The present regulated wholesale prices
of LPG and kerosene (excluding taxes) are below their economic values by about 36 and 38
percent respectively. Ex-refinery prices below import parity and variations between economic
and actual transportation costs and distributor margins account for these differences. The
insttution of economic Pices for LPG and kerosene will have a beneficial impact on the
objective of substituting traditional fuels (primarily fuelwood) with these modern fuels. Table
3 (Annex IV) compares the economic and actal price of LPG with corresponding prices for
kerosene and fuelwood based on Eusefuif heat equivalents.
4.17         LPGKerOsene Eoonomic Pricing and Impact on Fuelwood Substitution.
Comparison of the derived economic retal prices, assuming current taation rate for W,
and the actual urban market price of fuelwood, results in the following price advantages
(ower prices) for modern fuels:
(i)     Fuelwood is more expensive than LPG by 33 percent if stove
and cylinder (appliances) costs are excluded, and 13 percent if
appliances are included;
(ii)     Fuelwood is more expensive than kerosene by 77 percent if
stove costs are excluded, and 69 percent if stove costs are
included.
This suggests that the Implementation of economic prices for Lp and kerosene will still
allow these fuels (especially kerosene) to be competitive against fuelwood in targeted urban
markets where wood is a commercial fuel. The increased supply of modern fuels, or supply
72



response, as a result of economic pricing would, therefore, support the objectve of replacing
woodfuels with modern fuels.
Implementation of Revised LPG Prices
4.18         LPG Pricing. Actual road freight rates have already been stabilized at close to
their economic cost levels (based on liberalization in December 1992). These actual costs can
then be used in the LPG pricing formula. Distibutor margins can be maitained at their
curren levels until LPG supplies increase substantially, either through increased imports or
when Calub production begins (1997). Wholesale, retail and ex-refinery price increases can be
coordinated and negotiated between EPC and the distributors with the understanding that the
increases begin by Credit Effectiveness and the regulated wholesale and retail prices fully
reflect the IPP, economic transportation costs and current ditributor margins.
4.19         LPG-Kerosene inkage. Kerosene prices should Ideally be increased to their
economic levels in tandem with LPG price increases. A more precise sustainable price
differen  between LPG and kerosene, and taxation policy for the two fuels, can be
estlished incorporating the recommendations of the Pricing Study. This basis of price
linkage should be finalized by April 199S, (end of Pricing Study) and complete
implementation be achieved by April 1996.
4.20         The components of the established wholesale and retail prices should be
reviewed and adjusted bi-anualy in order to minize any distortionary effects on supply
and demand.

V. ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Economic Analysis
5.1          Least-cost and economic rate of retrn (EIRR) analysis was conducted on the
revenue earing/commercial component of the project, vu. the exuacion and processing plant
at Calub (The Calub Company). The component has a justiflable "pilot plant" dimension as it
is a "first-time" operation for Ethiopia and is expected to lead to a larger-scae natural gas
commercialization in the fitre. This larger-scale project will utilize the same gas wells and
producdon facilities to be fianced under the proposed project thereby enhancing the
economic viability of this second phase operation. The EIRR has been assessed under two
scenarios, the first (Case 1) utilizes the classic approach of valuing project outputs on the
basis of their import parity prices. The second scenario (Case 2) follows a more innovative
approach, rarely used so far at the Bank for such a type of project, whch attempts to capture
the environmental benefits of the project. Economic analysis has also been done separately on
the road rehabilitation component of the project. Details of cost-benefit analyses for the Calub
plant and the road rehabilitation component are provided in Annexes V.1 and V.2.
A.1 Extraction and Processing Plant (Calub Company)
Least-cost Analysis
5.2          Typically, assuming intenational standards and market prices, the Assab
refinery, processing imported crude, should be the least-cost source of LPG and condensates
compared with direct import of these products7. On tbls basis, the ex-Assab refinery
product prices should be as follows: LPG - $18S/ton, gasolne - $221Vton, kerosene -
$201/ton and diesel - $190/ton. With the exception of LPG, which costs substantially more
due to higher ocean freight costs and sub-optimal port facilities, acu  costs of imports (CIF
Assab) are comparable with these "typical" prices.
5.3          Acta ex-refinery prices (December 1992) are discussed in Section ll-D and
are summrized as follows: LPG - $156At. i, gasoline - $269/ton, kesene - $214/ton (ess a
$88/ton direct subsidy) and diesel - $198/ton. This price of LPG is lower than the price
($185/ton) at which modern, technologically efficient refineries seil LPG, and is not
correlated with economic production costs. In fact the price was $251/ton before the recent
devaluation. Obtaining LPG from the Assab refinery at the $185/ton price, and in quaiies
recoverable from Calub, would require major new investments. For example, production of
20,000 tons/year of LPG would typically require a refining capacity of around 1.5 million
tons of crude per year, twice the current capacity. Based on 1992 interntional prices ad
existing facilities in Ethiopia/Assab, the Import parity price of LPG is estimated to be
US$306/ton. This assumes optimal shipping quantities, and an opportnity cost of 14 percent

for investments required to construct adequat port receiving and storage facilities (Annex
IV). Imports of all major petroleum products are considered a cheaper option than revamping
or expanding the refinery. Tbis assumption is supported by refinery studies including a
recently completed World Bank study (pan. 2.6). In order to dermine the least-cost supply
souce, Calub production cost are, therefore, compared against import parity prices.
5.4           Comparison of the lined-out (3-4 years after plant start-up) weighted average
cost of the product mix produced at Calub, and the inmort of an equivalent mixture, are
summarized in Table 5.1 below. In order to meet the energy requirements of the target
markets defined in Section IV, LPG and condensate recovery from the Calub deposit offers
the least-cost option compared with the import of an equivalent mixture of products. Import
prices need to drop by over 50 percent before Imports become cheaper than supply fm
Calub.

Transportation 2f Calub Products
5.5          C(ost-efectiveness analysis was also conducted by Technip/BEICIP to compare
the cost of pipeline transportation of some.or all of Calub products to Dire Dawa versus
transortation by trucks/tankers. It was detemined that the cost of building a 500 km., 4
inch, underground pipeline would be about US$54 milion (80 percent foreign content). Truck
ransportation costs were determined to be about 40 percent less than transportation by
pipeline. Economic costs of road transportation were esimated by including investment in
additional truck(tanker capacity needed for Calub products, vehicle maintnance requrmeme
and support infratrcture, road conditions, and a contribution to projeced road maienance
costs for the Shilabo-Harar national highway.
5.6           Trucktanker transportation will be handled by private contractors and wil
have the added advantage of stimulating private enterprise whereas the building of a pipeline
would be essentially a joint-venture or government operation. Building of a gas pipeline
between Calub and Dire Dawa will be necessary at the time of a larger scale development of
Calub gas reserves.

Eoonomic Intunal Rate of Retun (EIRR)
5.7           Projet Costs. Project cost eates were based upon the basic design study
conducted by TechmipElCIP and are presented in Annex m.9. Cons and benefits are valued
in constant 1992 US dollars and include physical contingencis. A shadow exchange rate of
Birr 6.2 per US$ was used to convert local currency expese inorder to more accurately
reflect actual market condidons. The Birr was devalued from Birr 2.07/US$ to Birr 5.OUS$
on October 1, 1992, the first devaluation in over 20 years.
5.8          Development Costs and Product Sharig Aeeet. The approximatly
US$72 million already spent on well drilling are treated as sunk-costs and not included in the
valuation of the feed to the Calub processing plant at this stage. When undern, these gas-
field development expenditures had been justfied by the Government on the gas
commercilization potental of the Calub deposit; they may, therefore be recovered when ths
larger scale exploitation takes place. However, additional   of $7 million for well
completion have been included as investment costs for the Calub Company. Ihese wells
would be utilized for gasfiquid extraction for the proposed project and for any future large-
scale gas commercialization. Of the investment in the processing plant, about $11 million are
associated witd -wcompression and reinjection of natura gas after it has been extracted and
stripped. Reinje-don is necessary in order to maintain condensate productvt and this
investment will also permit the exploitation of naturl gas under a future, larger-scale project.
In additon, gas flaring is considered enviromentaPy damagi.
5.9          Valuatn of Project Benefits. Two cases Involving two basic approaches,
import parity prices and intefl subsWtution have been used to value project benefis.
Gasoline and diesel from Calub constue a straightoward substitution of imports, or total
supply expansion, therefore their values are based on import parity prices (IPP), CIF Assab,
in both cases. The economic costs of transportation from Assab port to the target markets are
added to the IPP to determine product economic values at the market The Calub *factory
gat product values are then determined by subtacting economic transport costs between
Calub and the target markets from these derived market values.  tPs for all Calub petroleum
products are based on recent international prices incorating World Bank forecasts.
Constant, average 1992 prices are assumed through the life of the project.
S.10         Case 1 (Base Case). In the base cae, LPG and kerosene market and plant
gate values are also based on their PPs as discussed above. Since LPG is not presendy
imported in any significant quantity, the IPP has been constructed' based on investment costs
required to upgrade Assab (or Djibouti) port facilities (tanker bertg, storage, etc.) to
handle LPG imports at the level of production expected from Calub (Annex IV).
5.11         Case 2. This second case attempts to capture the en  benefits of
deforestation mitigation by valuing LPCS and kerosene in terms of the value of fuelwood they
can potentily replace on a "useful" energy basis. Usefil energy is dermined by taking into
account relaive calorific values and stove efficiencies (Annex IV). As over 80 percent of the

fuelwood traded in the urban markets of Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa is itlegally harvested,
wholesale and retail prices do not include the high costs of replanting or even the lower costs
of improved forest management. LPG and kerosene from Calub could potentially mitigate a
substantial amount of the deforestation estimated at about 200,000 hectares/year. The
inclusion of these additional costs to the market price of fuelwood used in this analysis would
serve to capture enviromnental costs of soil erosion, carbon sequestration and bio-diversity
protection associated with deforestation.
5.12         Based on World Bank estimates, the cost of natural forest management,
discounted at 10 percent per year, results in an additional cost of EclOikg of wood'. This
approach leads to a substantially higher economic value for LPG and kerosene than the IPP
even though It does not incotporate the higher costs required to reverse deforestation, nor the
value of time saved by cooking with more efficient fuels, and does not give a value to the
comfort-enhancing qualities of the modern fuels. 'Me approach is sound inasmuch as it
establishes the economic values for LPG and kerosene which include possible environmenta
benefits to the economy. The EJtR obtained by this valuation determines whether or not the
provision of these modern fuels to the economy is a worthwhile venture. If it is, and LPG and
kerosene from Calub remnain the least-ost supply source, then financing the project is
economically justifiable.
5.13         Comparative 'Calub Gate" economic values under the two approaches are
presented in Table 5.2 below. Market absorption of LPG, as a percentage of production
capacity, is assumed at 50 percezt in Year 1, 75 percent in Year 2 and 100 percent in Year 3.

Economic Risks and Sendtivity Analysis
5.15 The project is particularly sensitive to cost overruns, start up delays, increases in
transportatisn and operating costs, and drops in product value and/or production level. A drop
in produo value could result either by a fall in itnational petroleum pries and/or a drop in
woodfuast prices in Ethiopia's urban markets as a result of reforestation or reduced demand.
Sensitivity analysis is summarized in Table 5.3.
5.16          Cost overruns will be minimized by adopting a urnkey conract involving a
skid-mounted design and having project implementation managed on a commercially sound
basis. Economic values used are based on 1992 world petroleum prices which are relatively
depressed and therefore the risk of a further drop in product value is relatively low. Product
yields are based upon reliable seismic studies and a recent gas and condensate sample taken
from the Calub-5 well. Project risks associated with the remote location of Calub have been
78



dealt with by including a road rehabilitation component into the project. Economic analysis of
this component is presented separately.

5.17          The exist  regional market can absorb all non-LPG Calub products as they
are produced. In the case of LPG, even though demawd has been confirmed (Section IV-A),
there is a risk that the market infrastructure will not be prepared in time for the complete
absorption of Calub LPG. Slower absorption (25 percent in Year 1, 50 percent in Year 2, 75
percent in Year 3, and 100 percent in Year 4) reduces the ERR by about 0.7 percent. A
combination of a 20 percent escalation in investnent costs and a slower pick-up of LPG
market absorption results in an EIRR decrease of 4 percent (Case 1) and 6 percent (Case 2).
5.18          Switching Values. The plant can cover its operating and fixed costs at a
capacity utilization rate of 62 to 87 percent in the first four years of olperation (during market
build-up and coverage for the Operation and Management Contract). This rate then drops to
59 percent, increasing to 81 percent by Year 15 at which time the condensate and LPG
recovery is 74 percent of the initial recovery level. Capacity utilization switching values are
indicative also of the flexibility of the Calub plant to respond to changes in product values or
operating costs. Ihere is an improvement in switching values if LPG is valued in terms of
fuelwood. The above thresholds are considered technically achievable.

A.2 Road Rehabilitatlon Component
5.19         As described in Section m-C, this componen Involves the upgrading of 571
km of the Shilabo-Harar road, to secondary road conditions from Harar to Kebridehar (477
ki), and to feeder road conditions between Kebridehar and Calub (94 kn). The economic
anaysis has been done to determie the break-even average daiy traffic (ADM to cover
rehabilitation and annual maintenace costs. Rates of return have been determined for a range
of expected ADTs.
5.20         Benefits. The main benefits derive from the savings in vehicle operating cost
(VOCs) as a result of road rehabilitation. "With and without" VOCs were estimated based
on present average speed of 25 km/hbour which are expected to increase to 35 km/hour after
rehabilitadon. Standard World Bank estimates of VOCs were assumed. Based on currt and
expected traffic pattns, the following traffic composition was assumed: tucks (2-axle) - 74
percent, tankers with trailers (including water carriers) - 10 percent, LPG tanker/trailers - 5
percent, buses - 6 percent, and light vehicles - 5 percent. Average VOCs fall from
US$1.260/km to US$0.879/km as a result of road rehabilitation, a saving of 30 percent.
Additional benefits will result from passenger time savings and facilitation of overall regional
development, particularly by reducing the current dependence on air transport to supply
rmt   areas with food and other emergency aid. Benefits a  also possible from improved
road safety in the hilly areas between Harar and Kebridehar. Ihese benefts are difficult to
quantfy, and fture projections are virtually impossible therefore they have not been included
in the analysis.
5.21         Costs". Rehabilitation cost estates (US$50,400/km) include 8 percent for
consultancy and 10 percent for contingencies. Annual routine  nten     costs have been
estimated at around US$1,010/k. i excluding ownership costs of equipment and US$2,520ki
If ownerhip costs are included. Analized paeodic mainteace costs are esdmad at
around US$1,850/kn excluding ommership cost of equipment and US$4,540/km if ownership
costs are induded. Costs used in the analysis inlude ownehip costs. Road maintenance

B. Financial Analysis
hmncal Structure of The Calub Company
5.23         Under the Project, the Calub Company will be formed under the Commercia
Code of Ethiopia to be responsible for natural gas and liquids extraction and processing
activities at Calub. This company is to be incorporated as a share company and will be
responsible for extracting and processing Calub natural gas, and selling petroleum products to
distribution companies operating in Ethiopia. Calub Company shaues will be made available to
the private sector with no limit to the extent of private paricipation. Assumptions and
projected financial position are summarized below.
5.24         Product Prices. With the exception of LPG, product prices at the Calub
Company "gate are based on October 5, 1992 retail prices at the target markets less all taxes
(plus Government subsidy in the case of kerosene), t aon costs, and distributor and
retailer margins. LPG is priced at its import parity price (under optmized ocean freight and
port facilities) less the transportation cost differential of supplying the target markets from
Calub versus Assab.
5.25         Investment and Opeat   Costs. As in the economic analysis, these are
based on the finalized processing scheme (end-September 1992). An Operating and
Maaagement contract, spanning implementation (supervision of design and construction) and
first four years of operation has been included, with costs during constuction being
capitalized and costs dtring operation being treated as opeatng expenses. These costs amount
to US$7.00 million spread over six years. Costs of well completion and gas re-injection are
included in the investment however, no charge has been assigned to the feed (as and liquids)
to the processing plant. Estimated investment costs per barrel of petroleum product are higher
than those for a typical refinery type operation due mainly to the high costs associated with
gas reinjection and the remote location of the plant. The high investment costs
notwitanding, the financial rate of return for the Calub plant remains attractive (para
5.29). This largely because of the large proportion of high-value LPG produced (about 30
percent of the product slate) and the higher factory-gate prices which the Calub Company can
charge because its proximity to the target markets result in substantially lower tr oaton
costs. The income tax shelter (for the first five years of opeation) and duty exemptions also
contribute to this attractive rate of return.
5.26         Intert Rate, Exhuange Rate and Ttion Poicy. The Commercial Bank
of Ethiopia recentiy announced its Interest rate structure (October 1992). Anmnal long-tem
81



iner .; rate for energy projects is 14 percent while interest paid to depositors for fixed
deposits is 10.5 percent. Interest during construction has been capitalized. Principal payments
begin Year 1 and interest payments in Year 2. ITe current exchange rate of Birr 5/US$ is
used, however projections are in current US dollars and assume an annual inflation rate of S
percent refletng conservative assumption of annual inflation in relevant western economies.
Purchasing power parity has been assumed whereby divergences In Inflation between Ethiopia
and capital suppliers will be reflected in exchange rate adjustments.
5.27         As is allowed under the Government's Petroleum Operations Proclamation
(No. 29S/1986) the plant and related equipment, vehicles, etc. will be imported free of duties
and any taxes. Ihe company is expected to enjoy a tax holiday of five years from
commencement of production.
5.28         Tranportation Costs. In the financial anadysis, road transportation costs tor
Calub products are estimated to be 10 percent higher than the rate for an asphalted road, e.g.
current costs of supply from Assab (based on standard Bank VOC estmat). This assumes
rehabiliton of the Calub-Harar road, which is a component of the project.
5.29         Key financial highlights are:
Financial Rate of Return (before taxes)        17.4 percent
Finanil Rate of Return (after taxes) - Approx.  14.1 percent
Pay-out Period                                 5 years
Net Present Value @ 10 percent                 $ 24.4 million
Net Present Value @ 15 percent                 $ 5.6 million
5.30         Flnandial Structure. Projected Balance Sheets and Income Statements for the
first five years of commercial operation are presented in Tables 5.4 and 5.5.
5.31         Financial Position. The projected fmancial position of the Calub Company is
dependent upon the debt:equity ratio (gearing) and the debt reyment philosophy adopted.
The company is expected to remain cash-rich, owing largely to its large depreciation expense.
It may, therefore, choose to adopt an accelerated debt repayment plan. In the financial
statements, principal payments begin in Year 1 of operation while interest payments begin in
Year 2. The high interest rate of 14 percent results in a net income loss in Year 2, however
the company's liquidity position remains strong. The company is protected from exchange rate
risks because its products are expected to be priced based on import parity prices.
5.32         In keeping with prudent financial policies and practices, the Calub Company
will maintain a debt-equity ratio less than 2.5, a debt service coverage greater than 1.5 after
the initial 3 years of operation, and accounts receivable below 90 days of sales. In addition, In
order to prevent the dilution of private equity through non-essential acquisition/transfers of
buildings, machinery, equipment, etc., annual increases in the capital assets of the Calub
Company, in excess of 5.0 percent of total assets, shall be subject to MDA approval (until
project completion).

THE TRANSITIONAL GOVERNIENT OF ETHIOPIA                    Addis Ababa, 18 Janay, 1994
MINIRY OF MINES AND ENERGY
To:
Mr. Lewis T. Preston
President, The Wodd Bank
1818 H Stt, N.W.
Waston, D.C. 20433
Subject:     Lter of Secor Policy for the Ener&=  Sector
1.           Afer severa years of politd  iability and civil stdfe, Ethiopia has Iiotiatd a
ptoes of transition towards a democratic political system and a mat-oriented economy. As paut of
th economic policy program adopted by the Trnsitiona Governmet of Etiopa (TGE) and
suppored by the donor community, a National Energy Policy (NP has been isued and has the
following main objectives:
(a)    To allviate problems encountered In the proess of devroment, supply and
utlizaion of eney;
(b)    To focus on the development and supy of vaious energy sources;
(c)    To maximize the utilizadon of indigenous energy resources;
(d)    To minmize wastge during supply and utlizadon of energy; and
(e)    To minimize pollution during the process of the devdopment, spply and ulzaion
of enery.
2.           These goals derive fom the preset economic and ener  supply conditions
summized below. Over the next few years, a compreesive fomalzaton of the country's energy
sector policy wiUl be aided, bter alia, by several studies and plnning work shops. As     for
policy formulation in the petroleum sub-sector is expectd under the poposed, IDA financed, Calub
Gas Development Project (CGDP). The stegies to be followed in order to achieve the energy setor
goa are briefly outlined below for the non-petroleum sub-sectors and deaborated upon for tho
petroleum sub-sector.
Geneal Baciground
3.           With a popuaton of over 50 milion, Ethiopia is the second most populous country in
Sub Sabaran Afnica and, with a per capita income of US$120 pdor to the dvauation of October
1992, one of the poorst counries D h wodd. About 60 peracet of the populio lives below the
defined level of absolute poverty and read per capita income has been doclining at an average rate of 5
peet over the last three yeas. Ethiopia's productive capacity has bee sewverdy hampered by a
combination of factrs involving iapprprate policies, security probms, insufficient ifs ,tue,
and loss of natual assets due to environmeal damagge. On the policy front, before the political
change in May 1991, the economy was dominated by massive state contol of the productive sctors,
trade, financial services, and inftuctu  and utilities, oried to sport the war ftL Ibe pdvae
sector was consequently suffocated by a lack of foreign excage and many monopoly and
discriminar practices that limited access to credit at reasonable rtes, and taxed profits at exotbitan

levels. The distoons brought about by the overvalued Birr created additonal disinoives for
export-oriented production, and enoouraged purely spcultive activities. The TOE has made great
strides in refonning this negative policy fiamework and is commited to the continued estoaion of
confidence among domestic and foreip investors.
4.            Although Ethiopia has considerable naturl energy resources conDsisg In pcular
of its hydroelectric potentia, natural gn and fuelwood reserves, per capa energy consumption,
estdimed at 0.29 tons of oil equivalent (toe), is one of the lowest in the wodd. At preent, fochwood
a=d other biomass product aocount for 94 percent of the oountry's total enegy consumption,
predominany made up of fuelwood (80 percent). 15is is due in large measure to the fiac that a lare
porion of actual demand for modern commeecia energy (petroleum products and eecticity) remains
unsatsfied. This situation is, moreover, one of the major consraint on the country's economic
development, as well as a serious threat to the eavironment. An efficient energy sector, ener
sufficency and inreased diversity of energy supply are essenil  ngedis for achieving the
objectives of TGE's development shtategy, oentered on economic growth and poverty redution Ti

olicy recommendations of the Studm, upon Government accetance. wijl bYfl
imlemed by April 1996.
17.          Improve the dficency of sectoral Insfitutions The strategy to be adoptd wiUl be to
strengthen MME's regulator, pohcy-makng, promotiona ad coordinating capacity while teducig
the direct role of the Governmen in not-staegic, essentially commercid activities. A new Petroleum
Opetio  m inion (POA) is to be cread withi the MME to prmote oil and gas exploration
and development, and administer policy. The Ethiopian Enery Authority (EEA) wil conttibute to the
fornulaton of energy policy, regulat the sector and conduct research and studies on energy resources
and technology. The MMl s reo ion plan has been submitted to the Council of Ministes for
approval.
18.          Encourage further pFivate sector paridpation in petroleum operations. In
addiWion to the policy reform meas discussed above, long term cross-setora refoms  d the
following elements of the Government strategy, are expected to bave a positive impact on private
Investment in the petroleum sub-sector:
(a)    Ensuig that.the policy and regulatoty fmmework, producton shadng agreement,
and tax and duty incadves provide adequte rens to investors, prevet
envi=nmental damage and unsound techical practices, and fcilitate the development
of domestic expertise. Proclmation Nos. 295 and 296 (both of 1986 curnty
regulate petroleum operations and are judged to provide suitable incentives.
(b)   Improving the Governments exploration promotion capa   by updating the
exst  petroleum data base through seismic studies, compilng the data into an
ppropdate format and maketing it internationally. Data compilation and promotion
for the Opaden Basin will be aided under the CGDP. Provision of apopate
tchnical a =e will enhance the promotion capbilities of the MME. Lesons
learnt and expetise developed will be applied to similar efbrts elsewhere in the
country;
(c)    Assesng domestic and neighboring ountry demand for natr gas and establishing a
regime for regional cooperation. The Second Phase Calub Gas Development Study
will assess domestic demand and focus on studying the feasibility of a large scale
mercialiation of the Calub naural gas depost. Regional ageements would be
formulated in the longer term; and
(d)    Promoting direct equity padicipation, and other levels of participation, of the private
sector in petroleum opetions. Under the CGDP, the Calub Company has been
established as a share company unJer the Commercial Code of Elhiopia wih
dsgnificant private equity ownehip.
19.          Optimizathn of petrolem supply and disbton. Distribution of all petroleum
prdut in Ethiopia is handled by four private oil companies. It is the Government's policy that
distribution conine to be handled by the drvate sector. The strategy to be adopted for the
opdmization of supply and distribution is based upon: O) an imprvement in the present
and national capacity for the procurement, port handling, storage and distribution of petroleum
produc; and (Hi) revision of the prcing policy of all petroleum products, according to the
96

recommendations of the study and pinciples discussed above. Under the CGDP, a Pet&oleum Pdcing
and Marckt atutr Study will review curren  policy and pracices, Including the Inveament code,
safet and environmental regulations as they apply to the petroleum sub-sector, and make
recommendatons for comprehensive optimization. The Study is to be comnpid by AprI 1995 and its
recommendations uon  ovemment acce . would be h,lly jmplanented by Aui 1996.
20.          Stimulate tecbnology tanser and develop domestic capact, skills and expertse.
lbe sae    w ill Involve a number e initatives including direct foregn investnt, joint-ve mtures
with technologically advanced partners, technic assisne arrgements and training. he
improvement in the Investment cmate will encourag increased direct forign investment aud joint
ventues. Investment promotiou and faciliation measures, technical assistance and training provided
under 2he CGDP, wil support this stwaegy to develop technia capacy.
21.          Improve energy effci . Ihe focus will be on initially Improving the efficiency of
kerosene and LPG stoves, and in the longer term on Improving the energy efficiecy of petoleum
co _g industrie and the transportation setor. A kerosene stove improvement program is planed
and an LPG stove development program will be undetaen under the CGDP and is expected to be
omlted by Setmber 1996.
We are confiden that Govementes sector policies and refom program will result in
an efficient and sustainable energy sector. We look forward to your contiued support and
cooperaion.

CALUB GAS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Status of Petroleum Exploration
in EthioNWa
Red Sea
1.           Ihe Ethiopian sector of the Red Sea Oli3o-Mloen: age rifted sedimentary
basin, which Includes the adjacet onshore areas of the Danil depression, covers an area of
approximately 80,000 square kilomets. Its exploration commenced before World War II,
during the period 1935-40 by AGIP, as part of the Italian Governmenes natural resource
assessment of the colony. During this period eleven onshore shalow wells were driled,
toting 32,500 feet. Exploration restarted after World War U, inily by the Yugodavian
owmpany Naltalin, during the period 1958-60, with gavity, magnetic, and surface geologic
surveys, but no drilling.
2.           The modern exploration of this basin took place in three pases during the
period 1963-70. Starting In 1963, both Gulf and Mobil OU Companies toot out adja
exploration licenses. Mobil was joined in 1966 in its contract area by Esso. Both exploration
groups conducted magnedc surveys, with Mobil undertaking an extensive land-based grvity
survey in addition. Gulf shot 2553 km., and Mobil 14,530 km. of seismic data, and a total of
five exploratory wells were drilled, two by Gulf, and three by Mobil, totaing 53,000 feet.
The latter included the unoontrolled blowout of the Mobil C-1 in 1969. The blowout died on
its own accordt nearly two months ater it occurred, during the process of drilling the C-lA
relief well. Both wells were subsequenly plugged and abandoned.
3.           Baruch-Foster, an American seismic conactor, took out an exploration
license in 1966, obtined considerable geophysical data, and became embroiled in a
ctual dispute with the Ethiopian Government which went to arbitration. The contractor
lost, and the license was relinquished in 1970.
4.           The second modern phase of Red Sea exploration began in 1968 with the
granting of a license to the Ethi.:'an Oil Corporation/General American consortium which
undertook a minor amount of seismic in-fMll shootig, and the drling of two dry exploration
wells totaling 19,705 feet. The license was relinquished in 1976. Shell was licensed nearly
concuntly, during the period 1974-77. Additional gravity, magnetic and 4,178 km. of
seismic were acquired, and a dry exploration well was drilled to 10,233 feet. Shell
relinquished the license In 1977.
5.           Under the first decade following the overthrow of the Emperor, little or no
petroleum exploration was undertaken, existing licenses were relinquished, and the foreign
99



Annex U.L
Page 2 of 3
exploration companies withdrew from Ethiopian in an effort to reverse this trend, the Ministry
of Mimes and Energy contracted Westem Geop4ysical (USA) to undertake a 945 km. seismic
acquisition program In the northern portion of the Ethiopian Red Sea for purposes of
exploration promotion, followed by a World Bank-fimded Petroleum Exploraton Promotion
Project in which the French consulting firm BEICIP was the primary contractor. Ihe efforts
of this program were ultimately successfil in the Red Sea, with the signing of two exploration
contracts in 1989, with BP and Amoco. The International Finance Corporaticin took a 25
percent interest in the BP block at the request of the operator, as political risk insurance.
6.           With the subsequent change of government in mid-1991, and the separation of
Eritrea from the remainder of Ethiopia, a defactoforce m4jeure stus occured prior to the
drilling of wells. At the time of project appraisal, this situation has not been resolved, and the
work obligations remain uncompleted.
Gambela Area of Wstern Ethiopia
7.           The Gambela area in the extreme west of Ethiopia covers an area of
approximately 17,000 square kilometers. It is geologically related to the Cretace. -strtrary
age intracratonic rift basins of southern Sudan which have been found to contait petroleum
reserves through Chevron's exploration efforts during the late 1970s and early 1980s. In
conJunction with the Sudanese exploration, Chevron applied for a non-eclusive exploration
permit in the adjacent Gambela area of Ethiopia, and in 198243 conducted an aeroma.  c
and gravity survey as an extension of similar work in Sudan. The Gambela area was included
in the Bank-funded exploration project in the middle eighties. lndirectly, as a result of these
promotional efforts, International Petroleum Company of Canada has taken an exclusive
exploration license, incorporating the entire Gambela area in late 1991. At time of 4ppraisal,
geophysical work is waiting for the arrival of a crew.
Ogaden Area
8.           Exploration in the intracratonic, Paleozoic to Mesozoic Ogaden Basin, which
comprises 350,000 square kilometers in the southeastem portion of Ethiopia, started with
reccimaissance work by British America in 1920, and was followed by AGIP as part of a
general exploration of the country during the pre-war period of 1936-39. Modern exploration
began with the US company, Sinclair, during the period 1949-52. In this cawmpaign the area
was covered with gravity and magnetic surveys, 1582 km. of seismic data were acquired, and
two exploratory wells were driled. Ihis rnsuccessful program was followed by the dlling of
15 straigaphic wells, which ranged in depth from approximately 70 to 1800 meters.
9.           Subsequent to Sinclair's withdrawal from Ethiopia in 1952, a German
company, Elwerath, during the period 1961-66, undertook surface geologic studies, magnetic
and gravity surveys, and shot an addidonal 4141 km. of seismic data, and drilled two deep
exploratory wells. Between 1970 and 1975, Tenneco conducted additional geological field
surveys, gravity and magnetic data acquisition programs, and shot 8200 km. of seismic data,
and drilled eight deep exploratory wells, one of which tested non-associated naural gas at
major flow rates from two horizons in 1973.

10.          Due to the lack of a commeral outet for h gas dscoverles, as well s the
overthrow of the goverrment of laile Sellasie ini 1974, Tenneco relinquished its rights to its
discoveries, and withdrew from Ethiopia, thus concluding the fist major exploration phase of
the Ogaden area. At the time of Tenneco's withdrawal, more than 1V,000 km. of seismic dat
h ad been obtained within the basin, and 12 exploraoy wells and 15 sballow stratographic
bore holes were drilled totaling 168,626 feet
11.          Commencing in mid-1980, at the nvidon of the post-Haile Sellasle
Ethiopian government, the Soviet Union entered into a bilatera agreement to provide
technical services to develop the Calub gas field discovered by Tenneco, and to cotiue the
exploration of similar structures in the surrounding area. Of these exploration prospects, the
Hilala stucture (some 150 km. from Calub) was tested and found capable of producing gas,
with lesser amounts of oil, and the nearby Shilabo and Magan wells also ted positive for
gas.
12.          SPEE, which was created to underae operations in accordan  with the
bilatal agreesAnt, was originaly operaed by Techmoexport, and presenly by
Zarubezhgeologia. SPEE has undertaken a fiuther gravity survey, shot an additonai 7,000
km. of seismic data, and drilled 17 wells, totaling in excess of 184,000 feet Of these wels,
nine are development wells within the Calub field; the remainder are exploration wells in the
vicinity of the field.
13.          In accordance with the recent changes of government in bodt Ethiopia and the
Soviet Union, the bilateral relationship supporting the SPEE, activites ares being brought to a
conclusion, with present work being done on a negodated piece-work basis. The ultimate
disosition of the assets, and indeed the personnel, of SPEE are still uncetain and are open to
negotiation. It is reasonably clear, bowever, that i is the Government of Ethlopas itenion
to open the previously SPEE-exccusive area to activities by other interestd oil companies,
with a view to developing apparent discoveries of petroleum and gas in nearby areas. It is
possible that elements of the SPEE will continue to be utilized on a conttal basis, but the
underlying bilateral agreement will be brought to an end.
14.          In 199X, immediately preceding these governmental dhanges, two large
contracts for exploration in Region V were entered into with the United States firms of Maws
Energy Corporadon, and Hunt Oil Company. The Maxus block is located along the entire
bowdary with Northern Somalia. Geophysical work in this area commenced in 1991-92 and
has been completed. The smaller exploration block held by Hunt is in the southwest part of
the basin, adjacen to the border with Kenya/Somalia. Geophysical work wil be underak
with the contract crew being utlized by Maxus, as soon as that work is completed.

Supply and Distribution
7.           Supply. An analysis of current supply patterns and economics in terms of the capacity
and operating status of inbound facilities (port and storage at Assab and Djibouti); refinery
throughput, economics and maintenance status; procurement procedures for crude and finished
products ( e.g. International Competitive Bidding) and related financial costs (Letter of Credit, etc.).
The objective of this analysis will be to compare the actual ex-refinery/import prices with optimal, yet
realistic, import parity prices for all products, thus identifying areas of potential cost optimization.
8.           Distribution. The study of the distribution network should include the analysis of the
transportation and related infrastructure (inland depots, tanker capacity and constraints, railway
systerm) in terms of tariffs, access to capital and foreign exchange, and the impact of liberalization of
road freight tariffs implemented at the end of 1992. The study will also assess the impact of
distributor and retailer margins on the financial performance of these entities. Ihe performance of the
distribution and retail companies in Ethiopia should be studied in an historical context (over the last
three years), their margins be compared with margins in other Sub-Saharan African countries, and the
margins be related to the volumes and types of products handled. This analysis is needed to assess the
adequacy of wholesale and retail allowances.
Demand/Consunmption
9.           Household Energy. Markets will be segmented according to income, rural vs urban,
availability of alternative fuels to each market segment (purchased or collected), taste and function
(injera baking or other cooking, lighting, etc.). The study will assess the p,ospects, and enumerate
conditions under which, traditional fuels (particularly wood and dung) can be pragmatically
substituted with kerosene and LPG in the various market segments (the aim being to mitigate
deforestation and declining soil productivity). The study will take into account household income and
proportion of income spent on energy/fuels and household energy consumption patterns. The
relationship between stove/appliance costs and energy consumption patterns will also be assessed.
10.          Industry and Transportation. Study the energy consumption patterns within these
subsectors and assess potential/suppressed demand for modem fuels and conditions under which this
demand may be satisfied.

it.          Prepare projections of energy supply and consumption (imports and domestic
production for the various energy sources) for the next five years, including a justification of the
forecasts. Supply projections should take hno account electrification and reforestation plans with
respect to the impact of their supply on the consumption of petroleum products.
Pricing
12.          Following the analysis of the petroleum supply and distrbution system, the study will
audz the present petroleum price stucture and procedures for establishing retail prices at various
locations (including looking at the components on which this price Is based). Identify variations
between regulated and "parallel" market prices (if these exist for any products). Identify the sources
of market price distortions such as:
(a)   supply constraints - reinery output, non-availability of foreign exchange for imports,
inadequate pott and storage facilities, etc.;
(b)    non-economic pricing - inadequate or excessive distributor/reailer margins, implicit
subsidies or taxes not explicitly accounted for, subsidies resulting in misuse of the
subsidized fuel, etc.;
(c)   taxation policy - rational for explicit taxes/subsidies on various fuels;
(d)   impact of liberalization of road freight tariffs; and
(e)    poor road conditions not compensated for by higher transportation allowances.
13.          Product pricing will take into account the Government's goal of mitigating
deforestation and will therefore assess the adequacy of LPG/kerosene prices and subsidies vs.
traditional fuel prices/consumption among different market segments. The study will assess the impact
of pricing policy over the last three to five years on supply and demand, impact on suppliers,
distributors and retailers (profitability, reinvestment, network expansion, etc.), consumers, and on
interfuel substitution. The study will focus on a sample of urban and rural areas, and include areas at
different stages of deforestation.
Policy Recommendations
14.           The study will offer policy recommendations which will aim to align petroleum
product supply wih the international market, at the same time ensuring optmum economic use of
biomass and fossil fuels. Scenarios presented will compare market conditions (supply, demand,
interfuel substitution, etc.) with no policy reform with the projected conditions if recommended
policies are implemented. The recommendations will include implementation techniques, including
timing/phasing, for the scenarios presented.
iS.          The study will also recommend modifications and additions to the regulatory
framework, and actual practices, governing the petroleum subsector.
105

16           EclIons. Although electricity pricing is not within the scope of this stdy,
electrification plans and endings of the elecicity ar  study currently underway wil be taken Into
accoufi.
17.          Taxadon. Based on a review of current taxation of petoleum products in Ethiopia,
and fom experience In other countries at a simnar level of development, revisions In taxaton policy
should be recommended, If this is deemed beneficial.
18.          Institudonal Framework. The study should tecommend an optima (and pragmatic)
institutional framework under which prices, if they are to be administered, should be administered.
aear steps should also be provided as to how the price sefttin mechanism works, how it should be
Im4lemented, how often and under what circumstances prices should be adjusted, which entity should
be the supervisory authority and which entities should be prese  in an advisory/consultative capacity.
19.          Non-price measures anc other factors. The study will also ilrclude the analysis of
non-price measures which will have a significant Impact on supply, demand and interfuel substion.
Reforestation projects and programs for improvements in forestry management wil have a bearing on
woodfuel prices in the future; any subsidization of modern fuels should recommend mechanisms
through which longer term distortions in the traditional fuels market can be avoided.
20.          Mhme Hizor . The study will look at a horizn of five years and attenmpt to cptr
(as best as possible) the projected impact on fuel prices of the forestry action projects under
implementation. It is expected that the study will take six moths to complete and would begin after
Credit Effectiveness. Among other things, the recommendations of the study will provide the basis for
petroleum product pricing, including the extent to which prices should b regulated (retail, wholesale,
etc.) and conditions under which pries may be liberalized.
21.          Mhe Calub Gas Development Project. Specific to the Calub Gas Development
Ptoject, the stdy will refine the LPG pricing structure (based on import parity) to be established
under the Project, and define the linkage between LPG and kersene prices. Since LPG prices are to
be based on import parity (this is an approximate price assumig the import of economic quantities of
LPG with adequate port receiving facilities), the study wfll provide the necessary elaboration of this
prie, better define the distribution company margins and determine whether or not LPG prices can be
completely liberaized.

CALUB GAS DEVLOENCT PROJECT
Adigrat Reservoir lwevelopment
1.           The existng wells Calub-3, -5,4 and the curly drmiling -10 wel wi be
completed as producers in the Upper Adigrat A reservoir. Well -3 Is on the crest of the
structure, wells -5, 8 and -10 are in ntemmediate locato  on the flanm of the reservoir.
Calub48 was drmed as a replacemet well for Calub-1, the dcvery well. Calub-2 was
extensively damaged during completion and will hav little impact as eidtr a producto or
injection well. t i possible that remedial work could be sccessful, and tho well utilized as
either a producer or injection well. Calub-9 is productive in the deeper resevoir, but is at tho
aslwater conta at the Adigrat level. It i the logical candcdato for a source of Calub make.
up gas for reinjection into the Adigrat reservoir.
2.           'he producing wels will be flowed at the combined rate of 50 MMCFG/D,
which will be held constant for the first 15 years of field life duing which 56 percent of the
Iiial gas In place (i.e. a cumulative 273.5 MMCF of gas) will be produced, with a 90
percem sweep efficiency. Maximnm  diidual well rate product  wil be resticted to 26.5
MMCFG/ID, which wiU apply only to the Calub-3 well; the other wells being capable of less
prolific production will not be affected by this restriction.
3.     I      he assocated liquids production will comme  at a plateau rate of 1500
banesday for four years, and then declining to 1100 barrnslday at the end of 15 years.
umutive liquid production will be 7.36 million barrls, which equates to 50 perct of total
liquid reserves. Additiona lnfihl drilling dming the life of the field could reduce ts decli
in liquid production and imprwoe the ultimate recovery efficiency. lh economic evalution
of an infill drilling program wfll be undertaken in light of the production experience gained
fom the fist several yeaws of field life.
4.           In order to reduce condensate formation due to pressure draw-down in the
areas around the producing wells, consideable atetion wUI have to be given to the details of
well completion, with special atttion being given to the correct use of compledto fluids,
and high density, deep penetation perforation, utilizing an undebanced perforating fluid to
minimze reservoir damage in these critical areas. Tis wil likely require the Importation of
sophticated completion oquIment and trained pesonnel, rather than utflizing the less costly
tichnques currendy avilable at Calub.
S.           lhe undedying Adigrat B horion is sepad from the overlying main
Adgrat A reservoir by the bmpneable, continos 25 foot-ick Imer-Adigrat shale. The
two Adigrat reservoirs appear to contain separa  gas/water contacts and therefire are likly
to not be in hydrauic continty. The lower Adigrat B rservoir contains approely 30
perent of the tot Adigrat reve, but the maximum gas column in this reservoir is
111



Annex ML1
Page 2 of 3
approximately 100 feet, and is underlain by water. Pefating this lower reservoir would
likely lead to early water production. Additionally, the two reservoirs, if produced together,
would result In cross-flow between the two reservoirs because of the pressure differential.
The resulting cowingling of the two reservoirs would be to the detiment of overall
production. Accordingly, the Adigrat B reservoir will be produced at a later date, following
depletion of the Adigra A reservoir.
Calub Reservoir Deveopment
6.           The deeper, higher pressured, and leaner reserves from the Calub formation
will be produced as required to provide make-up gas to replace the voidage of the shallower
Adigrat reservoir due to production of the liquids and LPG as a means of maintAining
reservoir pressure. As markets for the methane gas are developed, reservoir simuion
studies of the Calub reservoir will be undertaken to determine maximm efficiency in
producing ks reserves thro  natual depletion; i.e. without pressre maintnance.
Inasmuch as there are very little nabtu  gas liquids entrained in these reseves, very little
potentia liquid production will be lost through this means of production.
7.           For purposes of fature development of the productive capabilites of this
additional reservoir, a simple materi balance production forecast has been made in which it
has been assumed that the reservoir would be produced at a target plateau production rate of
200 MMCFG/D (i.e. at four times the rate of the Adigrat reservoir). Plateau production at
his rat would condnue for 14 years during which 53 pnt of the original gas-in-place
would be recovered. The total reservoir life is calculated to be 29 years, with an exponential
decline rate of eight percent following conclusion of plateau production. Total recovery of
the Calub reserves would be approximately 80 percent though the use of eight wells
producing at an average rate of 26.85 MMCFG/D per well.
Gas Reujeon
8.           The existing wells Calub-4, -6 and -7 will be completed as injector wells to
re-inject the unused methane, euane, and remaining propane back into the Adigrat A
reservoir as a conservaion measure, and to maintain reservoir pressure. The latter is
required in order to Insure maximum recovery of the associated natural gas liquids which
woud otherwise condense out in the reservoir and be only marginally recoverable. Calub-4 is
located near the crest to insure timely voidage replacement In the heavily drained crestal area
of the reservoir. The other two wells are low on the fanks to provide an efficient peripbheal
drive in which the pressure front migrates toward the crestal producing area.
9.           Additional make up gas will be produced from the Calub reservoir through
use of the Calub-9 well, and re-injected into the producing Adigrat A reservoir. Estimated
volumes of makeup gas required for this.volume are 5.8 percent of total injected gas, or
4.594 MMCFG/D. Maximum surfce injection preure into the Adigrat reservoir is forecat
to be 344 bars, resulting in a maximum bottom hole injection pressure of 388 bars.
10.          Data to date suggests that this program will resut in a high sweep efficiency
and will provide adequate pressure support to the more cresta producers. There is, however,
119



Page 3 of 3
very little actual data avalable, and a detailed test anaysis program must be undertaken with
the injecton wells early in their life.
Ongong Resrvoir Studies
11.          Because of the unkown production and injection charWcs of the Calub
welb in the Adigrat reservoir, a sophisticated reservoir simulaton model wil hae to be made
which can be updated wifth production and injectivity histories as data becomes available eatly
in the life of the field. lbis will require the presence of onske sophisticated computers
capable of reservoir simulation and modeling, as wel as personnel trained in their usage for
these purposes. The results of these on-going reservoir simulation studies will determine the
necessary adjustments which must be made to production flow rates and injecdvity rates for
each of the wells in the field.
12.          Reinjection at the rate required for fuil voidage replacement can be mantained
for approximatly one period following which it is likely that the rising reservoir pressure
oround the injection wells will cotrain the rate of reinjection. It is libely, therefe,
depending on field experience during the initial phases of field life, that one or more
additional injector wells will need to be drilled relatively early in the project life.

ETHIOPIA
CALUB GAS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
The Proceng Plant
1.           GatherIng Lvnes and Prduction Manifold. The gathering system Is
designed to connect the produc;ig and injection wells to the proesig planL Iniil plans are
for four producing well, some makWp gas upply well and hree Injectors which are
conned to the manifold by four indh bare steel lines laid directly on the ground. Lengths
vary from a maximum of 5 km to a minimm disace of I kiL Flowing well head pressures
will be dropped by a choke valve to 250 bars by limiting the flow rate to maximum of 17.6
MMCFGAD per well; pressures will be reduced to 90 bars at the manifold inlet. lhese
restrictions are desigped to reduce the formation of hydrites which are entrained water
particles that cyslize out of the gas strea  -hen the pressure is reduced and the
tem ae    of the gas drops shaply. Ihe h, ,r 'es plug the vives, thus interrupting the
smooth flow of gas.
2.           Dehydration. For the reasons given above, the enaine water must be
rmoved frm both the gas stream and the recovered natural gas liquids before either can be
firher treated in the processing plat. This processing utilizes both pressure drops and
cooling. Ihere are severa means of accomplishing this; the actual choice wlil depend on
operati  simplicity, minimum pressure reduction and minimum operatng exp-nse. All water
must be removed at the plant inlet and disposed of. Ihe high salinity of this formation water
requires special disposal facilities for reasons of en  protection. This enta  either
deslination or reinjection below the ground water aquifers.
3.          IUquid ReANivery. Ihe recovery of both LPG and natual gas liquids from
the stream of dehydrated gas is achieved by cooling the gas, condensing the heavy
components, and separating the resulting liquid from the gas stream. The gas cooling process
Is in two stages, recoveing liquids from both stages. Initaly the gas stream is cooled by
heat exchangers against already chilled product. Following liquid sqparation, the remanng
gas is farther cooled though the use of a tubo-expander. The liquis are sparated In a low
pressure separatr, and the remaining gas is recompressed for reinjection back into the
reservoir. All processes commercily available to achieve this separation recover vtualy
the same amounts of LPG and natural gas liquifies; the chief vaiable is the amount of power
consumed in the recompression phase, and hence the associated capital cost for generators and
compressors.
4.           LPG Sepratlon and Recovery. The separation of gas to be reinjected
(methane, ehane and some propane) from LPG (butane and the remainder of the propane) and
the liquid condensate (panes and heavier) is based on vapor pressure. The basic process
involves reducing the vapor pressure to allow the separation of the natural gas which is to be
reinjected, stripping the butanes and associated propane from the liquids, and stabilizing them
115

at the pressure at which they ae to be sored and markeed. lTe remainn liquid cnts   no
volatie component at atmospheric pressure and ambien tene.
5.           The mechaism for accomplishing this depend on dropping the preure and
temperature to allow maximum separaton, followed by stabiizaton at LPG storage pressure,
and in the case of the liquids, at atmospheric pressure. The efficiency with which these
processes work is very dependet upon the technology which is udlized; at the same tme, the
choice of teebnology direcdy affects the capital expenditure for the initia plant, and the
ongoing operating expense. To maximize LPG reoovery from the relatively lean Calub gas
entails unit costs of extraction which are uneconomic in this project. Accordingly, under the
project altenative processes -will be considered which wll improve the oveall economics of
the project, at the expense of reduced efficiency of LPG recovery. ITe unovered LPG wi
be reinjected as a component of the injection gas and, in theory can be recovered at a later
date when the lean, residual gas is produced during the phase II of the project during which
the methane is also exploited.
6.           Te amount of propane which is recovered with the butane is direct fmnction
of the vapor pressure of the resulting LPG. At 17-19 bar cylinder pres . 45 percent of the
propane will be recovered as LPG. At the lower 10 bar presure curenWtly in use in Ethiopia
and most other African countries, closer to 10 pere  of propane Is recovered. The saving
In cost with the lower vapor pressure system results from the less expensive separation
equipment which is required, combined with the ability to utilize exisng bottling plant and
cylinders already in use in the Ethiopian market
7.           Refinng of the Condensate. This portion of the process plat separates the
resuling stabil;zed liquids (from which all butanes and ligter gases have been removed) into
the producton of gasoline, kesene and diesel oil. The process is simUar to conventional
crde topping unit, and involves simple atmospheric dtillatn Ihe very lttle residual
rmining after the distillation of the diesel component from the Adigrat-derived condensate Is
paraffin which can either extracted for disposal, or blended ii withthe diesel.

CALUB GAS DEVEPOPMENT PROJECT
Environmental Monitoring System
Monioing system
1.           There are severa agencies which are concened with the collection and
analysis of environmentaly relevant data. At present, however, the quat  of data and
knowledge of trends in the envonea sutuation i rather lmtd. While detaed data
collection on a large scale is a luxury which Ethiopia probably can not afford, there is a need
for some basic monitoring and analysis of data on key parameter conceig the
environmet, especially in situations where signs of envinm    stress are evident or, as in
this case, where signficant intventions are planned. Iberefore, an eenta compoent of
the Project mitgation plan is the estabUshment of a comprehensive Eon l Monitori
System for the project impact zone (.e. 150 km of Calub and 25 km on either side of the
road). n light of the potal           impacts idetified and of the mitigion plan
proposed, this monoring system should comprlse a natural resources componet and a socio-
economic component.
2.           The natural resources component should monitor the impact of the Project on
the local bio-physical environment, in particular on the followig indicators:
*     vegetation composition/association (range condition)
*     devegetation
*     water avaiability and quality
*     livestock movements and numbers
*     roadside erosion/gullykig
3.           The socioeconomic component is Intended to monitor the Inmpact of the
Project on the human environment, in particular on the following indicators:
*     population density and distribution (including settement pattens)
*     availability of grain and other goods in local markets
*     lIvestock-grain terms of trade
*     economic activities, especially employment and self-employment

Natual Resources Component
4.           Monitoring the natural ewvionment in the context of the Project relates to (a)
the measuremet and  tpretation of changes In those vegetation and soil characteristics
which are likely to influence the long-term productivity of the range, (b) the measurement of
livestDck movement and concentraon, and (c) the meaum     of water quality and quantty.
S.          It is antcipated that the overall effects of the Project will be beneficial.
Afowever, the creation of an industial complex and of a townsite may lead to a greater
concenation of livestock and people, thus upsetting the delicate balance betweea water and
gazing availability in the Shilabo area and possibly along the main road. For example, the
project is liklay to come under intense presure to drill new wells, but any such initiative
should be taken only after careful study of rangeland conditions and land use in the area, lest
the provision of a permne water source results in massive overazing and eventually in
devegetation arund the well.
6.           Rangeland monitoring requires information on the narAl environment at
dfferent time intervals. Space, aerW and ground tecwiques (i.e., establishmnt of
monioring sites) should be used to monitor the rangeland vegetation both in the Calub area
and at selected locations along the main road. Satellite im     wil be requed initily to
give broad disdnction to the vegetation. Aerial recon  should follow to obtain more
precise information on vegetation types and herd size; given the high cost of aerial surveys, it
is suggested that they take place only withi the Calub area 'he information collected in this
way wfll indicate the status and dynamics of local range condition and tends. Ihe
stablishment of monoring sites in key points (e.g., nea watr points) wil make it possible to
analyse environmenal indicators in greater detail, and therefore to detect any changes at an
early stage.
7.           Some of the ifonnation needed for monitoring the range and water resource
is already available in scatered locations in various governt departments. The inithl
activity wfll therefore be to collect this information and organize it into an adequate data bas
Once the data base is developed, gaps in the information available will be identfied and a
detailed monitoring system designed to fill the gaps. The infrmaton needed for monitord
and the parameters to be measured include:

Socio-Econonde Component
B.           The major socio-economic parameters in Region V are undergoing constant
change, so it would be difficult to identify what changes are likely to be direcdy related to the
Calub Project. Nevertheless, it is important that an attempt be made to quantify the major
trends which might be attributable, at least in part, to the Project. Ihese effects may be
either direct or indirect. A direct effect might be the impact of petroleum production, once
it comes on stream, on local woodfiuel consumption. An ilndirec effect might be the knock-on
effect of the rehabilitated HararShilabo road on food prices and avafaility in the area.
9.           Given the ripple effect of socioonomic changes, the area to be kept under
study will have to be limited somewhat arbitrarily. It is suggested that data collection
concentrate on the same area covered by the Community Development Fund, so that the
monitoring system will also provide an ongoing evaluation of the effectiveness of the Fund.
The study therefore should gather Information within 150 km radius of the Calub plant -
119



Page 4 of 9
which will include the main centers of Shilabo, Kebri Debar, Gode, Kelafo and Warder- and
at specified locations along the main road.
10.          While it would be desirable to use a combination of both quantitative and
qualitative techniques, it is advisable to rely primarily on indicators which lend themselves to
quantification. This would make it possible to stardardize and simplify data collection, and
would facilitate comparisons between locations and over time. The close link between the
economic life of most indigenous people and the conditions of the natura environment mean
that a degree of overlap with the data collection requirements for the blo-physical component
may be desirable if not necessary. Also, findings from the two components should be
compared and discussed at regular intervals. Key parmeters to be measured for socio-
economic monitoring would include the following:
Population
population increase, especially near the plant and along the road
population distribution in the project area
migratory movemes, both temporary and permanent

Monitoring Unit
11.          The monitoring plan outlined in this chapter should be an ongoing activity for
the duration of the project and it will require the attention of specialized personnel stationed in
the field. The mandate of the newly established Ministry of Natural Resources Development
and Environmental Protection makes it a logical candidate for the implementation of the plan,
but at present it would be unrealistic to expect the Ministry to be able to take over
responsibilit for monitoring activities, as neither its means nor its structure would enable it to
do it effectively. The Ministry of Mines and Energy would not be an acceptable
implementing agency for the monitoring plan because of conflict of interests. The NGOs
involved in environmental activities do not appear to have the needed expertise, or the
interest, to carry out the monitoring. It is therefore suggested that responsibility for the
monitoring plan be allocated as follows: a special Monitoring Unit should be established with
responsibility for overall coordination and for the direct implementation of the socio-economic
component, while SERP' would be sub-contracted for the natura resources component.
12.          SERP has already started colleting some of the needed dat over the south-
east rangelands as a whole and has plans to carry out its own environmental monitoring for
the whole region. SERP offices have been opened in a umuber of locations in Region 5,
specialized personnel is already in the field, and arrangements for the use of sophisticated
equipment (e.g., for satellite imagery) have been made. Contracting out to SERP the natural
resources component would save both time and money, since it would be possible to take
advantage of their expertise, organization and equipment. It would also give SERP the means
to carry out more intensive data collection in the Calub Project area (i.e., 150 km radius
around Calub and 25 km on each side of the Harar-Shilabo road), so as to achieve the desired
level of detail. As a close collaboration with SEEP would in any case be desirable, this
arrangement would ensure such collaboration.
It will be recalled that SEP is the SWth-Eag Rangeha Prtect weaed under the Misty of AOculure (see
ChapW3).
121



A.mLxLM3
Page 6 of 9
13.         The Monitoring Unit would be attached to the office of the Calub Commnwity
Development Fund (see Annex 4). ThIs would be desirable for practical reasons, such as
sharing office space and equipment, and for strategic reasons, to facilitate the monitoring of
the Community Development Fund activites and to have easy access to the Adviser who will
assist both the Fund and the Monitoring Unit. The Unit would comprise a full-time
Monitoring Officer, secretary and driver. The Monitoring Officer will receive support fom
the Technical Assistance Adviser to the Community Development Fund for a total of ten
months. This means that the monitoring budget will cover the costs of ten of the 33 months
of technical assistance to be provided by the Adviser to the Community Development Fund
(see Annex 4). The Monitoring Officer, who would ideally be qualified to post-gaduate
degree standard in a social science, would have access to a small budget to hire local school
leavers to act as data collectors/enumerators.
14.         The Monitoring Officer would be administratively responsible, in the first
instance, to the Manager of the Calub Community Development Fund. The accountant of the
Fund would be responsible for keeping the local accounts of the Monitoring Unit, which
would have a separate bank account in Kebri Dehar. Disbursement and procurement would
be carried out by the Coordinating Unit of the Community Development Fund on behalf of
the Monitoring Unit. Contracts for services above US$5,000 per contact would need the
approval of the regional government's Planning Office who would be ultimately responsible
for disbursement of funds and for the work of the Monitoring Unit in general. The
Monitoring Officer would have authority to sign cheques for up to US$5,000 per service
contract.
15.         The Monitoring Officer would be expected to prepare quarterly reports
discussing monitoring results, progress, problems enountered and so on. He/she would also
be responsible for following up work to be carried out by SERP for the natural resources
component, so as to ensure that the two systems are directed towards the same overall
objective: to understand, document and quantify as much as possible the overall impact of the
Project on the local human and natr environment.

Responsibilities of the Technical Adviser would be to:
o   collaborate with the Monitoring Officer in the design of the socio-economic
monitoring system;
o train the Monitoring Officer, and eventually other data collectors. in the use cf the
system as needed;
o  modify the system in the light of field experience;
o support the smooth running of the system through regular field visits during project
lifetime.
Responsibilities of the Monitoring Officer would be to:
o  prepare detailed work programmes;
o  supervise Monitoring Unit staff;
o  recruite short-term and/or part-time local data collectors as needed, and cordinae
and supervise their work;
o collect necessary field data and analyse them;
o  prepare quarterly reports to be sent to the Planning Office of the Regional
Government and to the Ministry of Natural Resources Development and
Enviromnental Protection;
o collaborate with the Calub Community Development Fund;
o  coordinate and follow up work to be carried by SERP;
o liaise with the Calub Company and other concerned agencies as appropriate.

Duration
17.          Monitoring activities should within one year from the date of IDA Credit
Effectiveness, with the collection of detailed baseline data. To do this, it will be necessay to
formalize arrangements for sub-contracting the auural resources component to SERP (this
possibility was already discussed during the Environmental As  Mssion) and to design
a data collection system for the socio-economic component. It should be noted that, although
finds for the monitoring plan will be made available through the Calub Ptoject only for five
years, ideally monitoring should take place for at least ten years and ideally for as long as
natura gas reservoirs in the area will continue to be exploited. Should monitoring stop
withthe end of the project, it will be difficult to detect any longer term trends. Because
changes in the bio-physical environment may take several years to manifest themselves, it Is
essential that agreements are reached to fund monitoring acdvities for a minimum of five
years after project completion, possibly in the form of a grant from environmentally-minded
donors.
Budget
18.         'Me budget Cm US$) is divided into two parts reflecting the diffrent set up
proposed for the natual resources component and the socio-economic component. the budget
for the natural resources component covers the estimated additional cost to SERP to carry out
the required monitoring over the Calub Project lifetime.

CALUB GAS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Calub Community Development Fund
hnvduction
1.           Ihe Calub Gas Development Project is intended to develop the Calub Gas Field In
the Shilabo District of Region V. Ithe main components of the Project are:
o     establishment of a plant in Calub, some 30 km east of Shilabo town, for the
commercial extraction of petroleum products;
*     establishment of the necessary associated inastuncture, in paricular rehabilitation
of the Shilabo-Harar road for the improved transport of petroleum products
towards and beyond Dire Dawa, and the building of a townsite for plant
employees and their lmilies;
o     establishment of a Community Development Fund so the benefits of the Projects
are more widely spread throughout the local population;
3     establishment of a monitoring system to monitor the impact of the Project on the
human and natural environment during the lifetime of the Project; and
o     technical assistance to the Government to promote petroleum exploitation, LPG
commercialization and execute a number of studies.
Bakound
2.           Region V is a remote and isolated area of Ethiopia, inhabited largdy by Somali
nomads herdg cattle, camels, sheep and goats. There are severa small towns and administrative
centers in the area, such as Gode (pop. 15,000) the former administrative capital of the area,
Kebri Dehar (pop. 10,000), Shilabo (pop. 5,000)1, Warder (pop. 4,000) and Kelafo (pop. 5,000).
Over 90 percent of the population live outside these towns in rural areas.
3.           Because of the constant trffic in people across the border with Somalia estimating
the poplation of the Region has always been frought with difficulties. In a recent series of
over-flights of the area carried out by Save the Children Fund in 1991, it was estimated that the
1     Thc popubtion of thces small towns is estimate fiom hinonation colleteod fiom town eldr  d fidd
observaton. AUl of the towns menlioned, but especaly Gode and Kelaio, have rcenty sa their popaion
incres as a result of an influx of retureesrefugees from Somalia
127



ANNI M m4
Page 2 of 15
total rural population of the Region, including the lowlands of the former Eastern Hararghe
administrative region, but excluding the refugeetreturnee camps, was about one million.
4.           Since 1989 the area has also become home to over 400,000 refugees and returnees
escaping the civil conflict in neighboring Somalia. The bulk of these have been absorbed within
the local rural population but some 70,000-80,000 live in relief camps along the Wabi Shebele
river, at Gode and Kelafo, and south of Jijiga. Others have drifted to the local towns, where they
eke out a living engaged in informal trade and small businesses (e.g., running tea shops) and
generally swelling the numbers of urban unemployed.
5.           The mainstay of the economy is nomadic pastoralism. In addition, there is a
lively two-way trade in livestock and relief food (grain and rice) with Somalia.
6.           Historically, the Region has been a neglected area. Infrastructure is poorly
developed
and the populion ill-served by basic social services, such as schools, clinics and hospitals. While
recendy the area has been the focus of a large scale humanitarian relief effort, there has been little
in the way of longer term development projects in the area. The South-East Rangelands Project
(SERP), financed by the African Development Bank, is the only development project presently
being implemented throughout the area. This project is intended to raise rural living standards
through sustainable livestock, range and dryland agricultural interventions, but it appears to be
handicapped by lack of resources and the poor infrastructure of the project area.
7.           Under the new political dispensation in Ethiopia since the Transitional
Government came to power in May, 1991 the former Ogaden Autonomous Region and the
lowlands of Eastern Hararghe Region are now consolidated together to form the new Somali
Region V. It is expected that the new regional government will be formally established in the
early part of 1993.
Justification
8.           Region V has a fragile dryland ecology and economy. In the last three years the
population of the area has suffered from localized drought, which has been exacerbated by the
influx of large numbers of refugees/returnees from Somalia. Many depend, either directly or
indirectly, on food relief. Local people perceive themselves to have been neglected by successive
Addis Ababa governments. The new emphasis on local regional autonomy, however, has
encouraged Somali to believe that they too will soon be able to enjoy the benefits of longer term
development, in particular greater employment opportunities and improved infrastructure and
social services. Any development of the Calub natural gas field cannot be divorced from this new
economic, social and political context.
9.           Area residents as well as politicians expect to see tangible local benefits from the
exploitation of what they consider their natual resources. Without local support for the Project it
is difficult to see how the Project could be implemented in what has historically and
geographically been such a remote and politically unstable area of Ethiopia.
128



ANNEX mA
Page 3 of 15
10.          While it Is likely that at least some local residents will be employed by the
Company, and the rehabilitation of the Shilabo-Harar road will provide additional temporary jobs
to others, as well as eventually a boost to the Regiones economy in general, it is ccasidered
important that local communities in the Calub area and along the main road, be offered a wider
range of development interventions. The establishment of a Community Development Fund will
ensure that people living in the project impact zone receive some direct benefits as a tangible
result of the project. The Fund will be available to finance and support a range of locally
identified, and community based and managed, micro-projects, and it will be identified with the
Calub Gas Development Project.
Objectives
11.         In addition to the general goal of bringing benefits and spurring development in
the project area, the Calub Community Development Fund will have two objectives. One will be
to enhance local support and identification with the Calub Gas Development Project, thus
indirecdy contributing to its successful implementation. The other will be to mitigate some of the
possible negative effects of the Project, such as the use of up to 50 sq km of seasonal grazing land
for the site of the gas plant and associated pipelines to the wells. The purposes of the fund will be
achieved by:
o     supporting community-based micro-projects designed to respond to the
rehabilitation and development needs of the target population;
o     promoting and using a participatory approach to the design and planning of local
development projects;
o     assisting and encouraging the organization of local self-help groups, with
particular emphasis on women's groups.
Project A
12.         The Calub Community Development Fund will be available to finance micro-
projects wifthin 150 km of the Calub Plant and 10 km either side of the Shilabo-Harar road.
Defined in this way, the project area wiU include all the main population centers and towns of the
region (see Map). The main districts (awraja) included in the project area will be: Shilabo, Kebri
Dehar, Gode, Warder, Sheikosh, Degah Bur, Kebri Beyah, Jijiga and BabilelGursum.
13.          Special emphasis will be given to communities living in the immediate vicinity of
the gas field and along the main road, particularly south of Degah Bur, where, because of
resource constraints, SERP is least operationalized and other agencies virtally absent. It is these
groups, in fact, who stand to be most affected by the Project through IopS of grazing land,
increased use of their local water supplies, and a heavier traffic along the road.
129

14.          'he Fund will be available to support three kInds of project:
(a)   small infratuual projecs, such as rehabilitation or construction of wells,
schools and health clinics, including supply of simple technology, such as
generators or water pumps, which serve the community as a whole;
(b)   sodial projects, for the provision of essena  social services, such as community
health and nutrition programs, training in adult litea  (especially for women)
and AIDS prevention, vocational training, and veterinary services;
(b)   income generating proJects, including provision of credit and/or small grant for
small-scale and micro-enterprises, preferably run by community-based groups.
15.          Such a spread of project portfolios would neady plug the gaps in exisig
programs in the area. In any case, care should be taken to avoid overlapping with ongoing
projects and to build on their achievements (more on this later). Where agencies may be hiteted
In starting up new programs, such as Me.ecins Sans Frontiers (Belgium) or UNICEF in the
community health field, the Fund would represent a potental source of finance.
16.          Depending on the category of micro-project, the Fund would work with a range of
implementing partners. }n uc   projects would generally be implemented either by NGOs
or eting government agenmies, such as SERP; social projects would be implemented by NGOS,
government agencies or even the local district administration; and income generaing projects
would involve providing seed capital either to NGOs actng as intermediaieslteclnlcal assistants
or directy to local self-help groups and individuals. The kind of implemeng partner used would
depend a good deal on the nature of the project. However, no hard and fast rules would apply;
for example, there would be no reason why in principle an infrastructural project could not also
be Implemented directly by the communty.
Approwh
17.          Ptojects should be participatory and sustainable. ITe Fund is intended to support
as large a number of beneficiaries as possible, so priority wiU be given to supporting groups
rather than individuals. Because the traditional women's role makes it more difficult for them to
take advantage of social and economic opportunities, a special effort should be made to ensure
that they benefit from the Fund. Beneficiaries will be expected to contribute to projects and to
take ownership of them, so as to provide proper management and maintenance after initial
implementadon. Depending on the type of project, the initial contribution could be in different
ways. For infrstructural projects it could be in terms of finance, latbor or raw materials; for
social projects it could be in terms of future management arrangements and possibly partial cost
recovery; for income generating projects it would be in the form of loaa repayment, including a
reasonable interest rate. SERP experience already indicates that local communities are familiar
with this type of approach.

18.          It s esagd  that the Fund  wll be avallable to support micprojects to be
implemented either direcly by thte local commmity or indirecdy by other agencies, such as
NGOS, distict adminIion or indeed other govanment agencies and projects which will act as
the Implementig agency for the community. Whoever/whawver the Implementing agency, the
standard criteria to be adopted In assessing project requests wiM be the same, in paticular that the
implementing agency uses a participatory approach, and the project is sustainable. Implementfig
agencies will be given no more than 10 percent of the total microproject cost to cover their own
expenses.
Insttona Framework
19.          The Calub Communty Development Fund wil be managed by a smal
Coordinating Unit (CU) established and staffed for that specific purpose. The CU wiul be
insfflutionally linked to the Regional Government and wi be responsible to a Steering Committee
cmprsing the Ministry of Natur Resources Development and Environmental Protection, the
Project's P1TF, the Head of the Regional Government or his/her represeive, and local
rpreentatives of government instons dealing at the regional level with health, education,
environment, agriculne, planning, and energy; the Steing Committee should also include local
reprsentatives of the Relief and Rehabilitation Committee, and of relevant NGOS, donors and
government projects, such as SERPF. The Steering Committee wfll meet quarterly to oversee the
workings of the Fund, approve project requests over the CU approved financi authority for
projects, and review work programs. The Committee will a point, with the agreement of the
major donors, an independent auditor for the audit of the Fund.
20.          Project accountability is extremely important Larger scale projects involving a
number of beneficiaries and sums in excess of US$500 will be expected to have their own Local
Project Committees established to oversee the implementation of the project and the proper use of
funds. These Committees might typically comprise the local administrat, community elders,
representives of the beneficiary group, and the responsible implementing agency. The Local
Project Committee will mainly be responsible to make sure that contractl commitmet were
adhered to and that project funds were properly utilized. On satisfactory completion of the
project, it wil sign a project completion certificate. The precise membership of Local Project
Committs wll be decided by the local communities themselves. Generly, it i8 expected hat
there wi}l be a standing core committee, made up of recognized local authorities (both formal and
infmal), to which additional members would be co-opted depending on the identity of the
project being discussed or under-review on any given day.
21.          Smaller projects, involving sums of less than US$500, and probably fewer
beneficiaries, will not be required to have a Local Project Commitee organized. Usually, these
projects would be small income generating projects to local self-help groups or individuals.
However, some degree of accountability to the wider community will be required as a condition
of project funding. Otherwise, it is difficult to see what local pres   can be brought to bear

against loan defaulters or to stop local 'comen' applying to the Fund. It is therefore proposed
ihat applications for projects worth less than US$500 wlll need to be accompanied by a formal
leter from the local administratio and/or recognized commnity elders from that area certifying
ihat applicants are bone fide local residents, of good character.

23.          The professional staff of the CU will consist of
o     a Unit Manager, with preferably a postgraduate degree in the social sciences or
range and at least 5 years experience in a managerial position;
o     a Range Ecologist or Social Scientist, with the same qualifications and experience
as above-
o     a Women's Affairs Officer, with at least a first degree in an applied soci science
(e.g., communiy development, social work) or other relevant discipline (eg.,
agriul extension, community health) and 2 years expeience;
O     an Accountat, with appropriate accountancy qalificDons and experience;
o     a Procrement-cum-Laison Officer, wifth at least Diploma level educadon and
extensive experience in government and private sector procement;
o     a Secreta, with appropriate typing and word processing skiJls.
24.          In addition, the Unit will be provided technical assistance from a Socio-Economic
132



ANNEX MA4
Page 7 of 15
Advisor and a Procurement Expert. The Socio-Economic Advisor will have a backgoWund in the
social sciences and a proven record of success In designing and managing this type of project.
He/she wil assist in setting up the Fund for the initial 13 months of project implementaion a
further eight months of consultancy inputs over the following three yeas will be available for
short-term follow up visits. His/her presence in the field, however, will be more prolonged,
because helshe will also be responsible for the socioeconomic component of the proposed
environmental monitoring plan (see Annex m.3, para. 13)4. As experience has showed that
procurement and disbursement procedures often determine the success or failure of social funds,
the Project will make avaiable the services of an experienced Procurement Expert for a total of
two months to emure that such procedures are set up in the most flexible and simple way
possible.
25.          Because of the large size of the area covered by the Fund and the limited presence
of experienced intermediary organizations, the Unit will need to employ five field officers to be
based in Jijiga, Degah Bur, Gode, Warder and Shilabo. These field officers wiW be Diploma
graduates with suitable backgrounds in commuty extension work, and will be responsible for
following up Fund activities in their area of operation. Each officer will be provided with a
motorcycle.
26.          The Unit may initially be based in Kebri Dehar town which is the historical center
of the Region and some 110 km from Shilabo. The town is the only center in Region V with a
thiopia Commercial Bank branch capable of holding cash reserves up to 2 miBlion BitL In
addition, there is piped water in the town and electricity for 5 hours at night. Beause much of
the work of the Unit wil take place outside Kebri Dehar, provision will be made in the budget to
rt a local house to provide office space in Shilabo, lijiga, Degah Bur, Warder and Gode.
However, other locations may be considered as the base of the Unit.
27.          The CU will have the following responsibilities:
o     Preparadon of a detailed operational manual which will describe the types of
projects that can be supported, the criteria to be used in assessing applications, the
kinds of organizations which can apply to the Fund, the different stages of
micro-project assessment and monitoring, and disbursement and procurement
procedures.
O     PromotIn and advert    of the Fund dtrough: meetngs with district officials
and local community elders, women's groups, cooperatives, govemment agencies
and non-governmenta organizations; preparation of appropriate promotional
material; and design and distribution of project request forms.
O     Assessment and appraial of project requests, including the technical, social and
3       mhe Socio-Eonomic Advisor could be rcrulted national or internationally.
Of the toal 31 working months for the Advisor, 10 monds wil be devotd to the sooo  componmet of
the prposed Nvonmnta monitoing plan, and therefore wi be paid out of tbat budget.

economic feasibility of the project, prepartion of an implementation program, and
review of the budget.
o     Disbursement of funds according to agreed procedures. Disbursement will be
in wenches up to a set and agreed limit. Occasionaly, the Unit will be expected to
procure items for local community groups.
O     Monitoring of micro-projects, in particular utilization of fumds according to the
agreed program and objectives identified together with the beneficiaries.
o     Preparation of quarterly reports for the Steering Committee detailing the micro-
projects supported, and any progress achieved and problems encountered.
Relationip  with other Organ=tions
28.          The CU wil be formaly linked to the Regional Govement, but it will be
responsible to Its own Steeing Committee. Although its relationship with other social funds In the
country, such as the Ethiopian Social Rehabilitation Fund', will be informa, it is considered
importat that  ular communication be mainained and possibilities of collaboration explored
when appropriate. At the district level the CU will work with its collaborating partners, which
may be the district adminision, non-governmental organizations, loIal community groups, and
government agencies, such as SERP or mainline ministries. It is these partners that will be
drecy responsible for micro-project implementation on the basis of project requests submitted to
and approved by the CU. In addition, the CU would liaise with the various Local Project
Commies organzed to supervise micro-projecs in the different project locations. As discussed
above, hese committees would generally need to be organized as a condition of project approval
and their composition would need to be approved by the CU.
M ro-Projet Cyde
29.          Projects wfll pass through a typical project cycle. This cycle will consist of a
number of progressive stages:
(a)    Project request. The project cycle starts once a project request form has been
received by the CU. This request is assigned a file and classified according to
category and geographical location. The basic details will be entered into a
computer database.
(b)    Projed a_ ent. The project will then be assessed according to agreed
criteria, such as sustainabiity, poverty alleviation, number of beneficiaries, impact
on women, and kind of group involved. (nhese criteria will be established in
detail in the Operational Manual and explained in promotional literature). Field
This fnd is pas of the Eemageny Rebabilulation and Rensucon Project (RRP) and it is intended to Oast
on a pilt bais in Shoa and rigy, but lbt expanded to other regions.
134



ANNEX MA4
Page 9 of 1S
visits will probably need to be made during this stage. If the CU feels it
necessary, it may call in a specialist consultant to technically assess the project.
(c)    Project approval. If the assessment is positive, a project document will be
prepared. MIis document will detail the project objectives, beneficiaries,
implementing agency and procedures, budget and implementation time table.
Because of the different scales of cost involved in the different types of project to
be supported by the Fund (e.g., an infrastuctra project involving the building of
a health clinic is likely to cost a lot more than a project providing seed capital for
a women's group), the CU will operate different ficial thresholds according to
'type' of project funded:
for infrastrumural projects, which are likely to be the most expensive,
the CU will have authority to commit up to US$20,000 per contract;
for social projects, the CU's authority will be up to US$10,000 per
contract;
for income geneaing projects, which for the most part will be very
small, the CU's authority will be up to US$3,000 per conact.
The Steering Committee will meet quarterly to approve projects with esimated
financial costs above these thresholds. Becase the intention of the Fund is to
spread benefits as widely as possible, it wi  be necessary to establisf absolute
financial ceilings for different types of project and maimm distric; allocations.
These limits will be initially defined in the Operational Manual, but could be
revised periodically.
(d)   Project monitorit. During the implementation phase, micro-projects will be
monitored against agreed indicators. On completion of the micro-project (e.g.,
when construction is finished or the loan is repaid), a completion report will be
prepared and the project file closed.
Monioing and Evalution
30.          The participatory approach to be adopted by the Calub Community Development
Fund-the process of consultation, the use of implementing agencies with strong credibility at the
rsroots, and of micproject committee representing the beneficiaries-will provide the
foundation for a participatory monitring and evaluatir n system based on regular follow-up visits
(at least once a month) and progress reports (monthly and quarterly).
31.          The monitoring of Fmud micro-projects will be built in to the overall
environmentl monitoring of the impact of the Calub Gas Project, primarily (but not exclusively)
in its socioeconomic component. Information obtained by the CU as part of its regular fotlow up
of micro-projects will form part of this wider monitoring system.
135



ANNEX mA
Page 10 of 15
32.          Given the location of the CU in Kebri Debar and its particular responsibility to
monitor the micro-projects it supports in the project area, It makes sense to locate in Kebri Dehar
as well the Environmental Monitoring Unit which will be responsible for the more general
socioeconomic component of the Monitoring Plan proposed in the Environmental Assessment.
The Environmental Monitoring Unit would be attached to the CU, and share its facilities and the
services of the Advisor. In particular, of the total of 33 working months proposed for the
Technical Assistance Advisor, 10 months would be paid for out of the environmental monitoring
budget. Such a set up should ensure that the activities of the Fund are carefully monitored, even
after micro-projects are officially completed, and that lessons from the successes and failures of
micro-projects are kept in mind when implementing new micro-projects. [For more details on the
proposed environmental monitoring plan, including total budget, refer to the Environmental
Assessment Report).
Financial Affangements
Disbursement and Prolurement
33.          The CU will have its own local currency account in Kebri Dehar which will be
regularly replenished by the Regional Government. This account wiUl be used to fund the bulk of
micro-projects. The Project Manager will be signatory to the account. In addition, the Regional
Govermnent will have a Special Deposit Account in US$ with the National Bank of Ethiopia; this
account will be used to replenish the MU's account in Kebri Debar and to purchase goods
requiring payment in foreign exchange.
34.          Disbursement and procurement procedures wiUl depend on the type of community
assisted, that is, on the capacity of the intended beneficiaries to procure needed goods and
services and to draw from a bank account. Three cases can be distinguished as follows:
(a)   the beneficiary does not have the capacity to establishloperate an account,
either for legal or practical reasons: in this case beneficiaries will not be expected
to open an account to receive disbursements from the MU, and the CU will be
responsible for procuring materials and entering into contracts with contractors on
behalf of the community;
(b)   the beneficiary does not have the capacity to establish/operate an account, but
an NGO or government agency sponsors the micro-project: in this case, the
CU would disburse funds on the account of the sponsor, who will be responsible
for procurement and for entering into contract for needed services;
(c)   the beneficiary has the capacity to establish/operate an account: in this case, a
Micro-Project Committee is created, who will open an account to receive
disbursements from the CU and will be responsible for procuring needed material
and entering into contracts for needed services, according to the Fund
procurement regulations (see below).
35.          Where the implementation agency is a local community group itself, that is, no
136



ANNEX MA
Page 11 of 15
sponsoring agency is involved, the CU will have to determine whether it is reasonable to expect
beneficiaries to open and operate an account for their micro-project. Whi}e the Operational
Mamnal will provide detailed guidelines in this sense, it is anticipated that decisions will be based
on considerations such as the amount of money involved, the intended use for the money, the
educational backgound of the beneficiaries, and difficulties in reaching a bank.
36.          As a rule (cases b and c above), disbursements will take place in tranches, and the
first tranche will not exceed 30 percent of the total. Possible exceptions wW be cases in which tfhe
micro-project centers aroutd the provision of an important piece of equipment, such as a pump or
a generator; in these instances, disbursement may require a very large initlal instalment. Tranches
will normally only be paid against receipts or sttements of expenditure. It will be the
responsibility of the micro-project holder to keep proper accounts acceptable to the CU. lhe CU
accountant will be responsible for checkdng these accounts to ensure proper use of fimds.
37.          The Calub Community Development Fund will have independent procurement
procedures outside the normal Regional Govemment procedures, similarly to what has already
been agreed by the Government for the operation of the Ethiopian Social Rehabilitation Fund
financed by the World Bank. The CU may import items for its own use, such as vehicles and
computers, or in support of micro-projects, such as building supplies and water pumps.
38.          Procurement regulations will be as follows:
local shopping for civil works, goods and services up to US$30,000;
local compedtive bidding for civil works, goods and services between
US$30,000 and 200,000;
international competitive bidding for goods over US$200,000.
Credit
39.          Income generating micro-projects wiU involve a credit component. As a number
of successful grass-root credit projects have been documented worldwide (e.g., the Grameen Bank
in Bangladesh and ACCION in Latin America), income generating microprojects should be set up
taking into consideration such experiences. For example, interest rates should be at commercial
levels, banking procedures should be simple and quick, requirements for collaterals should be
"soft' and possibly replaced by group guarantees, and credit liability should be shared by group
members. Most iraportanty, field staff should be responsive to the needs and interests of its
clientele, and carry out pre- and post-credit supervision with extreme diligence. These tasks are
normally eased by the borrowers themselves being organized into groups.
40.          The beneficiaries of the Fund's credit component are likely to comprise returnees
from Somalia living in the small towns and settlements in the project area (as defined in para.
12). In fact, while pe±  a1ent residents of the area tend to be nomadic or seminomadic pastoralists
with little interest and no experience in micro-enterprises, many retus have experience and
skills in various trades, such as leather working, which they have brought with them from
Somalia. They do not have, however, the means to start up small businesses.
137



AMXM.4
Page 12 of 15
41.          The account of the revolving credit fund will be kept distinct and separate from
the Fund general account. An initial sum of US$500,000 wiUl be paid into the account to start the
fund, and the sums  of money loaned will be small-less ta US$3,000 per loan. The credit fund
wiUl be regularly audited.
42.          The CU will be responsible, through its field staff, for advertising the credit
scheme, explaining its functioning to all those interested, and following up on loans. A simple
manual on credit operations will be prepared to be used by field staff and group leaders. Where
either individuals or groups in a locality consistently default on the loans the local community
elders will be informed, and no new loans to the community in the area initiated.
43.          The revolving credit find should be operated on a trial basis in the first year. As
experience in the operation of the fnd is gained, appropriate modifications to the design of the
scheme will be carried out. Details on how the credit will operate, including who and what kinds
of activities will be eligible, will be explained in a specific section of the operational manual of
the Fund to be prepared by the Adviser within the first three months of project implementation.
The manual will need to be approved by the Steering Committee at the Regional Govemment
headquarters before becoming effective.
Budget
44.          The bulk of funds allocated to the Calub Community Development Fund will be
used to fund micro-projects. However, there will inevitably be some administrative costs involved
in managing the Fund and operating the CU in Kebri Dehar. Becase of the remoteness of the
area and difficult work conditions, it will be necessary to pay national staff above normal official
salary levels. Otherwise, it is unlikely that the right calibre of staff wil be attracted to the Uni It
is also important to establish from the start the principle that priority in makig appointments to
the Unit wiUl be given to Somali spealdng Ethiopian nationals living in Region V. It is suggested,
however, that professional staff be selected in such a way as to minimize their vulnerability to
clan pressure.
45.          Althougi; the approach to be adopted by the CU wil be to ensure an element of
cost sharing through local communities' contrbution to micro-projects In either cash or kind, it is
difficult to know at this stzge the proportion of recovered funds to total funds which this approach
wil generate. Hence, it is difficult to dermine the extent to which the Fund will be replenished
during the five years of operation of the Calub Gas Development Project.
46.          The initial budget for the Fund will be on a grant basis for the first five years.
Thereafter, it is anticipated that the Regional Government would contribute to the manteance of
the Fund out of tax revenues, including those generated by the Calub Gas Company. In addition,
other donors may be attracted to invest in the Fund. It is important that in principle the Regional
Goverment agree to contribute a proportion of the tax revenues generated by Calub to support
the Fund in future before the initial grant establishing the Fund is made. The total sum allocated
to the Fund for the support of micro-projects, excluding the costs of the CU, will be
US$3,500,000 over five years.
138



ANNEX MA

47. The above is intended to delineate the basic principles and mode of operation of the Catub
Community Development Fund. It must be realized that a detaUed operational manual needs to be
prepared spelling out the details of Fund procedures. In particular, the institutional framework of
the Fund will have to be detemined more precisely once the Regiona Government for Region V
is in place. When this happens, presumaly in the early part of 1993, the formal institutional
details of the Fund will need to be worked out with Regiona Govetnment representatives as well
as regional representatives of the mainline ministries.
47.          Before the Fund is finalized, certain basic principles need to be discussed and
agreed on:
o     that the Fund's procurement and disbursement procedures will be as free from
bureaucratic restrictions as it Is compatible with sound accounting practices;
o     that the major part of the Fund will be used for micro-projects, e.g.,
infastructrl projects worth less than US$10,000, so as to avoid the temptation
to regional authorities of using the Fund for large infrastruct  programs;
o     that the Fund will be clearly identified in the minds of project beneficiaries with
the Calub Gas Project, otherwise a major rationale for the fund wil be removed
and confusion may arise with national programs such as the Ethiopian Social
Rehabilitation Fund;
o      th the tax revenues from the Calub Gas Company or petroleum product sales in
Region V will be partly re-invested in the Fund;
o     that the staff employed in the CU will be Somali speakers with a thorough
Inowledge of the local culture;
o     that CU staff will be paid salaries adequate to attract and retain expert staff;
o     that the people of Calub itself and the immediate surrounding area, within Shilabo
District, will be given priority in the disbusement of funds.

CALUB GAS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Technica Aance to the Minitry of Mines and Energy:
Petroleum Exploration Promotion
1.        Petroleum Promotion Project Objectives. The objective of the petoleum
promotion is to undergo a maor updae of the pre-existing data base provided by BEICIP as a
result of the successfil 1985 promotion, to integrate these data Into an industrily acctable
format, and to market the results to the international petroleum industy. Following a show of
interest by interested oil companies, the MME will provide access to the required data ses,
negotate area: of interest and terms for their exploration, and sign the resulting production
sharing contracts.
Promoion components
2.        Daft gathering, analysis, integration and bterpretaton. The focus of the
promotion will be on exploration of the remaining open areas of the Ogaden Basin. The newly
acqired data from the existing Maxxus and Hunt license areas cannot be incorporated into the
promotional dat set for reasons of confidentiality, but should be included in the confidendal
nterpretion for use by the MME.
3.        The remainder of the data which was not included in the previous BEICIP
interpretation consists of the data acquired by the Soviet Exploration Expedition Project. This
includes 7,000 km of seismic, 12,000 gravity stations, 16 deep wells and a large number of
dslllower stratigraphic and water wells. Ihese data need to be incorporated into the existing
BEICIP data set, reprocessed where needed, intereted, put into a computerized data set, and
evaluated for the petroleum potentia.
4.         The Gambela area of southwestern Ethiopia is currently under license, and litdt new
data is available. However there is believed to be useful topographic and geophysical data
avaflable which was not utilized by BEICIP and this should be incorporated into the data package.
5.         Previously unexplored frontier sedimentary basins in other parts of Ethiopia require
the acquisition of basic surface data by the Geological Survey, and incorporated into the
promotional document.
6.        To accomplish this work, the MME wishes to maximize the utilization of Ethiopian
experdse, under the supervision of international experts either full time or on a periodic basis.
143

7.         Pnomotonal Work. The effort of convetn this evaluated data set into an
intationaly acceptable promotional document will reqr the assistance of international exmert
in the areas of computerization, cartgraphy, publication, distribution, marketing and promodto
acdvItY, Inluding direct contact with interestd oil companies. IDA assistance has been requested
in these areas
8.        Manpower Development and Equipment Purhae. Much of the previous PEPP
staff have now gone elsewhere, and their places need to be filled. The new appoitees will
reuire training in the skills needed for data intepretation and promotion. In addition computer
efclities, fax machines and office equipment as well as vehicles are required for the effective
promotion of Ethiopia's petroleum resources. UNDP funding has been provided for these
purposes under the execution of the IDA.

CALUB GAS DEVEOPMENT PROJECT
LPG Stoves Development Program
Terms of Reference
Bacround
1.           Ethiopia Is predominantly dependent on blomass fuds (fiuelwood, charcoal,
dung and agricultural residues) for energy. Almost 94% of energy comed is from
traditonal blomass energy sourc of which approximaely 99 percet is cons    by domestc
households. lhe main source of biomass energy is fiuelwood which is supplied largely
through uncontrolled cuttng of forests. While due atnton  is being given to reafbrestation
and coseaton, at present fuelwood consumption is not sustainable. 'he dependence on
this adonal source of energy have led to desertification and decreased agricultural
productivity. A joint UNDP/World Bank Energy Sector Management Asiance Program
(ESMAP) reconfirmed the conclusion of previous governent studies which identified the
supply of household fuels as a major issue in the Ethiopian Energy Sector. In order to
addess this problem effecvely, the Government with the assistance of the World Bank has
deised a mnmber of strateies. One of these is the development of the Calub Gas field in
order to increase the supply of altemate fuels, pardeularly LPG, for household consumption.
One of the components of the Calub Gas Development Project is the stoves development
program (SDP).
Objeives
2.           Ihe overall objective of this program is to provide the Government of
Ethiopia with a comprehensive basis for policy, planning and decision making, with a view to
formulating a realistic strategy for the mss production and dinaon of least cost LPG
stoves in order to promote usage of LPG and encourag iterfuel s on.
Specific Activities under the Program
(a)    Review avaiable studies and information concening cooking pratices in
Ethiopian households.
(b)    Review and assess curredy used iLPG soves desigs in order to detmine
their technical efficiency and consumer aceptance.

Detailed Project Capital Costs
Commercial Component: The Caub Company
Projec Prepaaon
1.           Costs incured for the technical and economic feasibility study (ncluding
conceptual design) of the Calub plant, road surveys, corporte structuring consultancy,
technical assistance for promoting the Calub Company to private investors (up to Credit
Effectiveness), and other technical assistance are included in this estimate. These costs,
financed by Project Preparation Funds (PPF) are estimated to be US$1.17 million and do not
include project preparation expenses covered through a US$0.5 million Japanese Trust Fund.
Well Completions, Subsurface Equipment and Related Producdon Facilities
2.           Field exploration and drilling costs associated with the nine existing wells
(Calub-2 througb Calub-10) are treated as sunk costs. Ihe field was developed for its gas
reserves and the cost of this development may be recovered when the gas, rather han LPG
and liquids, is commercialized.
3.           The cost of completing the wells and preparing them for production however,
is a valid project cost, estimated at a cost ranging from US$500,000-750,OOO/well, for a total
expense of US$7.0 million (Consultant report on file).

CALUB GAS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Markets and Marketing
A. Market for Project Outts
Non-LPG Petroleum Products trm Calub
1.           At the eected yield level of about 45,000 tons/year, gasoline, keosene, and
diesel/gasoi from Calub amount to about 6 pecent of natoa petroleum fuel supply
(746,000 tons in 1989/90) and 13 to 15 percent of all petroleum product imports (See Table
2.1-331,000 tons in 1989/90; the balance of 410,000 tons was supplied by the Assab
refinery). These non-LPG Calub products constitte a small fractio of national supply and no
special amragements are deemed necessary to absorb them into the Ethiopian market. Market
statistcs inate sufficient existng demand within the newly fod Reglon V and the
province of Hararge (Table 2.5). For ihis market area, Calub supply is ected to satisfy
about 90 to 100 percent of projected 1996 demand for gasoline, 80 to 90 percent of the
demand for kerosene, and 30 to 40 percent of the demand for diesel. The propordon of
regional demand supplied from Calub will decrese as demand continues to grow as per
market forecass (Section IU-C, par. 2.10). hivate dbution cmpnies opeating in
Ethiopia wM take Calub products at the plant gate and distribute them through exitg or
newly added retail oudets.
2.           The regional market will be supplied from storage facilities to be cntucted
at the Calub plant and exsting storage at Dire Dawa (Table 2.6). Some additional investment
in storage capacity in Dire Dawa will be needed as demand grows and if t is deemed
necessary to increase supply coverage from the curret level of 11 to 13 days.
3.           Transportation of products will be handled by the distribution companies,
direcly or by subcontractig to private transporter. Contingent upon timely road
rehbilitaion, it is estated that about 30 taktralers (30 cubic meters per tanker) will be
requked, assuming an average turaround time of 4-5 days for the target markets around
Dire Dawa. This tuck fleet entails an estmated investment of US$3.6 million (excluding
duties and taxes) to be met entirely by the private sector.
LPG from Calub
4.           Pending the firher development of Calub's substntial gas reserves, LPG is
expected to be Calub's most significant contribution to Ethiopia's energy needs at this stage.
The Calub plant is designed to produce about 21,000 tos/year of LPG, which would result in
163

over a four-fold increase over the current supply from the Assab refinery. If imported, this
Calub production would cost about US$6.6 million per year (CIF Assab assumig optimat
order quantities). LPG is typically used as a cooking fuel in households and commercial
establishments (hotels, restaurants, hospitals, etc.). Suppressed demand and substitution of
woodfuels and kerosene with LPG will be the primary parameters driving the market
absorption of this additional LPG. Ihe rate of absorption will be strongly influenced by
market development measures undertaken and the institution of market-based pricing before
the Calub plant goes on stream (paras. 12-19).
Natlonal LPG Demand Estimates and Target Markets for Calub LPG
S.           High investment, operating and transportation costs associated with a LPG
distribution network, relative to other household fuels, make highly populated urban areas the
ntura markets for LPG. Given the currently low consumption level of modern fuels for
cooking purposes, LPG consumption wil mainly replace traditional fuels which are by far the
most commonly used. There may also be some substitution of kerosene with LPG and a
second step substitution of tradiional fuels with kerosene, possibly among a lower income
segment of the population. Modern commercial fuels are likely to compete against traditional
fuels (mainly wood) only in areas where traditional fuels are commercially traded, viz. larger
urban areas and possibly in smaller towns where wood resources have been severely depleted.
Urban areas account for about 10 percent of the fuelwood consumed in Ethiopia. Substition
of this consumption with modern fuels in conjunction with reforestation and income enhancing
programs targeting both rural and urban areas will make a significant contribution to
mitigating deforestation in Ethiopia.
6.           The consumption levels of woodfiuels, and suppressed demand for modern
fuels, in Addis Ababa and the Dire Dawa area (mcluding Harar and Jijiga) make these the
logical target markets for Calub LPG. Distribution to other areas, particularly in the north
where woodfuel supplies have been virtually exhausted, is also possible. Depending upon
tansportation costs, direct LPG imports may be more competitive than Calub supply in some
areas geographically closer to import sources.
7.           Historically, LPG supply in Ethiopia (excluding Eritrea) has consisted of
5,000-7,000 tons supplied to Addis Ababa from the Assab refinery. Suppressed national
demand has been estimated by the distribution companies to be In the 50,000 to 80,000
ton/year range with Addis Ababa alone estimated at over 25,000 tons/year. This potentia
demand is supported by woodfuel consumption stastics diused below, growth in kosene
consumption (rable 2.5) and the fact that LPG offers considerable savings and convenience to
consumers at current prices (para. 1.33) and will continue to be competitive at economic
prices (Annex IV.1B).
8.           National energy statistics (Table 1.4) indicate that about 94 percent of
Ethiopia's energy supply is in the form of biomass fuels consisting predominantly of woody
biomass (about 76 percent) with the balance being dung, crop residues and charcoal.
Woodfuels are consumed mainly (93 percent) by households with the balance being used by
cottage type industries and for commercial purposes (hotels, hospitals, etc.). For the year
1989/90, the Ethiopian Energy Authority estimated total woodfuels consption to be 35
164



AnnexIY
Page 3 of 12
million tons of which about 33 million tons was wood and 2 mtion tons was chaoal. Urban
household consumption alone accounted for some 3.2 mitlion tons of woodfiuels, equivalent to
275,000 tons of LPG on a usefil energy basis. An es_ted 600,000 tons was consumed in
Addis Ababa and about 150,000 tons in Dire Dawa, Hatar and Jijiga, an LPG equivalent of
50,000 and 14,000 tonslyear respectively. About 2.2 million tons of fuelwood is consumed by
industry and for commercial uses (hotels, restaurant, etc.), a substantial part in urban areas.
9.           LPG is a potenta  subsftiute fuel for woodfels used for domestic and
commercial cooking purposes. Te EEA has eGimated that woodfuel demand will grow at an
annul rate of 2.6 pecn between 1990 and 2010. Whh ura populations expected to grow
faster than national average rate of 2.9 percent/year, annual demand growth for domestic fuels
in urban areas s expected to be in the 3 to 6 percent range. In the absence of an cease in
the supply of alternae fuels and assuming a demand growth of 3 percent/year, the LPG
equivalent of annua woodfuel demand by 1996 (first year of Calub supply) would be about
60,000 tons in Addis Ababa and 17,000 tons in the Dire Dawa area'.
10.          Substtution Mechanism. Switching from woodfuels to LPG is favored by
lower expenditures on LPG per unit of buseful" heat (even at economic prices) and by the
comfort enhancing and time saving attributes of LPG. Obstacles to the substitution include
higher start-up costs (stoves/cylinders, cooking utensils, etc.), limitations of using LWG for
certain cooking functions (e.g. woodfuels or electricity are favored for the baking of injera),
higher disbu       per purchase of LPG (which is currently packaged in 12 to 15 kg
cylinders), and, in the past, unreliability of supply (discussed in Section I-D). At the
economic price of LPG, including cost of appliances, LPG is expected to offer consumers
considerable financial and time/convenience benefits over fuelwood. Lower income segments,
unable to afford the high start-up costs (stove, cylinder, etc.) associated with LPG use will,
however, be more likely to switch to kerosene, which has substantily lower start-up costs
an LPG. As LPG supply expands, higher income consumers wil switch from woodfuels and
kerosene to LPG, increasing the availability of kerosene to lower income groups and
consequently faciliag woodfuel substitution among this segment The net impact will be the
increased substiution of woodfuels with modern fuels.
11.          The  cted Calub production of 21,000 tons/year of LPG accounts for about
27 percent of the potenIal demand projected for 1996 in Addis Ababa and the Dire Dawa
area. The rate at which the target markets are projected to absorb Calub LPG is 10,000 tons
in 1996 (13 percent of potental demand), 15,000 tons in 1997 (20 percent of potentia
demand) and the fkll 21,000 tons by 1998 (25 percent of the demand projected for 1998). The
distribution companies consider this to be an achievable rate of absorption. Initial absorption
of Calub LPG in the Wire Dawa market will depend to a large extent on preparation of market
irastructure prior to pla  start-up. This preparation incudes the instalation of a botding
plant and distribudon network (pars. 15).

Market Deveopment
12.          Curent Supply. LPG is presently bottled and distibuted by AGIP and Shell
only through their bottling plants in Addis Ababa. (Shell also has bottling plants in Asmara
and Assab). Shell and AGIP each have a LPG storage capacity of 170 tons in Addis and a
filling capacity of 1,000 cylinders per shift. Currently there is storage and bottling capacity of
16,000 to 17,000 tons/year in Addis Ababa (assuming a two-shift/day operation), divided
equally between Shell and AGIP. Present capacity utilization is about 35 percent, limited by
LPG supply and shortage of cylinders. Mobil is in the process of installing a LPG bottling
plant and storage in Addis Ababa with a capacity comparable with Shell and AGIP.
13.          Shell markets its LPG in bottles of 12.5 kg and 52 kg for domestic and
commercW uses respectively while AGIP has a wider range consisting of 10, 15, 25 and 100
kg bottles. The distribution companies supply bottled LPG to retailers under an exclusive
contract. Retailers supposedly make home deliveries although severe supply shortages have
caused diuptions in the actual functioning of the distribution system. The bottles themselves
remain the property of the distributors but are available for use by consumers for a one time
deposit of Birr 80. Both AGIP and Shell follow internationally accepted safety practices
regarding LPG packaging and use. Cylinders are inspected periodically for damage and metal
fatigue and discardeu if they do not meet Shell/AGIP international standards. A small amount
of LPG is distributed in bulk (2000 kg) to large commercial and instutional (hospitals, etc.)
users.
14.          Future Situation. Making Calub LPG avalable to consumers in the target
urban markets will require investment in additional storage and bottling capacity mn the Dire
Dawa area), LPG cylinders, and tankers/trucks for bulk and bottled LPG transportation. In
Addis Ababa, based on the projected consumption of 20,000 tons/year (15,000 tons from
Calub, the balance from Calub being consumed in the Dire Dawa area), the current storage
capacity of 500 tons (including Mobil) covers about 9 days of consumption, which, though
not ideal, should suffice. An additional 300 to 400 tons stotge (15 days coverage) may be
added as the market expands. The addition of Mobil's plant in Addis Ababa provides
sufficient bottling capacity to supply Calub and Assab LPG production to the Addis Ababa
and surrounding markets.
15.          The Dire Dawa area will require about 200 to 250 tons of storage and one
1,000 bottles/shift bottling plant. Based on estimates from distributors and plant equipment
manufacturers, cost of a bottiing plant, ancillary facilities, fork-lifts, etc. is about US$0.5-1.0
million. Additional storage facilities are estimated to cost US$25,O0 per 100 m3 (50 tons).
16.          Bulk LPG transport from Calub is projected to require about 25-30
tanker/trailers (30 m3 per vehicle, 8 day turn-around for Addis Ababa and 5 days for Dire
Dawa) estimated to cost US$5 million (at US$180,000 each). An expanded fleet of
trucks/vans will be needed for bottled LPG delivery to retail outlets and domestic and
commercial consumers. Costs are estimated at US$1.5 million.
17.          Affordable stoves (and regulators) need to be made available for purchase by
consumers. Average annual LPG consumption per household, by those who have access to
166



^DnnLIy
Page 5 of 12
LPG, is estimated to be about 80 to 100 kg. At this consuwption rate, and assuming some
bulk LPG consumption for commercial purposes, Calub production could supply atound
200,000 households annually, which implies a requirement for at least 200,000 bottles and
stovestegulators. Botfle costs are estimated at US$30 for a 10 to 15 kg bottle and US$10 for
a 5 kg botde; stoves cost about US$35 and above, FOB Etbiopia. LPG market infrastructure
development costs are summaried In Table 1.
18.          The project's success rests to a large extent on investment in these
downsteam facilities being made by the private distribution companies and other
entrepreneurs. A rvision of the government's LPG pricing policy, as outlined In Section IV-
B, and the continuance of a liberal road freight tariff policy, are key pre-conditions to
attracting the private capital needed to expand and operate the LPG distibution network, and
are therefore included as conditions for the Credit.

assist with an LPG product and safety awareness program, establish LPG national standards,
and investigate the feasibility of local stove mamifacre or adaptation to suit local economic
conditions and cooking habits. Distributors and the Govenment may consider adopting the
followi-g facilitation measures: (I) Institution of credit schemes to help finance the purchase
of LPG stoves by consumers; and (ii) packaging LPG in smaller (3 to 5 kg) botdes in order to
facilitate transportation, and reduce per purchase disbursement for lower income groups.

B. LPG Pricing Policy and Impact on Intfrrfuwl Substitution
20.          Commercialization of the Calub gas deposit will result in the first domestic
production of petroleum products. In order to ensure economic efficiency all petroleum
products in Ethiopia should be priced according to the economic efficiency criteria (based on
import parity prices) outlined below. The success of the Project depends to a large extent on
all Calub products being priced according to this criteria. However, because LPG from
Calub will substantially increase national supply, requires substantial downstream investments,
and non-LPG Calub products constitute a smaller percentage of national consumption, a
relatively quick institution of a revised LPG pricing policy, with a rational linkage to kerosene
pricing, is critical for the project's success. Also, with the exception of LPG and kerosene
(which is subsidized), other petroleum products already reflect their economic import parity
prices.
21.          A more comprehensive assessment of all petroleum prices will be undertaken
under the Petroleum Pricing and Market Structure Study financed under the project. The
recommendations of the Study are expected by April 1995. LPG and kerosene prices
established under the economic efficiency criteria described below will be fine-tuned by
incorporating the findings of this study, which will elaborate upon the determination of import
parity prices, provide options for linking the price of kerosene and LPG, recommend suitable
taxation policy, and detennine the impact of economic pricing on consumer behavior and on
the financial viability of LPG producers/importers (Assab refinery, Calub Company and EPC)
and the distribution companies.
22.          Downstream investment in the transport, bottling, marketing, and retail
distribution of LPG is expected to be made by the private distribution companies and other
entrepreneurs. The goverunent's LPG pricing policy should, therefore, provide the necessary
incentives to attract this private capital, without undermining economic efficiency or the
objective of rerlacing traditional woodfuels with modern fuels. This section provides the basic
principles for deriving applicable benchmark transfer2, wholesale and retail prices for LPG in
Ethiopia.
23.          When Calub production begins, the Ethiopian LPG industry will be based on
two producers, the Calub Company and the Assab refinery, two or more bottling companies,
and several retail agencies/outlets. As supply constraints are alleviated, market forces are
expected to set LPG retail prices at the various retail locations. The oligopolistic structure of
the production and bottling industries leaves this area more susceptible to price collusion and
therefore may require some form of regulation. It Is theretore recommended that retail and
the wholesale price of LPG be temporarily regulated. As competition in the distribution
sub-sector increases, these prices may evenually be liberalized. In addition, it is
recommended that LPG and kerosene prices be linked, with kerosene also priced at its
2      la this casw %s( pnice is the price the disdbutioa copaniespay to LPG impoters or producers.

economic value. Ibis is necessary both in order to prevent distortions in LPG demand and to
eliminate consumer surpluses in the kerosene market.
Economi EMciency Criteria for LPG Pricing
24.           In principle, the estimation of the economic price of LPG is straightforward.
If LPG were to be imported, its economic market price as an Interaonally traded
commodity should be set at the import parity price (IPP), CIF Assab or Djibouti, adjusted
for: (i) investment in adequate port berthing, unloading and storage facilities to guarantee a
level of continuous supply that Is comparable with the domestic (Calub) supply option; (ii) the
scarcity value of foreign exchange; (iii) economic cost of inland transportation to the target
markets/bottling plants; and (iv) economic costs of botding and distrution. This basis
establishes the benchmak wholesale price exclusive of taxes; It domestically produced
LPG results in a price higher than this benchmark price, then it would be cheaper to
import LPG rather than produce it domestically.
25.           Typically, assuming inernational standards and market prices, Assab refinery
LPG should be the least-cost source of LPG3. Ihis basis would result in an ex-refinery price
of US$185 per ton, compared with the actual (current) price of $156/ton. Obtaining increased
qaties of LPG from the Assab refinery, for insmce in qu;ties recoverable from Calub,
is however, not possible without major new investmentse. In the absence of Calub
production, imports would be the least-cost option to supplying increased quantities of LPG,
therefore, It is economically justifiable to base domestic LPG prices on the IPP. This
justification is fiuther elaborated upon in Section V, para. 5.2.
26.           The LPG import parit price for Ethiopia may be derived by adding to the
FOB Middle East Gulf price, ocean freight costs for economic order quanities, amortzed
investment costs for upgrading port and storage facilities, reasonable transaction (letter of
credit, etc.) costs, and port receiving and handling costs5. This IPP is currently esimated
at $306/ton CIF Assab. An alternate method of emat  the IPP is to link it to the IPP of a
close substitute which is regularly imported, in this case kerosene. The IPP of kerosene is
$207/ton which is equivalent to an LPG price of $290/ton on a "useful" heat equivalent basis.
This price is comparable with the "constructed" IPP of $306 derived by the first method.
27.           Ihe IPP, adjusted for economic inland transportation costs, and for the
scarcity value of foreign exchange (if there is a variation between official and market

exchange rates) would be the approximate transfer price betwen the producer/bulk supplier
(Assab refinery, Calub Company or imports) and the bottler/distributor. This price would
provide the basis of the supply contract to be negotiated between producers and distribution
companies. Adding to this transfer price the economic costs (including an adequate rate of
return on investment) of storage, bottling and marketlng, wil result in the wholesabe
(regulated) LPG price, ex-botting plant gate.
28.          Retail prices can be derived by adding the appropriate economic costs of
bottle transport to retail centers and consumers, other operating cost, and a reasonable profit
margin. The flexibility of these prices to adjust to changes In relevant costs can be aided by a
mandatory annual or bi-annual price review by the regulatory and commercial entities.
Recommended Pricing Structure
29.          Based on the above discussion, it is recoended that the regulated wholesale
price be set according to the following formula:
Wholesale Price     LPG Import Party Price + Port Charges + ExpXlcit Taxes +
Inand Transport costs to Bottling Plant (Addi re Dawa) +
Bottler/Distribution Company Opwating Margin
Retail Price =      Wholesale Price + Taxes (if any) + Economic Retail Distribution
Costs
The inland transportation costs to be included in the fornmla should be those from the least-
cost supply source (Assab in the case of Addis Ababa and Calub, Assab or Djibouti if there is
a bottling plant in Dire Dawa). The above formula assumes that the official exchange rate
coincides with the market exchange rate available to petroleum importers.
Derivation of Prices and Inpact on Interfuel Substitution
30.          Comparison of Economic and Actual (Current) Prices. Economic and
actual cost comparions of LPG, kerosene (ts close substute) and fuelwood for the Addis
Ababa market are summrized in Table 2 below. As described above, economic prices for
LPG and kerosene are derived using import parity prices, and esfimated economic costs of
transportation, distribution and retail. Currently, part of the retailer margins accrue to the
distributor who is also responsible for delivering bottled LPG to the retail outlets. In the case
of fuelwood, as a major part of the wood sold in urban markets is scavenged, its economic
price is derived by adding a premium to the market price to cover costs of natural foresty
management to allow production on a sustinable basis. Transportation costs will vary for
each bottling plant and retail location and will therefore have an impact on wholesale and
retail prices. For Addis Ababa, inland transportation from Assab is expected to continue to
cost less than supply from Calub or Djibouti. These actual and estmatd economic transport
costs are used to derive the wholesale benchmark price for Addis Ababa. For a bottling plant
to be located in Dire Dawa, economic taportation costs from Calub, expected to be the
least transportation cost supply source, should be used to derive the Dire Dawa wholesale

supply increases, unit distrbuton costs should fai on acount of ger  capa  utilization,
as is reflected in the economic magins. Economic margins for retailers plus distributors are
estimated at $88/ton compared with the current margin of $131/ton (at about 35 percent
capacity utilization). This retaier margin is only indicative. As the economic wholesale price
derived above is based on sutn tly higher LPG supplies, economic distribution margins
should not be ins_ti      until supplies increase. The impact of instutin  economic pricing for
LPG and kerosene on the objective of substiting traditional fuels (rimaly fuelwood) with
modern fuels is asessed below.

33.          LPG/Kose Economic Pricng and Impact on Fudwood Substituon.
Compaion of the economic retail pries derlved bovwe Cb    3), mumins curent taat
rate for LPG, and the actual urb  maket price of fbdwood, result in tho following price
advantage ower price) for modern fuls:
(a)    Puelwood s more expensive than LPG by 33 pecen If stove and cylinder
(appliances) costs aro excluded, and 13 pern If applianes ae included;
(b)    Fudwood 1s more expensive than keoen by 77 percent If stove costs ar
excluded, and 69 percent If stove coots are icluded.
Tis suges that toe Implementaion of economic price for LPG and kosen wll stll
allow thes fuels (especially kerosen) to be competvo agnt fudwood In targetd ura
market where wood 1 a commercial fud. The icres  supply of moden fues, or supply
response, as a result of economic prilcng would, therefore, support the objective of replacing
woodfuels with modern fuels. A typical consumption levd of 100 kg of LPG per household
per year can potentlly subsdtuto about 1,150 kg of wood. At the economic retail price for
LPG and the actual market price for wood (Table 2), this oubstton represens a savlng of
Birr 90/yea (UJS$18). This savi  could poteiy be applied towards the purchase of a LPG
stove and cylindr. Appliance costs are imated at $35 for a basic 2-uner LPG stove, $5-
10 for a kerosene stove, and $30 for a 12.5 kg cylinder. At typical household consumption
levels these unit appliance costs are equivalont to about $56/ton of LPO (for a basic LPG
stove), $15/ton of kerosene (for a kerosene stove) and $48/ton of LPG (for a 12.5 kg LPG
cylinder).
LPG - Kerosene Price Unkag
34.          Household sOCtOr consumption of LPG and keo       In Ethiopia is mainly
concentratd in urban area (Table 2.3). At preset, rtve primc of LPG and keos    a
distortd due to a direct subsidy and the xclusion of axation for kroe. Mjusting the
wholesale price of LPG to Its economic value without a corrSpo    adjustmt In the price
of kerosene, and a balanci  of taxes on each fuld, will skew demand In favor of kerosen
and may jeopardixe the mketability of LPG.
35.          A comparison of wholesabl  vel (ecuding taxes) economic vaues, at the
same usefl heat lovel (Table 3) shows a LPG: Kerosen pice diffeenil of 10 percent U
appliance coWs are excluded, and 28 percent iudli  applian  costs. At the retai levd,
including appliace costs but excluding tas, this economic price diffeetial is 33 prcent
(16 percent uxcluding applan  costs). The supeior burnin qualites, or 'convenience"
premium of LPG over krose, we prelmnaUy etmad to be able to sustain this price
differenl'. Txatdon policy wlll have an Important Impact on ensuring Ihat retai price
diffretals between LPG and kerosene are mainaind at a sustainable level. Taxation policy
and the linkage between LPG and kerosne prlces will be studied In dtil by the Pricing
Study.

Iiplementadon of Revised LPG Prices
36.          LPG Pricing. Actual road freight rates are close to their economic cost levels
(based on liberalization in December 99Q2). These actual costs can then be used in the LPG
pricing formula. Distributor margins can be matained at their current levels until LPG
supplies increase substantially, either through increased import or when Calub production
begins (1997). Wholesale and ex-refinery price increases can be coordinated and negotiated
between EPC and the distnbutors with the undersding that the increases begin by Credit
Effectiveness and the reguated wholesale and retail prices fully reflect the IPP, economic
transportation costs and current distributor margins by April 1996 (to coincide with increased
imports of LPG for market preparation).
37.          LPG-Kerosene Lnkage. Kerosene wholesale prices should ideally be
increased to their economic levels in tandem with LPG price increases. lhis can be achieved
by a phasing out of subsidies, which may be converted to direct subsidies targeting low
income population segments. Tbe sustainable price differential between LPG and kerosene,
and taxation policy for the two fuels, can be established incorporaing the recmmens of
the Pricing Study. The precise basis for price-linkage should be finalized by April 1995 and
complete implementation be achieved by the end of April 1996.
38.          The economic value-based derivation of prices discussed above would reslt in
the following wholesale prices (excluding al taxes) In Addis Ababa: LPG at Blrr 230/kg
(versus Brr 1.49/kg) and kerosene at Birr 1.18/lter (vsus Birr 0.8/lter). In order to
maintain the retail fuel price differential of 16 percent on a useful energy basis (Inclusive of
taxes), the economic retail prices should be Birr 2.885/kg (currendy Birr 2.0/kg) for LPG
and Birr 1.781kg or Birr 1.40/liter (currently Birr 0.90/liter) for keosene.
39.          The finacial and economic viability of the Calub Company has been
predicated upon LPG, and other products, being valued at their economic prices (Table 2)
which are derived from imnort parity prices. The Calub Company Is expected to be
competitive and profiable at these prices. In addition, as demonstated above, both LPG and
kerosene will still be cheaper than fuelwood on a usefulZ energy basis. Marketing strategies
of the distribution companies should highlight the competitiveness of modern fuels, and may
introduce credit schemes and other inceives to accelerate the rate of market absorption. In
addition, the Government could investigate provision of direct subsidies to low income groups
in order to ficilitate the substitution of traditional fuels with modern fuels and consequently
mitigate deforestation.
