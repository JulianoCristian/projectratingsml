                                       xiv
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design1
1.1 Context at Appraisal

Alignment with Country Development Objectives.
1.    With per capita Gross National Income of USD 160 Ethiopia ranked 169 out of 177
countries in the United Nation's Human Development Index (HDI) for 2005. Little
progress had been achieved since the turn of the century in terms of the percentage of
population living below the poverty line which stood at 44 per cent of the estimated 67
million population in 2005. Ethiopia therefore ranked among the ten poorest countries of
the world. In early 2002 85% of its estimated 65 million population lived in rural areas
and had some of the lowest levels of life expectancy, literacy rate and access to primary
health care.

2.    The Project arose from explicit national strategy and coordinated Government
request to all developing partners for support in building up the capacity of the economy
to solve its poverty and inequality problems and to meet its development goals. GoE saw
Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) as an enabler of efforts to achieve
sustainable development and poverty reduction through support of the capacity building
pillar of the country's sustainable development and poverty reduction program (SDPRP)
adopted in 2002.

3.    The project was designed to support SDRP's National Capacity Building Sub
Program to: (i) strengthen the policy, regulatory and legal framework for use of ICT; (ii)
improve organizational effectiveness and develop human resources of core ICT sector
agencies; and (iii) "build capacity to build capacity" through a country-wide training of
trainers (TOT) program. Furthermore, under the ICT Capacity Building objectives of the
sub program, the project included a component to expand community-based ICT services
and another to support the private ICT services industry.

4.     In alignment with the SDRP, the project was also supportive of the Bank's 2003-
2005 Ethiopia Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goals of (i) enhancing pro-poor growth
(ii) fostering economic growth by supporting the creation of a favorable environment for
more active participation of the private sector in all aspects of ICT sector development
and (iii) strengthening the key ICT sector agencies.

Sector background
5.   At the time of appraisal (March, 2004) Ethiopia lacked a coherent policy, standards
or guidelines for use of ICT in the public sector. The Government had prepared an ICT
Policy paper in line with the SDRP which was being reviewed by the Council of
Ministers. Standards to display information in local languages were non-existent. High

 The ICR's length is due to the project's numerous implementation partnerships, institutional
outputs and previously untried activities.


                                               1
tariffs (40%) on ICT equipment powerfully constrained the growth of the sector and no
legislation was in place to enable electronic transactions in the economy.

6.    The government had recently (2003) established the Ethiopian ICT Development
Agency (EICTDA) as the national policy advocacy and coordinating body for ICTs, and
it was in the process of strengthening the management teams of the other two core sector
agencies, the Ethiopian Telecommunications Authority (ETA) and the Ethiopian
Broadcasting Authority (EBA).

7.    Project baseline surveys taken in March 2006 indicated that the size of the ICT
services industry in Ethiopia was very small: Not counting telephone resellers, there
were only about 688 companies (45 in software development) of which approximately
95% had less than 20 employees and less than US$ 115,000 investment capital. About
46% of the owners of these companies considered the weak domestic market their main
growth constraint and only 11% thought that poor ICT infrastructure was the culprit.

8.    Telecommunication policy at project effectiveness (June 2005) was characterized
by monopolistic provision of all services and consequent limited independent regulatory
power over the monopoly operator. However, plans were under consideration to license
private sector providers of rural connectivity, Internet access and community radio.

9.   Ethiopia's teledensity (subscribers per 100 inhabitants) in 2004 was 0.54, one of the
lowest in Sub-Saharan Africa. There were only 340,000 fixed telephone lines in use,
90,000 mobile subscribers, 6,000 dial up Internet accounts and only a handful of
broadband subscribers. All were concentrated in Addis Ababa.

Rationale for Bank assistance
10. The Bank was viewed to bring to the table, along with financial assistance: (i) a
cross-sector perspective to the use and growth of ICT, (ii) international experience and
knowledge sharing on the same and (iii) design advice and stakeholder convening
influence on innovative schemes to apply ICT at the grassroots level.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

11. The original objective of the project was defined on page 3 of the PAD as: "to assist
communities to improve their livelihood through the use of appropriate Information and
Communication Technologies (ICT) that facilitate increased access to markets,
development information, and public services." This objective, the PAD added in the
same breath, was to be achieved by "enabling the public and private sector providers of
information, goods and services to improve the quality and quantity of their products
through the efficient and effective use of ICTs." This formulation including both "what"
and "how" aspects was somewhat ambivalent as a definition of a project objective.

12. Two of the three results indicators for the PDO referred to the "how" aspect and
only one attempted to measure improved livelihood outcomes more directly through
observable reductions in the cost of services. Thus from the start project designers
realized that measuring project success directly through improvements in the livelihood


                                            2
of ICT-using communities was not realistic or credible within the time span of the
project. They chose to measure a proxy- the supply response of the ICT services industry
 as the best indicator of accomplishment of project objective. This decision is discussed
more extensively in Annex 3. The important point here is to note that from the start the
project was focused on capacity building to bring about a powerful supply response in the
number and geographic spread of ICT service organizations.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

13. Taking the above (Section 1.2) into account, since the official project
documentation and internal Bank Implementation Supervision Reporting (ISR) system
consistently recorded the original objective of assisting communities to improve their
livelihood, this contributed to a growing sense of mismatch between PDO and actual
project design and results framework.

14. Therefore during the April 2008 mid-term review (MTR) of the project it was
agreed to revise the PDO to make it "(i) directly relevant to PASDEP2 and CAS; (ii) more
focused and measurable; (iii) attainable project components and activities". The revised
objective "to increase the use of Information and Communication Technologies by
Communities in project Target Areas" was formalized through an amendment to the
Credit Agreement on January 29, 2009.

15. Strictly speaking, the increased use of ICT by targeted communities is still a proxy
as it does not by itself demonstrate improved livelihoods. Nonetheless, it is a proxy that
PASDEP and CAS and, as will be seen in Annex 3, the entire international community
accept as valid and worth pursuing by itself. The GoE and IDA then paired this proxy
with the one previously used in the PAD formulation of the PDO (supply response, see
above) creating a much stronger and realistic Results Framework (RF) for the project.

16. Along with the reworded PDO, the PMU and Bank teams started a process of
refinement of the results framework from MTR in April 2008 to the last ISR of the
Project written in June, 2010. Several versions of the RF were produced. The one
presented in the Data Sheet for this ICR corresponds with the manner in which the
Project was monitored since MTR.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,

1.6 Other significant changes

19. Cancelling of Rural Connectivity subcomponent. This subcomponent was
designed as a pilot test for provision of 3,000 rural telecommunication points of service
through partnerships between the monopoly operator, Ethiopian Telecommunications
Company (ETC), and private sector cooperatives in rural areas. By May 2006 the GoE


                                             4
had decided to install five times as many rural telephones in connection with a backbone
expansion contract signed with the Chinese company ZTE. This led to agreement at mid-
term review (February, 2008) to cancel this part of the credit and waive the related dated
covenant for issuance of community telephone licenses.

20. Change in the role of DED. The partnership with the German Development
Service (DED) was intended to provide field advisors for the various program areas and
for the PMU management, with a primary objective of knowledge transfer. Due to
staffing shortages at the PMU and capacity gaps at the partner agencies, particularly the
EICTDA, DED advisors' role had a larger component of direct implementation work
than originally planned. Section 5.2 (b) discusses how this worked.

21. Decentralization of the Business Incubator Program. The BIC program
originally targeted the creation of an incubator in Addis Ababa. However, the municipal
government could not provide a building at reasonable cost, as required. The program
was then successfully changed to four regional capitals were as many business incubators
were created. In the final 15 months of project the BIC program turned back to Addis
under a virtual incubation model for 17 small companies.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
22. In its three broad areas of activity ­ policy and institutional support, private sector
support, and community ICT support - the ICTAD Project achieved all its development
objectives and met and exceeded its project development indicators (see Data Sheet,
Section F). The project assisted poor, disabled, isolated and HIV-exposed people in
Ethiopia (see full list of beneficiaries in Table 1) to access and use ICT and for the first
time become part of the information economy.

23. The benefits provided by the project include access to ICT; general computer
literacy; specialized technical skills; access to information; capital, technology and
facilities; direct employment, and in some cases international exposure and academic
training. The project also had extensive and somewhat unexpected social benefits of
community empowerment; volunteerism; gender equity; empowerment of the youth and
interest in access to technology by people in remote and poor areas of the country.

24. The project leaves behind 65 community ICT centers throughout the country
serving over 70,000 customers per month, 7 community radios, 4 regional ICT business
incubators with 55 startup company tenants, and one environmentally green, state of the
art computer refurbishment and de-manufacturing facility at par with the best in Africa.
It provided training to over 9,000 people, strengthened the key ICT sector institutions and
developed the initial body of ICT policies and standards of an information economy.

25.       Success factors. The main factors accounting for project success were:

      ·    Consistency of support, leadership and commitment of the GoE to project
           objectives, as discussed in Section 5.2 (a).




                                                5
    ·   Decisive intervention by EICTDA management to confront serious
        implementation roadblocks encountered as a result of the innovative nature of
        many project activities being tried for the first time in the country.
    ·   Effective project management and outstanding performance of the PMU, as
        discussed under Section 5.2(b).
    ·   In-depth, long-term and field-based advisory support by DED as discussed under
        Section 5.2 (b).
    ·   High quality of project implementation support provided by IDA with a core staff
        team that remained unchanged from the design to the completion of the project.
    ·   Extraordinary enthusiasm and participation of project beneficiaries and high
        demand for project interventions.
    ·   Strong support by regional governments in particular by Capacity Building
        Bureaus and TVET colleges.

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

26. Project preparation involved spirited discussion within the Bank on whether to
support an operation to leverage ICT for economic development without centrally
addressing reform objectives in the telecommunication sector. The concern was that
without competition the ICT sector would not be free to expand, services might not
improve and costs could remain high thus perpetuating a fundamental development
constraint for the economy and a threat to the impact and sustainability of project outputs.
The alternate view held that there was a wide field of needs and opportunities for use of
ICT as an enabler of development which could be successfully pursued separately from
the central telecommunications sector policy reforms. A constructive project could
concentrate on human resource and institutional capacity constraints in the sector, address
the policy, regulatory and legal framework directly related to those constraints and
directly bring ICT to poor communities and micro entrepreneurs.

27. Although by and large the latter view prevailed and was clearly reflected in the
Credit Agreement and later validated by project results3, the project was left with several
sector reform objectives that it either could not expect to accomplish or about which it
lacked appropriate leverage. While inclusion of these results indicators may have served
to accommodate the differing views, it also created confusion on the degree to which
project success would be measured by progress on telecommunication sector reform. All
but one of the telecom-related indicators were cancelled when the project was
restructured in December, 2008 (see Section 5.1.a, Table 5).



3
  As shown in Annex 11, the sector did expand during the project period (725% in number of
users, 677% fiber optic broadband capacity, 125% growth in fixed line subscribers, 328% growth
in Internet subscribers, 461% mobile subscribers) and costs did go down (average of 35% before
inflation). However, services did not improve that much, mainly due to network operation
problems.


                                              6
28. This ICR follows the letter of the Credit Agreement regarding the
telecommunications sector reform content of the project being limited to: (i)
strengthening of the regulatory agencies; (ii) licensing of community radios; (iii)
licensing of Internet service providers and (iv) licensing of rural connectivity providers in
partnership with ETC. The ICR nonetheless examined in some detail (see Annex 11) the
progress made in telecommunications infrastructure, subscribers, services and tariffs
during the Project period.

29. Project design. Project components and activities were logically consistent with
the Project's capacity building objectives and highly relevant to the needs of the intended
beneficiaries. Five major features of project design account for the impressive and
expected lasting impact of project results, albeit also for much of the complexity, initial
slow pace of implementation and for the shortcomings that impeded a fully satisfactory
rating for the project, as discussed in Section 3:

    ·   Focus on cross-cutting policy and institutional factors. Component 1 targeted the
        enabling policy and institutional framework, not specific technology
        implementation activities, and the strengthening of the coordination and
        regulatory sector organizations ­ EICTDA, ETA and EBA.
    ·   Demand-driven, bottom up initiatives were required in beneficiary selection.
        Principally, community organizations of all kinds were to apply for project
        support to establish CIDEV centers and Community Radios (CRs). This created
        ownership of project outputs at the beneficiary level and revealed dramatically the
        importance attached to ICT by rural, poor, and disadvantaged communities.
        However, it also increased manifold the complexity and scope of the work of the
        PMU.
    ·   Implementation through partnerships. Institutional arrangements for
        implementation envisioned, in addition to a ring-fenced PMU and an external
        technical cooperation partnership with DED, multiple implementation
        partnerships as depicted in Table 2. Each partnership required comprehensive
        design, negotiation, formalization through MOU, financial control, progress
        reporting and monitoring, crisis intervention and often technical support.

        Table 2. ICTAD Implementation Partnerships and their intended responsibilities
    ·     Extensive institution building work.        Component 2 for Application and
          Community Support required institution building work at a scale that far exceeded
          initial projections of staff and time requirements. Each CIDEV center,
          community radio, business incubator, and the CRTC-DMF required development
          of MOU, business plans, building renovation or construction, legal and
          organizational design, financial procedures, operational manual, ICT systems
          deployment, staff recruitment and staff training, among others. Long and difficult
          road travel throughout the country added substantially to the complexity of this
          project component.
    ·     Budgetary and implementation flexibility. Project designers recognized the
          difficulty to predict the detailed course of implementation of the multiple project
          activities. Thus they allocated project budget formally at the Component level
          only (PAD Annex 4) thus providing flexibility to shift resources where most
          needed (such as the unplanned cost of incubator buildings), yet also complicating
          budgetary control which was sometimes substandard (see Annex 2, Section 1.3.4).
30. The Quality at Entry for the project was very high in most aspects. In particular,
the intensive policy dialogue on the capacity building potential of ICT and its relevance
to poor communities produced strong Government ownership of and commitment to
project objectives. The Quality at Entry study of the Bank in November, 2005 (QAE7)
rated ICTAD's overall QAE as satisfactory and its implementation arrangements as
moderately satisfactory.

31. Risks. Most risks envisioned in the PAD on the non-restructured areas of the
project were adequately assessed and mitigated through effective EICTDA, PMU and
IDA management (see Table 3 below). The possible underperformance of
implementation partnerships was not envisioned as a risk and in hindsight it was a major
issue for the project.

               Table 3. Behavior of major risks identified at Project Inception

2.2 Implementation

32. Startup delays. Board approval, credit signing and project effectiveness were all
delayed until GoE could fulfill the conditions for each. Board Approval shifted from
7/27/2004 to 9/16/2004. Project effectiveness was delayed nine months (from 9/30/2004
to 6/24/2005) due to change in procedures (requiring an additional approval of credit
agreement by the Council of Ministers) and to difficulty in recruiting the Project
manager. Covenant for issuance of ISP licenses by ETA, starting September 30, 2005,
was partially fulfilled only by March, 2007 after two postponements requested by
Government.

33. Steep learning curve. Major project activities (CRs, CIDEV, BIC and CRTC-
DMF) were being done for the first time in the country. Neither the Agency, nor the PMU
or the implementation partners had relevant prior experience with them. The learning
curve was therefore very long.

34. Difficult activation of partnerships. The numerous institutional partners
responsible for project implementation (See Table 2 above) encountered restrictions,
changing priorities and contingencies that seriously affected their performance vis-à-vis
the project. For example, the EICTDA agency had to embark in a protracted yet high
priority business process redesign exercise that absorbed large amounts of staff time.
Local governments sponsoring business incubators, CIDEV and CR community


                                                 9
organizations were unable or late in providing the agreed upon buildings whose
construction then took one to two years. In most cases the project had to step in with
financing, technical assistance and intensive progress monitoring to break the impasse.

35. Increased workload and understaffing of the PMU. Under these circumstances,
the PMU was forced to fill the capacity gaps of various partners. As shown in Table 2,
its planned role (and staffing) was only of coordination and monitoring. However, it had
to take effective management responsibility and play a major implementation role in
CIDEV, CRs, TVET TOT, BIC and CRTC-DMF and Capacity Building program areas.
As a result, the PMU was chronically understaffed for its increased responsibilities and
the burden fell primarily on the shoulders of the PMU manager and DED advisors. The
Bank team had proposed a much larger PMU staffing plan early during project design
and this was rejected by the GoE.

36. Uneven implementation pace. The above situation coupled with the complexity
of the project (See Section 2.1 ­ Project Design) resulted in initial slow implementation
and by MTR only 15.5% of Project funds had been disbursed (after subtracting the
balance in the special account). It was very difficult for the PMU to obtain timely and
accurate progress reports from implementation partners and this jeopardized effective
progress monitoring and timely corrective action (see for example Annex 2,
Subcomponent 1.5 on ETA).

37. Staff compensation issues. While project design envisioned compensation
packages for PMU and EICTDA consultant staff competitive with the private sector, in
practice a gap existed throughout the Project which made recruitment difficult and
increased staff turnover. At MTR (March, 2008) the WB team confronted this issue and
proposed a minimum compensation schedule for PMU. The EICTDA Director General
was able to obtain a performance-based salary bonus for PMU staff which increased
morale and possibly stemmed further staff turnover.

38. Effective Mid-Term Review of the Project. The MTR was an in-depth review of
implementation issues resulting in reformulation of implementation plans, partnerships,
and project activities. It took place 3 months into the second half of the project (March,
2008 instead of December 2007) at the request of the government. The comprehensive
action plan agreed upon during the mission had decisive impact and made possible the
completion of most project activities by closing date on May 31st, 2010.

39. Shortened incubation time for project outputs. Two key agreements during MTR
were (i) to reprogram the funds from the canceled Rural Connectivity subcomponent
towards strengthening of the CIDEV and TVET subprograms and (ii) to seek extension
of the Project by two years in order to give the new entities created by the project
(CIDEV, CRs, BICs, CRTC) time to solidify their operations and achieve self-
sufficiency. This was in recognition that construction and other delays were already
bearing inevitably upon the project implementation schedule. The first agreement was
reversed for an important humanitarian reason related to the subsequent food crisis in
Ethiopia (see next). The second fell victim to uncertainty about the project's ability to
achieve results and to IDA portfolio reorganization by GoE. The parties decided not to


                                           10
seek extension of the project and rather to consider a follow up operation once actual
project achievements became clear. This left many of the key project outputs without
time to achieve self-sufficiency and dependent on finding a new source of financing
immediately after project completion. This decision is at the root of the high risk to
development outcome rating given to the project (see Section 4).

40. Major changes/Restructuring. On December 10, 2008 the IDA Board approved
restructuring of ICTAD and eleven other projects in the Ethiopia country portfolio. USD
10 million of ICTAD's funds were transferred to the Ethiopia Food Crisis Response
Program as of January 29, 2009 when the corresponding amendment to the Credit
Agreement was signed.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

41. Financial management was exercised in general compliance with fiduciary
requirements and agreed upon procedures, yet with significant shortcomings. The
financial accounts of the project were regularly audited and found correct. The final audit
was still pending when this ICR was completed.

42. Accounting and financial reporting were barely able to keep up with the past and
contributed little to forward-looking financial management. During the first three years
when financial activity was low, FM was rated satisfactory or higher by the Bank. After
that, there were constant delays in posting of transactions and in production of complete
and accurate financial reports.

43. Although FM performance was affected by exogenous factors such as scarcity of
foreign exchange, staffing shortages and slow procurement, there were also numerous
internal shortcomings such as accounting for transactions outside the computerized
system, incorrectly formatted and incomplete financial reports to IDA and un-reconciled
balances that persisted until the end of the project and delayed considerably the
preparation of this ICR. Annex 2, Section 1.4 discusses FM performance in detail.

44. Procurement performance was substantially different from the first to the second
half of the project. There was initial difficulty to recruit staff knowledgeable of World
Bank procedures and lack of familiarity with procurement of construction contracts
which had not been originally planned. These issues led to one unsatisfactory rating by
IDA in October, 2009. Corrective action from EICTDA's Director General on down was
energetic and effective. Procurement had fully caught up by project closing and the
project ended with a well-deserved satisfactory rating in this area. Annex 2, Section 1.4
discusses procurement performance in more detail.

45. Monitoring and Evaluation. The M&E system developed for the project was
generally well designed and consistently utilized. It tracks information on the entire IT
services subsector, particularly in the rural areas, which is needed by EICTDA for its
mandate as sector oversight agency. Unfortunately the system did not collect routine,
accurate service statistics from the CIDEV centers. As a result, a major effort had to be



                                            11
made for this ICR to collect the data necessary for the assessment of project outcomes.
Annex 2, Section 1.4 discusses M&E performance in detail.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

Transition and long-term Operation and Maintenance Arrangements
46. All the entities created under the project (CIDEV centers, etc.) started operations
two years later than originally planned and did not have time to become self-sustainable
from either the managerial or financial points of view:

   ·   23% of the 65 CIDEV centers reporting average monthly losses deserve financial
       support for some time. 15 centers have not yet graduated from their 1-year
       subsidy period and therefore EICTDA has still a commitment to support them
       financially. Of those that have graduated, 9% have a low sustainability rating and
       may need continued support.
   ·   None of the CRs or the business incubators is financially sustainable yet.
   ·   TVET TOT program needs public funding, either from the federal or the local
       level, to continue, since the TVET college system is publicly funded.
   ·   Even the CRTC-DMF is probably 1 year away from breakeven revenue and
       requires continued staff salary support until then.
   ·   The legal status of BIC, CRs and the CRTC, is still unclear.
   ·   None of the entities have real autonomy to recruit qualified management and pay
       accordingly. Business incubators, for example, would need managers with far
       more experience in marketing, production planning and IT.
47. The general approach being taken by the EICTA is to transfer responsibility to local
governments for sustaining the newly created entities and nurturing new ones:

   ·   CIDEV. DED has extended one year the contract of their CIDEV advisor to
       provide continued coordination of the program, transfer of knowledge to two
       consultants presently employed by the PMU and to help set up a formal network
       of centers. The EICTDA is connecting some centers to WoredaNet but it is not
       clear whether this will be done for all centers and at whose expense. Neither has it
       been clear whether EICTDA will continue fulfilling its financial commitments
       with 51 centers not yet graduated from their subsidy period.
   ·   CRs. DED has extended one year the contract of their CR advisor to provide
       ongoing coordination and support and help establish an association for peer
       support, sharing of content and pursuit of common interests by existing CRs.
       There are no other formal arrangements for continued financial support needed by
       the CRs both for staff salaries and for indispensable ongoing staff training.
   ·   BICs. EICTDA will continue supporting the program for one year through its
       own staff and through the agreed extension of the DED TA contract and the PMU
       will oversee the completion of ongoing building contracts. The steering and


                                           12
       financial responsibility for all the BICs will be transferred to the respective local
       government authorities. However, MOUs with local governments had not been
       signed at project closing and it is not clear that they will include firm, enforceable
       commitments for managerial and financial support, which will be needed in
       varying degrees for at least 2 years. Also, MOUs should spell out assurances that
       incubators can continue being run as a business, can pursue financial
       independence and can select clients strictly according to their entrepreneurial
       potential.
   ·   TVET TOT. There are no explicit plans to continue financing this program from
       EICTDA. It will fall to the TVET colleges and their supporting local
       governments to incorporate ICT training into their curriculum and to finance the
       continued operation of the computer maintenance and training labs created under
       the project. However, formal and reliable commitments for this did not exist at
       project closing.
   ·   CRTC-DMF. The management contract with private partner was extended for 6
       months beyond the project closing. These facilities have very good prospects for
       financial sustainability and as their owner, EICTDA will continue having overall
       managerial and financial responsibility for them.
Follow up Support and Scale up Program
48. IDA has decided to conduct and in-depth sector study to determine its best strategic
position in the ICT sector in Ethiopia in view of the emerging new version of the
Government's ICT strategy. IDA is not therefore planning an immediate follow-on
operation but neither has it ruled it out, pending the above study. Assuming GoE's
interest, such operation has been recommended by past Quality Reviews and is strongly
recommended by this ICR in view of the positive results of the project.

49. The Government has offered to cooperate with IDA in the above sector study and
has not formally requested a follow-on operation. However, the Government expressed
to the ICR mission a firm determination to maintain and scale up the results of ICTAD,
particularly the CIDEV and CR programs.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
Rating: Satisfactory

50. Regular rating method being used in spite of revised project objectives. IDA
guidelines provide for a special approach to rating projects with formally revised
objectives. Although technically this was case with ICTAD, application of the special
rating approach was not deemed appropriate. Measures of project results are equally valid
before and after restructuring.

   ·   The cancellation of the Rural Connectivity component did not really change the
       nature and course of the Project since (i) it only cancelled the dormant
       subcomponent and reallocated its associated budget along with other largely
       unused project funds and (ii) the expected benefit from access to telephones in


                                            13
        3,000 rural communities was still pursued, and over achieved, through installation
        of over 11,000 rural telephones directly by the ETC.
    ·   Neither the underlying development objective nor the fundamental activities of
        the project were changed when the PDO was reformulated at project restructuring.
        The change of PDO removed ambiguities and strengthened the practicality and
        credibility of the RF but did not change the fundamental development objective of
        the project or its components.

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Relevance of Objectives: Rating: Satisfactory4
51. Country Development Strategy. In September 2006 the GoE adopted a Plan for
Accelerated and Sustained Development to End Poverty (PASDEP) which is Ethiopia's
guiding strategic framework for the five-year period 2005/06-2009/10 and therefore
updates the SDPRP of 2002 according to which ICTAD was formulated.

52. Under PASDEP the project objectives and results are more directly linked to
economic development and are therefore more relevant to national priorities. In
PASDEP the GoE states that exploiting ICT is central to promote growth and reduce
poverty, creating new jobs, new business opportunities, to modern education, and to
improving the effectiveness of government administration and service delivery.
Therefore, a major priority is being attached in the coming five years to "leap-frog"
forward, by building a major ICT backbone and affordable local-level access to ICT5.

53. ICTAD contributes directly to two of the five elements of the ICT strategy in
PASDEP6 and indirectly to another two, as follows:

            Direct contribution                           Indirect contribution
(i) "Promoting human resource development     (ii) Mainstreaming the use of ICT in all sectors
in the ICT field" (through the CIDEV, TVET    of the economy, in the administration of
and CRTC program areas)                       government, and in the education system
                                              (through the CIDEV, CR, BIC and CRTC)
(v) "Creating the enabling legal and          (iii) Developing the necessary
regulatory framework" (through the            telecommunications infrastructure (through
namesake component of the project).           strengthening of the ETA)

challenges of the country7, as shown in below. Properly enabled through capacity

                                            access to ICT and ICT training.

Relevance of Design: Satisfactory
56. All project interventions were directly conducive to achievement of both original
and modified project development objectives. Section 2.1 (Project design) discusses
some of the innovative, forward-looking and poverty-oriented features of the design of
this project which made it highly relevant to Ethiopia and a likely example of
international good practice.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives: Satisfactory

57. In its three broad areas of activity the Project achieved its development objectives
and met and exceeded its project development indicators as formulated both before and
after re-structuring (see Table 4). The benefits provided by the project to its multiple
direct beneficiaries (listed in Table 1) include access to ICT; general computer literacy;
specialized technical skills; access to information; access to capital, technology and
facilities; direct employment and in some cases international exposure and academic
training. The project also had extensive and somewhat unexpected social benefits of
community empowerment; volunteerism; gender equity; inclusion of persons with
disabilities and at risk of HIV; empowerment of the youth and extraordinary awareness
and interest in access to technology by people in remote and poor areas of the country.

58. At the policy and institutional level the project developed a foundation of policies,
standards and guidelines for use of ICT in the economy (see Annex 2, Table 7). The
project did not do something equivalent for provision of telecommunication services in
the economy since this was not its agreed PDO (see Section 3.4 below). At the
institutional level the project strengthened the key ICT sector agencies, notably the
EICTDA and the EBA.




                                             16

wide technical training in computer maintenance and networking and by establishing ICT
business incubators in four regions.

                                   ICT services sector well beyond the targets set for the project.
2. Average monthly number Achieved 725%. This achievement is particularly important
of ICT users in project            because it validates the demand-driven approach to formation of
areas/communities                  community centers and the value of the centers to the affected
                                   communities country-wide. The project also overachieved in the
                                   number of community centers and community radios created.
Before re-structuring of Project
By 2009, in the areas covered by          Fully Achieved. With the exception of international, local
the project business transaction          and mobile charges which did not change, the general trend
cost for users of ICT assisted            was of tariff cost reductions (-35.47 % average), more if
services reduced by 30%.                  accumulated inflation during the period (80 %+) is
                                          considered. This indicator was dropped during
                                          restructuring as the project had no leverage to pursue it.

60. The "Satisfactory" rating differs from the "MS" rating given to the project during
the last 7 ISRs within the Bank. However, five of those ISRs deemed that achievement
of PDO was "very likely", "highly likely", "on schedule", "as intended" and "likely". It
is not clear then why the "MS" rating was given. The last ISR, after noting that "the
project has achieved or surpassed most of its targets" gives an "MS" rating presumably
because the results were delivered at the end of the project and their sustainability would
require additional time and support. However, as Table 4 indicates, all the PDO
indicators were accomplished on the dates initially planned, and thus the correct rating
for accomplishment of PDO should be "Satisfactory".

3.3 Efficiency: Satisfactory
61.   It is not possible within a 5 year period to develop policy, build institutions, create
human capacity and expect to measure impact of ICT on economic development. ICTAD
accordingly aimed to create capacity for development, not development itself and set out
to measure results through (i) the supply response of the ICT services industry (PDO
Indicator 1 in Table 4) and (ii) the number of people using the ICT access facilities
created by the project (PDO Indicator 2). On the first indicator the project accomplished


                                                  17
100% of the target and on the second 725%. Thus, using these proxies, there is no
question that the project succeeded in creating capacity for development.

62.   Whether this was accomplished at reasonable cost, in the absence of quantifiable
benefits this must be discerned by examining unit costs against internal or external
norms, if they exist. This is the approach taken in this ICR (see Annex 3) except that,
due to the novel nature of project activities, relevant internal or external norms were
difficult to find. Using very conservative assumptions, the project unit costs were found
to be very reasonable. They are shown below, but to be properly understood each must
be examined in detail as shown in Annex 3.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory
63. The project is rated satisfactory because it achieved and surpassed its development
objectives and indicators, whether as stated originally in the PAD or as sharpened after
restructuring in December 2008, as can be seen in the Data Sheet. This rating is
grounded on the Credit Agreement and ICR rating guidelines of the Bank. However, it
does not reflect the project's limited telecommunications reform­related objectives (see
par. 28)) that were not part of the PDO and on which project outcomes were not indeed
entirely satisfactory (see Section 5.2(a), par. 91, bullets 3 and 4). This merits pointing out
because making telecom reform the primary PDO (see Section 2.1) was a design option
intensely discussed but finally discarded, as reflected in the Credit Agreement.

64. As discussed in Section 3.1 the project is directly relevant to the human resource,
capacity building and policy reform objective of the country's Plan for Accelerated and
Sustained Development to End Poverty (PASDEP). It is also directly relevant to the
service delivery take-off envisioned by the Bank's CAS as one of the central
development challenges of the country, and to specific CAS priorities on citizen
empowerment, service delivery and local capacity building.

65. In terms of the efficiency in the use of Project resources, while there is no practical
way to strike a precise ERR, analysis of design features of the Project, of the unit costs of
its main outputs and of some of its poverty-oriented pricing practices supports a
satisfactory rating, as discussed under Section 3.3.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
66. Access to ICT for the poorest communities in Ethiopia: ICTAD demonstrated
the relevance of ICT to the lives and aspirations of poor, rural and disadvantaged
communities in Ethiopia. The direct and indirect beneficiaries of CIDEV centers, over
70,000 per month, are people at the bottom of the income scale, women, HIV-infected
and the disabled, all of whom invest their limited time and money to access information
and learn basic ICT skills. At completion, the project faced a 1,000% repressed demand
(650 approved applications) for scaling up of the existing 65 centers across the country.

67. Building the capacity of the most disadvantaged communities and creating an
enabling business environment. ICTAD has shown the vast demand for training and
growth potential of the ICT services industry through its successful Training of Trainer
(TOT), SME training and ICT business incubation (BIC) programs. TOT, based on the
existing Training and Vocational (TVET) college network trained 576 teachers and set up
15 computer maintenance labs. SME program trained 645 SME operators and BIC
created 4 regional business incubators that were nursing 43 new companies by project
completion. ICT service industry indicators chosen to estimate the economic impact of
these activities showed uniform growth, in excess of expectations.

68. Innovation. The project introduced to Ethiopia ICT-enabled areas of activity such
as ICT centers, community radios, computer refurbishment and ICT business incubation
that are being pursued successfully by leading countries like India, Brazil and the US and
can yield long-term benefits for Ethiopian development.

(b) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

69. CIDEV Centers as public/private service infrastructure. ICTAD demonstrated
that community-based centers are not only successful models for ICT access, but also
promising institutional platforms for dissemination of knowledge, provision of
government services and community participation in governance. Center activities
enabled through ICT include HIV education, women empowerment (Beza, Awi),
environmental cleanup (Tena Kebena, Felege), help for persons with disabilities (Cardos,
Alem Gena), distribution of government forms (Bahir Dar), youth education and
empowerment (Yirgalem, Mekele, Korem), community library (Shashamene Dawn of
Hope, Afar) orphan protection (Bollo, Robe), market/agriculture information (Kechema,
Gewane, Nebo Daletti).

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome:
Rating: High
70. The risk to development outcome is rated high for the ICTAD project because, in
addition to the expected uncertainties of an innovative, community-based, demand-driven
project, the arrangements for continuation, sustainability and scaling up of project
activities are unfinished and consequently weak.


                                           19
71. As pointed out in Section 2.5 many of the organizational entities created under the
project started operations two years later than planned and consequently are still far from
being self-sustainable from either the managerial or financial points of view.

72. Taking the CIDEV program as an example, the income-generating activities of the
centers are seriously affected by frequent power supply failures, interruptions in
telephone and internet connections resulting in loss of patrons and income. Up to 16 of
the 65 centers, or 25%, are not yet financially self-supporting, due to low demand for ICT
services that are not enabled by reliable Internet access, as expected by project designers.
Most centers were established within the last 2 years and their management has not yet
matured for lack of handholding and technical support during a start-up phase. Thus,
the Program as a whole merits continued monitoring and requires financial support from
the GoE lest it cannot be sustained.

73. The ICR Team was given to understand that responsibility for continuation of the
CIDEV, CR, BIC and TVET-TOT programs beyond 2010 will be transferred to regional
counterparts of the EICTDA agency. This may well be the best long-time arrangement,
but without training, handholding, incentives, managed transition plan and certainty
about allocation of resources, local governments will encounter all the challenges to
continue the program that ICTAD PMU encountered to create it. Thus this is considered
a weak arrangement to sustain the development outcome of ICTAD.

74. In hindsight the project extension recommended at MTR was probably correct and
should have been implemented in tandem with a reduction of about $3 million in the
amount re-allocated to the Food Crisis program. This would have given the project the
time and funding necessary to fully prove sustainability and scalability of outcomes.

75.       Compensating somewhat for the above risks, are the following positive factors:

      ·    GoE is committed to sustaining the results of CIDEV program. This was
           unequivocally affirmed by the Minister of Capacity Building, the Director
           General of the EICTDA agency and the Director General of the Ethiopian
           Broadcasting Authority during ICR interviews.
      ·    Since many CIDEV centers are set up by existing community organizations that
           can provide space, furniture, management, customers and sometimes subsidized
           revenue, their sustainability following termination of ICTAD can be much higher
           than if they were self-standing operations.
      ·    EICTDA and PMU were very successful in eliciting interest and securing
           cooperation by local governments. BIC centers in particular are the pride of the
           four regional governments who benefited from ICTAD support and this is an
           auspicious condition as responsibility is transferred to them.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 IDA Performance: Moderately Satisfactory

(a) IDA Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry: Moderately Satisfactory
76. IDA provided intensive support to GoE since early 2002 to help formulate an ICT
Capacity Building Program responsive to national development objectives articulated in
the July 2002 SDPRP (Ethiopia's PRSP) and in IBRD's 2003-2005 CAS. For this
purpose it organized a series of high level CAS Workshops in March 2002 which clearly
connected the ICT objectives of SDPRP and CAS with specific policy/ regulatory
framework, capacity building, private sector development, community access and
institutional strengthening activities under the ICTAD project. This not only provided a
strong development policy underpinning to the project, but also showed IDA at its best in
connecting development, poverty reduction and ICT.

77. During project preparation IDA helped effectively to coordinate external partners
most notably by (i) mobilizing a USD 0.97 million PHRD grant from Government of
Japan to finance the bulk of project preparation activities and (ii) assisting in the design
of DED's cooperation with GOE for long-term advisory support in project
implementation, initially estimated in USD 1.8 million and eventually reaching USD 2.92
million.

78. IDA was also at its best in supporting and facilitating robust stakeholder input into
project design. It worked together with GoE to convene numerous stakeholders in an
extensive serious of consultations (see 5.2 below) that provided valuable external
perspectives into project design.

79. Thanks to the PHRP grant, project preparation and design were underpinned by
highly relevant technical studies on the application of ICT to various sectors and by
regional surveys on the state of ICT infrastructure.

80. There were also one moderate and one minor shortcoming which account for the
moderately satisfactory rating given to IDA:

   ·   Implementation partnerships (Table 2) were defined only, not really designed,
       creating significant implementation risk. The operational and administrative
       manuals stated only in general terms that: "All partners and beneficiaries will be
       responsible to implement sub-components and activities and regularly report on
       the progress of the project to PMU...". MOUs with specific staffing and results
       commitments were left to be done during project implementation. The Bank, the
       PMU and DED compensated later with effective efforts to energize those
       partnerships or to work out alternatives. The timely intervention of EICTDA
       management was also critically important at times. However, since performance
       of the partnerships was a critical success factor for the project and since PMU
       staffing was designed only for coordination and monitoring rather than



                                            21
         implementation, a significant risk was taken in not designing the partnerships
         more precisely (see Section 6, bullet 3 for suggestions).
    ·    The Bank left in the original set of progress indicators three that were related to
         broader telecommunications reforms (see Table 5) for which the project had no
         leverage and no commensurate activities or resources. These caused confusion
         regarding project objectives that persisted in some cases through to the end of the
         project.



            Indicator                                           Comment
Laws enacted by 2006, allowing         The competitive provision of connectivity was against
competitive provision of               explicit government policy to keep the backbone
connectivity and ICT related           infrastructure under sole control by ETC. In truth the
goods and services                     parties expected only legal and regulatory clearance to
                                       conduct a pilot program of public private partnerships for
                                       3000 community phones. Even this limited reform
                                       objective proved unattainable and the rural connectivity
                                       subcomponent of the project was consequently cancelled.
Ethiopian Telecommunications           The project design had no appropriate mechanisms to
Corporation (ETC) effectively          accomplish this objective and strictly speaking
provides backbone services at          "competitive" rates could never have appeared under a
competitive rates.                     monopoly.
Ethiopian Telecom Authority            This was something of a circular indicator as national
(ETA) effectively regulates and        policy was and continues being of monopoly provision by
enforces national policy by 2007       ETC of voice, data and multimedia communications
(spectrum management, licensing        whether wire line or wireless, fixed or mobile. Spectrum
new technologies, etc.) and            management and licensing of new technologies by a
licenses at least 2 private ISPs per   regulator under these circumstances are rather pre-
annum.                                 determined. As experience under this project would later
                                       show, licensing of ISPs by a regulator, under conditions of
                                       monopoly in service provision, is nominal in nature and the
                                       effective value and result of the license is determined by the
                                       monopolistic operator.
        Table 5. Key Telecom-related result indicators dropped at project restructuring

(b) Quality of Supervision: Satisfactory
81. The Bank provided full staff continuity as both the Task Team Leader and a senior
consultant (Messrs. Bobak Rezaian and Michael Broemmel respectively) were involved
from early preparation to completion of the project.

82. The Bank team was flexible and creative in its analysis and corrective action when
various project activities stalled particularly in the year between June 2008 and June 2009
(See Section 2.2 on Mid-Term Review). This happened for example with the BIC
program in early 2009 when an external consultant was brought in, a special workshop
was held and one on one meetings were organized between the EICTDA agency and the
local governments sponsoring incubators in their jurisdictions. These efforts helped turn


                                                  22
around the pace of progress and enabled the BIC program to achieve its targets.
Something similar happened with the TVET program which was scaled up at the same
time. On the CRTC-DMF, the Bank assisted in the examination of the contract issues
with the consultant and helped the PMU to evaluate the choices and eventually decide to
outsource to the consultant, an NGO, the entire operation. This decision led to a rapid
turnaround in performance, completion of the building and successful launching of the
facilities.

83. When insufficient familiarity with Bank procurement guidelines was determined to
be a cause of procurement delay the Bank responded proactively by (i) bringing one of its
most senior procurement experts in early 2008 to assist with analysis of the procurement
plan and impart formal training in works and consulting services consulting; (ii)
providing concentrated support from the Addis office for bi-weekly procurement reviews
after the project was restructured in the second half of 2008. By project closing
procurement had fully caught up and the project ended with a well-deserved satisfactory
rating in this area.

84. In the financial management area there was a clear if minor shortcoming in IDA's
supervision of this project. IDA changed four times its project FM specialist and provided
accurate but often ineffective follow up on issues that remained unresolved for long
periods of time. It declared the Peachtree accounting software adequate for the needs of
the project and did not revisit this assessment in spite of repeated evidence that
transactions and reports were being processed outside the system. Whether for lack of
software functionality or operator knowledge, the software could never tie procurement
plans, disbursement plans, budgets and financial accounts to alleviate the burden of
overworked PMU manager and staff. This shortcoming is rated as minor, however,
because on the fundamentals IDA maintained accurate supervision of the financial
accounts of the project, which were regularly audited and found broadly correct.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

85. On the whole, the performance of IDA in this project was fully satisfactory.
However, IDA also had one minor shortcoming in supervision of the FM function, as
pointed out above, and one moderate shortcoming in ensuring quality at entry. The lack
of specificity in commitments and implementation arrangements with the various
institutional partners of the project could have been serious had IDA and the Borrower
not rallied energetically at critical points during implementation (see 5.1 (a) above). As a
consequence, the PMU manager became the critical path for resolution of every issue and
the DED advisors were forced into an enhanced implementation role additional to their
role as technical advisors.

86. Under these circumstances, IDA guidelines call for a moderately satisfactory rating
in spite of clearly satisfactory performance in the Bank's quality of supervision of the
project.



                                            23
5.2 Borrower Performance: Moderately Satisfactory

(a) Government Performance: Moderately Satisfactory
87. Government similarly met satisfactorily the majority of its commitments under the
project, albeit with some shortcomings explained below. GoE provided timely
counterpart financing, and on the whole empowered the EICTDA agency and its PMU to
execute the project to successful conclusion and thereby meet its development objectives.

88. The degree of government support given to the EICTDA agency is noteworthy
since the agency was created less than two years before project effectiveness and its
mandate affects critically the functioning of government and the entire economy.
Government gave the Agency adequate political support and autonomy to (i) convene the
rest of government, private sector, academia and other stakeholders to formulate a body
of policy, regulatory and legal instruments in the area of ICT; (ii) seek and engage local
government cooperation for all project components and (iii) select beneficiaries for
programs such as CIDEV and CRs through a bottom-up, objective and pre-defined
approach.

89. Government was also open and proactive in seeking extensive stakeholder input
into project design. A total of eleven awareness raising workshops, initial needs
assessments, and stakeholder and beneficiary consultation workshops were held during
the design and preparation of the project. These included representatives from federal,
regional and local government, NGOs, private sector stakeholders, community based
organizations (CBOs), academia, donors and other partners.

90. Through its telecommunications infrastructure program (see Annex 11),
Government also enabled the achievement of project objectives. This happened directly
in the case of the CIDEV program that was able to establish 51 community centers with
access to Internet. Indirectly, the powerful supply response of the ICT service sector
used as key indicator of PDO accomplishment (see 3.2), could not have occurred unless
sufficient confidence existed in the economy on the viability of investments in ICT-based
enterprise. This is not to say that telecommunication services in Ethiopia have yet caught
up with international standards (broadband Internet service, for example, is still very
unreliable and expensive) nor to imply that reforms should not be considered. It is an
acknowledgement that the multiple capacity building achievements of the project were
not seriously jeopardized by lack of essential telecommunication services.

91. However, four policy issues detracted from a fully satisfactory government
performance rating on this project :

      ·   Unfinished Sustainability Plan. The Government's firm determination to
          maintain and scale up the results of ICTAD, particularly the CIDEV and CR
          programs, was not reflected in commensurate institutional, human and financial
          arrangements by the end of the project. All the institutional entities created under
          the project (CIDEV centers, etc.) started operations two years later than originally
          planned and did not have time to become self-sustainable. Thus the nurturing that
          should have happened within the project needs to happen outside it in order for
          them to survive (See Section 2.5. This requires a strong transition plan including
          training, handholding, incentives, financing, staffing (central and regional),
          central coordination and local management. Bits and pieces of this plan were
          present (See Section 2.5), yet a full, reliable plan was not there by the end of the
          project.
      ·   Below market staff compensation. The compensation packages for high-skill
          positions were not set competitively and resulted in (i) difficulty to hire
          appropriately qualified staff in areas such as procurement, financial management,
          BIC management; (ii) staff attrition at critical times (procurement, FM), and
          filling of certain positions with individuals lacking the proper experience and
          qualifications. Acknowledging that this is a very complex problem for
          governments everywhere, the fact remains that if the right people cannot be hired
          and retained due to inability to compensate them competitively, then important,
          ICT-intensive projects and initiatives cannot be successfully undertaken.
      ·   Ineffective ISP licensing scheme. Even though ISP licenses were issued and thus
          the related dated covenant was technically met, the original intention of the
          parties to spur the improvement of Internet services through limited competition
          was not accomplished. While technical difficulties with the infrastructure may
          have prevented ETC from enabling the ISP licensees to operate, since ETC is a
          government-owned monopoly these difficulties were ultimately under
          government control.
      ·   Failure to test rural connectivity partnerships. Although GoE well surpassed the
          objective of 3,000 rural telephone connections set for the cancelled Rural
          Connectivity subcomponent of the project (see Section 1.7), the Government-

           requested cancellation did prevent the pilot testing of partnerships between the
           ETC and private sector cooperatives for provision of rural telecom services.
           Agreed upon and important opportunities were foregone to gain knowledge and
           experience in real-world regulatory issues involving private providers,
           competition, access rules, interconnection charges, etc.
92. Several delays were also minor shortcomings affecting government performance
rating, albeit with well understood justification, as pointed out in Section 2.2.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance: Moderately Satisfactory

93. EICTDA. At the project leadership level the Agency performed superbly and
steered the project to clear success. Advocacy with higher government, mediation with
local governments; consultation and coordination effectiveness with stakeholders were
exercised to great effect. The overall level of delegation of responsibility and authority to
the PMU were conducive to project success.

94.       However the Agency came up short in the following areas:

      ·    The Agency initiated a virtual incubation program in Addis for 17 private sector
           companies at an average cost of USD 32,590 without any known design
           document and without documented results of any kind. The BIC assessment
           report commissioned by the PMU did not offer any information on design or
           outputs of this effort and was quite skeptical about its technical soundness.
      ·    As an implementation partner institution for the project, while the Agency
           performed very well in some areas like Policy/Standards and BIC (after re-
           structuring), there was frequent tension and heightened project implementation
           risk from (i) encroachment of project staff time for agency business (for example
           for a protracted business process re-engineering exercise during 2007/2008) and
           (ii) diffused accountability for results when tasks were under Agency rather than
           PMU responsibility.
      ·    The EICTDA was also frequently unable to maintain dedicated counterpart staff
           for critical areas of ICTAD like CIDEV, BIC, TVET-TOT and CRs. In some
           cases counterparts were Agency managers who, while able to provide guidance,
           were not suitable subjects of field-level knowledge transfer from DED advisors.
           In others (TVET and BIC counterparts during the first half of the project),
           counterparts were consultants or agency staff who, for one reason or another,
           could not dedicate the time necessary to become accountable for results.
95. The above challenges are to be expected from a new agency and therefore the
performance rating is satisfactory in view of project results (see Section 3). Project
design provided for formation of the PMU precisely to mitigate the risks posed by (i) the
relative inexperience of Agency staff in management of complex projects; (ii) the
daunting responsibilities placed on the Agency (Proclamation 360/2003 gives it 26
government-wide mandates); (iii) the mismatch between traditional civil service culture




                                              26
and pay scales on one side, and the performance demands from an agency focused on
technology-enabled transformation of government and of the economy at large.

96. The PMU received unanimous praise from the numerous project stakeholders and
clearly was very effective in managing the project to successful completion. This was
particularly notable in view of the large scope and complexity of institution building
responsibilities that the project was forced to take in order to meet its targets.

97. The PMU was highly effective in building the implementation partnerships on
which project implementation relied by design.             It conducted an extensive
communications and training program to raise the capacity of the partner organizations
and secure their commitment to project objectives. When for one reason or another
partnerships did not make progress at the expected pace, as in the case of the Ministry of
Education for the TVET TOT program, the PMU negotiated successfully across layers of
government to get help from new partners.

98. The willingness and capacity of the main partners (the Agency, the PMU and IDA)
to confront crisis and change course were notable factors of project success. Following
mid-term review in April 2008 it was clear that the pace of progress had to change
drastically for the project to meet its objectives. Program areas such as BIC, CR, TVET
and RTC were seriously behind schedule. Three main initiatives were implemented:

   ·   A "Project Charter" was defined for each major program area of ICTAD as part of
       a rapid results exercise. This raised awareness among project stakeholders about
       the complexity, status, and challenges to complete the work before project
       closing. However, it did not change day to day management and in retrospect it
       was not viewed as critical factor of success by any of the stakeholders interviewed
       for the ICR.
   ·   Direct, forceful involvement of EICTDA management to resolve strategic
       bottlenecks. This was decisive for: (i) TVET TOT program partnership was
       reoriented towards regional education bureaus and away from central Ministry of
       Education. (ii) IBLF was given a full management contract to set up and run the
       RTC and de-manufacturing facility. (iii) BIC program reverted to the EICTDA
       agency which mobilized authorities to speed the pace of implementation.
   ·   Intensive follow up of procurement by the Bank and joint work with PMU staff
       succeeded in eliminating the transaction backlog and complete the procurement
       plan.
99. However, there were also shortcomings in the performance of the PMU, notably on
the financial management and M&E areas, as indicated in Section 2.4 and discussed in
Annex 2, Section 1.4.

100. DED performance. The role and performance of DED advisors was a critical
factor of project success and is rated as highly satisfactory. DED's role was envisioned
as advisory with a paramount emphasis on transfer of knowledge to Ethiopian
counterparts. While knowledge was in fact effectively transferred to individual CIDEV
center boards, BIC managers, CR associations and TVET college administrators,


                                           27
knowledge transfer from DED advisors to EICTDA staff was limited by discontinuity in
counterpart staff assignments.

101. In the absence of dedicated PMU or agency staff with the required skills and time,
several DED advisors (TVET, BIC, CIDEV, and CR) became effectively responsible for
program implementation in the field, acting on behalf of the PMU but not always with a
commensurate level of discretion and information on financial and procurement aspects.
DED's agreement to this role change and its constructive handling of the resulting
inevitable tensions speak highly of their institutional commitment to the project. The
integration of DED advisors into task implementation teams was ultimately productive
and successful yet required significant adjustments on both sides. Its conditions can be
improved in future projects, as suggested in Section 6.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance:
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
102. As was the case with rating of Bank performance, rating of Borrower's performance
as "moderately satisfactory" instead of satisfactory or higher is disappointing given the
Borrower's major accomplishments in this project. However, the performance of
government was affected by four moderate and one minor shortcoming, as detailed under
Section 5.2.(a).

103. Rating of the implementation agency (EICTDA) and the PMU as "Moderately
Satisfactory" instead of satisfactory or higher is equally disappointing given their major
accomplishments and effort on this project. However, as explained in Section 5.2 (b),
both had also some shortcomings that pulled the rating down towards the "MS level.

6. Lessons Learned
104. The main lessons emerging from this Project are for the most part relevant to other
developing countries.

      ·   ICT is relevant and effective enabler of grass root development. Over 70,000
          poor people in remote rural areas of Ethiopia, women, HIV-infected, the disabled
          and especially the young invest their limited time and money every month in
          community centers and other facilities created by the ICTAD project to access
          information and learn basic ICT skills. ICTAD demonstrated that adequate
          institutional models, public sector support programs, grassroots demand and
          technologies exist to enable development of people at the lowest end of the
          income scale. The project provides strong evidence that governments and
          international development organizations should be "resolute to empower the poor,
          particularly those living in remote, rural and marginalized urban areas, to access
          information and to use ICTs as a tool to support their efforts to lift themselves out
          of poverty"10.

                                                28
·   Community-based ICT centers are a successful institutional model. ICT
    community centers created bottom up on the basis of demand by community
    organizations are a sturdy and promising model for bridging the connectivity gap
    in Ethiopia and probably in other countries. None of the 65 centers created under
    the ICTAD project have folded down, even those that have operated for over two
    years. This is an important lesson when considering that failure rates during this
    same period exceed 15% in other countries. Since this project did not have time
    to determine unequivocally whether the business model used was financially
    sustainable and therefore scalable in the long-run (see Annex 2, Subcomponent 4,
    par. 161), a clear lesson is also the need to test desirable modifications to the
    business model and financial sustainability over a longer period.
·   Implementation partnerships must be tightly designed at entry. Agreements
    between government agencies, particularly across levels of government, can go
    wrong for many reasons. When detailed commitments of staff, time, money,
    authority, problem solving, monitoring, early termination, etc. are not spelled out
    at entry, as in the case of ICTAD, the risk of implementation failure can be
    increased. This is of course a dilemma for project preparation which would need
    to be extended in time (and cost) to achieve this level of precision. It is also a risk
    in itself as best laid plans can be unraveled during implementation or unduly
    constrain it. However, if the partnerships are critical success factors for the
    project, this problem has to be addressed either through extended project
    preparation, more flexible results frameworks or more flexible staffing plans.
·   ICT Projects requiring institution building must have long time horizons,
    large TA inputs and phased implementation. Institution building even at the
    level of community organizations or small businesses is complex and time
    consuming.     Mobilizing local support requires extensive managerial time and
    new organizations require intensive training and technical support. With
    procurement and organizational work taking 4 years, measurable development
    outcomes from new institutions during one investment project are often
    unrealistic. CIDEV, BIC, CRs, CRTC-DMF are all new institutions created under
    ICTAD with extraordinary effort and five years were barely sufficient to get them
    started.
·   Long-term, field-based technical cooperation can be highly effective modality
    of international assistance. This was demonstrated by the key role played by
    DED in project success. DED's contribution to ICTAD far exceeds its monetary
    cost in terms of the development potential of organizations (CIDEV community
    centers, community radios, business incubators) and facilities (TVET college
    training programs and computer labs, e-learning programs, etc.) created with their
    help. This modality of international cooperation is only possible for organizations
    like DED able to attract experts personally committed to the advancement of less
    developed countries with all its complexities and challenges, and is therefore in
    scarce supply. When available, however, it can feature prominently in project
    designs by governments and IDA.

   ·   Local political support is essential and must be explicitly designed for. This
       was a critical success factor for all activities under Component 2. The
       establishment of CIDEV centers, community radios and business incubators was
       possible only after the Agency mobilized local political support. Project design
       must envision what incentives ­ budgetary transfers, competition, self-interest,
       awards, political pressure or raw authority ­ will be deployed to obtain and
       maintain local support. Awareness raising events only go so far.
   ·   Bank project team continuity is important success factor that should be the
       default Bank staffing policy. When IDA proposed to change ICTAD's Task
       Team Leader following MTR, GoE argued forcefully against it and IDA's
       eventual agreement to keep the team intact from beginning to end of the project
       proved to be decisively important.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by
Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies
105. High level Government representatives interviewed for the ICR expressed strong
satisfaction with the work done by IDA in support of ICTAD design and implementation
and in particular with the dedication and knowledge of the task manager. This is
mentioned here not only because it clearly went beyond the normal formalities, but also
because this level of satisfaction with IDA support was made possible in large measure
by the stability of the task manager and a senior consultant who steered the project from
conception to completion.

106. Conversely, in areas like financial management where IDA made repeated staffing
changes, Implementation Agency representatives expressed disappointment and
suggested closer and more stable involvement by IDA. It seems clear that IDA could
have done a better job following up on FM issues and assisting the PMU with training
and technical advice in setting up a better computerized system.

107. Similarly, some Agency representatives expressed disappointment with occasional
inconsistency in IDA procurement technical reviews. IDA sometimes needs to call in
consultants or staff for ad-hoc technical reviews whose comments may be inconsistent
with prior IDA clearances and advice followed by PMU in preparing procurement
documents. Clearly IDA needs to ensure that its technical advisors have the duty and
time to take into account past interactions and agreements with the Borrower.

108. A final comment from Implementation Agency representatives was a suggestion
that in projects like ICTAD involving large capacity building activities, residential
workshops, overseas training and the like, it was important to design highly transparent
participant selection mechanisms and to strongly tie training with result commitments.

109. The DED expressed satisfaction from its participation in this project. The
organization invested over 2.1 million Euros to field 10 advisors who provided over 31
staff years of TA to the project. The DED advisors, being members of implementation
teams, had recommendations which could have speeded up the project but could not be
implemented for various reasons. They felt that review missions of the World Bank often
did not understand the real situation and sometimes sensed these missions negatively. To
avail future projects from this extraordinary resource it would be important to define
careful communication guidelines among the Government, the DED and IDA.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component
Component 1 ­ Policy and Institutional Support

110. The objective of this sub-component was to develop the core set of National
policies, laws, regulations and standards, and guidelines for use of IT in the Ethiopian
economy in general and in the public sector in particular. This is therefore an essentially
"horizontal" governance foundation affecting utilization of technology across the entire
economy.

111. Specific target indicators were (i) the development of an overall ICT policy for
government; (ii) development of 14 national ICT standards, and 3 National ICT
guidelines; (iii) the reduction of import tax on ICT imports. Other indicators that were
reformulated during program restructuring were the development of ICT-related
legislation and of intellectual property right legislation.

112. Against these objectives the EICTDA agency performed outstandingly well,
especially considering that it was a new agency and that this agenda is one of the most
complex ones that challenge mature counterpart agencies in other countries. Table 7
summarizes the outputs from this subcomponent. The data sheet shows how of the
indicators formulated after restructuring the only one not fully achieved was the reduction
in tariffs for ICT which was only made applicable to investment-oriented imports and
thus largely bypassed the ICT industry.

113. As indicated in Table 7, five laws were drafted and sent for comments to
government agencies prior to their submission to the legislature. Thirteen ICT standards
and three ICT guidelines were developed and issued. Additionally, four draft standards
were finalized, and eight were under development by project termination. These outputs
required extensive stakeholder consultation and debate. 14 consultative workshops and
discussion forums were conducted and about 528 stakeholders (181 women) participated
at different stages.

114. A large consultative effort is needed to develop policy regulation and standards and
the quality and extent of this effort determines compliance in large measure. Thus
EICTDA held 14 consultative workshops and discussion forums in which about 528
stakeholders participated at different stages, with 181 women among them as shown in
Table 8.

Subcomponent 1.3 Institutional Strengthening

1.3 1     Institutional support to EICTDA
115. This subcomponent was the flagship capacity building mechanism of the project.
Its objective was to build the human organizational and technical capacity of the key
sector institutions namely the EICTDA, the ETA and the EBA. In practice capacity
building efforts were extended to the Civil Service College, the College of
Telecommunications and Information Technology (CTIT), the Productivity Improvement
Center (PIC), the Federal Medium and Small Enterprise Development Agency
(FEMSEDA) and a small part the ETC. This subcomponent absorbed the lion share of
project funds, 31.8% or USD 7.4 million to be precise. In total over 765 staff members
participated in short and long term trainings (27 on BSc/BA programs, 79 professionals
participated in short term external trainings, and 82 persons participated in study tours.

116. As is the case with all training, impact can be seen only in results and over the
medium term. From this perspective it is clear that the capacity of the Agency to
discharge its multiple mandates has been substantially strengthened, as evidence by late
project performance on programs such as the Policy and Regulatory Framework and the
Business Incubation program.

117. Under this subcomponent the EICTDA agency also provided smaller support inputs
to the following agencies:

   ·    Ethiopian Civil Service College. The project set out to help ECSC use modern
        eLearning technologies for remote training of civil servants. A DED advisor
        dedicated to this effort designed an e-Learning SW platform and two courses
        (Procurement Management and Human Resource Management). Staff were
        trained (unfortunately one left) and a first pilot course was ongoing in Awassa
        during the ICR mission, which unfortunately had already been halted several days
        due to the poor quality of Internet connectivity. Project results were therefore not
        conclusive, however it is clear that e-Learning is a promising technology,
        particularly in a country that has had the forethought to deploy a government-
        wide data communications network like Woredanet.
   ·    College of Telecommunications and Information Technology. Project component
        one was designed to provide extensive support to the College of
        Telecommunications and Information Technology (CTIT) in the form of technical
        assistance, hiring of academic consultants, short and long term training and IT
        infrastructure. The objective was to create capacity for research and learning
        primarily in the Telecommunication subsector. Unfortunately CTIT was
        drastically reorganized and its mission re-oriented during the project. It played a


                                            38
       rather modest role in ICTAD as the source of training for 173 TVET instructors.
       Nonetheless, the project provided support to the tune of USD 353,639 to CTIT.
   ·   Productivity Improvement Center (PIC) and FEMSEDA. These two institutions
       support training of small and medium enterprise employees, the first mainly in
       Addis Ababa and the second throughout the country. The project strengthened
       them with training, IT and training equipment, software and technical support. In
       total these organizations trained 645 SME operators (see Annex 2, Table 17).

Subcomponent 1.3.2. Institutional support to ETA
118. The project provided support at a cost of USD 1.7 million (7.2% of project funds) to
the ETA in the form of technical assistance, hiring of consultants, short and long term


                                           39
training and IT infrastructure. One DED Technical Advisor was posted to work with the
ETA for 2 years starting September, 2007 in the areas of telecommunication standards
and quality of service, on which ETA published new standards.

119. ETA issued the following regulatory instruments during the project:

   ·   Private Radio communications Directive issued in 2005;
   ·   New national numbering plan issued in 2006;
   ·   Quality of service standards for telecommunication services issued in 2008 ;
   ·    Standards for short range devices issued in 2008;
   ·   Directive on type approval of telecommunication equipment.
   ·   Value added services directive
   ·   Standards for Terminal Equipment to be connected to Public Switched Telephone
       Network (PSTN);
   ·   Standards for Integrated Services Digital Network Basic Access Devices (ISDN-
       BA);
   ·   Standards for CDMA 800 MHz Fixed Wireless Phones and
   ·   Standards for Third-Generation (3G) Cellular Mobile Terminals
   ·    Standards for Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line Modems (ADSL Modems)
   ·   VSAT licenses to investors and different institutions have been issued.
   ·   Consumer complaint handling process was developed and ETA started processing
       complaints.
120. On the other hand, over USD 1 million were disbursed for ETA's spectrum
management system in 2006 and the system did not reach full operational status by the
end of the project. Design of ETA's Integrated Regulatory Information System was
contracted for in May, 2008 and the system was not operational by the end of the Project.

121. The performance of ETA's-related indicators in ICTAD's result framework
(reduced import tax for ICT equipment and effective regulation and enforcement of
national spectrum and quality of service policy) were deemed to have been accomplished
50% and 40% respectively (see Data Sheet, Section F), becoming the only progress
indicators that the project failed to substantially achieve or overachieve.

Subcomponent 1.3.3 Institutional support to EBA
122. Broadcasting allows people and communities to exercise their right to freedom of
expression and thus it is a powerful application of technology to human development.
EBA's mission is promoting expansion of high quality broadcasting that contributes to
political, social and economic development. ICTAD sought to improve EBA's capacity
to perform its mission through training of staff and financing of technology. The
expected evidence of increased institutional strength was the development of


                                           40
broadcasting legislation and radio licensing schemes, as well as the issuance of at least 5
community radio licenses within the period.

123. EBA overachieved in all output categories (see Table 11):

   · Policy and regulation. The pre-existing Broadcasting proclamation no 178/1999
     was replaced by proclamation no 533/2007 which addresses the development of
     Community Radio in accordance with international best practice.

   · The Board of EBA approved the Formulation of Community Broadcasting
     licensing directives incorporating comments by NGOs, Government
     representatives and other stakeholders.

   · A complaint handling directive was formulated to help safeguard the quality and
     safety of broadcast materials.

Subcomponent 1.4 - Project Management
124. The overall performance of the PMU was evaluated already under Section 5.2(b).
This section therefore focuses only on explaining the general comments made in Section
2.4 on the FM, procurement and M&E functions.

125. Financial management. As indicated in Section 2.4, financial management was
exercised in general compliance with fiduciary requirements and agreed upon procedures,
yet with significant shortcomings. The financial accounts of the project were regularly
audited and found correct. The final audit was still pending when this ICR was
completed.

126. Accounting and financial reporting were barely able to keep up with the past and
contributed little to forward-looking financial management. Ledger posting backlogs
prevailed and budgets were non-existent during most of the project. Budgets were
declared nominally alive only seven months before project closing when all financial
planning discretion had evaporated. While it could be argued that expenditure
forecasting and budget control had a very limited role in an environment dominated by
operational constraints as pointed out in Section 2.2, in fact a consistent comment made
by leaders of the various program areas was that knowledge of funding envelopes would
have helped them to steer action and plan work more efficiently.

127. Some of the FM shortcomings that prevailed during the project despite repeated
flagging in IDA reports and corresponding "reform" agreements were: (i) incorrect
format and content of financial management reports (FMR); (ii) inconsistency between
IDA and project accounts (see Annex 1 for discrepancies remaining at the end of the
project), and (iii) unresolved issues with partially reimbursed withdrawal authorizations.

128. The following issues kept the project under frequent accounting backlog,
substandard level of internal control and unclear financial condition:

   ·   Under staffing of FM function. Advertising for the assistant financial officer
       position did not attract interest for over a year and then the new recruit left for
       better pay after less than a year on the job. This resulted in concentration of work
       on the principal financial officer and consequent internal control issues for lack of
       segregation of duties.
   ·   Deficient accounting software. The Peachtree Software-based accounting system
       never reached the level of functionality required for agile and accurate financial
       reporting under the project. This was raised by the Bank since November, 2007
       and even for this ICR the PMU prepared the expense breakdowns feeding into
       Annex 1 using data processed in Excel outside the system.
   ·   Irregularity in IDA vs. Counterpart funds utilization. Funds contributed by the
       government should normally be used to pay an agreed fraction of categories of


                                            42
       payments specified in the Credit Agreement. The Bank pointed out since
       November 2007 that this was not always being done under ICTAD. Although
       GoE counterpart contributions were timely made over the five years, 79% of fund
       withdrawals were made during the last 5 months of the project, even though
       during the same time disbursements from the IDA account were less than 10% of
       project funds. Furthermore, during review of the last FMR, IDA found a balance
       of USD 621,174.33 that did not correspond with its own project accounts as
       affected by withdrawal authorizations submitted by the PMU. To preserve
       foreign exchange the PMU had apparently made the corresponding payments out
       of the Counterpart, not the IDA account. It must be noted that inconsistencies
       were always eventually resolved in a satisfactory manner.
129. It must also be acknowledged that the numerous institutional partnerships required a
large volume of accounting transactions that would have been challenging to keep up to
date even with a superior computer system and adequate staffing.

Procurement
130. Procurement performance was substantially different from the first to the second
half of the project. There was initial difficulty to recruit staff knowledgeable of World
Bank procedures and lack of familiarity with procurement of construction contracts
which had not been originally planned. These issues led to one unsatisfactory rating by
IDA in October, 2009. Corrective action from EICTDA's Director General on down was
energetic and effective. By project closing procurement had fully caught up and the
project ended with a well-deserved satisfactory rating in this area.

             Issue                                         Comment

131. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization.
The M&E system built under the project caters to the needs of both the ICT sector in
general, to assist the EICTDA in its mandate as sector oversight agency, and of the
ICTAD project in particular. With respect to its sector-wide objective the system worked
well by meeting the requirements of the National ICT CB Program (2002).

132. With respect to ICTAD's M&E requirements, the system design and operation for
the most part met the requirements of the results framework post-restructuring, albeit
with some shortcomings noted below. On the whole, however, the methodology and
process for data collection were well designed and consistent across the years. They are
therefore a data and methodological platform of much value both to the sector and to any
potential follow-on operation. Specifically, the system developed survey methods and
consistent 4-year data series on (i) ICT industry across the country and (ii) access to
services in rural areas.

133. An effective M&E program and a robust learning system were considered key
activities under this project because of the expected asynchronous implementation of its
multiple activities. The requirements of the M&E system were formulated in the PAD
perhaps too ambitiously and were properly scaled down during project restructuring.
Below is an assessment based on original requirements in the PAD:

                                  dimensioned to supervise and enforce the reporting system.

134. A useful service suggested for ICTAD's M&E system was that of tracking progress
in telecom services against the government's own established benchmarks. The system
did track the critical network infrastructure, user base, tariff and quality of service
variables but could not draw comparisons with targets that are largely not publicized.

objectives were accomplished through installation of over 11.000 rural telephones

Subcomponent 2 ICT Private Sector Development (Business incubator)
136. The objective of the Business Incubation (BIC) program of ICTAD is to create
opportunities for technology micro entrepreneurs to test their business ideas and develop
viable businesses. Each incubator would provide technology, space, technical and
entrepreneurial support to private companies, usually start-ups.

137. The project set out to create one central incubator in Addis Ababa where demand
was presumed to be largest. It actually over achieved its objective by creating four
regional business incubators in four regional capitals between February, 2008 and July,
2009. The business tenant profile of these centers is shown below in Table 14.

                      Table 14. Tenant Profile of Incubation Centers
138. Each incubator required developing a government-owned yet business-oriented
organization from the ground up and coordination of this on both the central and local
sides was time consuming. All jurisdictions had difficulty fulfilling their commitment to
provide a suitable building as a condition for program support, and it was ultimately
necessary to relax this requirement and provide construction financing in order to
proceed.

139. ICTAD PMU provided effective coordination of the program until after MTR of the
project in March, 2008. After that, responsibility for the program was transferred to a
different manager within EICTDA who did take matters into his hands and helped to
remove major roadblocks then existing. A DED advisor was dedicated to the BIC
program at great personal effort and was therefore instrumental in making it a success.

140. Total program costs were in the order of USD 3,512,426. Of these, almost 16%
were spent on grants for seventeen (17) so called virtual incubators in Addis Ababa.
These grants were considerable in terms of the usual capital structure of software
companies in Ethiopia, and ranged from USD 11,000 to USD 48,000. This part of the
program had very doubtful results as the grantees, apart from receiving the money and
access to space in a local government facility did not receive discernible technical advice,
supervision or monitoring. Under these circumstances grants operate only as public
subsidies to private business that may distort more than help their long term competitive
viability and discriminate against competitors. It is understood that this "virtual
incubation" program in reality is preparing a tenant base for the IT Park being developed
by EICTDA and therefore it may well be a sound long-term investment in private sector
support. With the information available to the ICR, however, no tangible benefit can be
discerned from the Project investment in this program.

Computer Refurbishment and Training Center/De-manufacturing facility
141. As planned, one computer refurbishment and training centre (CRTC) was built from
the ground up, fully equipped and started operations in Akakai (Oromiya region). The
CRTC refurbishes donated computers and sells them at affordable prices ($105 per
computer) to schools, health centers and community organizations (not to the public). In
addition the center provides advanced, hands-on training to 75 TVET graduates every
year using for this purpose superb classrooms and computer workshop facilities.
Graduates achieve mastery of computer repair, maintenance and networking.

142. The CRTC is a world class facility and Microsoft Authorized Refurbisher (MAR)
adhering the EU's Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) directive.
Computers are professionally tested, cleaned and loaded with licensed software in a high-

offering support and ensuring that eligible recipients are able to provide a secure
environment for the safe and sustainable use of ICT.

   The USD 85 cost includes overseas and inland shipping, new peripherals (cables, mouse,

 software installation, and packaging for distribution.
                      Table 15. Value Proposition of ICTAD's CRTC
143. Protracted preparations (for financial autonomy, building construction, power
connection, access to foreign exchange and recruitment of skilled staff) and fragmented
management responsibilities (between EICTDA, PMU and the consultant company),
seriously delayed the start of CRTC operations. Following the project's mid-term review
in April 2008 the EIICTDA outsourced to the consultant, an NGO, management of the
CRTC under a form of PPP arrangement until November 2010. The business partner
provides knowledge transfer, technical support and management. Under this PPP the
center was able to start operations in June 2009 and by the end of the project it had sold
3,300 out of planned 15,000 computers.

144. The CRTC is now poised for sustained operation and rapid growth. While ICTAD
provided the needed investment financing as a grant, the CRTC is expected to be
operationally self-sustainable going forward. It is on track to firm up supply
arrangements with overseas donor corporations and domestically to reach a steady stream
of orders from eligible recipients. Its breakeven quantity is around 9,500 computers per
year, at $105 per computer, therefore it is not a small scale operation and requires
professional and accountable management to avoid insolvency and prosper.

145. Although clearly an outstanding achievement so far, the CRTC needs continued
support from the EICTDA during the initial phase of operations to establish itself firmly
as an independent entity. In particular it needs: (i) autonomy to hire competent
management and technical staff and to compensate them competitively; (ii) access to
foreign exchange for its international supply operations; (iii) clarification of its legal
status and (iv) reliable demand from public schools and other qualified clients to ensure a
breakeven flow of computers through its impressive facilities.

De-manufacturing (DMF)
146. Before ICTAD, there was no process in place to collect and process electronic
equipment at the end of its life cycle. This is a major environmental risk and immediate
actions are required to prevent the dumping of toxic electronic waste to landfills. Thus
the project established a computer de-manufacturing facility next to the CRTC which is
already operating in a temporary building pending completion of its own.

147. Planning and management of the DMF is also the responsibility of the CRTC
business partner. Experts from the partner work closely with the Ethiopian Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) to establish environmentally safe processes in the entire supply
and de-manufacturing chain of toxic electronic waste.

Subcomponent 3. TVET Training of Trainers (TVET - TOT
148. The Ethiopian Technical and Vocational Education and Training system (TVET)
offers training in 25 fields including ICT at more than 200 locations to over 200,000
students, of whom 51% are women. Ethiopia ranked 72 out of 93 countries rated in 2007
by the UN with respect to the Women Empowerment Index11.

149. The overall objective of the TVET TOT program is to improve the quality of ICT
training for students at TVET colleges in key ICT subjects including initially PC
maintenance and trouble shooting, networking, and Database management basics.
Specifically ICTAD aimed to train at least 600 TVET teachers (increased from initial
400) and to improve the IT infrastructure and training labs in at least three TVET
colleges. The project fully achieved and surpassed these objectives (see Table 16). It
graduated 576 certified trainers and additional training sessions were on-going by end of
project. It also established 15 computer training labs, two each in TVET colleges in
Tigray, Oromia, SNNP and Amhara regions, and one lab in each of the other 7 regions.

150. ICT services are needed by all sectors today. Many private, government and non-
government offices in the regions suffer from non-functioning ICT equipment as the
required maintenance expertise mostly available in the large cities. Although not
explicitly tracked, TVET-TOT trainees are believed to be behind the major expansion of
computer training facilities and services measured as one of the PDO indicators.

151. The HRD-department of EICTDA managed the program in partnership with the
Ministry of Education, the Regional Education Bureaus, and TVET colleges. ICTAD
supported the program with one experienced DED TA. Three institutions provided the
actual training: Mekelle Institute of Technology (MIT), Adama University and the
College of Telecommunication and Information Technology (CTIT).

152. Separately, the project supported also the initiation of TOT courses for Small and
Medium Enterprise (SME) operators, mainly in Addis Ababa but also in other regions.
The project partnered with the Productivity Improvement Center (PIC), a training outfit
mainly oriented towards the Addis Ababa region and the Federal Medium and Small
Enterprise Development Agency (FEMSEDA) for this purpose. Table 17 below shows
the training results from these partnerships:

153. The project ended with extraordinary interest from the regional education bureaus
in expanding the TVET-TOT program both in geographic and in curriculum coverage.
However, as pointed out in Section 2.5, there are no specific plans to continue funding
the program other than transferring responsibility for it to the local governments but
without explicit technical support or funding from the center.

Subcomponent 4 Community ICT Development (CIDEV)

154. CIDEV provides competitive access to grants for eligible community organizations
and assists successful applicants to setup community ICT centers. The centers are


                                                           49
located in buildings provided free of charge by local sponsors (the community
organization itself or local government) and are managed on a voluntary basis by a
committee. They have been established mainly in remote and inaccessible parts of the
country (see Table 18) and focus on community development activities (see Table 19).
Full profile is in Table 23.

                       Table 18: CIDEV centers created under the project
155. The appraisal process for CIDEV program proposals was carefully defined and
documented in the ICTAD Operating Manual. Eligible entities include local civic
organizations already working on development issues, government agencies, licensed
businesses, registered associations, NGO's or kebeles. Proposals are evaluated on well-
defined criteria such as (i) scalability; (ii) alignment with national priorities in health,
agriculture, education, good governance and ICTAD development objectives; (iii) a
demand-driven business model; (iv) physical and financial feasibility; and (v)
sponsorship by community or local government through provision of rent-free space.
Investment grant proposals cannot exceed USD 50,000 equivalent (the actual average
grant was USD 33,803), and they must meet defined documentation standards (rational
objectives, anticipated impact, costs/risks, etc.) The PMU performs the technical
appraisal process, and then recommends proposals for selection by an advisory board
composed of representatives from government, private sector, civil society and the
UNDP. The final grant decision is made by the EICTDA Director General on the
Board's recommendation.

156. Outputs. The project target of 40 "community-based" centers was exceeded. A
total of sixty-five (65) CIDEV centers were set up of which 54 meet the "community
based" requirement and 11 (created top-down by the Ministry of Youth affairs) do not.
Repressed demand for new CIDEV centers was over 600 proposals by Project closing.

157. Formation of each center requires considerable travel and extensive work on
awareness raising, planning, negotiation, contracting, community mobilization,
organization, recruitment, training, building preparation, procurement, installation of
equipment, financial administration and technical support. The results, however, go far
beyond mere provision of ICT. CIDEV centers are also institutional platforms for
dissemination of knowledge, provision of government services and community
participation in governance.

158. Services. All centers provide basic computer training, telephone use, and secretarial
services such as scanning, fax, and photocopying. Many centers diversify into other
services such as passport photographs, cafeteria, recreational TV, showers, etc. to
increase revenue. Most centers are the first and only ICT service providers in their area



                                              50

statistics is shown in Table 19.

160. Financial performance. The not-for-profit principle of the program results in
below-market service fees which are still calculated to cover operating costs after ICTAD
support terminates at the end of one year of operation. Average operating cost and
revenue data were available only for 44 (68%) of the centers (see Table 21). Of these, 34
centers (77%) show monthly profits. Some centers incurring monthly losses
(predominantly youth centers) waive the fees due to customer's inability to pay. Eight of
them now have independent sources of revenue. Twenty-nine centers were founded in
the last year and still face the expenses and frequent revenue shortfall associated with
startups. Although more systematic data collection is clearly needed, it seems reasonable
to expect that a majority of the centers can be financially sustainable.

161. Sustainability. Sixty-one out of 65 centers are rated to have medium to strong
sustainability, as shown in Table 22. These ratings were assigned by program managers
through qualitative assessment of factors such as service statistics, availability of rent-
free facilities, income, and the strength of the governing board and of
community/government sponsorship. Even though 45 centers (69%) have already
graduated from the one-year operational subsidy period, at project completion no center
had yet closed for business. This is likely to change, and a percentage of the centers will
probably close. However, the failure rate of centers in Ethiopia is expected to be lower
than in India (15%), mostly on account of the CIDEV partnerships with existing
community organizations13.

162. Scalability. The question of whether CIDEV centers with the present business
model could be scaled up as country-wide solution to the connectivity gap was not
answered conclusively by ICTAD due mainly to lack of time to observe the financial
performance of the centers. ICTAD's average cost per CIDEV/CR was USD 52,760.
For 15,000 Kebeles, this would cost USD 791.4 million, an amount presently
unaffordable. However, ICTAD's average investment cost per center is an unlikely
parameter for estimation of scaling up costs because:

     ·   Close to one half of investment costs were used to help sponsoring community
         organizations refurbish and furnish the center premises. This would be done only
         exceptionally under a scaling up scheme.

  In India, the Citizen Service Center (CSC) program is based on local entrepreneurship, most of it ad-hoc.
See http://www.csc-india.org/Default.aspx?tabid=490&EntryID=4.


                                                    52
   ·   Training costs for employee training are likely to decrease significantly given the
       much higher supply of instructors which the project generated primarily through
       the TVET program.
   ·   Financial performance of the centers over a longer period of time may be
       sufficiently strong to justify a loan component for investment costs, thus reducing
       the average amount of grant financing.
163. Challenges Encountered. The main limiting factor was the small number of staff
to run the CIDEV program both at the PMU and in the regional capitals. For more than a
year, the DED advisor traveled mostly alone throughout Ethiopia as the only staff person
responsible for implementation of centers, and the ICTAD Project Manager had to
intervene personally to remove obstacles and negotiate every grant award. Thus,
extraordinary individual dedication was in large part responsible for the eventual results
exceeding project targets.

164. Centers also faced high turnover of committee members and generally low
managerial skills within the responsible community organizations. Some ICT centers are
not yet financially self-supporting due to low demand for ICT services. Frequent power
supply failures and interruptions in telephone and internet connections also disrupt
income-generating activities. Failure of some sponsoring communities to provide rent-
free space also imperils sustainability. Administration and control systems were not
developed enough to provide the full service statistics and revenue data needed for the
ICR.

Community Radio (CR) Program
165. The project set out to establish 4 community radios, three (Kore, Bonga, Durame)
in the SNNP region and one (Sude) in Oromia region. It actually established seven
community radios in the above targeted locations plus one each in Kombolcha, Sekota &
Jimma. The Jimma CR had been started before the project launched so ICTAD provided
ICT equipment and training to make it operational. An 8th CR in Argoba was being
established at project closing.

166. ICTAD provided all coordination, technical assistance, procurement of equipment
and funding for the CR program. A DED advisor was dedicated to these tasks and was
therefore instrumental in making these community radios a reality. The EBA supported
the project effectively through new legislation on CRs and by expediting issuance of
licenses.

167. Establishment of each CR requires licensing, technical installation, training, content
development, organizational development and networking / establishment of a
Community Radio Association, hiring of staff (including the station manager),
administrative and financial control systems and of course money (over USD $50,00o for
each CR).

168. Each CR requires studio Equipment (broadcast mixer, CD-Players, etc.), Field
Recording Equipment (recording sets for interviews, external Microphones, etc.),
Transmission Equipment (antenna masts, FM Transmitter, etc., IT Equipment (10


                                            53
refurbished computers and special software for every site, etc.), power generator, backup
equipment and of course furniture.

169. CRs go through a process at the community level akin to that of a child learning to
speak at the personal level. To give effective voice to a community and learn to inform
members on common issues, concerns, culture and activities is a long-term learning
process that requires extensive training and mentoring by experienced practitioners. In
addition, CRs under ICTAD need to become at least partially self-sufficient and this
involves business planning and collegial management by a board of community leaders.
More fundamentally, CRs need at all costs to be grounded and led by communities and
therefore they cannot thrive well under external direction.

170. Thus CRs are both an extraordinary resource for community development and a low
volume, long gestation-type of activity not easily scaled up but demanding of
experienced, professional support by governments, at least at the beginning. The
EICTDA has extended the contract with the DED advisor who is focusing on setting up
the Community Radio Association as a mechanism for networking, technical support and
possibly training of the existing CRs.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Economic Premise and benefits

171. As pointed out in Section 3.3, to analyze ICTAD's economic benefits it is
indispensable to acknowledge fully that the project's objective was fundamentally
capacity building.

172. The project aimed to create capacity for well-known economic benefits to
materialize, not to achieve those benefits directly. The project's fundamental economic
premise was that "use of appropriate ICT can facilitate access to markets, development
information, and public services, all ways to improve the livelihood of the affected
communities." The design took the link between project outputs and ultimate economic
benefits as a premise, not as an objective to be validated through the results framework.
The project did not set out to actually provide access to markets, or to deliver
development information or public services through ICT-based facilities. In fact, none of
the original or restructured project components and none of the project development
indicators directly targeted any of these economic benefits.

173. This approach resulted in a project designed to create human, institutional and
regulatory capacity to jump start the ICT sector in areas where it was practically non-
existing and for the benefit of communities previously without access to technology. The
five years of the project were spent in creating these capacities and launching them
operationally with reasonable prospects of continuation. The benefits to be expected
such as increase employment and incomes, increased economic activity, lifting of some
very poor people out of complete poverty, giving development opportunities to
disadvantaged groups like women and HIV-infected youths, etc. were shown to be
possible and likely through beneficiary surveys mainly for CIDEV and BIC programs.
However, actual impact measurement has to wait until a representative group of
graduates from these programs can be followed during a meaningful time.

174. In the meantime it is worth noting that a strong consensus exists both locally and
internationally on the value of a project like ICTAD and the urgency of scaling up its
results. To wit: `

      In stakeholder consultations during project preparation all respondents to a country
      wide sample stated their belief that ICT improved internal and external
      communications, reduced costs, empowered people and improved service delivery.14
      In another preparatory study to assess the potential socio-economic impact of ICT
      "Stakeholders from six regions of the country all pointed to one major theme: current
      information communication technology [manual collection, fragmented paper reports,
      limited and late dissemination], is impeding community and individual economic
      development. ...ICT will mitigate situations such as described above by enabling

     citizens, agencies and others access information resources through public information
     centers. It can play a major role in improving quality of life by providing citizens a
     much wider access to markets, services and opportunities to acquire skills, businesses
     and employment."15
     During negotiations, both sides agreed that "CIDEV program is a public good
     program"16 to recognize explicitly that community centers would provide ICT access
     to people who could not otherwise get it through market forces alone and thus that
     public assistance was justified.

     Internationally, recognition of the potential value of ICT for development has been
     for some time a worldwide consensus. Figure 1, for example, shows the strong
     correlation (0.8), across countries, between an index of human development and one
     of ICT readiness, access and use in 2003.

     At the World Summit of the Information Society (Geneva, 2003) leaders from all
     over the world committed to an agenda virtually identical to the objectives of the
     ICTAD project, and for the same reasons, as shown in Box 2 below.

         ICTs should be regarded as tools and not as an end in themselves. Under
         favorable conditions, these technologies can be a powerful instrument,
         increasing productivity, generating economic growth, job creation and
         employability and improving the quality of life of all.
         We must focus especially on young people who have not yet been able to
         benefit fully from the opportunities provided by ICTs.
         We affirm that development of ICTs provides enormous opportunities for
         women, who should be an integral part of, and key actors, in the

         We shall pay particular attention to the special needs of marginalized and
         vulnerable groups of society, including ... persons with disabilities.
         We are resolute to empower the poor, particularly those living in remote,
         rural and marginalized urban areas, to access information and to use ICTs
         as a tool to support their efforts to lift themselves out of poverty.

Box 2. Extract from Geneva Declaration of the 2003UN World Summit of the Information

175. Under these circumstances it seems appropriate for project designers to have chosen
the growth of the ICT service industry as the most practical proxy to measure
achievement of the project development objective. A supply response from this industry,
whether directly or indirectly spurred by the project, is best possible evidence that
capacity for economic use of ICT has increased across the economy.

176. So for example, if there were 15 computer maintenance companies in Amhara
region in 2006 and 42 in 2009, as was measured by beginning and ending surveys, the
project design asserts that its development objective has been advanced (and even
accomplished, had there been a specific indicator agreed upon for Amhara, which there
was not) regardless of whether or not this change can be traced to project outputs.

177. The basis for this assertion is that the project facilitated the creation of one business
incubator in Amhara (Bahir Dar) with 13 client companies; helped train 99 teachers from
TVET colleges and 23 employees from SMEs; and helped set up 10 community centers
in the region. In addition the project assisted ETA to become a better regulator of the
services offered by ETC, which contributed to the expansion of fixed and mobile
telephone subscribers in the region. The project also assisted EICTDA to issue a critical
localization standard and transliteration engine for Amharic to allow rendering of
software and names in local language. Finally the project mobilized local government to
support all these initiatives and convened people from industry, government, NGOs to
discuss them and support their creation.

178. All these actions in Amhara and similar ones across the 11 regions of the country
contributed and spurred the growth of the ICT services industry and will continue to do
so in the future. This is the closest that ICTAD design can get to a true impact indicator
for the time being and therefore the accomplishment of indicators to this effect under the
results framework merit a satisfactory rating for PDO.

ICR (see Table 24) which showed an encouraging 27% result among formerly
unemployed trainees. In addition, it is worth noting that administration of each center
generates direct employment for about 5 people.

July and December, 2009. The first19 profiled 26 centers and the second20 evaluated the
program based on visits to 27 centers. Results show strong benefits for over 70,000
people a month throughout the country in terms of skills development, convenience
gains, access to information, access to telecommunications, equity gains (increased ICT
access for the very poor, women, persons with disabilities and HIV/AIDS). Also visible
are increased volunteerism, administrative and financial skills and ICT center
stewardship within the community21.

Costs

181.  It is not possible within a 5 year period to develop policy, build institutions, create
human capacity and expect to measure impact of ICT on economic development. ICTAD
accordingly focused on creating capacity for development, not development itself, and it
fully met and exceeded its targets in this respect.

182. Whether this was accomplished at reasonable cost, in the absence of quantifiable
benefits, must be discerned by examining unit costs against internal or external norms.
Table 25 below shows unit costs for the key outputs of ICTAD. Most of the actual costs
were incurred under competitive procurement (except for virtual incubator grants) and

can thus be assumed to be the lowest possible. The useful life of outputs is conservatively
assumed to be that of the main assets acquired (4 years for technology and 10 years for
buildings) and the number of outputs is that achieved under the project without any
growth projection22.

183. Under these assumptions project unit costs appear very reasonable, even though
meaningful country comparators were not readily found since project activities were new
to Ethiopia. US$ 28,238 for each of the 23 policy, legal, regulatory and standards
instruments developed (see Annex 2, Table 7) seems reasonable given the national
consultation and government-wide impact of these instruments. Unit costs of $ 77 per
refurbished computer (against USD 825 in the market ­ see Table 15), $ 434 per trained
TVET teacher/SME opeator and $4,391 per incubating startup company similarly appear
very reasonable. US$ 2,684 unit cost per trained EICTDA staff member seems high but
it is skewed by the high cost of 48 people trained abroad.

184. The unit cost for each CIDEV center user (USD 0.9723) seems moderate since it
encompasses both simple services (sending a fax) and complex ones such as a computer
literacy course. In assessing the reasonableness of these costs one should have in mind
that the Centers play a social role by giving access to people who would not otherwise
have it and by heavily subsidizing the prices. In effect:

     ·   Most centers charge about half the price of privately-run businesses in their areas.
         Some centers scale their training fees based on people's ability to pay and offer
         even free training for members in need (orphans, people with disabilities etc.). To
         give an example, the Yirgalem Youth Community ICT Center offers basic
         computer training at a cost 50 ETB/month, while commercial providers charge
         100 ETB/ month. Two people with disabilities from each of the six kebeles of
         Yirgalem receive training free of charge.
     ·   In many cases Centers are the only ICT access facility in their area. For example,
         the Wonago center in the Gedeo Zone of the SNNP region (365 km from Addis),


22
   For BIC, an average of 15 tenant companies (currently 11) per year per incubator and 20 virtual
incubation companies in Addis (currently 17). For the CRTC, 9,500 refurbished computers per
year, and for CIDEV, 77,394 users per month.
23
   This already factors in average US$ 0.05 recovered through user fees.


                                               61
       is the only ICT facility in its area and the nearest facility is 30 km away in the
       town of Dilla. An average of 520 people uses the Wonago center every month.
185. Overall, all the unit costs of ICTAD outputs appear very reasonable. However, this
is still a qualitative assessment and opinions may vary until in a follow on project a full
ERR can be calculated on the basis of quantifiable economic benefits.

186. It must be noted that PMU staff contribution to the project came at costs below
market value. As noted, PMU staff salaries were below market and yet a core team
stayed for the duration and saw the project through. In the case of DED advisors, in
addition to their contribution being a grant and having been increased 61% over original
plans (from USD 1.8 to USD 2.9 million), the market costs of similar skills for similar
length of time would have been a multiple of this sum.

187. The project's closing workshop was an enthusiastic gathering of all the stakeholders
that made evident their widespread satisfaction with the work done and accomplishments,
their expectation for a follow-on operation, and their clear awareness of the difficulties to
sustain the project's results in the absence of further government help.

188. Beyond that, the workshop was filled with moving testimony from project
beneficiaries about the impact of the project on their lives. This is something difficult to
convey in a formal report like this but is nonetheless important for all who think that
development is ultimately defined by how the most vulnerable members of society are
given opportunities to grow and exercise their rights.

Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is a powerful tool to support social
and economic development. It is widely accepted that Information and Communication
Technologies (ICT) play an important role in national development and is instrumental
for alleviating poverty, accelerating development and promoting good governance. It is
the indispensable factor to intervene the multi-faceted problems the country faces.

The Ethiopian Government realizes that the application of ICT technology would best
accelerate and enhance the rate of economic growth and alleviation of poverty. It is with
this understanding that the government developed new ICT policies and strategies to
increase productivity, improve infrastructure, reduce costs. Several ICT oriented
initiatives have been started, involving various government and non-government
institutions and the private sector.

Major steps have been taken by the government to develop and promote the ICT sector
with high priority. These initiatives integrate major institutions and government bodies
like the Ethiopian ICT Development Agency. EICTDA was established as a new agency
in July 2003 to be the responsible to promote the use of ICT.

The ICTAD project was launched under this newly established Ethiopian ICT
Development Agency (EICTDA) in cooperation with the World Bank and German
Development Service (DED).

The overall objective of ICT Assisted Development Project was to assist communities to
improve their livelihood through the use of appropriate Information and Communication
Technologies (ICT) that facilitate increased access to markets, development information,
and delivery of public services. After the mid-term review the objectives were changed
to: Increase the use of information and communication technology by communities in
project target areas.

As a long term impact, ICTAD was designed to support the government's efforts in
reducing/eliminating the pertaining poverty situation in the country.

The project was organized in two major components:

    ·   P        I          S        C

    ·   A             C          S           C

Since effectiveness of the DCA in June 24, 2005, the ICTAD project has been executed
with undisrupted and full support from the government, the World Bank's task team
leader (TTL) and country office, the German Development Service (DED), partner


                                             65
institutions, the stakeholders and the community at large. Along its major developmental
objectives the project has increased capacities for the key regulatory and policy making
institutions in constructing an enabling legal and policy environment for ICT
development.

The Information and Communication Technology Assisted Development Project
(ICTAD) unlike many other development projects ended within the stipulated time frame
of the project plan.

Although there was a delay at the start of the project, after the mid-term review major
objectives of the project and targets are attained and often over achieved.

Policy and Institutional Support Component One
   ·   Laws are enacted which allow competitive provision of ICT related goods and
       services. New Policies, standards, laws, directives and regulations are adopted to
       create a better environment for the ICT sector development.
   ·   Currently, EICTDA is in a position to fully accomplish its mandate as stipulated
       in its 2003 Proclamation. The institutional and professional capacity of the
       Agency has been upgraded with the support of the ICTAD project.
   ·   All stakeholders and project partners (EICTDA, EBA, ETC, PIC, ECSC, CTIT,
       universities and regional and federal government offices) have actively
       participated in implementing the projects components in line with their respective
       mandates. Many of these project partners benefited from the project by support of
       strengthen their working capacity. With regard to capacity building of the staff of
       the partner institutions, a total of 765 staff members participated in short and long
       term trainings (27 are BSc/BA and above) the remaining are short term training
       participants, 79 professionals participated in short term external trainings, and 82
       persons participated in study tours.
   ·   Ethiopian Broadcast Authority (EBA) developed a radio licensing scheme. The
       proclamation of EBA has been amended so as to include the community radios.
       This helped the Authority to issue community radio licenses.

As the performance report shows, most of the project targets have been accomplished or
some have been delivered more than 100%. Some of the achievements are listed below.
   ·   The national ICT policy and ICT security policy has been developed and
       approved by the council of ministers,
   ·   Thirteen ICT standards developed (93%),
   ·   Three national ICT guidelines have been approved (100%),
   ·   The amendment of the radio proclamation and licensing has been effected by
       EBA (100%),
   ·   Eight community radios are licensed (160%)



                                            66
     ·   The ICT security policy has been developed
     ·   Five ISPs are licensed

Application and Community Support Component two


     ·   It was initially planned that in selected TVET training centers at least 500 ICT
         trainers have to be trained. The achievement at the time of this report (training is
         ongoing) is: 576 TVET teachers are trained (115%).
     ·   With regard to the SMEs, the target set was 10024 selected ICT SMEs supported
         within the context of FeMSEDA, however 645 SMEs operators have been trained
         (645%).
     ·   Although it was planned to establish two business incubators in selected Regional
         Governments, the actual business incubation centers established were 4 (200%).
         In addition, 18 virtual incubates are established in Addis Ababa.
     ·   One fully equipped and networked Computer Refurbishment and Training Center
         (CRTC) is established and operational. Computers deployment plan was 15,000;
         however, the number of CRTC computers deployed until end of June 2010 is over
         5,000 (performance level is about 33%).
     ·   It was also planned to establish 40 ICT Community Centers under the CIDEV
         component, but today 54 centers are established; hence the performance is 135%.
         In addition 11 youth focused ICT service centers are established in collaboration
         with the Ministry of Youth and Sports. These community ICT centers are able to
         conduct several Basic computer trainings, and provide other ICT services in very
         remote areas of the country.
     ·   It was planned to train 1000 persons in Community ICT centers. Actually 3,283
         people have been trained until today (training is ongoing), the performance is
         328.3%,
     ·   It was planned to establish five community radios, however, the achievement is
         seven (175%), and the 8th one is approaching to start operation.
     ·   The PMU has been able to manage and follow up all project components, sub-
         components and ICT promotions. Several workshops, seminars, community level
         trainings have been organized and implemented by the project. With this effort
         many project partner staff members have got the chance to upgrade their
         professional skills. This also increased the efficiency and effectiveness of the
         partner institutions.
24
  The document "Emergency Food crisis response program of the federal democratic republic of
Ethiopia" from November 25, 2008 talks about a target of 200 SMEs trained. This target was not
communicated to the project team and never made it to the planning documents. With a target of
200, the performance would reduce to 322%. Subsequent review missions (09/02, 09/06, 09/10,
10/02, 10/04) did not correct this difference.



                                              67
Fund Utilization

The project has fully utilized the allocated budget both from the Government and IDA.

The amount utilized for all project components from the Government/ counterpart fund is
Birr 43,880,562.73, whereas the estimated budget was Birr 46,253,700.00, overall
counter fund performance level is 94.87%.

The utilized amount from IDA's fund is USD 16,148,394.77, whereas the IDA's
estimated budget was USD 16,148,369.00 this shows IDA's fund utilization level 100%.

In general, ICTAD project has adequately implemented the project's objectives and
evidenced that ICT can better support the government's effort in providing ICT services
to improve the access to information in marginalized areas of the country and alleviating
poverty.

4.2.2 World Bank

The World Bank has sufficiently supported the project since the inception time and has
contributed significantly to its completion. A regular deployment of the Bank's
supervision mission has given the project to enhance its performance level, mainly after
the Mid-term Review of 2008. The Bank's country office also supported the project in
providing advices and technical support in expediting procurement of goods &
equipment, consultancies, and M&E activities.

ICTAD project has worked under one Task Team Leader (TTL) since the commencement
of the project, which enabled the project and the Bank read each other and move forward
without interruption and information gap.

Major challenges with the WB were delays in clearance of "No objection", which
actually improved after the Mid-term review of the project. The Bank's mission and
EICTDA have agreed to meticulously monitor most delayed procurement activities of the
project. Measures taken in this regard are interventions made by EICTDA through
arrangement of fortnightly meetings to evaluate progresses made by PMU and each
project partner at the federal level. Such measures helped in giving timely appropriate
directions to enhance procurement performances (local and international procurements).

4.2.3 The German Development Services/DED

The German Development Service (DED) was one of the major partners of the ICTAD
project. DED actively supported the project in providing technical assistance by
deploying 10 technical experts during the period of ICTAD. The total contribution of the
DED has a value of 2.1 Mio EUR ~ 2.8 Mio USD.




                                             68
The DED's main intervention areas were private sector development, e-learning
development in colleges, community ICT centers and radios, and capacity building for
several partner institutions.

The integration of the advisors was good in most cases; their experience in their fields of
specialization was helpful for the progress of ICTAD.

Many of the achievements are related to the hard working ICTAD teams and to the
experience and dedication of the technical advisors.

In a few cases the experience and knowledge of the TAs could not be fully absorbed
because of the low capacity of the project teams (number of team members, skills and
experience, staff turnover).

Whenever possible, the ICTAD project management tried to strengthen the teams to
make more use of the TAs by knowledge transfer to counterparts and project teams.

The ICTAD program officially ended on May 31st, 2010 but the German Development
Service (DED) has signed an agreement with EICTDA to extend the contracts of three
technical Advisors. This should help to sustain the community projects (ICT centres and
radios) and the ICT-Incubation component of ICTAD.

Annex 8. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other
Partners/Stakeholders
German Development Service (DED): Comments by Guenter Ozdyk, DED coordinator
and TA to PMU, EICTDA and other partner institutions.

The DED congratulates all project partners for the successful implementation of this
complex ICTAD program.

Honor is due to team members of ICTAD, EICTDA and all partner institutions. Special
gratitude goes to the Director General of EICTDA, today Minister of Communication and
Information Technology and to the Project Manager ICTAD. Also the involvement of the
World Bank teams contributed to the successful completion of the program. Special
thanks are given to the team leader of the World Bank for his commitment.

Although many review missions were dissatisfied with the performance of the ICTAD
program, especially in the first 2-3 years, it was very obvious that under the given
situation the PMU performed extremely well and the team delivered outstanding outputs.

The gap between the expectations of the donors and the results were induced by planning
issues. The planning of the project targets did not sufficiently take into consideration the
pre-conditions and the capacity gaps of the partner institutions. Documents of gap
analysis or resource estimation are not available. Especially the time needed for CIDEV
and CR awareness creation and training of volunteers was not considered.

Many of the DED experts had a long experience in project management and they
complained about the absence of communication guidelines among the main players
GoE, the DED and IDA. This created a lot of conflicts and was obstructive to better
results. Also the absence of project charters at project start and clear roles and
authorization of the various team members was reason for complaints. It would also have
been helpful if the project had more flexibility in reducing targets because of the resource
situation in favor of quality and sustainability of results.

Today many projects are implemented in stages with a gateway approval process from
one stage to the next stage. This is very useful to avoid failures in early stages and to
mitigate the risk of program blowup. Mid Term Reviews could be used as one of these
gateways for project components with clear rules for dropping non-performers or with
clear assignment for solid restructuring a project towards better results.

The DED agrees with the report, ICTAD was successful at the end. This success was
possible because of "Heroic Effort" of many team members. ICTAD has produced a lot
of lessons learned which hopefully will be used for similar projects.

Annex 11 - Developments in Ethiopia's Telecom Services
2006 ­ 2009
Telecom Sector

Sector expansion underpins sustainability of project outcomes. ICTAD's objectives
with respect to the telecommunications sector were deliberately limited to (i)
strengthening the regulatory agencies; (ii) issuing a first set of ISP licenses to private
providers; (iii) issuing community radio licenses, and (iv) pilot-testing the expansion of
telephone services to rural areas through public private partnerships. To determine
whether sector expansion adequately underpins the sustainability of project outcomes, an
examination was made, as shown below, of important developments in the sector during
the project period.

The findings are that major expansion of the telecom infrastructure indeed adequately
underpins sustainability and possible scaling up of Project results. However, poor quality
of mobile and Internet service and high cost of broadband Internet service can still
jeopardize project achievements. In the absence of competitive forces, improvements in
quality and reduction in costs depend directly on GoE's management of the sector.

While overwhelming international experience would indicate that sector growth in terms
of access, quality and affordability of services could have been stronger under a
competitive sector structure, the significant accomplishments of the GoE in the
telecommunication sector, as evidenced by the figures below, must necessarily be
recognized.

Subscriber Base

Ethiopia: Growth leader in mobile telephony. According to ITU Africa remains the
region with the highest mobile growth during the period 2003-2008. Within Africa,
Ethiopia was the fastest growing country in mobile cellular telephony with a compound
growth rate of 128% (see Figure 2 below).




                                           76
            Figure 2. Ethiopia: Growth leader in Mobile Cellular Growth in Africa25

During the period 2006-2009 mobile subscribers grew 461.52% from 0.87 to 4 million.
By 2010 the number of mobile users may have further increased to 8.6 million according
to ETA (see Table 26 below).

Rapid Growth in fixed telephony and Internet. As illustrated in Table 26 there are
discrepancies between various estimates of the subscriber base for telecommunications
services in Ethiopia. However, ITU data will be used for comparison since this was
agreed for ICTAD's result framework. According to ITU therefore, there were 910,000
fixed line subscribers in Ethiopia and 71,000 Internet subscribers in 2009. This
represents 125% growth in fixed line subscribers and 328% growth in Internet
subscribers during the project period. ITU's 2009 estimate of Internet users (as opposed
to subscribers) is 0.45 million, which represents 0.54 Internet density (users per 100
people) in the country, up from 0.31 in 2006.

Persistent low performance in Africa. While progress is significant, particularly in
mobile telephony, on a comparative basis the current figures still place Ethiopia among
the lowest five countries in Africa in all the three services. According to ITU's ICT
Development Index 2009 Ethiopia's rank is 147th out of 154 countries and this ranking
did not changed in the 5 years covered by the index (2002-2007).

Infrastructure

Backbone
Countrywide fiber optic backbone deployed. A 10,000 Km. fiber optics line has been
laid throughout the country which can deliver state-of-the-art voice, data, video and text
services to 90% of the territory27. This puts Ethiopia among at the top in Africa in terms
of broadband capacity and creates leapfrogging opportunities of strategic importance, for
example to convert the whole country to Voice over IP (VOIP) telephony bypassing
further expansion of the old, copper wire-based plain old telephone service (POTS). It
also means that Ethiopia now has infrastructure to provide triple-play (voice, internet,
telephone) service throughout the country. Utilization of this infrastructure in a regular
and reliable manner is still in the future and is discussed below under Quality of Service.

GSM is the global standard being used in Ethiopia for mobile cellular telephony and
SMS services. It is deployed across the whole nation. Actual availability, however, is
"to be checked the respective zonal/Regional and Dealers" as per ETC's web page
instructions, due to network management issues. General Packet Radio Service (GPRS)
is a technology to provide Internet access over the GSM network which requires
connecting the GSM to the fiber optic backbone. The connections have been completed
in Ethiopia but usage is minimal mainly due to high pricing (Birr 40 cents per megabyte
transmitted) and to network management issues discussed below under Quality of
Service.

                                                    78
CDMA is a wireless technology that can be used for voice, internet and fax services. It is
being used in Ethiopia mainly for internet access in areas beyond the reach of the fiber
optic backbone. Presently the technology has been deployed in 90% of the country, but
actual service is still lacking in most of the country28 due to network management issues
discussed below under Quality of Service.

Rural Connectivity has expanded beyond original project targets. At the start of the
project ETA had recognized clearly the problem and framed the objectives to which
ICTAD would be pointed:

        ...the existing strategy of the government, Agricultural Development Led Industrialization
        (ADLI), requires the telecom sector to focus on universal access of telecom services at the
        regional, woreda, other towns and kebele level. ... However... the telecom services are still highly
        skewed in the big towns like Addis Ababa, Nazreth, Bahirdar, Diredawa and Others.29

ICTAD therefore set out to provide funding and technical assistance for private sector
operators and communities to connect to ETC's points of presence (PoP) primarily
through phone lines. Its objective was to provide access to about 3000 community
phones over the project period, covering communities in an area of about 100,000 square
kilometers.

During project implementation, however, the government gradually shifted its thinking
on the business model for community phone operators and eventually decided to pursue
the same objective in a larger scale but with a different business model. This was the
subject of considerable concern in all supervision missions during the first half of the
project and eventually resulted in formal agreement to restructure the project and cancel
this subcomponent along with US $10 million of credit funds. In essence therefore,
restructuring after the MTR increased the share of counterpart financing and raised the
bar on the original rural connectivity objectives of the project.

Results wise ETC far exceeded project objectives by connecting between 10,000 and
14,000 kebeles30 under its Rural Connectivity Program (RCP) by the end of the project.

Six-fold expansion of international bandwidth. The bandwidth of Ethiopia's
international broadband gateway has constrained so far improvement of Internet service,
quality and cost of international voice service and supply of third-party Internet service
access31. The gateway has been operating with a total of 897.4 Mbps capacity, of which

28
   ETC's web page warns that: "Currently, the network is deployed in: Addis Ababa, Fiche,
Wolkite, Woliso and Jimma, but availability has to be checked in the respective telecom sales
office.

   The higher number is according to ETA's closing report. Survey under ICTAD's own final
M&E Report counted only 10,696 fixed line resellers (see pg. 88).
31
   According to ETA, four ISP licenses issued to private companies could not be made
operational because of this constraint.

537 Mbps are through optical fiber, 342.4 Mbps through satellite and 18 Mbps through
microwave.

On March 30, 2010 ETC announced having signed a contract with SEACOM Telecom
company for the provision of international bandwidth connectivity through submarine
fiber optic cable system via Djibouti, with a total cost of USD $47 million. The
agreement will provide capacity of 20 STM-132 for a total of 3,100 Megabits per second,
thus raising the capacity of the gateway by 445.44 %. It will also raise the current 537
Mbps capacity of fiber communication system of the country to 3,637 Mbps, or
677.28%.33

Out of this total leased capacity, 16 STM-1 or 2,480 Mbps capacity will be utilized for
commercial purposes while the remaining 4 STM-1 620Mbps capacity will be used for
EICTDA-Government development program.              This segregation of bandwidth is
indicative of the priority that the government gives to the expansion of e-services to the
entire population.

SEACOM is a company that has a total capacity of 1.28 Tbps /17,000 Km/ undersea fiber
optic cable system connecting eastern and southern African countries with the rest of the
world. African countries which are connected to the SEACOM system to date include
South Africa, Mozambique, Tanzania, Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, Djibouti and Ethiopia.


Tariffs

Generally high ICT Price Index in Africa. According to ITU, "Compared to the world,
the 2008 ICT Price Basket is on average significantly more expensive in Africa. Whereas
at the global level it represents 15 per cent of the monthly GNI per capita, in Africa it
represents 41 per cent 34". ITU goes on to explain that this situation is largely due to high
fixed Internet broadband prices as well as to the shortage of international connectivity in
the region.

Considering that Ethiopia in 2008 had the lowest GNI per capita in Africa, its 14th place
ranking in the continent's ICT Price basket35 (at 41 % of GNI) indicates that its pricing
structure is not out of line with that of the continent. To illustrate this Figure 3 from ITU
shows how in the Internet component of the price index Ethiopia is very close to the
average for the continent.

Unfortunately, due its low GNP Ethiopia ranks as the second most expensive country in
the world for fixed line broadband tariffs as proportion of monthly income (2085%),
according to ITU's 2009 statistics.

Against this backdrop, the changes in tariffs costs have not been uniform, except that if
one takes into consideration the 80% accumulated inflation during the project period37 an
argument can be made that they have all declined in real terms. In nominal terms there
have been both increases and decreases as shown in Table 2738 . Neither can be readily
explained in terms of related cost variations to the operator.

Quality of Service

It is readily observable in Ethiopia that mobile and Internet service, despite being
relatively expensive, are affected by serious quality of service (QoS) problems and
ETA's own QoS measurements tell this story (see Table 28 below). Broadband Internet
service availability, which ETA measured at 99.3% appears much lower to the casual
observer40. To give an example of the situation in the field, a Procurement course being
dictated under the CSC pilot e-Learning program in Awassa in early 2010 had to be
suspended for 3 weeks for lack of Internet access at BOFID (Bureau for Finance and
Economic Development).

   For example the ICR mission consultant used Internet service extensively in hotels in four
cities in Ethiopia (Addis, Adama, Hawasa and Bahir Dar) with frequent line drops, service
unavailability and low speed. Similar cases were reported by Martin Taschdjian's study in July,
2008, pg. 7.

       Table 28. Selected QoS Indicators for Telecommunications in Ethiopia - May, 201041

The major factors contributing to low QoS are being addressed by the government as
follows:

           Power shortages and limited electrification. This fundamental constraint causes
           many interruptions in telecommunications service. The Chinese company ZTE
           that has been installing the fiber optic network claims that "there are 320 base
           stations across Ethiopia which cannot be used commercially because of a lack of
           power supply"42. Since this affects economic development across all sectors the
           GoE is addressing this constraint through major initiatives. The Gilegel Gibe II
           Hydro Power Project 250 kms. south west of the capital was inaugurated in
           January, 2010 and 14 other projects are expected to complete within two years.
           The GoE has launched a large scale rural electrification program called the
           Universal Electrification Access Program (UEAP) for electrification of over 6,000
           rural towns and villages in all regions of the country affecting some 24 million
           people. Electricity access projects with The World bank for over US$ 400 million
           are active and likely to be expanded.
           Limited infrastructure. Fiber optic backbone, wireless internet, fixed line and
           international gateway are being drastically expanded as explained earlier in this
           note.

        Vandalism. Fiber optic infrastructure seems to be maliciously cut with
        considerable frequency and repairing it is often difficult and time consuming.
        ETC is reportedly attacking this problem through redundant connections.
        Technical complexity.     The multiplicity of technologies (GSM, CDMA,
        WCDMA, fixed PSTN and the multiplicity of equipment brands (Ericksson,
        Nokia, Cisco) complicate the management of the networks in Ethiopia. ETC is
        reportedly pursuing a gradual strategy of geographic segregation on compatible
        equipment to reduce complexity and failure incidence.
        Shortage of engineering and network maintenance capacity. A complex network
        such as Ethiopia's requires easily up to 3,000 trained engineers and technicians
        deployed across the country. Training must be hands on for the particular
        equipment involved and can take up to three years in stages. This is an area
        where uncertainty seems to exist as to the best way to organize delivery of this
        training, given the primarily academic orientation of the CTIT. At present ETC
        has over 12,000 employees but only a minority are trained engineers and
        technicians.
        Network management capacity gaps. This has been recognized by the GoE and a
        contract has been signed with France Telecom for management of the
        telecommunication network.

Sector Policy

According to PASDEP 2006: "Ethiopia's broad policy framework is that the
backbone infrastructure will remain in the public domain, under the auspices
of ETC, while the private sector will be encouraged to become increasingly
involved in downstream activities and services. At the same time, the
Government and the regulatory authority (the Ethiopian Telecommunications
Agency) will keep up sustained pressure to ensure that ETC meets the highest
standards, attains roll-out targets and delivers world class network and
service quality standards."43

While there have been major advances in backbone infrastructure, as
explained above, the growth in the subscriber base for telecommunications
service cannot really be attributed to significant liberalization occurring
during the project period. All major services are still provided exclusively by
ETC and even at the Kebele level resellers are really subcontractors of ETC.
Internet service is provided exclusively by ETC despite the fact that nominal
VISP licenses have been issued but never really operationally enabled.
Provision of mobile Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) cards still occurs only
at ETC offices and there is no competition yet for provision of any other value
added service.

Conclusions

From this brief overview of the Telecommunications sector, grounded primarily on third
party information, a few tentative conclusions can be drawn:

   ·   Even if ETC were to make order-of-magnitude reductions in tariffs, Ethiopia is
       likely to remain a country where broadband Internet access will be beyond the
       reach by the average citizen, and certainly by the poor.
   ·   Consequently, in Ethiopia more so than in most other developing countries, the
       need to create an infrastructure of Internet access centers throughout the country
       is a development imperative. ICTAD has demonstrated that CIDEV is a viable
       institutional model based on partnerships between the government and
       community organizations.
   ·   Since Internet access is the critical factor for the spread of e-government services,
       such access will need to be subsidized in one form or another if these services are
       to reach the average citizen and particularly the poor. CIDEV centers cannot be
       financially sustainable if they are expected to charge Internet access fees that
       represent 2000+ percent of per capita GNP.
   ·   The case for using the mobile phone infrastructure for access to e-Government
       services is compelling. As in the rest of the developing world, mobile telephony
       is spreading in Ethiopia much faster than Internet access (based on personal
       computers). According to ITU, in 2009 there were in Ethiopia 4.89% mobile
       subscribers increasing 433% per year against 0.09% Internet subscribers growing
       at 300%.
   ·   The pace of expansion of the network infrastructure in Ethiopia can sustain a
       major scaling up of CIDEV centers and the spread of e-services throughout the
       country. Systems and services can be now planned and deployed based on the
       expectation that Internet, fixed and mobile telephony will be available throughout
       the country.
   ·   Although network management is a major challenge at present, the government is
       committed to professionalizing this function to achieve international service
       standards, even if this requires tapping foreign expertise. High profile and ideally
       independent monitoring mechanisms will be necessary, however, to compensate
       for the reduced accountability inherent in the monopolistic structure of the sector.
