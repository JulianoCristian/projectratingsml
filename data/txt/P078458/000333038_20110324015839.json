(ICT)", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Information and\n            Communication Technology Assisted Development (ICTAD)\n            Project for Ethiopia were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was high, the\n            Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: ICT community centers created\n            bottom up on the basis of demand by community organizations\n            are a sturdy and promising model for bridging the\n            connectivity gap in Ethiopia and probably in other\n            countries. None of the 65 centers created under the ICTAD\n            project have folded down, even those that have operated for\n            over two years. This is an important lesson when considering\n            that failure rates during this same period exceed 15 percent\n            in other countries. Since this project did not have time to\n            determine unequivocally whether the business model used was\n            financially sustainable and therefore scalable in the\n            long-run, a clear lesson is also the need to test desirable\n            modifications to the business model and financial\n            sustainability over a longer period. Agreements between\n            government agencies, particularly across levels of\n            government, can go wrong for many reasons. When detailed\n            commitments of staff, time, money, authority, problem\n            solving, monitoring, early termination, etc. are not spelled\n            out at entry, as in the case of ICTAD, the risk of\n            implementation failure can be increased. This is of course a\n            dilemma for project preparation which will need to be\n            extended in time (and cost) to achieve this level of\n            precision. It is also a risk in itself as best laid plans\n            can be unraveled during implementation or unduly constrain\n            it. However, if the partnerships are critical success\n            factors for the project, this problem has to be addressed\n            either through extended project preparation, more flexible\n            results frameworks or more flexible staffing plans. Bank\n            project team continuity is important success factor that\n            should be the default Bank staffing policy. When\n            International Development Association (IDA) to change\n            ICTAD's Task Team Leader following mid-term review\n            (MTR), Government of Ethiopia (GoE) argued forcefully\n            against it and IDA's eventual agreement to keep the\n            team intact from beginning to end of the project proved to\n            be decisively important."}, "docdt": "2010-02-11T00:00:00Z"}
