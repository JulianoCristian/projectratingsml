Project development objective

The objective o fthis project i s to assist communities to improvetheir livelihoodthrough the use
of appropriate Informationand Communication Technologies (ICT) that facilitate increased
access to markets, development information, andpublic services.

Project description

The project consists o ftwo components:
    1. PolicyandInstitutionalSupport: This component will establish anenabling environment
        for the growth of the ICT sector by supporting a comprehensive assessment o fthe
        existing policy, regulatory and legal framework, particularlyinthe areas o f information
        technology, telecom, informationsharing, andintemet. Itwill also strengthencapacity o f
        the keyinstitutions that regulate the sector, provideservices, or managethe reform
        process.
    2. Application andCommunity Support: An important objective o fthe Government's ICT
        development programi s to increaseconnectivity andto provide access to
        communications services throughout the country. International experience suggests that
        the expansion of communications network is strongly correlated with economic growth,
        andthat access to communications inruralareas diminishes the urbdrural economic
        disparities, provides access to market information, and facilitates service delivery in
        health, education andother areas thereby reinforcingthe poverty reductioncontribution
        of ICTs.

Ethiopiaranked170inthe UNDP' s 2004 HumanDevelopment Index, rankingvery low
particularlyinthe areas o f life expectancy, literacy rate, and access to primaryhealth care.
To address these issues the Government has embarkedon a wide-ranging program to improve
the efficiency and effectiveness o fits socioeconomic development andpovertyreduction
programs for service delivery inhealth, education, agriculture, and other sectors. This approach
i s embeddedina constitutional decentralizationpolicy entrustingRegions and Woredas with the
task to respondto localneeds locally.

The Government intendsto utilize Informationand Communication Technologies (ICTs) as
enablers for implementingthe country's development program andhas embarked on amajor
NationalICT Capacity BuildingProgram. The vision o fthis program i s to "Develop and exploit
ICTs as an acceleratorfor the attainment of national developmentobjectives and global
competitiveness"  .

The Government's ICT development program consistsof four strategic objectives:

        1. Creating anenablingpolicy, regulatory andlegal environment for the growth and
            utilizationo f ICTs;
        2. Developingthe necessaryICT humanresources, infrastructure, rural access, ICT
             standards, andlocalcontent;
        3. Strengthening various national ICT policy, regulatory and advocacy institutions to
             facilitate the mainstreaming o f ICTs for socioeconomic development;
        4.   Facilitatingthe use o f appropriate technologies for development o f applications and
             content for RuralDevelopment, GoodGovernance, and service delivery inpriority
             sectors.

Together, the four strategic pillarsconstitute the core of anICT policy that will facilitate
Ethiopia's effective move towards ICT-assisted development. The Government is aware that
availability and affordability o f ICTs dependonbroader factors such as provisionof reliable
electricity, literacy, and access to appropriate and sustainablecommunication technologies and
infrastructure, particularlyinrural areas.

2. Rationalefor Bank involvement

The value addedofthe Bankwill be through i)increasing the impact of ICT Development and
ICT-assistedprograms by supporting an integrated multi-sectoral approach, and improving
coordination among sectors intheir ICT programs; ii)sharinglessons of experience for ICT
assisteddevelopment basedon global andRegionalexperience and adaptedknowledge (e.g.
Iganga -Uganda ICT-assisted maternal mortality reduction, communityradio for education, etc.);

iii)offeringgloballessonsofexperienceinICTsectorreformandinstitutionaldevelopment
issues; iv) expanding the opportunities for the private sector participation.
A keycontributionofthe Bankis its abilityto helpEthiopiadevelop innovative approachesfor
solving its development problems. The Bank is now ina positionto not only offer financial
assistance, but also to act as a knowledge broker andpartnerto convene donors inEthiopiain
relationto ICT-assisted service delivery inhealth, education andother sectors.

3. Higher level objectives to which the project contributes

The overarching objective of Ethiopia's SustainableDevelopment andPoverty Reduction
Program (SDPRP) is to reducepoverty by enhancing rapid economic growthwhile maintaining
macroeconomic stability. The Executive Directors discussedthe SDPRP on September 19,
2002, andthe SDPRP progressreport on January 16,2004. While stressing the importance o f
rural and agrarian development inorder to improve the lot o fpoor people, the SDPRP
acknowledges the need for explicit efforts at private sector development to put the economy on a
higher growthtrajectory. The SDPRP isbuilt on the following four pillars: (1) Agricultural
Development LedIndustrialization (ADLI)and food security; (2) governance, decentralization,
and empowerment; (3) reform o fthejustice system andthe civil service; and (4) capacity
building.Inaddition, the SDPRP identifieskeysectoral measuresandcross-cuttingpriority
issues, includingHIV/AIDS, private sector development andtrade, education, health, roads,
water and sanitation, and gender.

The 2003-2005 Ethiopia Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) provides support to Ethiopia's
SDPRP to reducepovertyand achievethe MDGs.World Bank support to Ethiopia's SDPRP can
betranslated into four inter-related themes:
    0   Enhancing pro-poor growth;
    0   Improvinghumandevelopment outcomes;
    0   Reducing vulnerability;
    0   Improvinggovernance      .
Since capacity buildingis a common underpinning to all four themes, the Bankwill strengthen
efforts to buildinstitutionalcapacity within the public andprivate sector, andincivil society.
This effortwill encompass institutionalreforms, development ofnewinstitutions and systems,
andimprovement ofskills. The draft CAS progressreport (IDAR2004-0224) provides ashort
update on the development inthe Telecommunications sector inEthiopia.

As part ofthese discussions, the Bankhas agreedto support the ICT-Assisted Development
Project (ICTAD). Theprojectwill support the CAS goals o f enhancing pro-poor growth and
improvinghumandevelopment outcomesby improving service deliveryto the poor through
ICT-assisted interventions, inalignment with the overall multi-sectoral capacity buildingand
development objectives o fthe Government. The projectwill also foster economic growth by
supporting the creation o f a favorable environment for more active participationofthe private
sector inall aspectso f ICT sector development.

B. PROJECTDESCRIPTION

1. Lendinginstrument

The lendinginstrument is a Sector InvestmentandMaintenance (SIM) credit inthe amount of
SDR 17.1 million (USD25 million equivalent).

2. Projectdevelopmentobjective and key indicators

The objective ofthisproject is to assist communities improve their livelihoodthrough the use
o f appropriate Informationand Communication Technologies (ICT) that facilitate increased
access to markets, development information, andpublic services. To achieve this objective, the
ICT Assisted Development Project will enablepublic andprivate sector providers o f
information, goods and services to improve the quality andquantity o ftheir products through the
efficient and effective use o f ICTs.

Theproject will therefore helpto:
        1.Createan enablingpolicy, legalandregulatory environment for the growthofICTs;
        2. Strengthenthe institutionalcapacity o fkeypolicy, regulatory and advocacy
        institutions;
        3. Establishlocally adaptedICT industry standardsanddata security arrangements;
        4. Foster opportunities for Small andMediumEnterprises, women andyouth inthe ICT
        sector;
        5. Facilitate access to marketsandmarket information for m a l andurbancommunities;

The intended outputs of the project are:

    0   Specific policy, legal, andregulatory decisions, proclamations, andlegislationthat will
        create an enabling and growth enhancing environment for broadcasting, communications,
        informationtechnology, internet, knowledge sharing, andprivate sector investment;
    0   An operational EthiopianICTDevelopment Authority (EICTDA); and a capable
        EthiopianTelecommunications Agency (ETA) andEthiopianBroadcasting Agency
        (EBA)withthe capacity to regulate andfoster the growthofICTs;
    0   A public-private partnershipbetweenEthiopianTelecommunications Corporation (ETC)
        andprivate sector groups to offer community levelconnectivity andaccess to the national
        telecommunications andICT services;
    0   A growingprivate sector ICTbusinesscommunity that canrespond faster to market
        demands;
    0   Successfully tested appropriate technologies for targeted, scalable interventions to
        increasethe efficiency and effectiveness o f efforts for reaching Millennium Development
        Goals (MDGs).

3. Projectcomponents

Theproject consists oftwo components: 1)Policy andInstitutionalSupport, and2) Application
and Community Support.

Component1.Policy and Institutional Support-$13.4 mil
This component will establishan enablingenvironmentfor the growthof the ICT sector by
supporting a comprehensive assessment ofthe existing policy, regulatory andlegal framework in
the areas of informationtechnology, telecom, broadcasting, knowledge sharing, andinternet. It
will also strengthenthe capacity ofkeyinstitutions that regulate the sector, provideservices, or
manage the reformprocess.

The Policy, RegulatoryandLegalFrameworksub-componentwill help identifypolicy and
regulatory impedimentsto the growth of ICTs, andwill propose favorable trade, taxation,
privacy, and security policies. Itwill also support draftingo f appropriate business law and
preparation o fnewpolicies andregulations that will addressthe current deficiencies.

The ICT Standards sub-componentwill support development ofcoherent, andwell defined
locally adaptedstandards through anopen andparticipatory process. Specialneeds o f disabled in
usingICTswill also beaddressed.The subcomponentwill also helpestablish DataSecurity
standards andprocedures.The sub-componentwill include training andstudytours and
technicaland managementtrainingfor keyICT stakeholdersandpolicy makers onuse and
management ofnew communication anddata exchangetechnologies such as internet; Internet
Protocol(IP) basednetworks, wireless communications andrelatedtechnologies. Particular
emphasiswill be givento clarificationo fneeds andidentificationo f options for the development
o f an adequateand sustainableinfrastructure for data exchangepurposes. This i s particularly
important inthe context o fthe Government's decentralization o fpublic administration activities
to local authorities at Woreda level. Since the bulk o f activities under this component consist of
consultancies, the funding for this component will bepooled to facilitate implementation
arrangements.

The InstitutionalStrengtheningsub-component will bethe keyICTpolicy andregulatory
agenciesto develop the necessary capacity for effective support o f ICT sector. These agencies
include the EthiopianICT Development Authority (EICTDA); the Ethiopian
Telecommunications Agency (ETA) andthe EthiopianBroadcasting Agency @BA), andthe
Institute for Telecommunications and InformationTechnology (ITIT). ETA'Scapabilities will
be strengthened inFrequency SpectrumManagement and inproviding advisory services on
sector reform options to allow rapidgrowth o f ICTs. The EBAwill be strengthenedto better
facilitate the licensing o f local, communitybasedradio broadcast operations. ITITwill receive
technical assistanceto strengthen its trainingprograms inthe areas o f advanceddigital
technologies andnetworks.

A ProjectManagementUnit(PMU) establishedunder EICTDAwill beresponsiblefor
coordination andmonitoringo f ICTADproject implementation activities.

Component2. Application and CommuniqSupport- $18.4 mil



                                                 4

An important objective ofthe Government's development programis to increaseaccess to
telecommunications services andinternet connectivity to communities throughout the country.
Intemationalexperience suggests that the expansion o f communications network enhances
economic growth, andthat access to communications inrural areas diminishesthe urbdrural
economic disparities, provides access to market information, and facilitates service delivery in
health, education andother areas therebyreinforcingthe povertyreduction contribution o f ICTs.

The Connectivity/ Access sub component will facilitate the creation ofpublic-private
partnershipsbetweenETC andqualified cooperatives and/or privatesector groupsto offer
community level connectivity and access to the national telecommunications andICT services.
Inthesepartnerships ETCwouldact as awholesaler ofcommunications network infrastructure,
andthe cooperatives and/or private sector operatorswill bethe service providers at community
level, offeringtelecommunications services, access to internet, andother value-added services.
Community organizations, cooperatives and/or qualified localprivatesector groups would then
act as communitybasedoperators or re-sellers of voice and data communication services. This
sub-component would create a win-win situation for all key stakeholders:the communities will
benefit byhavingaccess to national communications infrastructure, information, etc.; local and
regional economies couldbenefit from the informationflow and access to market information
that this will bringabout; ETA will strengthenits capacity through "learning by doing" by
tackling a series o freal-worldregulatory issues that it must manage skillfully inorder to make
rural connectivity inEthiopia a reality; ETC will also benefit from a scalablebusiness modelthat
promises to createnewrevenue streams for ETC through increasedtraffic on the backbone,
interconnection charges andprovisionoftechnical services.

Inaddition, theRuralConnectivityProgramwillcreateopportunities fortransferof
technologyto Ethiopia;support ResearchandDevelopmentactivities at Addis Ababa
University,Institutefor Telecommunications andInformationTechnology (ITIT) on Broadband
rural communications, andpotentiallyexportquality productiono frelevant equipment.
This component will beimplementedintwo phases. PhaseIwould include detailed studies of
available rural connectivity options, identifyinternational best practices, andproposepractical
options for modalities o f Government financial assistance and/or technical support for rural
connectivity inEthiopia. Phase Iwould also demonstratethe usefulnessofthe technology and
provide lessonswith regard to managingthe investments prior to scaling up, &d to identifyand
solve any bottlenecks inthe licensing process. PhaseIwould bemanagedby EICTDA in
cooperationwith ETA, ETC, regional andlocal authorities. DuringPhase Ithe project would
also establish the appropriate access rules, includingthe design o f output basedsubsidies or low
interest loans (the potentialfinancial models are not limitedto the two mentioned above but will
rather be determinedbythe realityon the ground at the time o fimplementation ofPhaseI)      that
would berequired to attract cooperatives and/or privateinvestors to invest inrural connectivity.
PhaseI1will implementRuralConnectivity solutions underPublic-Cooperative or Public-
Private arrangementsbasedon the findings ofPhaseI.

The ICT PrivateSectorDevelopment(BusinessIncubator) sub-component will foster the
direct participationof the private sector inall ICT relatedaspectsbycreating opportunities for
their growthinthe ICT sector. Theobjective isto identifyand/or createopportunities for local
privatecompanies inthe ICT sector to participate more actively inthe localas well as



                                                  5

international ICT market. Specific activities will be designed for creating businessopportunities
for the private sector to strengthenits ICT capacity by direct involvement insector activities
through the establishmentof anincubator that will provide technology-enhanced support systems
to private sector companies, including support for settingup of operations byprivate sector
Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Other activities will include the strengtheningo fprivate
sector's capacity for the use andmaintenanceof locally adaptedtechnologies. This
sub-component will also support initiatives for increasing opportunities for women and youth to
participate inICT relatedbusinesses or training opportunities.

The ICT Trainingof trainersin a selectedTVET center,will support specific ICT related
technical training deliveredbyvocational streams (either through secondary level vocation
trainingprograms or inpolytechnics and communitycolleges). Special emphasis will be given to
developing ICT technical andvocational training skills. This sub-componentwill also support
strengtheningo f a Regional Micro and Small EnterpriseAgency (ReMSEDA) to invoke a
stronger involvement of small andmicro enterprises into the development o fthe ICT sector.

The CommunityICT- DevelopmentProgram(CIDEV) sub-componentwill support
community-oriented initiatives that help communities to access anduse ICT assistedservices for
their development needs andactivities. Thisprogram will finance proposals submitted by
communities or intermediaries that meet a set o fpredefinedcriteria. These criteria are defined
around the following basic principles: ownership by communities, feasibility, sustainability,
scalability, alignment with national priorities andICTAD objectives, andmeasurability of
results. A special operational manualwill be producedbythe PMUto allow for a transparent,
and swift processing ofproposals. The ICTADPMUwill managethe program. For fbrther
details pleaserefer to h e x 4.

4. Lessonslearnedandreflectedinthe projectdesign

The following lessonshave beenincorporated inthe design o fthe ICTAD project:

OEDLessonsof Experience:
    0   Buildingregulatory institutions is a fragile, long-term process andtherefore localdemand
        for reform mustbe nurturedandcapacity supported over a longtime;
    0   Development of strategic information systemsi s a demandingandcomplex task,
        requiringsignificant attention andexpertise from the Bankandborrower;
    0   Privatizationis likely to be effective inproducing improvedperformance only when the
        necessarypolicy andregulatory framework i s createdfirst. Moreover, inpursuing
        privatization, borrowers should be encouragedto move to competition inall segments o f
        telecommunication services as early as possible;

Bank-wide Lessons of Experience:

    0   Consultations with stakeholders are essential for the success o freforms;
    0   Newlycreatedregulatory agenciesare frequentlyoverwhelmed bytheir responsibilities,
        buthave little in-house expertise to draw upon. Support from on-site advisers and
        operational advice during the initial stages to deal withpriority issues are invaluable;



                                                  6

       Telecommunications sector policy should include incentives to promote access to
       services to rural populations andto improve the affordability o f services to the poor in
       bothrural andurbanareas;
       The momentum created bypolicyreform initiatives can lead to sustained sector growth
       provided implementation is undertaken promptly;
       Existence o f an independent regulator within a stable regulatory framework encourages
       higher levels o finvestment andmore rapid development o f services that are being opened
       to competition (e.g. Value added service);
       Provision o f internet access must be supportedby content development andcapacity
       building; Provisiono fconnectivity andaccessalone is not enoughto yieldthe potential
       development benefits;
       Benefits o f internet access canbe muchmore widely distributed ifaccess is provided to
       local radio stations that can act as conduits for access to, and dissemination o f all global
       andlocal information that is available on-line;
       Content development must be genuinely locally driven, albeit with the assistance o f
       outsiders to help identify specific needs;
       The project designreflects the well known lesson that reform projects are likely to
        succeed when there is commitment at the highest level. Hence this project focuses on the
        areas where the Government ofEthiopia is committedto take action.

OtherLessons:

   e   Introducing a phased approach will work most effectively by starting with the realities on
       the ground, establishing base lines, introducing gradual change, strengthening existing
        institutional capacity, respondingto business needs based on existing service
        improvement demands, and dealing with policy, regulatory, andlegal reform issues in
       parallel with institutional andhumancapacitybuilding;
   e    Linkingreform measures to removal o fbottlenecks for the Government's service
        delivery anddevelopment agenda will increase the chances o freform success;
        Linkingthe scope o fproject activities to existing absorptioncapacity o fstakeholders and
       beneficiaries will improve the chances for the long-term sustainability and effectiveness
        ofthese activities;
        Adopting a learning by doing approach will increase the impact ofhumancapacity
       buildingefforts andwill improve sustainability.

5. Alternatives consideredand reasons for rejection

Various alternatives have beenconsidered to identify the one that is most responsive to the
Government's development objectives, realistic inits expected outputs andoutcomes,
sustainable after completion and likely to succeed based on existing realities on the ground.

All alternatives were discussed extensively with authorities, technical experts, stakeholders and
Bankstaffandthey include:

Technology-driven versus Development-driven approach. The option o f adopting a
technology-driven approach whereby the latest technological solutions would be usedto


                                                  7

modernize all aspectsof Ethiopianeconomy was discussed at the outset. This optionwas
dismissedinfavor of adevelopment-driven approach, where the emphasisis on adapting
appropriate technologies to localneeds andconditions for sustainableICT-assistedinterventions.

Full-fledgedimplementationof the Government'sICT Programversus selectivityand
prioritization. TheGovernment's originalproposalwas to turnthe entire ICTProgramofthe
government into an operation supportedbythe Bank.Existingimpediments (e.g. lack o f a
favorable policy environment, adequatetelecom infrastructure, humanresourcesand institutional
capacity) would makea country wide attainment o fthe objectives unlikelyandresults would not
be sustained.Prioritization andselectivity will:
    0   reduce risks byproviding ample opportunity for learning and adaptation;
    0   allow for better coordination ofthe cross sectoral approach;
    0   provide the opportunity to buildthe foundations for ICT development (Le. policy reform,
        HRetc.)


C. IMPLEMENTATION

1. Partnershiparrangements

TheBankhashelpedto convenedonors inEthiopiainrelationto ICT-assistedservice
delivery inhealth, education andother sectors. A Donorsconsultative group on ICTshasbeen
establishedwith active support from the Government, UNDP andother partners. Bilateraldonors
have expressedinterest inprovidingtechnical assistance and grant funds for a number o f
activities envisagedunder this project. For example, the Government o f Japanprovided
significant support for this project inthe form of a PHRD grant (of about $969,000) which
helped finance the bulk o fproject preparation activities. The GermanDevelopment Service
(DED)hasalso agreedto activelysupportthisprojectbyprovidingtechnical assistanceofUSD
1.8 million equivalent for humanresourcedevelopment efforts, Small andMediumEnterprise
development and strengtheningo f ICT vocational trainingprograms.

2. Institutionalandimplementationarrangements

Theproject will be executedbyEICTDA. Implementation ofinstitutionalcapacitybuilding
activities by EBA, ETA, EICTDA, and ITIT will be carried out bythe respective institutions, in
close coordination with the PMUunder the EICTDA. The multi-sectoral and cross-sectoralICT
Development activities will be therefore directly linkedto the sector objectives o fthese
programs (where applicable), andwill support the overall objectives o fthe National Capacity
BuildingProgram. The CIDEV sub-component is carefbllydesignedto support communities to
develop ICT assisteduse for their development purposes.Underthis component, ICT can act as
a catalyst for social change controlled bythe communities themselves.

3. Monitoringandevaluationof outcomes/results

TheProject Management Unitwill include a Monitoring andEvaluationSpecialist anda
Communications / Program Officer as well as a Program Assistant to assure that appropriate



                                                 8

work plans related to the specified activities are developed andimplemented,that the
implementation i s closely monitored and evaluated andthat potential lessonsare drawn from the
experiencesmade. Initially it is expectedthat the MonitoringandEvaluation Specialist assistsin
designing the work planso fthe different PMUdepartmentswhich will be consolidatedinto the
work plano fthe PMU. At this level aprimarybackstopping o fthe plannedactivities will be
carried out duringthe day to day supervision. Once the project hasbecome effective andhas
gatheredimplementationmomentum, practical experienceswill flow into the planningso that in
the first andpossibly secondyear of implementation a highdegree of flexibility will be of
importance. The flexibility neededis emphasizedbythe fact that inthe initial stages no
experiencerelatedto the impact o finformation campaigns, implemented by the Communications
/ ProgramOfficer, which areto trigger the demandfor the CommunityICTDevelopment
Program, are available. Lessons inthis respectcan only be drawn duringor after the first year of
implementation.

bycommunities makeprovisions for M&E, templateswillbe designedbythe M&EOfficer and
additional support will be givenbythe Program Assistant o fthe PMU. Templates to gather
baseline information on community level for three different sectors (Health, Agriculture and
Education) have already been developed through anM&E study. Additional templates needto be
developed as requiredandbasedon the sectors touched bythe Community ICT Development
Program.

through the Authority will report to IDAon a quarterlybasis. The frequencies o fthe internal
reporting systemwill be determinedby this requirement.The Planning, Monitoring and
Evaluation activities ofthe project will be supportedby a customized Management Information
Systemwhich will need to behighlyflexible as activities relatingt-othe Community ICT
Development Programcannot beplannedinadvance.Adequate resourceswill beprovided
underthe project for effective execution ofM&Efunctions. For additional details ontheplanned
M&Eactivities andtherelatedKeyPerformanceIndicators see Annex 3.

4. Sustainability

The ICTADproject is responding to avery strong client demandfor capacity buildinginthe ICT
sector to create anenabling environment for sector growth and strengthening o f service
delivery to communities. The Government has launched a national ICT Development initiative to
meet these objectives. The Government's overallICT-Assisted Development program appears
very ambitious andits full implementationrequires strong institutions andhumancapacity
beyondpresent levels. The ICTADproject i s therefore focusing on strengthening them.
The project preparationprocess included several consultation workshops with local stakeholders
andbeneficiaries to ensurethat the design andimplementation o f eachcomponent is fully
endorsed and owned bythe respective stakeholders. These include consultations with
NGOsKBOs andCommunity Based Organizations (e.g. Kebeles, Farmers Associations) and
other community and local government institutions.

The project will also actively support andpromote anincreasing role for the private sector in
provisiono fICT humanresource training andlocalcontent development. While the initial major
investments for development o ftraining o ftrainers may be coveredunder the project, the long
term maintenanceo f such facilities, the operating costs andother related expensesmust be
integratedinto the annual budgetso fthe respective institutions. Inaddition, potential sources of
revenue generation (e.g. registration fees, user fees, etc.) mustbe realisticallydeveloped and
implemented.Theproject will assistthe Government inassessingthese needs anddeveloping
appropriate measuresto ensure sustainability o fthese initiativesbeyondthe project period.

The fiscal implications o f the institutionalstrengtheningactivities will beminimal, andwell
withinthe absorptioncapacity o fthe Government budget.The Government has alreadyplanned
to provide on-going funding for the EthiopianICT Development Authority, andETA, duringand
beyondthe life cycle of the project. Inadditionto the already existing strong government
ownership, the project seeks social support through continuous dialogue with stakeholdersand
communities.

Technical appraisal o fthe design o fthe activities fundedunder the CIDEV subcomponentis
basedon applying principleso f appropriate and locally adaptable technologies, andtherefore is
consistentwith existing level o f capacity andtechnical know-how inthe country. Scalability o f
anyproposed activity will be arequirement for its fundingunderthe ICTADproject.
Itis expectedthat the fiscal impact ofpolicyreformprogramswillbemainly absorbedbythe
project, andthat their potentialbudgetary implicationswill beminimalbeyond the duration of
the project.




                                                  10

Sustainability o f the CIDEV program activities beyond the project duration are o f
concern. The more successful and scalable activities may require additional resources inorder to
be scaled up or replicated inother areas or sectors. However, determination o f scalability o f
successful CIDEV financedprojects would include a careful analysis o ftheir costs andbenefits
prior to scaling up.

5. Critical risks and possiblecontroversial aspects

The most important risk for the project is that the GoE fails to support creation o f an effective
I C Tpolicy, regulatory andlegal framework. This risk is mitigatedbythe following factors:

    0   Despitethe telecom monopoly andthe slow progress inthe policy andregulatory areas,
        the Government has shown a sustained commitment to introducinga wider role for the
        private sector inprovisiono fvalue added services, intemet service provision, andresale
        o ftelecom services. Inaddition, the Government has taken animportant step by
        appointing a new managingdirector for ETC to facilitate the move towards creation o f an

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

1. Economicandfinancialanalyses

The mainfocus of ICTAD is on creating an enabling ICT policy, legal andregulatory
framework, andstrengtheningthe institutions that canplay a keyrole inthis process. These
include the EthiopianICT Development Authority, EthiopianTelecommunications Agency,
EthiopianBroadcasting Agency, andthe Institute for Telecommunications andInformation
Technology.

The project-is also focusing on creating practical opportunities that foster growth o fdemand
frombelow, andincrease the needfor removal o fpolicy, legal andregulatory bottlenecks. For
example, the Rural Connectivityinitiative is focusing onprovisiono fcommunity level
connectivity to residents o funder-served or un-served areas through introductionof last-mile
connectivity options.

The large differentialbetweenEthiopianteledensity and globally observednorms ofteledensity
suggests that there is significant suppresseddemand for telecommunications services. Insuch




                                                14

circumstances, demandi s oftenprice sensitive andelastic. Ethiopia's teledensity o f about .9 is so
low (far below Sub-SaharanAfrica andHIPC averages), that almost any appropriately located
andscaledtelecommunications servicesprovider can succeedbecauseofthe substitution effect
relativeto other, less efficient means to transmit andreceive information. Ethiopia, while poor, is
a supply-constrained market for telecommunications. The reforms and activities proposed in
ICTAD, by initiatingthe processof creating competitive markets,will likely result inlower
prices for telecommunications services, thus generating increaseddemand.

Lack o f access to basic telephone service carries considerable costs. There are numerous case
studies documenting the prohibitivecostspaidby society whenrural andperi-urbanresidents are
denied access to telephone service. For example, the World Bank's World Development Report
1994, Infrastructure for Development, states that studies inColombia andthe Philippines have
shown that the ratio o fproductivity gains arisingthrough the use o ftelephone service exceeds
the annual cost o fproviding service by at least 20:1for businesses.

A studyofthe GrameenVillage Phoneprogram inBangladeshdetailed some ofthe economic
benefits achieved by introducing phones into villages. Accordingto this study, the cost of a
typical trip from a village to the capital city amounts to almost two to eight times the cost o f a
singlephone call. And a singlephone call from a family member inthe capital city to the village
can generate a consumer surplus between3.64% to 9.8% o fmeanmonthly householdincome.
(D.Richardson, R.Ramirez, andM.Haq, GrameenTelecom's Village PhoneProgram inRural
Bangladesh: A Multi-Media Case Study, Telecom Development Group, Ontario, Canada, for the
Canadian International Development Agency, 2000).

Community consultations carried out by the U S NationalTelecommunications Cooperatives
Association (NTCA) inruralNigeriaelicited similar examples. Communities surveyed reported
that they would benefit from telecommunication services innumerous ways. These benefits can
begrouped into five general categories:
    0   Reducedtransport cost andtime;
    0   Marketinformationfor buyingandselling;
    0   Reducedisolation from the outside world;
    0   Job creatiodtrainingheduced rural out-migration;
    0   Access to information about health, agricultural and environmental management.

CostRecovev Model

Inatypicalscenario, ifthere are 3000 community-phones providedat acost ofaboutUSD
2,660,000, the investmentcosts canberecovered in5 years basedon a 30-minutes use o f each
phone per day, at a rate of $0.99 per hour, or 0.14 EthiopianBirrper minute(assuming 1USD=
8.5 EthiopianBirr). This i s a very reasonablerate compared to what ETC i s charging for phone
calls inthe greater Addis Ababa area. Provisiono f access to internet will require an additional
investment cost

Dueto lack of supporting infrastructure (electricity, roads), one may consider Ethiopia to be a
highcost environment, with a cost per line o fUSD 1000per fixed-wireless line, andUSD
1,200-2,000 of extendingfixed-line service to remote areas. Extension ofmobile serviceswill

likelybe cheaper, but is not normallycalculated inaper line basis. More important to consider i s
the fact that, as a result of Ethiopia's extremely low teledensity, there i s ample potential for
growth under a ruralconnectivity program. However, some fundamentals are still lacking: policy
mustbedevelopedinorder to movefirmly, anda soundandreliable regulatory framework must
also develop. ETC has ambitious networkbackboneplanswhich include roll-out o fbroadband
andmultimediaaccess capacity, yet from apolicyperspective,universal access to voice and
some basic form o ftext email mustbe apriority, followed bythe morebroadbandintensive
applications. Ethiopia's universality approachshould aimnot only at rural andremote areas, but
also at urbanand semi-urban areas, which are agonizing for more connectivityandremainin
most cases surprisingly isolated. The opportunity to enhanceeconomic growth, as a result of
more informationandcommunication resources, inkey areas like tourism, exports of agricultural
and some nonagricultural products is enormous. See Annex 9 for further details.

2. Technical

Expert consultantshave assessed all the major technical aspects and options, andhaveprovided
feasibility studies andoptions for implementation of activities intheir respective areas. Proposed
activities andtechnical options have beenformulated inclose collaboration with stakeholder
groups inEthiopia. Theproject preparation team andthe consultants have also received
additional guidance and support on specific topics from appropriate Bankunits (e.g. from
GDLN/ISGonDistance Learningoptions).

Technical designs o fthe proposed activities have beenbasedon usinglocally sustainable
appropriate technologies, andtherefore are consistent with existing level o f capacity and
technical know-how inthe country. Scalability o f anyproposed activity will be a requirement for
its finding under the ICTADproject. Compatibility of selectedtechnologies or technical
solutions with international andnational standards (where applicable) will be a requirement.
Development of such compatibility requirements will take place indirect consultation with
appropriate stakeholdersto ensure compatibility with existing (or required) standards, andwith
locally sustainable and supported solutions.

International standards will be adopted as the startingframework for all technical equipment,
hardware, software andtraining. NationalStandardsfor other aspectsofInformationTechnology
 solutions that have to be adaptedto localneeds (e.g. locallanguagekeyboard, fonts, etc.) will be
developed as a keyfoundation buildingactivity duringimplementation o fthe project.

Procurement

Public procurement inEthiopia i s regulatedby (a) the FinancialProclamationNo. 57/1996 which
constitutes the Procurement Law, (b) the FinancialRegulationsNo. 17/1997 issuedby the
 Councilo fMinisters and (c) the Ministry of Finance Directives procurement andcontracts,
issued in 1997 andrevisedin 1999, at the federal level. The Bank carried out two Country
Procurement Assessment Reviews (CPARs) in 1998 and2002jointly with the Government. The
reviews included detailed diagnosis o fthe current procurement system, its strengths, weaknesses

anddevelopment of anAction Planto address the weaknesses. Themainweaknesses identified
were (i) o f an oversight body for policy andmonitoring, (ii) procurement procedures,

The mainrecommendations ofthe CPAR include: (i)        enactmento f aprocurement law; (ii)
establishment of aregulatory body; (iii) development o fprocurement directives; (iv) preparation
o f standardbiddingdocuments, manuals and guidelines; and (v) implementation o f a
comprehensive capacity building(including training) strategy. The Government has acceptedthe
recommendations ofthe CPAR andhas establishedataskforce to leadthe procurement reform
process. A procurement codehasbeendrafted andtraininghas started to be providedto
procurement staffat Federal level. The new procurement code hasbeenapproved bythe Council
o fMinisters andis expectedto bepresentedto the parliament by October 2004. The code
provides for the establishment o f anindependentregulatory body andthe Government plansto
fully decentralize procurement functions to civil service institutions at the federal levelupon
enactment o fthe code.

The Government has started aprocessto develop new standardbiddingdocuments for the
procurement o f goods, works and services. The NationalBiddingdocuments, when developed,
canbeusedfor national competitive biddingafter verificationbythe Bankthat the countries
laws andprocedures are acceptable. Inorder to be acceptablethe national procedures should
ensure that: (i) will be advertised innational newspaper(s) with wide circulation; (ii) bid

Financial Management

The overall conclusion from the recent CFAA exercise i s that considerable progress has been
made inthe rationalizingand strengthening ofbudgetingprocess at the Federal level. Various
capacity buildingefforts are beingundertakenat the regional levels as well. Despite some
progressesmade inthe last three years, there are weaknessesinmediumterm planning,
accounting, auditing andreporting.

TheProject willbeimplementedbyaPMUthat will beestablishedunder the Ethiopian
InformationandCommunication Development Authority (EICTDA) before the project
effectiveness.As a result o fthis, the project will needto ensurethat the financial management
system is carefully plannedanddeveloped as is indicated inthe action plan shown below.
Establishment o f adequatefinancial management system, among other things, includes
development of a financial managementmanual and appointment o fkey finance staffat the
PMU.

The draft financial managementandProcurement manuals havebeenprepared.
Fundingsources for the project includeBank credit, government andother donor funds. The
credit proceedsfrom the Bankwill flow from the credit account to a SA to be opened at the
NationalBanko f Ethiopia. Fromthe SA, funds maybe transferred to the localBirr account and

from the local Birr account, paymentsmaybemade to suppliers andcontractors.
The Federal Auditor Generalwill assignexternal auditors, acceptableto the Bank, to conduct the
audit o fthe project financial transactions. For details see Annex 7.

4. Social

A social analysis was carried out byconsultantsto analyzethe impact ofICT-assisted
interventions on improvingthe lives ofthe intendedbeneficiaries, urbanandrural communities,
small andmediumenterprises, public andprivate organizations, ruralpopulation, women and
youth, and disabled. The results of studiespoint to a positiveimpact against the background o f
anoverallpoorly developed sector.

Community ownership andbuy-inwill be critical for the success o fthe project. Therefore, a total
o f eleven awarenessraisingworkshops, initialneeds assessments, and stakeholder and
beneficiary consultation workshops havebeenheldduringthe design andpreparation of the
project. The first consultation workshop was heldinMay, 2003, with over 130participants.
These includedrepresentativesfrom Federal, Regional andLocal Government representatives,
various line ministries, NGOs and CommunityBased Organizations (CBOs), localcommunity
organizations, private sector groups, academic institutions, donors andother partners.
Subsequentconsultative workshops wereheldonICTDevelopment, ICT Standards,Rural
Connectivity, Wireless Communications, and other ICT Technical Issues. Consultations with
Private Sector stakeholderswere also heldon ICT SME Development. Regional consultative
workshops on ICT Development were also heldinAssosa, Benishangul, Gambela andTigray.

Stakeholder consultation workshops duringproject preparation have includeddiscussions and
collaboration withNGOsandCommunityBased Organizations, particularlythose that are
already actively involvedinservice deliveryprograms.

The project will be executedby EICTDA. The multi-sectoral andcross-sectoralICT
Development activities will be therefore directly linkedto the sector objectives ofthese
programs (where applicable), andwill support the overall objectives o fthe NationalCapacity
BuildingProgram. The CIDEV sub-componentis carefullydesignedto support communities to
develop ICT assisteduse for their development purposes.Under this component, ICT can act as
a catalyst for social change controlled bythe communities themselves.

The P M Uwill advise the authorities on how to monitor the ICT sector and its contributionto
socioeconomic development. Inthis context, studies canbe conducted under the project that
providemore in-depth analysis. Through the CIDEV sub-component proponents o fprojects will
berequiredto provide indicators for the socioeconomic impact o ftheir proposals.

5. Environment

There are no environmental issues with respectto the ICTADproject (Environmental category
for this project i s C).

                            Annex 1:Countryand Sector Background
ETHIOPIA: InformationandCommunicationTechnology AssistedDevelopmentProject

1. SummaryofKey StructuralandInstitutionalFeaturesofthe Sector

Thekey features ofthe ICT sector inEthiopiaare discussedbelow.

PolicyEnvironment
Ethiopia's broadcasting law is progressive comparedto other sub-SaharanAfrican countries.
However, inpractice no private radio or television stations are licensedto operate as yet.

EthiopianTelecommunications Corporation (ETC) i s the incumbent public telecom operator,
with amonopolyover all telecom servicesinthe country (fixed, mobile, Internet anddata
communications). IndependentV-SAT connections and satellite phones are not allowed, and
call-back services are illegal.

The Government hasrecently decided to proceedwith the licensing ofruralconnectivity
initiatives, private sector Internet Service Providers (ISPs) who will initially leaseconnectivity
facilities from ETC andresell to users, and CommunityRadios.

Inthe InformationTechnology (IT) andnetworkingsegment ofthe sector, thereisnocoherent
policy inplace as yet to support the growth of IT industry.Existinghighimport tariffs (40%) on
computer andcommunications equipment makethe widespread use o f such systems rather
expensive, particularlyfor smaller businesses andinstitutiqns.

InstitutionalFeatures
Development o f ICTs inEthiopia has beentreated inanad hoc manner untilrecently. Various
sectors andinstitutions have tried to addresstheir needs andconcerns independently,rather than
inthe context ofcreatingafavorable framework applicable to all. The ICTPolicyPaperof2003
provides a framework for definingthe directiono fthe sector andits development objectives. It
also sets the stage for institutionalarrangements for policy development, andthe promotion and
regulation ofthe ICT sector.

The Ethiopian Telecommunications Agency (ETA) is the Regulator. ETAi s arather new
institution andits capacity inexecuting its mandate is limited.ETA carries out frequency
assignment for a small segment o fthe spectrum. However, it does not have any spectrum
managementandmonitoringactivities due to lack o f licensing schemes, humanresources, and
monitoring equipment.

The government hasrecently establishedthe EthiopianICT Development Authority (EICTDA),
which i s mandatedto oversee the implementation ofthe ICT strategy.

Connectivity,DataCommunicationsInfrastructureandRelatedServices
Itis generally acceptedthat a robust telecommunications infrastructure is the necessarycondition
for more effective development o fmarkets and growtho fthe economy. The national
telecommunication switching capacity i s about 550,000 lines, o fwhich about 340,000 are


                                                  20

currently inuse. About 60 percent o ftelephones are concentrated inAddis Ababa. Ethiopia's
teledensity is about 0.54, one ofthe lowest inSub-SaharanAfrica.

Use o fmobilephones inEthiopiai s rather limited,but growing. Thenumber o fcurrent
subscribers is about 90,000 and growing. Costs are relatively affordable, but service quality and
availability are low. ETC plansto introduceprepaid and subscriber mobile lines (about 400,000
new lines during2004-2005) to alleviate the situation.

Despite the existing regulatory andinfrastructure limitations, the private sector hasbeen
increasingly active inoffering ITrelated goods and services inrecent years. Over 170companies
offer computer technology related products andservices, mostly inAddis Ababa.

A dedicated digital datanetworkprovides the underlyinginfrastructure for ETC's Internet
service. The number o finternet accounts is still limitedto about 6,000. International link
congestioni s quite severe for daytime connections. Despite the availability of the nationwide
localcall tarifffor dial-up Intemet users, the distributiono f Intemet users i s still strongly skewed
to the capital (94% are located inAddis). This i s partlydue to the limitedavailabilityoftelecom
infrastructure, andpartlybecauseo fthe low level o fcomputerization outside the capital. The
speedandreliability o finternet connections are rather low.

ICT HumanResource
Considerable efforts are under way to increasethe number o ftrained ICTprofessionals in
Ethiopia. These include vocational trainingprograms offered byvarious institutions, as well as
college anduniversitylevel degree programs incomputer science, electronics,
telecommunications andinformationtheory, software engineeringandprogramming, technical
management, anddesign andmaintenanceofmanagementinformationsystems.

 ETC's Institute for Telecommunications andInformationTechnology (ITIT) provides basic
training inplantmaintenance, switching, transmission, traffic andmanagement of
telecommunication networks. ITIT has recently begunbasic training on computer applications
and is planning to offer graduate courses intelecom engineering, management and information
technologies in2004 - 2005.

Since 1992, the private sector hasbeenprovidingbasic computer and software applications
training. The growth o f computer training centers inthe country, despite their unevenquality,
has improvedthe general level o f computer literacy andresultedinmore skilledcomputer usage.
Most ofthese computer-training centers offer courses on application packages, systems analysis
anddesign, andcomputer maintenance.However, the quality offacilities andtraining programs
varies greatly among providers.

Applicationsin Sectors
Thebasic education system hasbeenvirtually untouched bycomputers or Internet. Very few of
the 12,000 primary schools have computers or internet access. The Government i s currently
implementinga School Network program (SchoolNet) that will connect about 500 secondary
schools as part o f a national network. The Government has startedto introduce ICT training
programs insecondary and Technical andVocational andEducationalTraining (TVET) schools.



                                                 21

The tertiary education systemcomprises 6 national universities and 3 polytechnics with a total of
approximately 75,000 students. Addis Ababa University(MU)is the largest tertiary institution
andis also hostto the AfricanVirtual University(AVU)facilities. M Uhas developeda
campus-wide networkwith partialaccess to internet. Most other institutions have limitedaccess
to computer networks andinternet.

E-commerce andthe use ofthe Internet intrade are at a very early stage of development in
Ethiopia. E-commerce relatedlaws andregulations such as privacy protection and digital
signature have yet to be adopted. Automatic Teller Machines (ATMs) are beingintroduced on a
pilot basis.

There are about 350,000 civil servantsinEthiopia, o fwhich only 2,200 have email accounts
(based on 735 government EthioNet accounts eachhaving 3 users). I t i s estimated that about
14% o fpublic servants have access to PCs. Several government ministries and agencies,
includingMinistryo fFinance, have parts of their operations computerized. There are also plans
for computerization o f other public sector management operations.

The EthiopianCivil Service College inAddis Ababa is operating a GlobalDevelopment
LearningNetwork (GDLN) center, offeringvideo conferencing anddistance learningservices in
Addis Ababa. Thetwo-way video conferencing facility ishousedinaclassroom capableo f
takingup to 40 students. A variety of courseshavebeenoffered to about 1,200 students.

The Government i s developing implementingplans for a Government Network and a local
authority (Woreda) network, to connect the Federal, Regional andlocal governments. The initial
phasewill create a Regional andWoreda administration network that will connect over 560 high
schools and 611Woreda administrations with the Regional andFederal governments. The
proposedinitial applications for this network include communication and data exchange among
local, regional and federal government agencies. The Government i s also considering broader
use o f these facilities for service deliveryto local communities andoffering them as access
points for rural connectivity andaccess through a variety o f arrangements,which include public
as well as private service providers.

ICT Standards
Lack o f locally adaptedtechnology standardsfor informationtechnology systems i s amajor
concernthat requires special attention. Severalmajor local languages are widely usedin
Ethiopia, which vary across the Regions. Government's broader objectives o fcapacity building,
decentralization, andnetworked classrooms andlocal administrations will require development
o fICT standardsthat are responsiveto these needs.

2. Summary of the Bank'sassessmentsof key policy,institutionalissuesandconstraints

The Government hasrecently taken severalpositive steps to address the ICT sector development
challenges. Ithas establishedthe EthiopianICT Development Authority (EICTDA), with a
mandate to proposepolicy andto coordinate amulti-sectoral effort for development o fthe ICT
sector. Two keytelecommunications agencies (ETA andETC) now have newly appointed
managing directors, andthe new management teams that are keen on advancing the ICT sector



                                                   22

development objectives. All these developments could facilitate the steady growth and
development o fthe sector.

Encouraging developments inlicensing o fprivate sector operators to set up cyber cafes andto
engage insales, installation and service o fcommunications equipment and services are also
consistent with the Government's statedobjectives inits ICT Policypaper. However, major
challenges still remain. The Broadcasting law allows setting up o fprivate sector non-government
programs, but nongovernmentaloperations or programs are virtually nonexistent inEthiopia.

Staffo fthe Ethiopian Broadcasting Agency (EBA) lack exposure to intemational best
practices inbroadcasting policy formulation, licensing andthe development o f local(language)
content.

ETC's position as the incumbent monopolyhas ledto its inefficiency andineffectiveness in
respondingto customer needs andthe growing demands ofthe public andprivateinstitutions for
connectivity, communications, anddata exchange services,

ETA'Sinstitutionalcapacity for regulationofthe sector i s weak. Major challenges remaininthe
areas of rural connectivity, development of national telecom infrastructure, mobile telephony,
data communications, andavailability and affordability of intemet andrelated services.

The InfomationTechnology sector (computers, networks, andrelated services) is small but
growing. ICT humanresources are limiteddue to small markets, low salaries, low on thejob
incentives, andlack o f institutionalinfrastructure. Sector-specific ICT applications are limitedin
scope, andvery often are implemented ina disjointed andfragmented manner. The implemented
solutions are also generally under-utilized. Informationavailability, particularly inlocal
languages, i s limited.Lack o fICT standardshinderswidespread growtho f applications,
particularly inlocal languages.

Inpractical terms, anumberofregulatory, technical, andoperationalprerequisitesmustbe
institutedbefore ICTscanhave a significant impact onEthiopia's povertyreduction and
socioeconomic development efforts.

Government's strategyto addressthese issuesandconstraints
For Ethiopiato meet its development objectives usingICTs as enablers, considerable
investments are needed ininstitutionaland sector capacity buildingefforts. The same i s true
about humanresourcedevelopment needs, andcommunications andinformationtechnology
infrastructure. Inaddition, appropriate policy andregulatory reforms are neededto ensure
equitable, reliable, andaffordable access to informationandcommunication technologies.
Inresponsetothesechallenges,theGovernmenthasembarkedonamajorefforttoputinplace
many ofthe buildingblocksrequiredfor developing a robust ICT sector inEthiopia. The
Government has:

    1. PreparedanICT Policypaper (drivenbythe development objectives outlinedinthe
        SDPRP) which i s reviewedand endorsedby the Council ofMinisters;




                                                 23

    2. Established the Ethiopian InformationandCommunication Technology Development
       Authority (EICTDA) as the nationalpolicy advocacy and coordinating body for ICTs;
    3. Initiateda national ICT capacity buildingprogram (see Section B for details);
    4. Appointed anew managementteam for the EthiopianTelecommunications Agency
       (ETA) andthe EthiopianTelecommunications Corporation (ETC) respectively, to ensure
       effective strengtheningoftelecom regulation andremovalo fregulatory bottlenecks, for
       ICT development andto improve the efficiency and effectiveness o fthe operator in
       responseto the changing demandsofthe market;
    5. Initiatedactions to facilitate active participation o fthe private sector inprovisionof ICT
       andtelecom relatedvalue addedservices(e.g. issuinglicenses for provisionofintemet
       services and cyber cafb's bythe private sector);
    6. Agreedto increaseconnectivity andaccess to communications services, particularly in
       rural areas, through licensing o fprivate sector Internet Service Providers (ISPs); Rural
       Connectivitypublic-private partnerships; andcommunityradios.

3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:

Discussions on the existing status o fEthiopia's ICT sector have ledto amutualunderstanding
betweenthe Government andthe Bankon the purpose and scope o f the ICTADproject as
follows:
    0  Implementation o fthe GoE's ICT capacitybuildingprogramrequires a major effort to
       establish the cross-cutting prerequisites and foundations for sustainablegrowth ofthe
       ICT sector;
    0  The ICTADproject will focus on cross-cutting foundation buildingissues (e.g. policy
       andregulatory environment, ICT standards,trainingoftrainers, capacity buildingand
       institutionalstrengthening, etc.). These are among the key prerequisites for the successfbl
       institutionalization andmainstreaming o f ICTs inall sectors, andfor the effective growth
       o f ICT-assisteddevelopment inEthiopia;
    0  Large scalecomputerization androll-out activities invarious sectorswill becarried out
       underthe respective sector operations. These large scale operations includeIDAfinded
       operations, such as the Higher Educationandthe RuralDevelopment Projects, andthe
       Public Sector Capacity BuildingProgram (PSCAP). Inthe context o fthese projects,
       modalities of ICT applications and roll-out activities include ICT enhanced sector service
       delivery, Good Governance, andcomputerization o f federal, regionaland local
       government institutions andthe installation o fmanagementinformationsystems.

Therefore, ICTADproject activities will focus on:
    a  Facilitatingthe creation of an enabling Policy/ Regulatory / Legal environment through a
       select group o fpolicy reviews andrecommendations;
    0  Establishing the cross-cutting, multi-sectoral prerequisites for the growth o f ICTs in
       Ethiopia(e.g. locally adaptedtechnical standards anddata security);
    0  StrengtheningEICTDA's oversight andsector monitoringcapacity;
    0  Strengtheningthe performance ofregulatory authorities such as Ethiopian
       Telecommunications Agency and\theEthiopianBroadcasting Agency's regulatory
       capacity;
    0  Strengthening ITIT's trainingprograms and upgrading its personnel's skills;


                                                 24

        Providing Sector M&Eandproject administration through a PMU;
        Application andCommunity Support Incorporating ICT trainingo ftrainers inselected
        TVET training centers;
        Strengthening the Regional Micro and Small Enterprise Development Agency's capacity
        to develop Public-Private Partnershipswith SMEs for provision o fincreasedconnectivity
        andaccess;
        Establishing ICT Business Development incubators under a Public-Private Partnership
        arrangement;
        Supporting ruralconnectivity initiatives and creation o f access points inoutlying areas;
        Establishing a demanddrivenCommunityICT Development Fund, and evaluating its
        impact.

Initially, the project will mobilize existing institutionalcapacity andwork within the existing
policy, regulatory andlegal framework, while facilitatingthe shift towards introduction o fthe
necessaryreforms to help develop the ICT sector.

4. Summary of ProposedApproach

Withrespectto the four pillars ofthe Government's ICT strategy, the proposedproject
components concentrate on: i)creating an enabling policy, legal, andregulatory environment; ii)
strengtheningICT-sector institutions; iii)facilitatingincreasedconnectivity / access ;andiv)
supporting the utilizationo f ICT assisted services andproviding access to communications
through use o f appropriate technologies at community level through a demand driven facility.

This facility will provide fundingon acompetitive basis, The first three areas offocus will have
direct global, multi-sectoral andcross-cutting impact on the growth o f ICTs inEthiopia. The
communitydrivenpilotswill demonstratethe potential value andimpact o f access to ICT-
assistedinterventions inimproving the efficiency and effectiveness of service deliveryto
communities.

The outcomes o f ICTAD's activities will be complementary to those of other ICT initiatives
supportedbythe Government andBankprograms andprojects. This project will help create an
enabling legal, political and economic environment for the growth o f ICTs throughpolicy
dialogue and advice, strengthening the key sector institutions, anddeveloping opportunities for
private sector andcommunities to actively engage inthe sector andbenefit from it. Large scale
computerization or roll-out activities are beyond the scope o fthis project andwill be carried out
under respective sector operations.

                              Annex 4: DetailedProjectDescription
 ETHIOPIA: Informationand CommunicationTechnologyAssistedDevelopmentProject

The project consists oftwo components:
1.      Policy and InstitutionalSupport, and
2.      Applications andCommunity Support

By Component:

ProjectComponent1 USD13.40 million
                          -
Policv and Institutional Sumort

This component will establish an enabling environment for the growth ofthe ICT sectorby
supporting a comprehensive assessment ofthe existingpolicy, regulatory and legal framework,
particularly inthe areas o f informationtechnology, telecom, information sharing, andintemet. It
will also strengthen capacity ofthe keyinstitutions that regulate the sector, provide services, or
managethe reformprocess.

The Policy,RegulatoryandLegalFrameworksub-componentwill helpidentifypolicy and
regulatory impedimentsto the growth of ICTs, andwill helppropose favorable trade, taxation,
privacy, and security policies. It will also support drafting of appropriate business law and
preparation o fnewpolicies andregulations that will addressthe current deficiencies.

Severalmajor local languages are widely usedinEthiopia, particularly inthe Regions.
Government's broader objectives of capacity building, decentralization, andnetworked
classrooms andlocal administrations will require development o fICT standardsthat are
responsive to these needs. TheICT Standards sub-component will therefore support specific
activities to translate standardization requirements into coherent, well definedtasks andprojects,
andpromote anopenprocessfor establishmentofthe necessarystandards. Special needs of
disabled inusingICTs will also be addressed. Associated with standarddevelopment the sub-
component will help to establishmechanismsthat improve DataSecurity.

The sub-component will include trainingandstudy tours andtechnicalandmanagement
trainingfor keyICT stakeholdersandpolicymakers onuse andmanagementofnew
communication anddata exchangetechnologies such as intemet, Internet Protocol(P)based
networks, wireless communications andrelated technologies. Particular emphasiswill be given
to clarificationo fneeds andidentificationof options for the development o f anadequateand
sustainableinfrastructure for data exchangepurposes. This i s particularlyimportant inthe
context o fthe Government's decentralization o fpublic administration activities to local
authorities at Woreda level.

Since the bulk o f activities under this component consist o f consultancies, the hdingfor this
component will bepooledto facilitate implementation arrangements.




                                                 33

The component will support the strengthening of key ICT policy and regulatory agencies.
This includes support for the EthiopianICT Development Authority (EICTDA); for the
EthiopianTelecommunicationsAgency (ETA) andthe EthiopianBroadcastingAgency (EBA)
to become more effective regulators and facilitators for the user oriented development o fthe ICT
sector. ETA'Scapabilities will be strengthened inFrequency SpectrumManagement andin
providing advisory services on sector reform options to allow rapid growth o f ICTs. The EBA
will be strengthened to better facilitate the licensingandoperation o flocal, community based
radio broadcasting. This sub-component will also support ETC, to become a more efficient
operator inits areas o f core competency, andwill assist ETCinthe transfer o f certain value
added services to the private sector. Specific activities include supporting institutional capacity
for the Ethiopian ICT Development Authority (EICTDA); strengthening o f an independent
telecom regulatory Agency; instituting an effective spectrum management system; encouraging
andfacilitating (through comprehensive assessmentsandstudies) the development o fan
appropriate national communication infrastructure andprovision o f sufficient bandwidth for data
andmultimedia; Increasingawareness amongpolicymakers andcommunity leaders onthe
significant role that ICTs can play as enablers for improved governance and service delivery.

Efficient Project Management and Sector Monitoring are key to a successful implementation
o f the project. The sub-component will assist the EICTDAto manage the project through an
operationally independent Project Management Unit (PMU) that provides overall coordination
andmanagement o fthe project, more specifically, planning, communication, M&E, financial
management, procurement, reporting hctions. Inaddition the PMUwill manage the community
ICT Development program (CIDEV) (component 2) andevaluate its impact.

An effective M&E program anda robust learningsystem are considered key activities under this
project for the following reasons:

1. The inter-dependent nature o fthe plannedactivities is suchthat to achieve the program
     objectives, a series o f asynchronous activities must be carried out inparallel. The complexity
     o fmanagingthe interdependencies andthe sequencing needed, requires a very effective
     monitoring system throughout the implementationprocess.

2. The interdependencies also implythat successful implementationo fthe project requires a
     robust learning andknowledge sharing system. All key stakeholders must be very clear about
     the project's goals andhow to measure progress and success, andbe constantly aware o f the
     status o f eachprogram. The team must evaluate the progress andimpact o f each activity, and
     make the necessary adjustments to ensure that project activities remain responsive to the
     changing needs while remaining consistent with the program objectives. This is particularly
     important where the activities are to inform or guide future policy andinvestment decisions
     inICT-assisted Development.

Most poverty reduction interventions (schools, health clinics, agricultural development programs
andsocial services) depend oncommunications andinformation exchange for their effective
delivery. Provisiono f adequate communications capabilities, particularly when adapted to local
circumstances andneeds, also encourages the poor to participate ineconomic activities and

Application and CommunitvSupport

An important objective ofthe Government's ICT development programis to increase
connectivity and to provide access to communications services throughout the country.
International experience suggeststhat the expansion of communications network is strongly
correlated with economic growth, andthat access to communications inrural areas diminishes
the urbdrural economic disparities, provides access to market information, and facilitates
service deliveryinhealth, education andother areas therebyreinforcingthe povertyreduction
contribution of ICTs.

One sub-componentwill provide ICT Training of trainers in a selected TVET center,
supporting specific ICT relatedtechnical training deliveredbyvocational streams (either through
secondary levelvocation trainingprograms or inpolytechnics andcommunity colleges). The
long-term objective is the development of ICT humanresources to deal with more advanced
technical needs (e.g. network design andmanagement, communications systemdesignand
implementation, advancedtechnologies). Special emphasiswill be givento developing ICT
technical andvocational training skills. It further includes training intechnical managementand
support o f institutionalinformationsystems, computer programming, hardwaremaintenance and
support, applications development. This sub-component will also support strengthening o f a
(Regional Micro and Small Enterprise Agency (ReMSEDA) to invoke a stronger involvement o f
small andmicro enterprisesinto the development o fthe ICT sector.

The ICT Private Sector Development (Incubator) sub-component will foster amore direct
participation ofthe private sector inall ICT related aspectsby creating opportunities for their
growth inthe InformationTechnology (IT) sector. To this end, a study will be carried out in
close collaboration with the private sector to identify their needs andthe bottlenecks for ICT
sector growth. The objective i s to identifyopportunities for amore active participation o fprivate
sector companies inthe ICT sector, bothlocally as well as internationally. Additionally an ICT
marketassessment andgrowthopportunity analysiswillbe carried out, includingthe assessment
oftraining andhumanresource needs and a capacity assessment o f the private sector. Specific
activities will be designed for creating business opportunities for the private sector to strengthen
its ICT capacity by direct involvement inICT activities through the establishment of an

incubator that will providetechnology-enhancedsupport systems to private sector companies.
This initiativewill have three main activities: i)ahigh-end ICTbusiness incubator to foster
innovativeand advanceduse of ICTbusiness ideasboth at local andintemational level,
includingsupport for settingup of operationsbyprivate sector Internet Service Providers (ISPs);
ii)aSmallandMediumEnterpriseincubatorforInformationTechnologycompaniestoassist
theminbusinessdevelopment, marketing, andaccess to new customerbase; andiii)re-
manufacturing and upgrading initiative for productionof low cost computers andperipheral
equipment.Other activities will support the strengtheningofthe privatesector's capacity for use
andmaintenanceof locallyadaptedtechnologies. This sub-componentwill also support
initiatives for increasing opportunities for women andyouth to participate inICT related
businesses andtraining opportunities.

The Connectivity / Access sub component will facilitate the creationofpublic/private
partnerships betweenETC andqualifiedcooperatives and/or private sector groups to offer
community level connectivity andaccess to the nationaltelecommunications andICT services.
InthesepartnershipsETCwouldact as awholesaler ofcommunicationsnetworkinfrastructure
andservicesandprovidebackboneinfrastructure for connecting to the national communications
network. Community basedand/or qualified localprivate sector groups would act as community
basedoperators or re-sellers for retail sales o f communications services. This sub-component
would create a win-win situation for all key stakeholders. The communities will benefit by
having access to national communications infrastructure, information, etc. Local andregional
economies couldbenefit from the informationflow and access to market informationthat this
will bringabout. ETA will strengthen its capacity through "learning bydoing" bytackling a
series ofreal-world regulatory issues that it must manage skillfullyinorder to makerural
connectivity inEthiopia a reality. ETC will also benefit from a scalablebusiness modelthat
promises to create new revenue streamsfor ETC throughincreasedtraffic on the backbone,
interconnection charges andprovisiono ftechnical services. A set o f access rules will be
developed basedon transparency andaccountability that ensure a maximuminterest ofprivate
sector andcommunity involvement without exposing the Government's budget to subsidies that
would not be sustainable. This component will provide communities with access to
communications servicesbeyondthe current reach o f the national telecommunications
infrastructure. Itwill also create opportunities for technology transfer to Ethiopia, particularly
where certain components o fthe rural connectivity systems couldbe manufactured and/or
assembled locally. Inaddition, related humanresources, and research and development
capacity inrural access technologies couldbe established and supportedat technical schools and
highereducationinstitutions. These efforts could also foster export activities incertain areas of
rural access technology.

This component will be implemented intwo phases. Phase Iwould include detailed studies of
available rural connectivityoptions, identify international bestpractices, andpropose practical
options for modalities o f Government financial assistanceandor technical support for rural
connectivity inEthiopia. Phase Iwould also demonstrate the usefulness of the technology and
provide lessonswith regard to managing the investments prior to scaling up, andto identify and
solve anybottlenecks inthe licensing process. Phase Iwould be managedby EICTDA in
cooperation with ETA, ETC, regional andlocal authorities. DuringPhase Ithe project would
also establish the appropriate access rules, including the design o f output basedsubsidies or low

interest loans (the potential financial models are not limitedto the two mentioned abovebut will
rather be determined bythe realityon the ground at the time o fimplementation ofPhase I)       that
would be requiredto attract cooperatives and/or private investors to investinrural connectivity.
PhaseI1will implementRuralConnectivity solutions underPublic-Cooperative or Public-
Private arrangements,basedon the findings o fPhase I.

The CommunityICT- DevelopmentProgram(CIDEV) component is carefully designedto
support communityoriented initiativesthat help communities to access and use ICT services
withinthe context oftheir needs anddevelopment activities that are ongoing or under
preparation. This program will finance proposals bycommunities or intermediaries (such as
Government departments,projects, NGOs, associationsandother eligible proponents) that meet
a set o f criteria developed basedon the following basic principles: ownership bycommunities,
feasibility, sustainability, scalability, measurability o fresults, and alignment with national
priorities inHealth, Agriculture, Education, Good Governanceand ICTAD objectives. Under
direct supervision of the Project Director (EICTDA), the PMUwill managethe program andits
appraisal, andmonitoring and evaluationprocedures inatransparentmanner.PMUwill also
makeall informationrelatedto the CIDEV programandproposalspublic. Itis essentialto note
that the program is meantto demonstratethe complementary nature o f ICT inachieving a
development objective.

Community ownership andbuy-inwill be critical for the success o fthe project. Therefore,
awarenessraisingworkshops, initial needs assessments, and stakeholder andbeneficiary
consultation workshops havebeencarried out duringthe designphaseto determine the relevance
andsustainability ofICT support. The studies have assessedthe communities' informationand
communication needs, potential impact of ICT-enhanced services on the local economy, andthe
commitment o fcommunity leadersto support these initiatives. These ICT-enhanced activities
will introduce appropriate technologies through specific interventions to improve the
effectiveness andimpact o f sector programs.

A special operational manualwill beproduced for the CIDEV programbyPMUto allow for a
transparent, andswift processing o fproposals.

ImplementingEntities
TheEthiopianInformationCommunication Technology Authority (EICTDA) is responsible for
the overall implementation ofthe project. Inorder to facilitate implementation, anew Project
Management Unit (PMU) will be establishedandwill behousedunder the newly established
EICTDA.

The PMUwill be responsible for the overall financial managemento fthe project. All the
payments, except some which will bemade on exceptional basis, will bemadeby the PMU. The
PMUwill have anexperiencedandqualifiedfinance officer andjunior accountant.

Flow of Funds
The Government o fEthiopia, the World Bank andother donors will provide financial support to
the project. A Special Account will be openedat the NationalBank ofEthiopiato receive funds
fiom IDA for project implementation. The EICTDAPMUwill beresponsible for monitoring the
status o f disbursementsfrom the Special Account andto process applications for replenishment
inatimely mannerso as to ensure anunobstructedflow offundsto the project andits
beneficiary components.

One local currency account inBirrwill be opened at a commercial bank acceptable to IDA to
transfer money from the USD SA to cover six months expectedexpenditures. Another local
currency may be openedto beusedfor the counterpart contribution. The SA andthe two local
currency accountswill bemanagedbythe EICTDAPMU.

The Government has agreedto select the FMRs-baseddisbursement for thisproject after an
initial transition period, anddetails are shown inthe disbursementsections ofthe PAD.
Replenishments to the SA will bemadeup on submission o fFMRs andadditional statementsby
EICTDA to IDA.

All paymentswill beprocessedandpaidbythe PMU. ETA, ETC, EBA, andother sector
ministries will provide technical assistance, such as providing specifications for goods andTORS
for consultants; andconfirmingthe receipts o f goods and services. All the original supporting
documents will bekept at the PMU.

Staffing
The PMUwill hirefinance officer andjunior accountant with adequateeducational qualifications
andexperience.The advertisement for the finance officer has already beenpostedinanational
newspaper. Thejunior accountantwill beinplace lookingat the volume of the transactions in
the first few months ofproject implementation.

An international consultant will behiredto finalize the financial managementmanual o fthe
project andwill provide appropriate trainingto the finance officer to behired. The consultant in
cooperation with the finance officer will install a computerized accounting system for the
project, which i s capable o f generating the regular FMRs.

Accountingpoliciesandprocedures
The P M Uwill use accrual system of accounting on a double entry basis except fixed assets and
stocks for which the cost o f fixed assets and stocks will berecognized as expenditureat the time
ofpurchases. As far as possible the PMUwill use the Public Sector International Accounting
Standardsinrecording andreportingthe financial transactionsofthe project. Detailedprocedural
guidelines are includedinthe financial managementmanualo f the project.

InternalControls
Internalcontrol comprises the entire systems o f control, financial or otherwise, establishedby
managementinorder to (a) carry out the project activities inan orderly and efficientmanner; (b)
ensure adherenceto policies andprocedures; and (c) safeguardthe assets o fthe project and
secure as far as possible the completeness and accuracy ofthe financial andother records.

Theproject is expectedto design andinstallintemalcontrolsystems, whichwill helpthe
management o fthe project inachieving the project objectives inan orderly andefficient manner.
Since the project will not have aninternal audit section, the control systems to be designed
should compensate for the nonexistence ofthe internalaudit. Thus, the main focus o fthe intemal
control i s placed on the following:

    -Segregation of duties
    -Physical control of assets
    -Authorizationand approval
    -Clear channels of command
    -Arithmetic and accounting accuracy
    -Integrity andperformance o f staff at all levels
    -Supervision

The intemal audit unit o fthe EICTDA will perform some post audit activities o fthe project,

ReportingandMonitoring
The EICTDAPMUwill establish adequate accounting andreporting systems, which will
produce accurate andreliable informationregardingproject resources andexpenditures. The
systems should provide reliable records and reports on all assets andliabilities and financial
transactions o fthe project, and sufficient financial information for managing andmonitoring
activities. The accounting andreportingsystems will, among other things, include the:
    -Flow o f funds
    -Accounting policies to be followed
    -Accounting systems
    -Chart o f accounts
    -Reportingmechanism
    -Budgetingprocess

Accordingto the EthiopianConstitution, the Office o fFederalAuditor General (OFAG) is
responsible to carry out the audit o f all the financial transactions o fthe federal government and
subsidies to the regions. Each o f the regions hasregional auditor general responsible to audit
financial transactions inthe region. The OFAGusuallydelegates its responsibilitymostlyto the
Audit Services Corporations, the government owned audit firm, andinsome cases to private
audit firms to carry out the audit o f donor-financed projects. For this project, OFAGwill assign
an external auditor acceptableto IDA.

According to the new audit policy o fIDA,PMUwill prepare consolidated statements for the
project which include all the sources from donors andthe government andrelatedProject
expenditures andthe auditors will express a single opiniononthe consolidated Project accounts.
The TOR for the extemal audit were agreedduringnegotiations. The audit reports should be
submittedto IDA six months after the end ofeachfiscal year, which ends on 7 July ofeachyear.

3. DisbursementArrangements

There are two ways to disbursefunds from the Bank.The first one is the traditional disbursement
method, which uses SA, SOEprocedures anddirect payment procedures.The secondone i s the
report-based method, inwhich regular Financial MonitoringReports (FMR) plus additional
statementswill be the basis for disbursement. The project will use the transaction-based
disbursementmethodduringthe initialtransitional periodandconvert to Report-based
disbursementsafter the PIUhas establisheda good financial managementsystemcapableof
producingquarterly FMRs.Theproject will however submit quarterly reports (FMRs) required
underReport-based disbursementsduringthe transitional period. Thereportswillbeusedto
assess the progress towards meetingthe requirements o fthe Report-baseddisbursementmethod.
An advanceinto the Special Account, basedonthe amount determined duringnegotiations, will
bemade at the inceptionofthe project, andsubsequent replenishmentswill bemade on the basis
o fwithdrawal applications and Statementso fExpenditure(SOE's).

After the transition to FMRsbaseddisbursement, disbursementofthe IDAFundsto the PMU
will bemade on the basis of FMRsthat integratesproject accounting, procurement, contract
management, and disbursement with physical progress o fproject implementation. The FMRs
will include informationunderthree maincategories: aproject financial statementwhich
includes a summaryof sources anduses of finds, anupdated six-month forecast, Special Account
activity andreconciliationstatements, a statement o f eligible expendituresby disbursement
category; aprojectprogress report explaining variances between actual physicaland financial
progressversus forecasts; andaprocurement management report showingprocurement status
and contract commitments as well as statements on suppliers information for contracts below and
above Prior ReviewThreshold.

An advancewill bemade into the Special Account as soon as the use ofFMRs-based
disbursement is clearedby IDA.The advancewill bemeant to cover project expenditures for six
months as indicated inthe initial six-month cash flow forecast. Inthe subsequent quarter, the
project will submit FMRs, which include a cash flow forecast for the following six months
period. The cashrequest at the reporting date will be the amount requiredfor the forecast period
as shown inthe approved FMRsless the balance inthe Special Account at the end o fthe quarter.

The option o f disbursingfunds through direct payments from IDA on contracts above a
predeterminedthreshold will also beavailable throughout the life ofthe project. Withdrawal
applications for suchpayments will be accompaniedbyrelevant supporting documents such as
copies o fthe contract, contractors' invoices and appropriate certifications.

IDAwill havethe right, as reflectedinthe Development Credit Agreement, to suspend
disbursementofthe Funds ifreporting requirements arenot compliedwith.


Theproceedsofthe Credit will bedisbursedover theproject implementation periodoffive
years. Disbursementswill bemade against the categories o f expenditure presentedinTable A
below andinaccordancewith the guidelines set out inthe World Bank`sDisbursement
Handbook andthe financial monitoringguidelines.

 costs on all contractsregardless of the amount. Foreignstudytours andtraining are subject to no
 objection from IDA.The borrower will retainall the supporting documentation for SOEs,
 including completion reports and certificates. The supporting documentswill bemade available
 to IDA duringProject supervision andwill be audited annually by independent auditors
 acceptable to the Association. Disbursements for expenditures above these thresholds will be
 made against presentation o f full documentation relatingto those expenditures. Duringthe
 Project launchworkshop, there will be a session onproper preparation o fwithdrawal
 applications, includingthe preparation and submission o frequiredsupporting documents.

 SpecialAccount
 To facilitate disbursementsagainst eligible expenditures underthe Credit, EICTDAPMUwill
 establish a Special Account (SA) inthe NationalBanko fEthiopia. The authorized allocation for
 the Special Account will beUSD2,500,000. Upon effectiveness, IDAwill deposit an initial
 deposit up to USD 1,500,000 into the Special Account. Oncethe total disbursements from the
 Credit account, includingcommitments, have reached an aggregateamount o f SDR 4,000,000,
 the initial allocation may be increasedup to the authorized allocation. The EICTDA will submit


                                                 46

replenishment applications at least once a month.

Counterpartfund
The Government ofEthiopiawill open a localcurrency account ina commercial bank acceptable
to IDA andwill deposit Birr 7,200,000 (USD 837,000 equivalent) for the first project year and
subsequent depositsofBirr 8.6 million (USD 1.O millionequivalent) at the beginning ofeach
project year basedon the annual budgeto fthe project.

GeneralInformation

1. Public procurement inEthiopiais regulatedby(a) the FinancialProclamation No. 57/1996
which constitutes the Procurement Law, (b) the FinancialRegulations No. 17/1997 issuedbythe
Council o fMinisters and(c) the MinistryofFinance Directives procurement andcontracts,
issued in 1997 andrevised in1999, at the federal level. The Bankcarried out two Country
Procurement Assessment Reviews(CPARs) in 1998 and2002jointly with the Government. The
reviewsincludeddetailed diagnosisofthe current procurement system, its strengths, weaknesses
anddevelopment of anAction Planto address the weaknesses. Themainweaknessesidentified
were (i) of an oversight body for policy andmonitoring, (ii) procurement procedures,
         Lack                                                    Weak
(iii) ofalegalandregulatoryframeworkand(iv)Lackofadequateprocurementcapacity.
     Lack

2. The mainrecommendations ofthe CPAR include: (i)       enactment of aprocurement law; (ii)
establishment o f a regulatory body; (iii)
                                         development o fprocurement directives; (iv) preparation
o f standardbiddingdocuments, manuals and guidelines; and (v) implementation of a
comprehensive capacity building(including training) strategy. The Government has acceptedthe
recommendations ofthe CPAR andhas establisheda taskforce to lead the procurement reform
process. A procurement code has beendrafted andtraininghas started to beprovidedto
procurement staff at Federal level. The newprocurement codehasbeenapprovedbythe Council             1


o fMinisters andis expectedto bepresented to the parliamentby October 2004. The code
provides for the establishment o f an independentregulatory body andthe Government plansto
fully decentralize procurement hctionsto civil service institutions at the federal level upon
enactment o fthe code.

A.    General

3. Procurement for the proposedproject would be carried out inaccordancewith the World
Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement UnderIBRDLoans andIDACredits" datedMay2004; and
"Guidelines: Selection andEmployment o f Consultants byWorld Bank Borrowers" datedMay
2004, andthe provisions stipulated inthe LegalAgreement. The general description o fvarious
items under different expenditurecategory are described below. For each contract to be
financed bythe Credit, the differentprocurement methods or consultant selection methods, the
need for prequalification, estimatedcosts, prior review requirements, andtime frame are agreed
between the Borrower andthe Bank project team inthe Procurement Plan. The Procurement Plan
will beupdated at least annually or as requiredto reflectthe actualproject implementationneeds
andimprovements ininstitutionalcapacity.

4. The Government has starteda process to develop new standardbiddingdocuments for the
procurement o f goods, works and services. TheNationalBiddingdocuments, when developed,
canbeused for national competitive biddingafter verification by the Bank that the countries
laws andprocedures are acceptable. Inorder to be acceptable the national procedures should
ensure that: (i) will be advertised innationalnewspaper(s) with wide circulation; (ii) bid
               bids                                                                       the
documents clearly explainthe bidevaluation and award criteria; (iii) are given adequate
                                                                     bidders

responsetime (minimumfour weeks) to prepare and submit bids; (iv) bidsare awardedto the
lowest evaluatedbidder; (v) foreign biddersare not precluded from participationinNCB; and
(vi) no domestic preferencemarginsare applicable to domestic manufacturers andsuppliers.

ProcurementofWorks: Works procuredunderthis project, wouldinclude civilworks related
to Technology Park / Incubators and Connectivity and access. The procurement will be done
usingthe Bank's StandardBiddingDocuments (SBD)for all ICB andNationalSBDagreedwith
(or satisfactory to) the Bank. Works contracts exceeding USD500,000 will beprocuredthrough
ICB. Contracts below 500,000 will beprocured through NCB. Works contracts below USD
50,000 maybeprocuredbasedon quotations from at least three qualified domestic contractors in
responseto a writteninvitation. The award shall bemade to the contractor who provides the
lowest price quotation for the requiredwork, andwho has the experience andresources to
complete the contract successfully.

Procurementof Goods: The project will finance Office equipment, furniture, vehicles and
supplies. Theprocurement will bedoneusingBank's SBD for all ICB andNationalSBD agreed
with (or satisfactory to) the Bank.To the extent possible andpracticable, goods andequipmentto
bepurchasedunderthe project would becombinedintopackagesworth at leastUSD 150,000.
Goods that cannot bepackagedandprocured efficientlyusingICB procedures will as much as
possible bepackagedinsizable contracts to be awarded on the bases ofNCB procedures.
Contracts estimatedto cost less thanUSD 150,000 equivalent would beprocured usingNCB.
Procurement for readily available off-the-shelf goods that cannot be grouped together estimated
to cost less thanUSD 50,000 equivalent would beprocuredon the basis of Shopping Procedures.
Solicitations for NationalandInternational Shopping will (a) beissuedinwriting to at least three
reputable suppliers (it maybebetter to approach five or six suppliersbecausenot all three
suppliers may respond, so that at least three competitive quotations are received.), (b) include
specifications, and ifgoods are not immediatelyavailable, the deliverytime, (c) give the
estimated cost, including cost o f inlandtransportation and insurance, (d) be opened at the same
time for evaluation (to avoidabuse), and(e) inthe case ofInternational Shopping quotations, be
solicited from at least three suppliers from two different countries. Alternatively such goods may
also beprocuredfrom UNAgencies (Inter-Agency Procurement Services Office or IAPSO)
provided eachindividualcontract does not exceedUSD 100,000.

Selectionof Consultants: Consultant Servicesinclude studies relatedto policy, regulatory and
legal framework, standards, data security, M&E and CommunityICT development. Short lists
ofconsultants for services estimated to cost less than $200,000 equivalent per contract may be
composed entirely ofnational consultants inaccordancewith the provisions o fparagraph 2.7 o f
the Consultant Guidelines.The preferred methods o f selection for consultant services shall be
Quality andCost Based Selection (QCBS) method. Consultant for complex andhighly
specialized assignmentswith highdownstream impact andassignmentsthat can be carried out in
substantially different ways may beprocuredunder contracts awardedusingQuality Based

Consultants Qualifications (SBCQ) by comparing the qualificationof consultants who have
expressedan interest inthejob or who havebeen identified.Individualconsultants willbe
selectedinaccordancewith SectionV ofthe Guidelines. Services for tasks that meet the
requirements ofparagraphs 3.8 to 3:11ofthe consultant' Guidelines maybe awardedusingthe
Single Source Selectionmethod. Services for which a team of Consultants are not requiredand
meet all the requirements set forth inparagraph 5.01 of the Consultant Guidelinesshall be
procured under contracts awardedto individualconsultant inaccordancewiththe provisions of
paragraphs5.1 through 5.3 o fthe Consultants Guidelines

B.      Assessment of the agency's capacity to implement procurement

Procurement activities will be carried out by The EthiopianInformationand Communication
Technology Development Authority (EICTDA). EICTDA i s a rather new organization
establishedin2003. A draft organization structure hasbeen developed for the Authority. The
Director for the Authority hasbeenassignedandit i s anticipated that additional staff would be
assigned from other Government offices andemployed as requiredas per the organization
structure inthe near future. At the time ofthe appraisal none o fthe keypositions with the
exception o fthe Director were filled. Itwas therefore not possible to conduct a comprehensive
capacity assessment.

As perthe agreementreachedduringthe pre-appraisal adraft procurement manualhasbeen
preparedby anInternational consultant. Themanualwill bereviewedandfinalized asperthe
final program ofthe projectbefore effectiveness.

Two Procurement staffwill be employed inthe Project Management Unit(PMU). The
advertisement for the employment o fthe procurement officer andother P M Ustaffhasbeen
issued and applications have beenreceived for the positions. The best qualified candidatewill be
selectedand employed usingthe PPF funds for the project andprior to project effectiveness.
Dependingon the qualificationofthe persons appointedfor the positions appropriate training
may be givento the individuals either locallyor at Regional (ESAMIor GIMPA) training
centers. Ifit is not possible to get an adequatelyqualifiedperson then the useo f consultants for
short periodo ftime duringthe initial phaseo fthe project will be considered. The consultant can
inadditionto performingprocurement activities act as amentor for the procurement specialist.

Inorder to insurethat thereis acomprehensiveunderstandingofprocurementprocesseswithin
the organization an orientation training will be givento all staff that would be involvedinthe
procurement decision makingprocess includingmanagers, tender committee membersand
departmentheads. The Orientation will be conducted through a short term Consultant.

The overall project risk for procurement i s high.

1. PROJECTIMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS


All procurement for the projectwillbehandledbythe PMUunder the ICTDA. ThePMUwillbe
responsible for the day-to-day procurement activities including preparation o fprocurementplans
andtender documents, processing o fbids andproposals, evaluation o ftenders, preparationo f
contracts and contract management. The PMUwill employ two staffs to handle these activities, a
Procurement Specialist and a Junior Procurement Officer. For highly specialized goods,
preparation o f specifications andtechnical evaluation o f offers will be done by external
consultants or the office for which the goods are beingpreparedifit has the necessary capacity.

A tender committee comprisingo faminimumo ffive members will be formed specifically for
the project. Three members o f the committee will be from the PIUandwill include the
Procurement Specialist and the Financial Management Officer. The tender committee will have
two additional members on a permanent basis fiom the PMUor other departments. Butthese
members can be replacedbyrepresentative o fthe enduser to ensure that the procurement
complies with the needs o f the user. At least two members o f the tender committee should have
adequate knowledge about the procurement process that needs to be followed. The final decision
makers for the procurement activities will be defined inthe procurement manual.

Procurement related activities like inspection o f goods, andlogistics support will be handledby
the respective departments o f ICTDA. The procurement manual will define the procedures to be
followed.

C. ProcurementPlan

The Borrower, at appraisal, developed a ProcurementPlanfor project implementationwhich
provides the basis for the procurementmethods. Subsequent changes agreedbetween the
Borrower andthe Project Team have requiredmodifications to this Plan, which are expected to
be incorporated inthe planbythe Borrower and submittedto the Bankprior to Effectiveness.
The final ProcurementPlanwill bemade available on the Web. Itwill also be available inthe
Project's database and on the Bank's externalwebsite. The Procurement Planwill be updated in
agreement with the Project Team annually or as requiredto reflect the actual project
implementation needs andimprovements ininstitutional capacity.

D. FrequencyofProcurementSupervision

Inadditionto the priorreview supervisionto becarriedout fromBankoffices, the capacity
assessment o f the ImplementingAgency has recommendedbi-annual supervision missions to
visit the field to carry out post review o fprocurement actions.

              Annex 9: RuralConnectivityViability andCostRecovery Options


 ETHIOPIA: Informationand CommunicationTechnologyAssistedDevelopmentProject

Themain focus of ICTADis on creation ofanenabling ICTpolicy, legalandregulatory
framework, and strengtheningo fthe institutions that can play a key role inthis process. These
include the EthiopianICT Development Authority, Ethiopian Telecommunications Agency,
EthiopianBroadcasting Agency, andthe Institute for Telecommunications andInformation
Technology. The secondcomponent o fthe project i s focusing on creating practical opportunities
that foster growth o f demandfrom below, andincreasethe need for removalo fpolicy, legal and
regulatory bottlenecks.

For example, the Rural Connectivityinitiative i s focusing onprovisionof communitylevel
connectivity to residents o funder-servedor un-served areas throughintroductionof last-mile
connectivity options. To demonstratethe viability o fthese options andtheir cost effectiveness,
atypical scenario i s describedbelow.

Return on Investment

Thevast differentialbetweenEthiopianteledensity and globallyobservednorms ofteledensity
suggests that there is significant suppresseddemandfor telecommunications services. Insuch
circumstances, demandi s often price sensitive and elastic. Ethiopia's teledensity of about .90 i s
so low (far below UNLDC, Sub-SaharanAfrica andHIPC averages), that almost any
appropriately located and scaledtelecommunications services provider can succeedbecauseof
the substitution effect relative to other, less efficient meansto transmit andreceive information.

Ethiopia, while poor, i s a supply-constrained market for telecommunications. This i s shownby
theprice sensitivityo fdemand for telecommunications there. Thereforms andactivities
proposed inICTAD, by initiating the process o fcreating competitive markets, will likelyresult
inlowerprices for telecommunications services, thusgenerating increaseddemand,

Lack o f access to basic telephone service carries considerable costs. There are numerous case
studies documenting the prohibitivecosts paidby society when rural andperi-urbanresidents are
deniedaccess to telephone service. For example, the World Bank's World Development Report
1994, Infrastructure for Development, states that studies inColombia andthe Philippineshave
shown that the ratio of productivitygains arisingthrough the use of telephoneservice
exceeds the annualcost of providingserviceby at least20:l for businesses.

Inanotherexample,astudyoftheGrameenVillagePhoneprograminBangladeshdetailedsome
o f the economic benefits achieved by introducingphones into villages. According to this study,
the cost of a typical trip from a village to the capital city amounts to almost two to eight times the
cost o fa singlephone call. And according to this study, a single phone call from a family
memberinthe capital cityto the village can generateaconsumer surplusbetween3.64% to 9.8%

Community consultations carried out by the U S NationalTelecommunications Cooperatives
Association (NTCA) inruralNigeriaelicited similar examples. Communities surveyedreported
that they would benefitfrom telecommunication services innumerous ways. These benefits can
begrouped into five generalcategories:
            Reducedtransport cost and time
            Marketinformationfor buyingandselling;
            Reducedisolationfiom the outside world;
            Job creatiodtrainingkeduced rural out-migration;
            Access to information about health, agricultural and environmental management.

CostRecovery Model

Inatypicalscenario,ifthereare3000community-phonesprovidedatacostofaboutUSD
2,660,000, the recovery rate of the network basedon a 30-minutes use of eachphone per day i s
(assuming nonprofit mode o fbusiness):

$2.66 milcost / (3000 POTS services X 60 months x 30 days x 0.5 hours per day average
utilization) =$2.66 million / (2.7 millionhours) = $0.99 per hour minimumrecoveryrate, or
0.14 EthiopianBirrper minute(assuming 1USD= 8.5 EthiopianBirr).

This i s a very reasonablerate comparedto what ETC i s charging for phone calls inthe greater
Addis Ababa area. Provisionofaccessto intemetwillrequire anadditional investmentcost

Estimated Costper Line

Dueto lack o f supporting infrastructure (electricity, roads), Ethiopia is consideredto be a high
cost environment, with a cost per line ofUSD 1000per fixed-wireless line, andUSD 1,200 -
2,000 o f extending fixed-line serviceto remote areas. Extension ofmobile services will likelybe
cheaper, but i s not normally calculated inaper line basis. More important to consider is the fact
that, as a result o f Ethiopia's extremely low teledensity, there i s ample potential for the kindo f
projects suggestedunder the connectivity program that hasbeenoutlinedinthe report. However,
some fundamentals are still lacking: policy mustbe developed inorder to move firmly, a sound
andreliable regulatory framework must also develop. ETC has ambitious networkbackbone
planswhich include roll-out ofbroadband andmultimediaaccess capacity, yet from apolicy
perspective, universal access to voice and some basic form o ftext email shouldbe a priority,
 followedbythe morebroadbandintensive applications. Ethiopia's universality approach should
 aim not only at rural andremote areas, but also at urbanand semi-urban areas, which are
 agonizing for more connectivity andremain inmost cases surprisinglyisolated.

 The opportunity to enhanceeconomic growth, as a result ofmore informationand
 communication resources, inkey areas like tourism, exports o f agricultural and some
nonagricultural products i s enormous. There i s ahuge marketpotentialthat will easilyjustify

investment inthe short term, although more detailed assessmentsthanthose carried out to date
will becomenecessary.

Beneficiaries

Ethiopiahas inadequatetelecommunications infrastructure andlow penetration o fbasic
telecommunication services, especially in-but not confined to -rural communities inevery
regionsurveyed. The telecommunications deficit appearsendemic nationwide outside ofthe
capital. Therefore, the potential beneficiaries comprise a vast cross-section o f the entire
Ethiopianpopulation. The specific number benefitingfrom the initialprogram will dependon
the communities selected.

The ICTADRuralConnectivity component will provide accessto about 3000 community
phones, withina coverage areao f about 100,000 square kilometers.

Scalability

The proposed extensionso fconnectivity are basedonbackbonenetwork expansionplans of
ETC. As such, they are scalableto the extent that infrastructure exists to support them. In
addition to the WoredaNet and SchoolNet programs, ETC i s inthe processofconstructing a
200,000 line capacity expansions o fits mobilenetwork for Addis Ababa and 12regional centers.
Part o fthis expansion is complete andthe services are already available. ETC is also inthe
process o fprocuringa 350,000 line fixed-line capacity expansion, which is reported to have
recently beencontracted.

Thetechnology associatedwith the ruralpilots is modular andas suchcanbereadily expanded.
The extent of suchscalability willbe affectedbymorethantechnical factors, however, with one
ofthe principal limiting factors beingthe ability o f communities to provide trained personnelfor
managementandtechnical positions inlocaltelecommunications enterprises.

Similar Successful Examples

As the Bank's RapidResponsePolicy Unithaswritten, "Competitive, private-led marketshave
shown they can go a longway towards makingtelecommunications services available
throughout the population, but gaps remain. Cost-effective measuresto achieve widespread
access to services thus focus primarilyon removingobstacles that preventmarkets from working
well. Nonetheless, what privateoperating companies are preparedto do on commercial terms
alone typically does not quite suffice to achieve what governments seek for economic, social,
regional, cultural, or other development reasons. Rural andremote localities, as well as low-
income urbanhouseholds andthe disabled, tendto lag, especially inthe poorer countries."

Two nations inthe Sub-SaharanAfrican region, South Africa andNigeria, have implemented, or
planto implement,national informationandcommunication technology strategiesinvolving
universal funds and/or agencies. A third, Uganda, has embarked uponsuch a planthat is
integratedwith sector liberalizationand a comprehensive national development framework.
These initiatives are each fundedby assessments on operating revenuesof licensed

telecommunications operators. Beyond that, they vary interms of their goals, mechanisms of
operation, andimpact on universal access intheir respective countries.

Worldwide, various models have been employed for management ofuniversal access funds. In
Colombia andthe Philippines, for example, the relevant government ministries administer the
funds. More commonly, the telecommunications regulator manages the fund, as inBrazil, Chile,
India, Nepal, Peru, andUganda. South Africa has created a separate agency to administer its
universal access fund (similarly, inthe United States, the universal service loan fund is
administered by a sub-agency ofthe agriculture department). Also, fundmanagement and
administration can be delegated to the private sector (Australia andthe United States manage
their universal service operating subsidies inthis manner).

Reasonsfor consideringan output based subsidy, low interest loan, or similar incentivesto
assist Community TelephoneServiceProviders

Experience inthe U.S. andelsewhere has shown that, ingeneral, it is important to distinguish
between rural andunder-served areas served by dominant PTO's (who conduct the bulkoftheir
business elsewhere), and rural andunder-served areas served by small telecommunications
providers based inthe community. Historically, these small, community-based
telecommunications providers (whether co-ops or investor-owned), have done a betterjob than
have large companies of achieving universal voice telephone service, despite obstacles of serving
areas with lower population densities and lower income levels. This historical success has been
achieved through a system of explicit subsidies and implicit support to small telecommunications
providers. The output based subsidy or a low interest loan option or a similar incentive
mechanism would be important because the capital markets inEthiopia are not structured to offer
credit on terms customary or usual inthe telecommunications industry or its sub-sectors; i.e.,
commercial terms are not patient enough relative to global industry benchmarks for ROI,
liquidityof the development bankisnot sufficient to fundcapital intensive telecom projects, and
risk premiums are too highfor utility sector investments.
