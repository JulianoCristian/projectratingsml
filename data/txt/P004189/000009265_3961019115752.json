The project was designed\n            to: a) carry out repairs and maintenance of Highway 13 in\n            the provinces of Savannakhet, Saravanne and Champassak; b)\n            strengthen the maintenance capacity of the three provincial\n            Road and Bnrdge Maintenance Societies (RBMSs); and c)\n            complete studies for future transport development.\n            Bank's performance was satisfactory. Overall\n            implementation by the Borrower was satisfactory. The main\n            lessonst o be drawn from the experienceo f implementationo f\n            the project were: (i) that the complex and time consuming\n            government administrative and procurement procedures\n            involved with ICB procurement should have been anticipated\n            and that technicala ssistance shouldh ave been consideredt o\n            supplement he Borrower's weak institutional capacity;\n            (ii) that more authority should be delegated to the line\n            ministry to manage the project, particularly with regard to\n            disbursement matters; (iii) thatt he implementationp rocess\n            helped to evolvea prototype of an acceptable and possibly a\n            sustainable approach to privatization of the construction\n            sector in the country; and (iv) that the basis of future\n            cumulative progress in the sector should be based on careful\n            planning of the next phase, based on a clear assessment of\n            what is absorbed by those involved in the implementation process."}, "docdt": "1995-06-19T00:00:00Z"}
