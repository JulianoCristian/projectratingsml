    planning and executing road maintenance on a continuing\n            basis.  To that end, it includes: (a) spot improvements of\n            the existing pavement and drainage systems including\n            bridges, on about 270 km of Route 13 in Savannakhet,\n            Saravane and Champassak provinces; and (b) procurement of\n            road maintenance and mechanical workshop equipment, bridge\n            panels and construction materials.  The project further\n            provides (c) consultant services to assist in procurement\n            and project implementation and also to carry out a series of\n            transport improvement and project preparation studies.  The\n            principal benefits of the project will arise from the\n            savings in vehicle operating costs due to road improvements."}, "docdt": "1987-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
