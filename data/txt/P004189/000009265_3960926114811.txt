LAO PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
SOUTHERN TRANSPORT PROJECT
Credit and Project Summary
Borrower:             Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR)
Beneficiary:          Ministry of Transport and Posts
Amount:               SD!k 11.1 million (US$14.1 million equivalent)
Terms:                Standard IDA, with a maturity of 40 years
Project Description:  The project is primarily intended to support a program
of repairs and maintenance for an economically critical
road section and to strengthen capabilities for planning
and executing road maintaince on a continuing basis. It
will include: (a) spot improvements of the existing
pavement and drainage systems including bridges, on
about 270 km of Route 13 in Savannakhet, Saravane and
Champassak provinces; (b) procurement of road main-
tenance and mechanical workshop equipment, bridge panels
and construction materials; and (c) consultant services
to assist in procurement and project implementation and
also to carry out a series of transport improvement and
project preparation studies.
The principal benefits of the project would arise from
the savings in vehicle operating costs due to road
improvements. There may be some risk of delays in
implementation due to the use of ICB. To minimize this
risk, appropriate consultants assistance is included in
the project and IDA assistance and supervision will also
be provided in all stages. It is unlikely that traffic
growth will be lower than estimated since road transport
is at such an early stage of development in Lao PDR and
also because there is no better transport alternative in
the project area. The risk is, therefore, very low that
the rate of return will fall below the estimate.

LAO PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
SOUTHERN TRANSPORT PROJECT
I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. Economic Setting
1.L       The Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) is a landlocked
countu with an area of about 236,000 km and a population of about 3.6 mil-
lion.,   It extends over 1,700 km north to south and from 100 to 400 km east
to west. The country's borders touch Burma and China in the north, Kampuchea
in the south, Vietnam in the east, and Thailand in the west. The Mekong river
flows either through, or forms the western border with Thailand for virtually
the entire north to south length of the country. About 80% of the area of Lao
PDR is mountainous, with heights ranging from 200 m to 3,000 m. As a result
of this rugged terrain, and long intercity distances, internal and external
communications are difficult and costly. Vientiane, the capital of the
country, is the largest city and is populated by 381,000 inhabitants. Three
of the five provinces comprising the southern part of the country have
substantial populations--Savannakhet, 549,000; Champassak, 407,000; and
Saravane. 189,000.
1.2       Lao PDR is one of the poorest countries in tpe world.  It had a per
capita (jross Domestic Product (GDP) of US$135 in 1985.-/ The economy is
dominated by agriculture, mainly subsistence rice farming which employs about
85X of the labor force. The agriculture sector accounts for over 60X of GDP
and for a significant percentage of export earnings from timber and coffee
production. This sector also provides the basis for agro-industries, such as
sawmills, rice mills and wood processing factories, and generates the most
demand for transport services. The country's shortages of skilled human
resources, its landlocked position, and inadequate internal and external
communications networks are major constraints to economic development.
B. Transport System Characteristics
1.3       In 1985, the transport system of Lao PDR comprised 12,983 km of
roads, the 1,150-km navigable section of the Mekong River, three major river
ports, a small gasoline supply pipeline from Vietnam, a number of smaller
provincial and municipal ports, one international airport, and about 12 small
airfields. the country does not have any railroads, but a study of rail links
from the potentially rich iron ore fields in the northeastern province of
Xieng Khouang to the port of Vinh in Vietnam is included in the Government's
long-term plans. The geographic coverage of the country by the road and river
network (30 km/1,000 km ) is very low by international standards.
1/ Government estimates, to be interpreted with caution because the data
base is inadequate.



-2 -
1.4       The major mode of internal communication is road transport, which
carried about 85% of freight traffic (ton-km) and passenger traffic (pass-km)
in 1985. The highway network connects the main provincial centers, but the
quality of roads is extremely poor and many key road sections are impassable
during the rainy season. Two main routes serve i.nports and exports. One is
Route 9, linking the South China Sea port of Danang in V`.etnam and
Savannakhet, from which most imports continue to Vientiane via the :iekong
River or Route 13. The other route links Thai road and rail routes from
Bangkok to Vientiane via the Nong Kai/Thanaleng crossing of the Mekong
River.
C. Transport Trends
1.5       Transport sector growth during 198C-84 averaged a~2but 7.2% per year,
which was somewhat higher than GDP growth of 5.0% per year.-   However,
transport activity remained low because of demand derived almost entirely from
agriculture, which itself is at subsistence levels. The relationship between
transport and agriculture in the national economy is shown in Table 1.1.
Except for coffee, logs, and forest products, most agricultural production has
not been significantly commercialized. As a result, over 80% of cargo genera-
ted in 1983 (Table 1.2) came from only a few commodities, including logs (29Z
of total tonnage), rice (13%), gypsum (13%), fuel and lubricant imports (13%),
and sawn wood (9%). About 50% of the estimated 437,000 tons of cargo genera-
ted was from domestic production for local use, 17% from exports, and 33% from
imports.
1.6       Traffic patterns vary with each commodity.  Timber is produced in
most orovinces and generates both long and short haul transport demands.
Gypsuw. is from a single source (Savannakhet) and is carried to a single
destination (Vietnam). Rice is transported mainly from surplus areas in the
Southern Provinces of Savannakhet, Saravane, and Champassak to deficit areas
in the Northern Provinces via Route 13 and/or the Mekong River. Tables 1.3
and 1.4 contain further freight and passenger transport statistics, respec-
tively, during 1976-85.
D. Investments
1.7       Total Government investment increased from about 19.1% of GDP in
1971 to about 25% of CDP in 1985. The transport sector's share of this
investment averaged about 30% per year during 1981-85. This means transport
investments reached 7.5% of GDP, which is high by international standards. In
the recent past, most investments were directed toward building a new road
(Route 9) from Savannakhet to the Vietnam border as part of the link to the
port of Danang. This road will be completed in late 1988 but Government
emphasis has started to shift to the rehabilitation of economically viable
sections of the badly deteriorated highway network and of selected ports
(para. 1.13).
2/   Government estimates.



- 3 -
1.8       Continued large investments in transport will be needed in the
coming decade to sustain economic development in the country. Therefore, the
Government has earmarked over 251 of planned investments during the Second
Five-Year Plan (1986-90) for the transport sector. Most investments will be
for roads. Table 1.5 provides further details about proposed investments for
1986-90, together with expenditures in 1981-85.
E. Ports and River Transport
1.9       Port facilities and river transport services are almost entirely
concentrated on the navigable section of the Mekong River, which extends about
1,150 km from Luang Prabang in the north to Savannakhet in the south. The
most important segment is the 435-km link from Vientiane to Savannakhet, over
which substantial cargo traffic moves. This segment completes the road/river
link from Danang to Vientiane. It also parallels and complements Route 13,
especially in the wet season when the road is virtually impassable. 'n 1985,
freight traffic in the corridor from Vientiane to Savannakhet was about 63,000
tons, of which about 68% was transported by road and 32% by river. An addi-
tional 30,000-40,000 tons of freight is expected by 1990 to be transferred
from road to river transport at Savannakhet to complete the journey to
Vientiane. Therefore, the river link could carry 50% of the 100,000 tons/year
of freight estimated to use this corridor by 1990.
1.10      River transport services are provided by both the Government fleet
and the individually owned boat fleet. The Government fleet includes one 30-
ton, seven 100-ton, and four 140-ton barges, one 200 ton barge, two 226-
passenger steel boats, two 120 passenger wooden boats and two fuel barges
operating largely on the Vientiane-Savannakhet segment of the Mekong River.
Government barges are mostly constructed of steel, top loaded, and propelled
by modern pusher units. Individual ownership of boats is *,ermitted by the
Government when operations are under the rules of an association. Most boatta
are small, wooden, self-propelled units which provide mixed passenger and
freight services at small river ports. Individually owned boats are the river
equivalent of passenger and freight pickup truck operations on the road.
Their freight and passenger transport rates are set by the Government and seem
to be high enough to yield adequate profits to the individual operators.
1.11      The ports or Laksi and lhanaleng at Vientiane and Keng Kabao near
Savannakhet serve the major river cargo traffic. Laksi (4 km from Vientiane)
currently serves domestic river traffic including traffic from Keng Kabao
(which mostly originates from Danang), while Thanaleng serves cross-river
traffic from Nong Kai in Thailand. Laksi has a single concrete-paved ramp to
accommodate river fluctuations together with a mobile crane for cargo
handling. It can handle about 50,000 tons of cargo/year. Thanaleng al0so is a
concrete-paved ramp operation with two ferries shuttling mostly trucks and
some passengers between the Lao and Thai sides of the Kekong River. Thanaler.g
has the most extensive equipment, space, and warehouses of any port in the
country, and it can handle about 100,000 tons of cargo/year. Keng Kabao is a
rew river barge port, which is intended to serve as a transit point for
imports from and exports to Vietnam and the port of Danang. Construction
there started in 1979 and was completed in late 1986. Keng Kabao has an
testimated cargo handling capacity of about 200,000 tons/year.

F. Highways
1.12      Details about the highway subsector are described in Chapter II.
G. Transport PoliLy and Objectives for the 1980s
1.13      The transport development policy as expressed in the Second Five-
Year Plan (1986-90) includes restoration of vital sections of the transport
network and provision of improved transport services. Its priority objectives
for the transport sector have been to open an alternate east/west link (Route
9) to the sea from Savannakhet through Vietnam to the port of Danang and also
to rehabilitate thG north-south axis (Route 13) from Luang Prabang to Pakse as
well as other roads that support agricultural production. Specifically, road
development is now focused on: (a) maintaining, rehabilitating, and upgrading
to all-weather standards the key stretches of Route 13 and other roads linking
agricultural producing areas with deficit regions; (b) rehabilitating and
constructing rural access roads in agricultural areas; and (c) iproving the
maintenance capability of central and provincial organizations.-   Selected
ports on the Mekong River also will be improved to handle increased cargo.
H. The Association's Role in the Sector
1.14      The Association's dialogue with the Lao PDR Government concerning
transport policy improvements evolved in the context of preparation of the
last Country Economic Memorandum (Report No. 6070-LA of July 1986) and a
Transport Sector Note (Report No. 6419-LA of September 1986). In accordance
with the recommendations of these reports, dialogue will focus on: (a) iden-
tification of the size of the network that is economically justified for
restoration; (b) management of the transport system, including policy
planning, coordination, and pricing; and (c) selection of appropriate
technologies for the transport infrastructure and the vehicle fleet. The
Association's strategy for the transport sector includes improvements in:
(a) road maintenance, (b) construction skills and techniques, (c) trucking
productivity, and (d) intermodal transport.
3/   The ADB has been actively supporting road rehabilitation and maintenance
projects in Lao PDR. The first project (FY83) focussed on rehabilitating
Route 10 in the Vientiane plain and is almost completed. The second
project (FY87) has recently become effective and includes rehabilitation
of Routes 13a and 20 in Champassak and Saravane provinces. A third
project (FY88) for improvements to Route 13 north of Vientiane has been
prepared and was appraised in August 1987. Also feasibility studies
covering part of Route 13 south and most of the key provincial roads in
Champassak and Saravane provinces will start in mid-FY88; the rehabilita-
tion of these roads will form the fourth ADB project (FY90). In all
cases the UNDP has funded, or agreed to fund, most of the technical
assistance requirements.

II. THE HIGHkWAY SUBSECTOR
A. Network
2.1       In 1985, the network comprised about 12,983 km of roads classj ied
as national (2,460 km), provincial (6,278 km), and district (4,245 km)._   By
definition, national (primary) roads interconnect provincial centers and
provide direct access to neighboring countries or to places of major domestic
importance. Provincial (secondary) roads provide the main link to the
national network within each province and carry the bulk of the traffic.
District (local) roads facilitate inter-village communications, farm-to-market
access, and natural resource development. The responsibility for construc-
tion, design standards, and maintenance cf each road class is relatively well
defined (paras. 2.15-2.17 and 2.20-2.21).
2.2       Most roads in the central and southern regions of Lao PDR have
deteriorated or been damaged to such an extent that they provide only dry-
weather access for vehicles. Many gravel surfaced roads and all of the earth
roads, which together comprise about 85% of the classified system, are in very
poor condition. After the first rains of the wet season, they are generally
unusable for three to four months. In the dry season, traffic can negotiate
the right-of-way only at low load levels and, even then, only by driver and
crew initiative in local rut-filling and by detours onto and even off the
shoulders.
2.3       However, the network was originally built to adequate standards for
colonial administrative functions and economic development could proceed
without reconstructing all of it. Hence, the Government's -,rogram (para.
1.13) includes the strengthening, rehrOilitation and maintenance of only the
core, economically important segments of the network.
B. Traf.ic Growth and Characteristics
2.4       In gene-.al, traffic volumes are estimated to be quite low.  Except
for major segments of Route 13, no accurate traffic counts are available for
national or provincial roads. However, based on the movement of aoods into
the country and between provinces, traffic estimates (in 1986) were: (a) for
national roads, 60-150 vehicles per day (vpd); (b) for provincial roads, 20-60
vpd; and (c) for district roads, less than 20 vpd.
2.5       Traffic growth has been modest (about 5-7% per annum), mainly
because of the nature of the economy, the poor condition of most roads, and
the low demand for trade. However, this situation is expected to change as
increased commercialization of the economy generates more demand for transport
services. Assurances were obtained from the Government during negotiations
4/   These figures actually represent the old, colonial network; the current
useable network is less than 30% of the lengths given here.



- 6 -
that traffic counts will be carried out annually on Route 13 between Vientiane
and Pakse and also between Vientiane and Luang Prabang, so as to facilitate
planning for future development.
C. Vehicle Fleet
2.6       Trucks and utility vehicles, dominate the vehicle fleet.  Few
passenger cars appear outside cities, and interprovincial passenger travellers
must have travel permits.  Very few buses exist, but they are supplemented by
trucks used for passenger movements.  Imports of vehicles are partially
restricted but, since 1985, imports are allowed by holders of adequate foreign
exchange.
2.7       In 1984, the total registered truck fleet consisted of 5,068 medium
and heavy trucks.  The fleet had developed mostly as a result of the Govern-
ment's program under the Five-Year Plan (1981-85) for imports of trucks, which
increcsed 10% per annum over the period.  Because most of the fleet has been
provided through bilateral a.jd other foreign aid, makes from all over the
world proliferate, with Soviet and Japanese equipment dominant.
2.8       The vehicle composition of State Trucking Company No. 1 in Vientiane
is typical of that in a state enterprise (para. 2.9 and Table 2.1). About 95%
of the fleet is Soviet-made, with the remainder Japanese-made. Soviet-made
5-ton trucks provide 42% of available fleet capacity. A fairly large propor-
tion of the fleet (28X) is made up of 16- and 20-ton vehicles. Of the 614
vehicles owned by the company, 525 (86%) actually were available for use at
most times in 1985. The operation of Company No. 2 in Savannakhet is similar
but somewhat smaller.
D. Trucking Industry
2.9       The industry is divided into state enterprises, autonomous opera-
tions, and individual enterprises organized into state-controlled associa-
tions. State enterprises handle most organized road transport, while indivi-
dual enterprises handle commercial activities. State enterprises are orga-
nized geographically around the four major urban areas. The largest are State
Trucking Companies Nos. 1 and 2 located at Vientiane and Savannakhet, respec-
tively. Much smaller units are located at Luang Prabang and Pakse. These
companies are managed and operated by MOTP employees and enter into annual
contracts with ministries and state enterprises that require transport
services.
2.10      Autonomous operations have evolved to satisfy specialized require-
ments and needs of state enterprises for close control over some movements.
Thus the Ministry of Commerce, which is responsible for warehousing and
distribution of fuel and building materials, contracts with state trucking
enterprises for most transport services but has its own fleet of about 120
fuel tankers. State entergrise logging operations also have their own
vehicles for carrying logs to sawmills.
2.11      Individual enterprises are organized into associations that are
regulated and controlled, partly through vehicle import restrictions,



- 7 -
Government rate-setting, and the supply of subsidized petroleum products.
Individual enterprise trucks fulfill the following functions:  (a) providing
most services at the end of the logistics chain in Luang Prabang and Pakse
while state enterprise t-ucks concentrate on Vientiane and Savannakhet;
(b) providing valuable short-haul passenger and small-goods movements from
farm to market, and (c) serving as a back-up for state enterprises and
autonomous operations when temporary shortages or breakdowns occur.
Previously most goods purchased by the Government or state enterprises, e.g.,
rice, timber, and coffee, moved in state enterprise trucks at official
rates. However, in the case of timber, this rule is now frequently relaxed to
enable the use of individual enterprise trucks because they are more efficient
and state logging operations have difficulty maintaining their trucking
fleets.
2.12      Truck utilization, as confirmed by an axle-load survey in 1985, is
very low. North of Vientiane, one-third of the trucks weighed were empty.
This situation was attributed to unbalanced traffic flows and empty backhauls
typical of own-account operations. More important were the findings that for
a two-axle truck the average load was 2.7 tons whereas the load capacity was
5.5 tons. This yielded a load factor of only 49% which, combined with a 67%
loaded truck percentage, yielded a 33% two-way load factor. South of
Vientiane loaded two-axle trucks carried only 2 tons on the average or 36% of
their capacity. When combined with a 93% loaded truck percentage, a 34% two-
way load factor resulted. Underloading is highly unusual for low Lncome
developing countries, where overloading is the norm.
2.13      An important point which emerged from the Transport Sector Note
(Report No. 6419-LA) was the need to increase the utilization of trucks. The
main reason for the low utilization is the poor road conditions prevailing in
the country which made operators reluctant to load trucks fully. The road
improvements planned under the project will therefore help to increase truck
utilization significantly.
E. Vehicle Operating Costs and Tariffs
2.14      Given the low productivity of trucks and the poor condition of
roads, trucking line haul costs are about double normal levels. Official
trucking tariffs, which vary according to road condition and goods type, were
updated in June 1985. However, given the price and cost distortions in the
economy, the effects of the higher tariffs on the financial status of various
firms are not known. Nevertheless, because individual enterprises continue to
repair and operate their vehicles, the implication is that costs are being
covered. The reasons seem to be twofold. First, dealings with market whole-
salers for delivery of consumer goods from the Thailand border or to regional
market centers seem to be outside the official tariff structure. Second, even
when carrying state-owned goods at official tariffs, individual enterprise
trucks carry other goods and some passengers in the same vehicle. Tables 2.2
and 2.3 provide data on freight and passenger transport tariffs, respectively.

F. Administration
2.15      Roads and road transport, together with river transport, are the
respoasibilty of the Ministry of Transport and Posts (MOTP). The MOTP has
seven technical departments, each headed by a director, in charge of:
communications projects; roads, bridges, and river quays; statistics and
inventory; construction planning 6nd control; personnel and administration;
equipment; and major projects. The department for construction planning and
control has direct authority over the various provincial societies for road
and bridge maintenarce. The MOTP also has directorates for vehicle
registration and for river and port planning. In addition, there is a
Division in the State Planning Committee (SPC) which liases with MOTP and is
responsible for transport planning (Chart 1).
2.16      The MOTP gives general policy direction and support to provincial
transport departments. It issues nationwide policies and regulations, spe-
cifying construction standards and providing technical support to all road and
river transport entities. The MOTP also controls the pool of manpower and
construction equipment of the two national construction societies and mobil-
izes them to implement major projects countrywide. In addition, it controls
the provincial construction societies by providing the bulk of their work and
appointing their key personnel.
2.17      The MOTP determines highway design standards (Table 2.4).  Standards
presently in effect are considered to be adequste for the design and upkeep of
the low traffic volume roads predominanL in Lao PDR. The MOTP's design and
survey offices are responsible for designing virtually all roads. Assurances
were obtained from the Government during negotiations that improvement of the
project road will be in accordance with agreed design standards.
C. Planning, Budgeting, and Financing
-.18      The MOTP and the SPC are responsible for overall planning of the
country's highway network. Execution of some works is periodically delegated
to the provinces. An annual review of construction, maintenance, and trans-
portation is carried out by the SPC's Planning Allocation Committee. There is
a five-year road investment plan which calls for the upgrading of most primary
roads to asphalt pavement. A program also has been drawn up to import
vehicles for the state trucking enterprises (para. 2.7).
2.19      The MOTP, provincial governments, and the Ministry of Finance
together establish national investment priorities and budgetary requirements
for the transport sector. User charges (Table 2.5) produce enough revenues to
cover annual road maintenance requirements, as the following data for 1982-86
show:



- 9 -
Item                           1982    1983    1984    1985    1986
-- (KN mln) --------
User-charge revenues                   95.0   110.2   125.6   147.1   216.4
Maintenance requirements               67.4    85.2   110.7   145.0   165.0
Annual surplus                         27.6    25.0    14.9       2.1    514
The real financing constraint arises from the fact that the annual surplus can
cover only a small portion of the investment needs. The major part of
investment funding should therefore come from national and provincial general
budgetary allocations, foreign grants and loans. Projects which are
implemented with foreign assistance are usually assigned a high budgetary
priority.
H. Construction and Maintenance
2.20      Construction of roads and bridges is normally done by force account
by the construction societies attached to the MOTP and the provinces. The
total national implementation capacity by force account is estimated at about
100 km/year of paved roads and 250 km/year of gravel roads. Implementation
capacity is limited by the poor condition of the equipment and lack of skilled
laborers and other workers. The project will help to improve implementation
capacity substantially by strengthening and fully equipping the Road and
Bridge Maintenance Societies (RBMS) at Savannakhet, Saravane, and Champassak
provinces (para. 3.12). In addition, a Technical Support Team (TST) will be
employed under the project to assist the MOTP with the project implementation
(para. 3.7). The combination of better equipment and technical support will
render the RBMS fully capable of implementing the project on schedule.
2.21      Maintenance of roads and bridges is also the responsibility of the
MOTP. In the past, roads were not maintained adequately mainly because con-
struction had been accorded priority in the allocation of available funds and
also because of the lack of a properly designed maintenance program. The
latter need will be addressed by the pilot maintenance program included in the
ADB's second road improvement project. The pilot study will help prepare a
five-year program for road maintenance, including identifying requirements for
annual budgetary allocations and the formulation of action plans. During
negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government that it will
progressively increase maintenance funding to cover expenditure on newly
rehabilitated roads in the project provinces.
I. Staff Training
2.22      Skilled and experienced field engineers, conatruction supervisors,
technicians, and mechanics staff the MOTP and the PDTPs but they are in short
supply. This is noticeable at the level of field-management, senior
supervisors for construction and maintenance, and technicians for quality
control and workshops.



- 10 -
2.23      There is a need for training and upgrading employee MOTP capabili-
ties, especially for maintenance implementation. The proposed project is
desigated to address this need through on-the-job training in road repairs and
maintenance techniques. Provision of this on-the-job training will be one of
the functions of the Technical Support Team (TST) which will be supervising
project implementation. Terms of reference for the TST are in Annex 1.
J. Safety
2.24      The low geometric and surface standards of most roads in Lao PDR are
not conducive to safe vehicle operations. However, current traffic levels are
so low that safety is only a minor concern at this time.
K. Government Policy and Objectives for the 1980s
2.25      The emphasis in Government policy for the highway subsector is
shifting to maintenance and rehabilitation as well as the reconstruction of
key links in the network. The MOTP now intends to have programs for construc-
tion and maintenance proceed simultLaeously with a program for improvement in
management of the road transport industry. The objective would be to lower
all transport costs, including those for construction, maintenance, invest-
ments, and vehicle operations.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Formulation and Rationale
3.1       In July 1985, the Head of the SPC proposed to the Association a
number of roads for possible financing. The Association responded, and the
Government agreed, that the roads be examined in the context of preparation of
the Country Economic Memorandum (para. 1.14) and the Transport Sector Note
(Report No. 6419-LA) to facilitate appropriate sector analysis and identifica-
tion of high priority projects. The rehabilitation of Route 13 in the
Savannakhet, Saravane and Champassak Provinces was recommended as a priority
project in the Transport Sector Note. An IDA identification mission visited
Lao PDR in July/August 1986 and the project was appraised in March 1987.
3.2       The Government has increased the capacity of the provinces to carry
out the maintenance on the heaviest travelled sections of Rou-e 13, which
connect cities and agricultural areas, by providing more resources. This is
in line with the strategy identified by the Association for the sector. It is
now appropriate for the Association to assist the Government in removing major
transport bottlenecks, thereby encouraging increases in production and move-
ment of goods that would stimulate economic development. Accordingly, the
project constitutes the first transport sector operation in Lao PDR for
financing by the IDA.



- 11 -
B. Objectives
3.3       The project is designed to:  (a) carry out a program of needed
repairs and maintenance on Route 13 in the Project Provinces; (b) strengthen
the maintenance capacity of Road and Bridge Maintenance Societies (RBMSs)
working in Savannakhet, Saravane, and Champassak provinces; and (c) complete
studies required for future transport development. It is also intended to
enhance benefits expected to accrue from the Association-financed Agricultuire
Rehabilitation and Development Project (Credit 1197-LA of 1982 for US$15 mil-
lion) by improving roads to facilitate the movement of goods in the project
area.
C. Main Features
3.4       The project would consist of:
(a) spot improvements to the existing pavement and drainage systems
including bridges on about 270 km of Route 13 in Savannakhet,
Saravane, and Champassak provinces;
(b) procurement of road maintenance and mechanical workshop equipment
and road and bridge construction materials; and
(c) provision of consultant services to assist in procurement, project
implementation, and also to carry out a series of transport
improvement and project preparation studies.
D. Detailed Description
Rehabilitation of Route 13 in the Project Provinces(270 km)
3.5       Route 13 is considered to be the most important road to support
development of the Lao economy. It is the only road linking the country from
Luang Prabang in the north to the river port of Veune Kham in the south, a
distance of some 1,500 km. It also traverses the intermediate terraces of the
Mekong River basin below Savannakhet (linking Savannakhet, Saravane, and
Champassak provinces--the project area), which make up the largest agricul-
tural areas in the country. In this area, Route 13 parallels sections of the
Mekong River which are not commercially navigable and is thus the sole means
of transport. However, the road, whose former asphalt surface has largely
disappeared, now constrains the transport of agricultural surpluses from the
south to deficit areas in the north because of its severe disrepair, extremely
poor riding quality, and virtual inaccessibility during most of the wet
season. To remedy this situation, the project is designed to improve Route 13
in these provinces to a maintainable level. This improvement would consist of
spot regravelling, grading, drainage and bridge improvements all along the
existing road alignment.
Road Maintenance and Workshop Equipment and Construction Materials
3.6       Improvement of the project road will be carried out by the three
RBMSs in the Savannakhet, Saravane, and Champassak provincial departments of



- 12 -
transport and posts (para. 3.12). The RBMS's existing road maintenance equip-
metit is old and has a serviceablity rate of only 54%, which is inadequate to
maintain the road network in the three provinces. In addition, workshop
equipment and tools as well as ersential construction materials, such as
cement, bridge panels, culvert pipes, etc., are not available. Therefore,
under the project the maintenance implementation capacity in the three
provinces wiil be strengthened through the provision of additional road main-
tenance equipment, including spare parts (Table 3.1), workshop equipment and
tools (Table 3.2), and road and bridge construction materials (Table 3.3)
together with on-the-job training (para. 3.7).
Consultant Services
3.7       Consultants will be employed for a TST, consisting of two experts
for 30 man-months to assist the Government in implementing the project. The
terms of reference for the TST (Annex 1) have been agreed between MOTP and the
Association. The objectives of the TST are to supervise implementation of the
project by assisting in the (a) strengthening of RBMSs and on-the-job training
of staff; (b) procurement of equipment, spare parts, and construction
materials; and (c) supervision of road works. On-the-job training of RBMS's
staff is intended to ensure that the project is implemented in an efficient
manner and that, after completion of the project, the road will be maintained
satisfactorily. During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the
Government that consultants will be selected prior to credit effectiveness.
3.8       The Lao Government intends to restore the key sections of its
transport network which has now fallen largely into a state of disrepair. In
order to carry out a program of restoration, improvement and future develop-
ment of the transport network, the Government intends to: (a) prepare a
national road inventory; (b) improve the transport and traffic statistics data
base; (c) design a road maintenance program; and (d) carryout feasibility
studies for priority road links. In order to do so, the Government agreed
during negotiations to engage consultants to assist in carrying out a series
of relevant studies which are to be called the National Transport Improvement
Studies. Agreement was also reached on the timetable for implementing these
studies (Annex 2).
E. Cost Estimates
3.9       The total project cost is estimated at US$15.1 million equivalent,
net of taxes and duties. It includes a foreign exchange cost of US$13.3 mil-
lion, or about 88% of the total project cost. Physical contingencies of 10%
and price contingencies of 4% of the project base cost are reflected in the
project cost. Price contingencies were calculated on the basis of cost
escalation factors estimated at 3% for 1987, 1% for 1988 and 1% for 1989.
Contingencies are low because of the high proportion of project costs related
to equipment purchases, for which firm prices could be obtained from
suppliers, and because of the short implementation period (para. 3.13). Coat
estimates are shown in detail in Table 3.1 and summarized in the following
table:

3.10      Cost estimates for road maintenance equipment and spare parts
(Table 3.2), mechanical workshop equipment and tools (Table 3.3), and
construction materials (Table 3.4) are based on estimates developed by the
MOTP and consultants and on recent suppliers' quotations. Estimates o'
maintenance unit operating costs, including manpower, fuel, oil, lubricants,
equipment maintenance, and repairs (Table 3.5), are based on analyses by
consultants, and assume that work will be completed in 42 months. Operating
costs are based on an actual working time requirement of 30 months. However
it is estimated that the project would be completed in 42 months due to the
phased start-up of the work and extensive rainy seasons. Improvement of the
project road, including bridges, would cost about US$23,000/km, including
depreciation of equipment estimated at about 35% of the purchase price. The
cost estimates for consultant services are based on prices for prevailing
consultancy contracts.

F. Financing
3.11      The proposed IDA credit of US$14.1 million will finance 93% of the
total project cost, or 100% of the foreign ccst and about 45% of local cost.
The Government will finance US$1.0 million or about 7% of the total project
cost.    Local cost f.inancing under the IDA credit is justified in view of the
country's limited financing capabilities. The following table sets out the
financing plan for the project:

C. Implementation
3.12      Implementation will be the responsibility of the Project
Implementation Office (PIO). The PIO will be located at Savannakhet and
report directly to the Department of Communications in the MOTP (see Chart 1).
The PIO will be responsible for: day-to-day management of the project; opera-
tional procedures; procurement and allocation of plant, vehicles, equipment,
and construction materials; repair and maintenance of equipment; and quality
control of works. The staff of the PIO will accordingly include the project
manager and his assistant as well as four experienced engineers (for main-
tenance, bridges, materials and mechanical services); it will also serve as
the base for the Technical Support Team. The PIO has been already established
and key staff, consisting of the Project Manager and his Assistant were
appointed prior to, and took part in, the credit negotiations.
3.13      On-site maintenance work will be carried out by the existing RBMSs
in 8avannakhet, Saravane, and Champassak provinces which are to be strength-
ened by adding key staff and by providing equipment under the project. The
RBMSs will be responsible for all road, bridge, and drainage works and quality
control within the area assigned to them. Each RBMS (Chart 1) will be managed
by a senior civil engineer, assisted by an experienced engineer and other pro-
fessional and support staff, and will carry out the day-to-day operations and
quality control of works as well as regular servicing and preventive mainte-
nance of plant and equipment. Upon completion of the project works, each RBMS
will continue to carry out routine and periodic maintenance of Route 13 under
the overall guidance of the MOTP which will still retain overall responsibility
for maintenance. The appointment of key staff for the first RBMS at
Savannakhet, including one Site Engineer and one Mechanical Superintendent is
expected to be completed by June 30, 1988. During negotiations, assurances



- 1S -
were obtained from the Government that key staff for the second RBMS would be
appointed by October 31, 1988, and for the third RBMS by November 30, 1988.
3.14      A detailed implementation schedule was agreed with the Government
during negotiations, as shown in Annex 3. According to this schedule,
consultants for the TST will be selected by December 1987, bidding documents
and specifications will be prepared for equipment and construction materials
and bids will be invited by December 1987, and both road improvement and
implementation of the transport studies will begin by October 1988. Also, the
project will be completed by June 30, 1991.
H. Procurement
3.15      Road maintenance equipment and spares, mechanical workshop equipment
and tools, and construction materials estimated to cost US$10.0 million
equivalent will be procured on the basis of International Competitive Bidding
(ICB) in accordance with the Association's Guidelines. All ICB procurement
documents will be reviewed by the Association. The MOTP has virtually com-
pleted preparation of the procurement documents and it is expected that they
will be submitted shortly to the Association for review. Small items, such as
tools and construction materials, costing less than US$5,000 equivalent will
be procured by prudent shopping after receiving at least three quotations; the
total amount of these purchases will not exceed US$0.4 million equivalent.
Items such as timber, fuel, oil, lubricants, and o.her day-to-day requirements
estimated to cost US$2.4 million equivalent will be procured from local
suppliers. Also, consultants services will be procured in accordance with the
Association's Guidelines. The procurement arrangements are summarized in the
following table:

I. Disburaements
3.16      Disbursements will be made on the following basis:
(a)  1002 of the c.i.f. cost of equipment and materials procured directly
from abroad;
(b)  100% of foreign expenditure for consultants services;
(c)  10% of expenditures in local currency for operating cost (up to a
maximum of SDR 90,000 equivalent to US$113,000); and
(d)  100Z of expenditures in foreign currency for operating costs.
Disbursements for expenditures on procurement of equipment and materials will
be fully documented. Reimbursement applications for small items of equipment
and materials procured by prudent shopping will be submitted when the aggre-
gate amount reaches US$100,000 equivalent or every 3 months, whichever comes
first. Operating costs will be reimbursed on the basis of statements of
expenditure certified by the MOTP. Table 3.6 shows a schedule of estimated
disbursements which is much faster than the regional profile for transporta-
tion projects because most of the IDA credit will be used for equipment
purchases. To facilitate disbursements under this project, a Special Account
with an authorized allocation of US$1.0 million, representing approximately
four months' average project expenditureœ would be established. Applications
for replenishment would be submitted quarterly or when the amounts withdrawn
equal 50Z of the inital deposits, whichever comes first. The closing date of
the credit will be December 31, 1991.
J. Auditing, Reporting, and Monitoring
3.17      The MOTP will establish and maintain separate accounts for all
expenditures under the Project. Assurances were obtained from the Government
during negotiations that these accounts and financial statements will be
audited annually in accordance with sound auditing standards by the Foreign
Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance and will be furnished to the
Association within six months of the end of each fiscal year.
3.18      Agreement was reached with the Government during negotiations on
quarterly progress reporting and on monitoring requirements for the project.
These would include details on staffing, monthly output of each RBMS, and
actual expenditures separately for the operating costs including manpower,
materials and equipment as outlined in Table 3.5. Agreement also was reached
that, within six mont-as after the closing date of the credit, a Project
Completion Report wiA1 be prepared and submitted to the Association.
K. Environmental Aspects
3.19      The project is not expected to cause any environmental or ecological
problems. No changes in the alignment of the project road will be made and no
additional land will be acquired. Improvement of drainage and bridges along
the project road will improve environmental and road safety conditions.

IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Present and Future Traffic
4.1       Based on traffic counts carried out by the MOTP in the project area
in October 1986, traffic on the project road has been estimated to vary
between 95 and 125 vehicles per day. In line with the composition of the
vehicle fleet (para. 2.6), trucks and utility vehicles comprise most of the
traffic. Present traffic levels, particularly of passengers, are depressed
largely because of the overall low level of economic activity, poor condition
of the roads, and unavailability of vehicles, tires, spare parts, and fuel.
4.2       For future traffic, the analysis starts from this depressed base and
assumes a 7% p.a. growth during the initial years after project completion.
This level is consistent with the expected growth of the transport sector
(para. 1.5) and with that of production in the region. Because of controls on
vehicle imports, only a small amount of additional traffic is lilcely to be
generated by the road improvements (Table 4.1).
B.  Costs and Benefits
4.3       Project costs and benefits have been evaluated in corstant June 1987
prices. Financial cost estimates have been converted to econo-nic costs by
excluding taxes, duties, and price contingencies. Quantifiable benefits
attributed to the project stem from savings in vehicle operating costs (VOC)
as a result of improvements of the north/south road link in an area where the
Mekong River is not commercially navigable. Also, improvement of the project
road will allow the trucking industry to be more productive because trucks
will be able to carry full loads.
4,4       In addition to the quantifiable VOC benefits, other benefits that
are extremely difficult to quantify will result from corupletion of the project
and alleviation, at least partially, of current road transport constraints.
These unquantifiable benefits are: (a) time savings; (b) increased agricul-
tural production and resulting producer's surpluses; (c) strengthened road
maintenance institutions; and (d) support for a shife in priorities for
budgetary allocations from construction to maintena-nce.
C. Overall Evaluation and Risks
4.5       The economic evaluation considered the benefits and costs of road
improvements under the project. The life of the improved road was assumed to
be 20 years, with adequate annual maintenance. Based on combined costs and
benefits of road improvements ill all three provinces, the overall economic
rate of return is about 18% (Table 4.2). The ERR is very conservative because
it is based only on VOC savings.
4.6       There may be some risk of delays in implementation due to the use of
ICB. To minimize this risk, appropriate consultants assistance is included in
the project and IDA assistance and supervision will also be provided at all



- 18 -
stages. It is unlikely that traffic growth will be lower than estimated since
road transport is at such an early stage of development in Lao PDR and also
because there is no better transport alternative. The risk is, therefore,
very low that the rate of return will fall below the above estimate. The
sensitivity of the ERR to cost increases and slower traffic growth is
summarized below:
Assumption                      ERR %
1.   Best estimate                             18
2.   Implementation delayed by 2 years         11
3.   Traffic growth reduced by 10%             12
4.   Combination of 2 and 3                     10
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.1       During credit negotiations, understandings were reached with the
Government that:
(a) the implementation of the project will be in accordance with an
agreed schedule (para. 3.14).
5.2       During credit negotiations, assurances were obtained from the
Government that:
(a) annual traffic counts will be executed on Route 13 between Vientiane
and Pakse and between Vientiane and Luang Prabang (para. 2.5);
(b) the improvement of the project road will be in accordance with
agreed design standards (para. 2.17);
(c) it will progressively increase maintenance funding to cover
expenditure on newly rehabilitated roads in the project provinces
(para. 2.21);
(d)  the National Transport Improvement Studies will be carried out
(para. 3.8);
(e) key staff for the first (Savannakhet) RBMS will be appointed by June
30, 1988, for the second (Saravane) RBMS by October 31, 1988, and
for third (Champassak) RBMS by November 30, 1988 (para. 3.13);
(f)  audited accounts will be provided to the Association within six
months of the end of the fiscal year (para. 3.17); and



- 19 -
(g) project progress reports (para. 3.18) will be submitted quarterly to
the Association and a project completion report will be submitted
not later than six months after the credit closing date.
5.3       The condition of credit effectiveness is the selection of
consultants for the TST (para. 3.7).
5.4       With the above agreements and assurances, the proposed project is
suitable for a development credit of SDR 11.1 million (US$14.1 million
equivalent) on standard terms, with a maturity of 40 years, to the Lao
People's Democratic Republic,

LAO PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
SOUTHERN TRANSPORT PROJECT
National Transport Imerovement Studies
Background
1.        The Lao Government intends to restore key sections of its transport
network which has now fallen largely into a state of disrepair. In doing so,
the Government wants to take steps to ensure that only the economically
viable, core sections of the network are included in the investment program,
and that once restored these sections are properly maintained. A similar
rationale applies to ports and waterways transport and, to a lesser extent, to
civil aviation. Hence in order to identify and implement a rational program
of transport improvements the Government first intends to carry out studies on
transportation and the transport network.
Objectives
2.        The objectives of the studies are to (a) identify priority
improvement needs in the transport sector, (b) ensure the least-cost
restoration and development of economically viable links in the network; and
(c) design a five-year investment and maintenance program.
Scope of Work
3.        The work will be done in 2 phases of 7 and 14 months,
respectively. Together the 2 phases will require about 80 man-months of
foreign consuslting expertise. The two phases will consist, inter alia, of
the following:
(a) Phase I
(i)   Completing a detailed inventory of the transport network
including road systems, river ports and waterway facilities,
and also airports.
(ii)   Compiling transport sector statistics and improving the data
base, including the carrying out of traffic counts where
necessary. The statistics should include traffic growth
rates, vehicle fleet composition and utilization data, freight
and passenger transport statistics, transport sector user
charges and revenues, etc. Recommendations should also be
made on strengthening the institutions responsible for
transport statistical analyses and time-series data.



- 24 -                            ANNEX 2
Page 2
(b)  Phase II
(i)   Using economic rate of return criteria, delineate the core
sections of the network for improvement. In particular for
roads, it will be necessary to identify the improvement levels
applicable to the various sections of the network.
(ii)   Prioritize investments in roads, waterways, river ports and
civil aviation.
(iii)   Identifying transport-sector managerial, organizational and
institutional development needs.
(iv)   Identifying priority improvements in major segments of the
transport industry--trucking, shipping, goods distribution and
storage, intermodal transfer and freight-terminal moderniza-
tion.
(v)   Drawing up an overall five-year investment and maintenance
program for the transport sector.
(vi)   carrying out feasibility studies for priority links in the
road network.
Implementation Schedule
4.        The terms of reference will be finalized by July 1988 as part of an
IDA supervision mission. Phase I should be started in October 1988, and all
of the studies should be completed by June 1990.
