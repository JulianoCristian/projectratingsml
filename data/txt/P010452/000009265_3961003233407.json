      Program for the sector by:  (a) financing an immediate\n            action program to begin to deal with some of the most urgent\n            environmental and infrastructure problems in Karachi and\n            three interior cities; (b) supporting GOS's newly\n            created policy-making machinery in implementation of its\n            program of fiscal and administrative reforms; (c) initiating\n            institutional strengthening for two key urban services\n            organizations in Karachi; and (d) preparing engineering\n            studies for future infrastructure and transport improvements\n            in Karachi and three interior cities.  The physical\n            investment components are environmental upgrading and\n            transport improvements.

The component for investment\n            program preparation includes consultant services to prepare\n            transport demand and management studies and engineering\n            designs for future infrastructure improvements in three\n            interior cities."}, "docdt": "1993-11-24T00:00:00Z"}
