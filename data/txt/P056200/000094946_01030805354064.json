rail-borne export trade. The components\n            include: 1) reconstruction of the paved road from Erdenesant\n            to Arvaikheer, based on technical, and economic assessments\n            for alternative types of rehabilitation, of some twenty six\n            sections of the road, of which, those with the highest\n            weighed economic rate of returns, were selected for\n            improvement. In addition, short sections of the road from\n            Arvaikheer to Khovd, will be upgraded, to provide an\n            all-weather gravel surface, with additional short sections\n            of the road from Kharkorin to Tosontsengel, improved as\n            well, with an all-weather gravel surface; 2) technical\n            assistance (TA), and training provision, to support the\n            advisory Road Board, including co-sponsoring visits to other\n            transition countries, with similar, and established road\n            boards. The component will complement a grant from Sweden,\n            which provides training in contract management to the\n            Department of Roads personnel; 3) road safety, and\n            implementation of a system of registration, and inspection\n            of road vehicles, complementing inspection facilities,\n            funded by previous operations, with additional testing lines\n            for trucks, and light vehicles; 4) supply of maintenance\n            equipment to ensure road maintenance; and, 5) TA to\n            establish the railway financial accounting system, to\n            complement the existing management information system, thus,\n            facilitate the use of financial, and physical resources."}, "docdt": "2001-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
