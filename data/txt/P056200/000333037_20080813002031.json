"abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Transport Development\n            Project for Mongolia were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            significant, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: use\n            of trials and pilots in the case of countries facing severe\n            climatic conditions is important. During the project several\n            pilots of alternative road surface designs were carried out.\n            Pilots are helpful to assist with the selection of proper\n            technologies given the conditions of Mongolia: harsh\n            weather, long distances making it costly to carry road\n            construction materials, sparse population making it\n            difficult to secure personnel to carry out road maintenance.\n            Since Mongolia road engineering standards were relatively\n            old and inadequate, such trials and pilots were essential to\n            assess proposed new standards before they were adopted.\n            Better-than-average project preparation is necessary in\n            countries with short construction seasons. Countries with\n            long and harsh winter conditions such as Mongolia only have\n            a few months when conditions allow for carrying out road\n            improvement works. Thus, better and more rigorous planning\n            and procurement compared to other countries is necessary to\n            ensure that works can be scheduled and implemented in a way\n            that maximizes utilization of the short construction season,\n            thus minimizing the cost of road works and facilitating an\n            early completion of the works."}, "docdt": "2008-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
