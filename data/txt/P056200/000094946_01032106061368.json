environmental impacts. It provides a brief description of\n            the legislative framework, and discusses the screening\n            methodology used for its analysis. River basins are\n            permanently affected by the influence of freezing, and\n            thawing processes, affecting not only roadways, but soil\n            erosion in general, as sedimentation trends are current, due\n            to wind conditions, and intensify arid zones, while\n            groundwater resources are scarce, mostly due to stony, and\n            dry streambeds with high water absorption, endangering the\n            region's flora and fauna, as well as alpine tundra\n            forests. Mitigation measures stipulate that: 1) excavation,\n            embankment, and grading works will ensure sedimentation\n            control of water courses in, or adjacent to work areas,\n            securing clean surfaces of undisturbed soil and rock, and,\n            low areas will be filled with on-site material from the\n            cutting operations, facilitating drainage of surface runoff.\n            A buffer zone of undisturbed vegetation will be maintained\n            between water courses, and works, protecting its outflow\n            location; 2) wastes, and oil spills will be appropriately\n            stored at selected land sites for final disposal; 3)\n            critical habitats will be flagged, and avoided as possible,\n            followed by re-vegetation to control surface erosion,\n            incorporating certified, rapid seed mixes to improve the\n            degraded topsoil."}, "docdt": "2001-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
