IMgd to about 42 IMgd; (c) the extension of the distribution\n            system including the installation of about 45 miles of water\n            mains, the construction of service reservoirs and the\n            provision of about 40,000 water meters; and (d) consulting services."}, "docdt": "1973-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
