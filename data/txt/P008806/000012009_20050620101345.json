The assessment\n            shows the difficulties of implementing projects affected by\n            a major exogenous shock, and a number of lessons can be\n            drawn on how problems were addressed. To summarize, lessons\n            suggest the following: 1) the formulation of realistic and\n            measurable project objectives is crucial, and when there is\n            a major restructuring of a project, the task team should\n            take the opportunity to review the original objectives in\n            light of changed circumstances; 2) Bank supervision\n            arrangements should be realistic, and budgets should be\n            higher when projects are decentralized, or spread over a\n            wide area involving more than one implementing agency.\n            Project design should take this into account; 3) covenants\n            should not be imposed on authorities that do not have the\n            legal power to carry out the commitment. Weak or open-ended\n            conditionality should be avoided, and objectives should not\n            be conflicting; and, 4) it is unwise to involve local,\n            sub-national borrowers with the foreign exchange risks in\n            unstable macroeconomic conditions, especially when their\n            revenues are in the local currency."}, "docdt": "2005-05-24T00:00:00Z"}
