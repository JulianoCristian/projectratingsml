MEMORANDUM AND REcOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCnON AND DEVELOPMENT
To nE EXECUnIVE DIRECTORS ON A LOAN TO THE
RUSSIAN FEDERATION FOR AN URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT
1.         I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on
a loan to the Russian Federation for the equivalent of US$329 million to help finance a project
for Urban Transport. The loan would be at the World Bank's standard variable interest rate,
with a maturity of 17 years, including five years' grace. The major part of the loan proceeds
would be onlent to the cities at an interest rate 200 basis points above the primary loan's interest
rate, for terms of 15 years, including a five year grace period. The oblast government in each
city will be required to sign as guarantor for the loan. The proceeds of the loan to finance the
purchase of urban transport spare parts throughout Russia will be onlent to the National Spare
Parts Distribution Center at an interest rate of 250 basis points above the primary loan's interest
rate for a term of one year.
2.          Country Policies and World Bank Group Assistance Stnztegy. The most recent
discussion of the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was on May 19, 1994 in the context
of the Financial Institutions Development Project. At that time the Bank recommended an
Intermediate Case lending program, on the order of US$1.0 to US$1.5 billion annually, not
including adjustment lending. The program would be composed of a core set of projects, largely
in the infrastructure and social sectors, and an additional set of projects that would go forward
only when the Government satisfied key conditions for sectoral reforms. The project is part of
the core set of investment projects. As outlined in the CAS, core investment projects are
expected to provide high economic rates of return which are not sensitive to changes in the
macroeconomic environment. A major focus in core projects is the achievement of effective
Implementation arrangements, and the addressing of key policy issues directly related to the
objectives of the specific investment project. For the project, these would include the
development of onlending relationships between the federal and regional levels of Government
and the strengthening of cost recovery in the implementing agencies. The project is, therefore,
fully consistent with the objectives of the most recent CAS and represents a priority use of Bank
resources in supporting the adjustment program in Russia.
3.          Background to the Project. With 74 percent of its population living in urban areas
and car ownership only about 6 cars per 100 inhabitants, compared to over 40 in Westem
Europe, Russia is more dependent upon public transport services than any other nation with a
similar level of income. Urban transport carried 42 billion passengers in 1991, representing an
85 percent share of passenger transportation by all modes, compared to 20 percent in Westem
Europe and three percent in the United States. Though small in terms of vehicles per population,
Russia has one of the three largest urban public transport fleets in the world, with about 105,000
buses providing regularly scheduled urban and suburban service. Mornover, the fleet is
shrinking. Rapidly deteriorating equipment conditions, driven by unavailability of funds to
upgrade and maintain existing fleets, are resulting in a bus fleet that is often only 60 percent
operational in some cities. Vehicle breakdowns are as high as 30 percent. Low service levels are
developing as a result: vehicles are overcrowded, averaging over nine passengers per square

REFORM PROGRAM ADorED  BY TIE 14 CITIFS
Cost Recovery
*    Before April 1. 1994, achievement of a minimum of 20 percent of the operating costs of urban transport
enterprises recovered frorn operating revenues.
*    By end-July 1994 achievement of a minimum 25 percent of the operating costs of urban transport
enterprises recovered from operating revenues.
*    By December 1, 1995 a minimum 35 percent cost recovery for all participatingtransportation enterprises
should have been maintained for the previous six months and by March 31. 1996 a minimum 40 percent
cost recovery should have been maintained for the previous six months. All cities expect to achieve a 40
percent cost recovery for the six month period before the contracts are signed for the new buses and
trolleybuses in late 1995. A target of 50 percent cost recovery has been set for the end of 1997.
*    By June 30, 1996, reduction of fare evasion to ten percent or less of daily passenger trips and seven
percent by June 30, 1998.
Governance of Transport Entites and Corporate Autonomy
*    As a condition of inclusion in the project, transferral of urban transport entities from oblast to city level
of subordination.
*    As a condition of inclusion in the project, establishment of enterprises participating under the project as
legally autonomous and corporatized entities (i.e., not part of the city government even if partially or fully
owned by the city), with significant operational independence.
*    As a condition of inclusion in the project, establishment of a transport department (or similar body) with
qualified full timne staff for the purposes of planning the development, and regulation, of the city's urban
public transport system.
*    By December 31, 1995, completion of separation of city bus from inter-city bus operations.
Operatng Efficiency and Investment Planning
*    By June 1, 1996, adoption of action plans, agreed with the Bank, to introduce contractual arrangements
aiming at improving of operating efficiencies of transport companies, reducing their costs and the overall
level of subsidies provided to them by local govermments.
*    By June 30, 1997, carrying out of a financial and economic review of transport systems to determine the
least-cost mode of urban transport and the least cost type of vehicles within each mode.
Compeition and Private PNrsion of Public Transport Servces
*    Take al necessary measures to support provision of transport services by private individuals or
companies, to encourage wider provision of urban transport services.
*    By September 1, 1996, preparation of plans for contracts with entities other than the project companies
to provide urban transport services or auxiliary services.
*    As a condition of inclusion in the project, preparation of a plan for privatization of taxi services.

meter at peak and waiting times have increased considerably. Similar, but less severe, problems
prevail with tram and trolleybus companies.
4.          The lack of funds, together with the increasing costs and declining production of
domestic buses and increased cost of imported diesel-powered buses, has left public transport
companies without the means to replace its fleet and sustain operations. Low cost recovery from
fares, together with a high number of fare dodgers and fare exemptions (at least one-third of the
population and as high as 70 to 80 percent in some cities) and an inflationary environment, have
increased urban transport companies' operating losses to an estimated Rb1.0 trillion in 1993,
roughly six percent of GDP. At the same time, as a part of the pattern of general reform, the
responsibility for capital and operating subsides to the urban transport industry has devolved of
necessity, and by decree, to the local level. Local governments, which have increasing
responsibilities to subsidize other sectors as well as an often insufficient tax revenue base, are
finding it difficult funding transport losses. Reforms to improve cost recovery, eliminate fare
exemptions and fight fare evaders are greatly needed so that a greater portion of existing
subsidies can be used to inance vehicle replacement and other capital needs. In the longer term,
Russia also needs access to more fuel efficient vehicles (about half the Russian bus fleet is
gasoline rather than diesel-powered, and is about 40 percent less fuel efficient). The development
of competitive procurement procedures will help in this regard by stimulating a competitive bus
manufacturing industry within Russian that offers more energy efficient, less-polluting and
longer lasting buses.
5.          During project preparation, the Bank worked with a number of cities to encourage
them to put forward urban transport reform programs. Of the 15 subsequently self-selected
candidate cities, 14 met a minimum program of urban transport reforms by negotiations,
including doubling or trebling cost recovery ratios as a condition for inclusion of the project.
All agreed to implement the Project's reform program (see Box). The 14 project cities include
five of the nation's thirteen cities over one million population and range from 116,000 (Velikie
Luki) to 1.5 million people (Nizhniy Novgorod). All the cities, except Omsk, are in the
European part of Russia. Cost recovery ratios for the 15 candidate cities averaged 11.8 percent
for 1993. In order to improve this situation, inclusion in the project was limited to those cities
that achieved at least a 25 percent cost recovery ratio (excluding depreciation) by July 1994, and
implemented fundamental organizational reforms. Financial data submitted in Augu3t 1994
showed that with the exception of one tram company that will be excluded from the project,
transit companies in 14 cities achieved a cost recovery of at least 25 percent for the second
quarter of 1994. One city opted not to be included in the project. These 14 cities, therefore,
have been included in the project following receipt from their respective oblast governments of
an agreement in principle to guarantee the proposed loan to their cities. By the time of
negotiations, ten of the cities reported cost recovery ratios in excess of 40 percent.
6.          Project Objectives. The objectives of the project are to: (a) preserve essential
urban transport capacity in 14 cities by linking financing of urgently needed replacement vehicles
and spare parts to the implementation of reforms; (b) strengthen the 14 project cities' urban
transport sector institutions so as to improve the efficiency of passenger transport operations; (c)
arrest the decline of urban transport services in cities throughout Russia through the provision
of urgently needed spare parts for transport vehicles; and (d) provide restructuring advice for
the domestic bus industry. The project will also serve to demonstrate the benefits of such reform
programs to other cities in Russia and how Government support for capital replacement of



4
vehicles could be tied to improved cost recovery and other reforms. Such reforms are needed
on a national level to reduce urban transport losses, which were about six percent of GDP in
1993.
7.          Project Description. The project cost totals US$391.0 million, of which the Bank
will finance US$329 million for the following components: (i) assistance for 14 self-selected
cities to finance a large part of required fleet replacements for a three year period including
Bank financing of 1,501 diesel fueled buses and 272 trolleybuses (US$276.8 million), and
rehabilitation of 997 buses, 327 trolleybuses, and 380 trams (US$40.9 million); provision of
workshop, computers and other equipment for urban transit companies, plus a fare collection
system to be tested in one of the project cities (US$8.7 million); and technical assistance and
training to assist the cities implement reforms and assist with procurement and monitoring of the
project (US$8.3 million); (ii) assistance for MOT including: ten natural gas fueled buses
(US$1.5 million); equipment for the Project Implementation Directorate [PID] (US$0.2 million);
studies of, and restructuring advice for, the domestic bus manufacturing industry; technical
assistance and training to assist MOT develop more appropriate urban transport policies for cities
throughout Russia; and help expand the reform program to other cities (US$4.6 million); and
(iii) provision of spare parts for transit comeipanies throughout Russia (US$50.0 million). About
19 percent of fleet requirements will be firnanced by local governments (US$53.1 million). An
additional US$1.8 million will be provided by the European Union (EU) for technical assistance
to the project cities to help them implement the reform program.
8.          Project Implementation. The Russian Federation will be the Borrower of the
World Bank loan, and will onlend to the project cities, which will pass on the funds as a grant
to the local tran sit companies. At the request of the Ministry of Finance (MOF), the participating
city's oblast government will guarantee the Subsidiary Loan. Confirmation that each project
city's oblast government will guarantee the Subsidiary Loan was a condition of the city's
participating in negotiations. The three party agreement will include the reform propram to be
implemented, as well as details of goods and services to be financed for each project city. The
Bank will not be a party to the Subsidiary Loan Agreement, but did formally acknowledge
Declarations of' Commitment signed by each city which detailed the reform p:ogram to be
implemented and the goods and services to be financed under the project. Loan effectiveness will
require the signing, and presentation of legal opinions thereon, of Subsidiary Loan Agreements
with at least five cities. The terms of repayment will be fifteen years with a grace period of five
years and a rate of interest 200 basis points above the Bank loan for the project cities. The cities
will carry the foreign exchange risk.
9.          MOT will coordinate and have overall responsibility for the physical execution
and technical aspects of the project, including maintaining compliance with conditions and
overseeing disbursements and financial record keeping of the pioject. To fulfill this
responsibility, the Government has established an Urban Transport Project Coordinating Council
to provide project policy and oversee the project and a Project Implementation Directorate (PID)
to undertake the administrative, procurement and supervision functions. The Council includes
representatives from the cities, including a Deputy Chairman elected by the cities. The PID is
staffed by a Project Director and MOT staff drawn from among those that have been working
on the project to date. Monitorable targets relating to supervision of the project were agreed at
negotiations, and will be included in the Subsidiary Loan Agreements. Procurement
administration also will be the responsibility of the PID, which has been set up as a separate



5
administrative unit by MOT, with evaluation committees also including representatives from city
staffs on a visiting basis. The Project Director will be assisted by a Project Adviser financed
under the project. The Project Advisor will be an individual provided by a firnm that will also
provide additional short term experts to supplement, when needed, assistance in procurement and
accounting for MOT and the cities and their procurement units. Cities will have their own
procurement units and be responsible for local procurement, perhaps some international
procurement of spare parts, vehicle rehabilitation work, and will liaise with the PID on
procurement of new vehicles and on some rehabilitation of vehicles by contract.
[0.         A detailed vehicle rehabilitation plan for each urban transport company was agreed
at negotiations and included in the Declarations of Commitment. The plan will be included in
the Subsidiary Loan Agreements. The US$50 million component for the national urban transport
spare parts program will be procured in two phases of US$25 million each. Implementation of
this component will be undertaken by the National Spare Parts Distribution Center which will
sell parts to end users and repay MOF for the full value of each phase within one year of the
parts' arrival in Russia. Terms of onlending to the Center will be one year replacement period
and a rate of interest 250 basis points above the Bank loan. Draft bidding documents for the
purchase of new vehicles and specifications for the new vehicles to be financed under the loan
were discussed at negotiations and will be issued shortly. In order to ensure that the PID has the
experttise to evaluate the bids for buses and trolleybuses, and prepare bidding documents for
other components of the project, consultants will be financed under a Project Preparation Facility
(PPF). A project launch workshop will be held within three months of loan approval and a mid-
term review will take place in November 1996.
11.         Project Sustainability. The project will enhance the sustainability of transport
capacity in the project cities by enabling the replacement of old Russian-made buses with better,
more fuel efficient ones that should remain in operation well beyond the life of the project.
Government's and municipalities' commitment to the project has been strong throughout project
preparation but the project's ultimate sustainability still depends on their willingness to ensure
a level of support that will keep operational the vehicles financed under the project and that will
maintain cost recovery gains. In particular, the project's sustainability is related to its success
in improving cost recovery since lack of funds for urban transport is the single greatest problem
in the sector. To increase the chances that this will occur, real increases in cost recovery have
been achieved during project preparation, and two-thirds of the cities have already met the cost
recovery target set for March 1996 for bus operations. Cost recovery can be improved by
reducing fare exemptions and fare evasion as well as by raising fares. The targets were set at
levels that the average Russian citizen should be able to afford even in periods of high inflation.
Analysis shows that if fares were to be increased to ensure a cost recovery ratio of 60 percent,
excluding depreciation (the target ratio for end of the project is 50 percent), the percentage of
average monthly household income spent on urban transport would increase from a range of
about 0.1 percent to 3 percent to a range of about 1.2 percent to 5 percent per household.
According to research, 10 percent is the maximum level of household income that should be
spent on urban transit use. Nonetheless, sustainability of the project will be made more difficult
in a high inflation environment since there is generally a time lag between cost increases and
fare increases implemented to compensate for the costs increases.
12.         Sustainability will also be supported by the inclusion of other performance targets
and reform measures to be reached under the project. Adherence to these will be reinforced



6
through the Subsidiary Loan Agreements. Servicing a long term debt equal to the project loan
in each city would require an average of about 3 percent of municipal revenues, with a low of
1.0 percent for Nizhniy Novgorod and a high of 7.2 percent for Saransk. This level of debt may
be sustainable, particul2rly if cost recovery targets are met. By improving cost recovery ratios
for transit operations, the cities can at least cover part of thc debt repayments for new buses and
trolleybuses by reduced transit subsidies.
13.         Lessons Learnedfrom Previous Bank Operations. The World Bank has only had
limited experience in the urban transport sector, and of the fcw projects that included the
financing of buses, audits have found that bus companies generally made improvements in
operations and staffing ratios over the course of the project and that they were relatively
efficient. Financial targets, however, were not generally met given government's reluctance to
increase bus fares. In view of this experience, the loan required substantial real increases in fares
as a condition of inclusion in the project of candidate cities and their transport companies. Past
experience has also shown that project schedules are over-optimistic at appraisal, resulting in
considerable delays in project execution, often due to countries' unfamiliarity with the Bank's
procurement procedures. Lessons leamed from the Russia Environmental Management Project
(Ln 3806-RU) and other projects indicate the need: (i) to identify a consistent counterpart with
authority to move the project forward; (ii) to coordinate among key parties on critical project
issues; (iii) to involve local consultants and institutes in the process; (iv) to streamline the
Government's procedures for loan signing and effectiveness after Board approval; and (v) t( set
up early in the project a Project Implementation Unit with experienced advisers to facilitate
procurement and prepare bidding documents before Board presentation.
14.         Thz project was initiated by MOT, the key counterpart for the sector, and was
discussed with MOF to determine its willingness to borrow on behalf of cities for a project
which does not generate incremental savings sufficient to cover the loan's debt service. The
design of the project has taken into account these issues: procurement preparation is well
underway; the PID within MOT has been estab'ished and working groups that will evolve into
the PID's at the city levels nave already been appointed; and, project preparation and
implementation arrangements have already, and will continue to, involve officials and transport
operators in the project cities as well as experts from a local institute. A sample Subsidiary Loan
Agreement was drafted for early review with MOT, MOF and several cities to gain early
reaction to the concepts involved. Efforts also are being made to ensure that the project benefits
from the experience gained under the first Rehabilitation Loan (Ln 3513-RU) with respect to the
procurement of spares parts for the urban transport secter as a whole.
1J.         Rationale for World Bank Involvement. Urban transport services have been
steadily declining over the past few years given the deteriorating budgetary situation at both
federal and local levels of government. At least for the next three years, it is unlikely that
government budgetary resources will be available to replace the rapidly aging urban transport
vehicle fleet or that revenues can be increased sufficiently quickly to finance the purchase of
buses and other vehicles. Because of the low cost recovery, privatization of transport services
will be difficult in the short term because of the wide differential in fares for public and
privately operated services if private operators are to earn a reasonable profit. The financing of
fleet replacement and rehabilitation by the World Bank will enable the project cities' urban
transport companies to improve service to at least a minimum satisfactory level and, along with
the improvement in service, raise far_s to increase cost recovery. With higher levels of cost



7
recovery it will be possiblc In introd(utce more privatization and competition lor the provision of
urban transport services sinic private operators coul(1 not competc withi highly subsidized public
operators.
16.         The project also supports sector restrticturinfg and needed institutional changes
such as: the devolvcmient of responsibility for urban transport to municipalities, the breaking-up
of oblast-wide transport operating and spare part (listribuition monopolies, the transformation of
a centrally controllcd procurement system and allocation of urban transport vehicles based on
vehicles per population and MOT judginent, to one based on operational and economic analysis
and competitive bidding procedures. Although much of the project is limited to 14 cities, the
demonstration effects could lead to implementation of the project's reforms throughout the
country. Consistent with the Bank's CAS to support projects that improve infrastructure and
underpin the mKiat =tor in contzxts that support structural reforms, this project is expected to
play a catalytic role in supporting sectoral policy and institutional changes in the urban transport
sector at the Federal level and to enhance our support of the transport sector as a whole.
17.         Agreed Actions. The Borrower has agreed the following as conditions of the
Loan Agreement: (i) responsibilities of the Urban Transport Project Coordinating Council and
the PID within MOT; (ii) an onlending rate of 200 basis points above the Bank rate and a
repayment period of 15 years, inclusive of five years grace, for the project cities, and for
Avtonabsbyt an onlending rate 250 basis points above the Bank rate and a repayment term of
one year from the time spare parts financed under this loan arrive in the country; and
(iii) assessment of the federal government mandated urban transport passenger exemptions and
measures to reduce exemptions. To ensure financing would be available for essential project
management and procurement services, a PPF of US$0.75 million and retroactive financing of
up to US$1.5 million are included in the loan. Loan effectiveness will depend upon:
(i) execution and effectiveness of Subsidiary Loan Agreements for at least five project cities,
and, (ii) the PID's having successfully signed a contract, with a firm or firms, to provide project
management and procurement services. Conditions of disbursement relate to effectiveness of
Subsidiary Loan Agreements. Agreement was reached to include as conditions of the
Subsidiary Loan Agreements the following: (i) project transit entities' maintenance of a 35
percent cost recovery ratio for six months prior to Deccmber 1, 1995 and a 40 percent ratio for
six months prior to March 31, 1996: (ii) providing the Bank an opportunity to provide its
opinion regarding any new investment in the cities' transport systems that could affect the
municipalities' financial situation; (iii) by December 31, 1995, completion of separation of city
bus operations from inter-city bus operations; (iv) by June 1, 1996 adoption of an action plan,
agreed with the Bank, to introduce co.atractual arrangements aiming at improving operating
efficiencies of transport companies, reducing their costs and the overall level of subsidies
provided to them by local governments; (v) by June 30, 1997, analysis of least-cost mode of
urban transport; (vi) to take measures to support the provision of transport services by private
individuals or companies, to encourage wider provision of urban transport services;
(vii) preparation of plans for contracts with entities other than project companies to provide
urban transport services or auxiliary services by September 1, 1996; (viii) project monitorable
targets, including the reduction of fare evasion to ten percent of daily passenger trips by mid-
1996; (ix) full repayment of the first procurement of national spare parts by Avtonabsbyt before
proceeding with the second procurement; and (x) Avtonabsbyt to charge prices based on
commercial terms for the spare parts.

18.          rinvironmental Aspects. The project has a B rating since it is not expected to have
any significant negative environmental impact. The new dicsel-powered buscs to be financed
under thc project will have engincs that will at least meet European standards for emissions and
therefore will be less polluting than the many gasolinc-powered buses in operation today. The
new bu.,es will also bc lcss noisy and morc fucl efficient tha-n the present fleet of buses in Russia
although the overall impact may not be largc since buses accounted for only 7.2 percent of
transport _missions of siulphur dioxide and 10.8 perccnt of nitrous oxide nationwide. Technical
assistance to bc provided under the project will assist in monitoring the project's environmental
effects and will suggcst methods of limiting harmfuil effects for the dispoIal of engine fluids and
old tires.
19.          Proogrum Objective Categories. The project supports several aspects of the Bank's
program objectives, which include: promoting the commercialization of puiblic sector enterprises;
redressing government fiscal problems; reducing environmental pollution by lowering
atmospheric ernissions; and improving the quality of life by reducing overcrowding on heavily
used urban transport vehicles.
20.          Participatory Approach. As previously described, the cities that are participating
in the project were self-selected. They participated in the definition of the reform program and
already demonstrated commitment to the project by meeting increasing higher cost recovery
targets for inclusion in the project. Local consultants and MOT officials from the sector have
been guiding the selection process and preparation of the project since its inception.
Implementation has been designed to continue the participation of cities and MOT officials.
21.          Project Benefits. The project will help alleviate the growing shortage of public
transport in the 14 project cities and thereby increase the quality of service. Major benefits for
the project cities will be from reduction of passenger waiting times (often in sub-zero weather
conditions) and excessive overcrowding on buses, trolleybuses and trams. The project will also
help improve the efficiency of public transport services and the organization of the sector in the
14 project cites, promote more reforms in other cities and economic urbar. transport policies at
the national level, improve the availability of existing vehicle fleets in cities throughout Russia
and assist with the development of a viable urban transport vehicle manufacturing industry in
Russia. The unaquantifiable benefits include important organizational reforms that will be carried
out: inciuding, (i) establishment of autonomrous transit agencies completely separate from the
oblast or municipal governments (most cities have already carried out this reform); (ii) municipal
goveriments and transit companies entering into contracts to set performance targets and
encourage greater efficiency for the provision of transit services; (iii) municipalities establishing
transport deparilnents to regulate transit services; (iv) the introduction of private transport
services on a trial basis; and (v) divestiture of non-urban transport services and taxi services
from miuicipal ownership. The Economic Rate of Return is estimated to be 39 percent for new
vehicles and the rehabilitatiun of vehicles in the 14 cities.
22.          Risks. A major risk of the project is that the reforms, especially the cost recovery
reforms, will not be implemented (or maintained) as promised, and the availability of urban
transport vehicles would once again decline and maintenance costs increase because of the lack
of spare parts and fleet replacement. To allay this risk, the project includes cost recovery (25
percent by negotiations) and organizational reform as a pre-requisite for inclusion of cities in the
project, and further cost recovery (40 percent by March 1996). Monitoring of the project



9
companies will be undertaken quarterly so as to assess the need for additional fare increases in
a timely fashion. A second risk is that once the project is completed the transit companies will
still not have sufficient funds for the purchase of spare parts and replacement of the fleet, even
with improved cost recovery achieved under the project. Given the uncertainty over future levels
of funding, thc project: (i) sets a target of 50 percent cost recovery by the end of the project;
(ii) requires the introduction of contractual arrangements aimed at improving operating
efficiencies of urban transport companies; and (iii) introduces privatization of appropriate urban
transport services to reduce public funding requirements. A third risk is that cities will not
purchase the spare parts to be financed under the national spare parts component since the parts
are to be sold at their purchase price plus mark-up. MOT will onlend to the distribution center,
thereby encouraging the center to keep its costs to a minimum. The procurement will be divided
into two phases to reduce the risk of unsold inventory. The center will have one year after
receiving each lot to repay MOT and will auction off any remaining parts at the end of the year.
A fourth risk is that there will be delays in project execution, but a major part of the
procurement will start before the loan becomes effective since preparation of bidding documents
and specifications are about to be finalized. A final risk is that the investment components could
cost more than originally estimated. This risk will be mitigated by Government's stated intention
not to procure the second round of national spare parts until the procurement of new vehicles
has been completed. This will enable the Government to consider reallocating funds from the
national spare parts component in the event more funds are needed to complete the procurement
of urgently required new vehicles for the project cities.
23.         Recommendation. I am satisfied that the loan would comnply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Worl1 Bank, and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
