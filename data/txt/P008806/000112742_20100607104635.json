The project will also serve to\n            demonstrate the benefits of such reform programs to other\n            cities in Russia and how Government support for capital\n            replacement of vehicles could be tied to improved cost\n            recovery and other reforms. Such reforms are needed on a\n            national level to reduce urban transport losses. The project\n            comprises three major components. The first component\n            provides assistance for 14 self-selected cities to finance a\n            large part of required fleet replacements for a three year\n            period including financing for diesel fueled buses and\n            trolleybuses, and rehabilitation of buses, trolley buses and\n            trams; provision of workshop, computers and other equipment\n            for urban transit companies plus a fare collection system to\n            be tested in one of the project cities; and technical\n            assistance and training to assist the cities implement\n            reforms and assist with procurement and monitoring of the\n            project.
