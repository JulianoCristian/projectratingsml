introduce the main principles of the Training and Visit\n            system in the extension services of Cote\n            d'Ivoire's three main rural development agencies.\n            It will focus on (a) increasing extension coverage from the\n            present 25 percent to about 50 percent of the total number\n            of farmers, through a better organization of field services;\n            (b) extending simple crop husbandry improvements and better\n            means of using available modern inputs; and (c) improving\n            linkages between research and extension to ensure a\n            continuous flow of technologies well adapted to local needs\n            and constraints. To accomplish these objectives, the project\n            will support:  (a) the modification of the agencies'\n            extension services; regular continuous training of extension\n            staff at all levels; and strengthening of linkages between\n            research and extension.  It will further (b) encourage the\n            development of effective monitoring and evaluation and\n            management information systems in each agency and the\n            improvement of their financial management."}, "docdt": "1986-10-21T00:00:00Z"}
