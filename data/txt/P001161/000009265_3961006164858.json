The project achieved some of its objectives,\n            its impact on institutional development was modest,\n            sustainability is uncertain, and the performance of the Bank\n            was satisfactory while the Borrower's was marginally\n            satisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, much progress was made in spite of a very\n            complicated institutional, financial, and economic\n            environment which did not favor adequate project\n            implementation and management. Second, the T&V system of\n            extension is very efficient as it is tailored to local\n            conditions. Third, an effective monitoring and evaluation\n            system, with clear objectives, is indispensable for\n            efficient management of extension activities. Fourth,\n            although women play a major role in food crop production,\n            they were not seriously taken into account during project\n            implementation. Finally, the efficiency of the T&V\n            system is adequate as long as a critical minimum of funding\n            is available to enable proper mobility and training of staff."}, "docdt": "1994-06-07T00:00:00Z"}
