                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall, the project implementation has progressed well and the last works – the Takon Landfill – have been completed and provisionally handed over to Government by the
                         contractor. As of May 24, 2012, 91.48% of the original credit and 100% of the additional financing credit have been disbursed. The overall achievement of the project as at June 25,
                         2012, is as follows: (i) The rehabilitation (paving and drainage) of 33.9 kilometers of urban roads is completed (about 126% of original project target) providing to 355,000 residents
                         better access to the city centers (121% of end of project target); and (ii) The construction of 17.4 km of primary drainage network, protecting more than 981,000 residents from

                         they set aside for the maintenance of their infrastructure stock; (iv) Fourteen (14) Operational Neighborhood Development Committees have been created and functional; (v) The
                         quantity of municipal waste collected and transported out of Porto Novo has increased to more than 71% of total quantity generated, especially after the completion of the Takon

                         On Component D -- Solid Waste Management and Takon Landfill Construction of the project: The Takon Landfill was the very last of the works on the project to be completed and
                         was handed over to the Government of benin by the contractor on April 17, 2012. All aspects of the Government of Benin's promise to carry out follow-up social mitigation measures
                         ("measures d'accompagnement") on this project have been fulfilled. The outstanding issues of the water supply, electricity and road construction as part of the social mitigation
                         measures undertaken by the Government for the Takon community have all been completed and handed over by the contractors to the Government and the village of Takon.
                         Therefore, GoB’s responsibility/commitment for "measures d'accompagnement" in the Component D, have been fully and concretely executed: (i) the construction of 3 additional
                         classrooms to augment the existing three classroom block in the local primary school has been completed, and has thus reduced class size in this local school from more than 127
                         (on average, before use of the new facilities) to about 45. The three existing classrooms were also renovated; (ii) eight new toilets have been completed and added to the stock of
                         three that was already existing at the school; (iii) the construction of a new clinic for the Takon community has been completed together with four public toilets (the Government has
                         provided the necessary administrative, equipment and resources and the clinic is now operational just as well as the school); (iv) the community center has been completed and
                         handed over to the community; (v) the construction of a new road leading to the landfill was extended to the center of the Takon village ( the host/beneficiary community of the landfill
                         site) and; (vi) the borehole construction for the water supply component of the project has been completed and water now flowing to most areas of the Takon village including to the
                         primary school and clinic.
