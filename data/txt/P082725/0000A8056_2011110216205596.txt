                         Implementation Status Overview
                          This is an update to reflect project progress following just ended supervision mission. The overall project implementation is progressing well. As of October 4, 2011, 100% of the
                         original credit and 91.48% of the additional financing credit had been disbursed. The mission was pleased to note that the Government of Benin's promise to carry out follow-up
                         measures ("mesures d'accompagnement") on this project has been fulfilled to a large extent (except the electricity supply that needs to be undertaken now that the road construction

                         Construction of the project), the following aspects have been concretely executed: (i) the construction of 3 additional classrooms to augment the existing three classroom block in the
                         local primary school has been completed, and has thus reduced class size in this local school from more than 127 (on average, before use of the new facilities) to about 45. The
                         three existing classrooms were also renovated.; (ii) eight new toilets have been completed and added to the stock of three that was already existing at the school; (iii) the construction

                         of a new clinic for the Takon community has been completed together with four public toilets (the Government needs to provide the necessary administrative, equipment and
                         resources to ensure that this clinic is operational just as the school is); (iv) the community center has been completed and handed over to the community; (v) the construction of a
                         new road leading to the landfill has been extended to the center of the Takon village ( the host/beneficiary community of the landfill site) and; (vi) the borehole construction for the
                         water supply component of the project has been completed and water now flowing to most areas of the Takon village including to the primary school and clinic. The mission noted
                         the excellent action on the part of the GoB in providing all it set out to do under the "mesures d'accompagnement" that the Takon community demanded as compensation in order to
                         allow the siting of the Takon landfill site on their farmlands.

                         The preparation of the Local Government support program is proceeding well. A GoB decree has appointed a 23-member project preparation committee drawn from diverse
                         Ministries (Urban development, Decentralization, Rural development, Commerce, Environment, Social Development, Water Affairs, Energy and Mines and four Mayors representing
                         the Local Governments). A technical committee of the project preparation committee has been mandated to evaluate towns and sub-projects in all towns that could be considered for
                         inclusion in the new project. The Bank Team is providing important technical support to the project preparation committee and all proposals will be subject to close scrutiny during the
                         national workshop on the project called by the Government.
