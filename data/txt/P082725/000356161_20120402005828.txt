                                    Extension of Closing Date

1. The closing date for BENIN-- Second Decentralized City Management will be
   extended from 03/31/2012 until 06/29/2012.

      Briefly summarize project implementation progress and confirm whether project
      objectives continue to be achievable.

2. Government of Benin, through a letter dated March 1, 2011, made a request to the
   Bank to apply funds remaining in Credit 4117-BEN totaling SDR 2,044,717.35 (US$
   3,163,218.63 equivalent) that is currently available in the project account to make
   some payments for the counterpart funding on the project. This remaining amount
   emanates from the open procurement processes applied by the Government in line
   with the Bank's procurement guidelines which elicited bids that were lower than some
   of the estimated amounts for some of the works and equipment in the original project.
   There were also some favorable exchange rate gains in the process of transferring
   funds from SDR into CFA Francs. The Bank's project Team has no objection to the
   request and in line with Bank procedures has agreed with Legal Department to
   restructure the project to make a change to the schedules of payment that is in the
   Original (Credit 4117-BEN) and Additional Financing (Credit 4490-BJ) project
   documents.

3. The overall project implementation has progressed well. As of March 28, 2012, 100%
   of the Additional Financing credit and 91.48% of the original project funds had been
   disbursed respectively. All works promised in the PAD under the original and
   Additional Financing credits (Credit 4117-BEN and 4990-BJ) have been completed
   and fees for implementing agencies up to closing date of project have been taken care
   of.

4. The achievement of the project is as follows: (i) the rehabilitation (paving and
   drainage) of 32.9 kilometers of urban roads is completed (about 126% of original
   project target) providing to 384,000 residents better access to the city centers (121%
   of end of project target); and (ii) the construction of 17.5 km of primary drainage
   network, protecting more than 981,000 residents from periodic flooding (end of
   project target exceeded). The Implementation Progress rating is satisfactory and the
   Project Development Objective (PDO) rating is also satisfactory at this close-to-
   closure of the project. 14 operational neighborhood development committees have
   been established surpassing the end of project target of 10. The committees are
   supporting the entrenchment of community participation in decision making in the
   project. All participating municipalities (except one) have increased their overall

   internally generated funds and are consistently allocating funds for urban
   infrastructure maintenance per project agreements and targets. Indeed the PDO is on
   course to being achieved.

5. The Team confirms that all the project works have been completed and handed over
   to Government including the last works on Takon Landfill site which were completed
   and finally handed over to Government on March 8, 2012.

6. As of March 28, 2012, Government owes (counterpart funding) a total amount of
   US$ 3.48 million to vendors/contractors who have provided services in construction
   of various facilities in the works of the project. The remaining funds in Credit 4117
   BEN total US$ 3.165 million equivalent. If the remaining funds are applied to the
   counterpart funding owed by Government it still leaves a shortfall of about US$ 0.315
   equivalent that must be paid for by Government itself. As of now, Government has
   not fully and credibly shown the Project Team how this small shortfall amount will be
   paid. The only reason for extending this project closing date is therefore to ensure
   that Government will find the shortfall amount of US$ 0.315 million equivalent and
   pay it to the project account. This will bring to a complete balance all payments and
   obligations of the project to vendors and contractors and remove a possible
   reputational risk the Bank may face should the project close without Government
   paying all its obligations to vendors/contractors who worked on the project. The Bank
   Team believes that, if approved, the time requested will allow for Borrower to seek
   the needed funds to finance the shortfall identified above.

7. The Borrower has submitted a request for extension of project closing date on March
   27, 2012. This will be the 3rd extension (from March 31, 2012 to June 29, 2012) of
   the project. The first (from June 30, 2010 to December 31, 2010), concluded during
   the preparation of the Additional Financing Credit (for six months), was to allow for
   works envisaged to be completed. The second (from December 31, 2010 to March 31,
   2012) was to make more time available for the completion of works after
   Government lost 16 months in getting Parliament to approve the Additional
   Financing Credit and therefore works could not begin at the appropriate time. The
   cumulative extension is 23 months.

8. There are no audit report issues. The 2011 audit reports were unqualified for the
   implementing agencies (AGETUR and SERHAU).

9. The Task Team confirms that the three conditions required by Bank policy (O.P.
   13.30, paragraph 3) to be fulfilled before a closing date can be extended have been
   met: (i) the objectives of the project continue being attainable, (ii) the performance of
   the Recipient is satisfactory, and (iii) the Recipient has prepared a specific action plan
   acceptable to the Bank to complete the activities within the period up to the new
   closing date.
