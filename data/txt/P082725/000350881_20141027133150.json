Some important\n            project lessons learned were: (1) Keeping the scope of the\n            project straightforward and simple and at the same time\n            including some forward looking developmental elements. The\n            maximum feasible amount of flexibility in implementation\n            greatly facilitates the successful implementation of\n            projects of such nature. (2) A programmatic project\n            approach, targeting a limited number of cities increases\n            both the sustained access to infrastructure, as well as the\n            institutional building positive impacts. (3) Scaling-up the\n            approach is necessary to reflect seriousness with regards to\n            supporting the decentralization process. Limiting the scope\n            to the city-scale might hinder the capacity to impact\n            national urban policies, especially those related to fiscal\n            transfers, urban planning, among others. The Bank must\n            consider scaling-up to a broader national program targeting\n            the urban environment, while keeping a specific focus on\n            large cities as well as local engagement. (4) Taking\n            advantage of existing implementation capacity and extending\n            the life of an already proven and tested PCU and PIUs rather\n            than creating new structures helped safeguard institutional\n            memory, and improved the success of the project through\n            challenging instances. (5) Designing a proper implementation\n            framework for institution-building components improves\n            outcomes. Although the project conducted very interesting\n            studies and capacity-building exercises, they did not fit\n            into a comprehensive framework that could incorporate\n            M&E and fine-tune approaches with regards to\n            institutional activities. (6) Experience sharing on\n            decentralization will facilitate Bank dialogue on potential\n            reforms and reassure counterparts."}, "docdt": "2012-12-27T00:00:00Z"}
