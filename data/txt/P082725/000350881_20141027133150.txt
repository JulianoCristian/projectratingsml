1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Poverty in Benin. Per capita income growth rose from about 1 percent during 1990-95 to
3 percent in 2003, and real GDP growth accelerated from 4 percent during 1990-95 to
more than 5 percent on average since 1996. Benin, however, was still a poor country as
per capita income was only US$440 in 2003, and over 50 percent of the population was
considered extremely poor or poor.

Sectoral constraints and government strategy. Clear progress had been made in the three
primary cities included under Phase 1 of the Adaptable Program Loan (APL). This
included a significant increase of the financial resources of municipalities, as well as their
organizational and technical capacity to deliver urban services. Benin’s secondary cities
faced many of the same constraints identified during the first phase of the project,
namely:

   a. Rapid but uncontrolled urban growth (5 percent yearly over the past 20 years) -
      one of the underlying chronic problems for nearly all of the issues that Benin’s
      cities have had to deal with and continue to have to do so.
   b. Slow implementation of the current decentralization process, which was
      hampered by the (i) lack of resources at city level; (ii) difficult realignment of the
      role of line ministries; and (iii) lack of decentralization of line ministries.
   c. Lack of local capacity and weak municipal management, thereby weakening their
      capacities to manage the decentralization process.
   d. Weak municipal resource mobilization and utilization.
   e. Poor delivery of basic infrastructure and social services.

To remedy this situation, the government launched strategic actions to support urban
growth and to improve living conditions of the urban poor. These strategic actions were
supported by the World Bank and other international and bilateral agencies, leading from
1990-2004 to the provision in 35 cities for key urban services, which included: (i)
improved management of core urban services in the area of drainage and rehabilitation of
public infrastructure; (ii) provision of about 210 km of drainage and 55 km of collectors;
and (iii) significantly decreases in cases of flooding.

At additional financing. Benin’s population reached 8.7 million with a per capita income
of US$540 in 2006. Poverty remained widespread and per capita income below the
average for sub-Saharan Africa. The 2006 elections reaffirmed the importance of
decentralization as a critical issue for development. Country and sectoral issues remained
similar to those at appraisal, with urbanization rates at 41 percent and rapidly increasing
at an annual growth rate of 5 percent.

Rationale for Bank involvement. Both through its own assistance program and through
its support to the formulation of the PRSP, the Bank has played a crucial catalytic role in

                                                                                            1
mobilizing resources of the donor community’s towards public investment in urban areas.
The Bank’s credibility and convening power in the urban sector were primarily due to the
success of the 1992 Urban Rehabilitation and Management Project and the First Phase of
the Decentralized City Management APL (DCM I, approved by the Board in June 1999).
Taken together, these two projects pioneered the transfer of responsibility for the
operation and maintenance of urban infrastructure and communal services to local
communities/governments, and introduced the subsidiary principle into the vocabulary of
public investment and service delivery policy.

The first phase of the APL succeeded in improving the capacity of local government to
mobilize resources and target expenditures on priority infrastructure and services in
consultation with local population. This first phase met and surpassed some of the trigger
objectives for the second phase.

In conclusion, the project was the logical continuation of the successful first phase of the
APL. Additionally, the project, in particular through its components A and C, was fully
consistent with two of the four building blocks of the World Bank’s strategy for the urban
sector, namely: (i) Formulating national urban strategies; and (ii) Scaling up services for
the poor, including upgrading low-income urban neighborhoods.

1.2. Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The development objective of the second phase of the APL is to increase access to
infrastructure and basic services for residents of Benin's primary cities (Cotonou, Porto-
Novo and Parakou), as well as selected secondary cities (Abomey-Calavi, Lokossa and
Kandi).

The key indicators used to monitor progress towards achieving the project development
objective were the following:

   •   Growth in the revenues of municipalities;
   •   Additional population getting access to primary and secondary paved roads;
   •   Additional population protected from periodic flooding;
   •   Number of operational neighborhood development committees; and
   •   Quantity of municipal waste collected in Porto-Novo and transported out of the
       city.

1.3. Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The PDO was not revised as it remained relevant throughout the project implementation.
After the approval of the additional financing, the key indicators for monitoring progress
towards achieving the project development objective also remained the same as that of
the original project, although the target values for the indicators related to component B
were adjusted upwards to reflect the additional activities.

  1.4 Main Beneficiaries

  The main beneficiaries included: (i) residents of Benin’s primary cities (Cotonou, Porto-
  Novo and Parakou) and selected secondary cities (Abomey-Calavi, Lokossa and Kandi);
  (ii) local governments received capacity building support; (iii) cities were supported in
  their efforts to increase revenue generation to improve their capacities to finance and
  operate urban services; (iv) the poorest neighborhoods in certain cities were targeted for
  improved access to services; and (iv) local residents were encouraged to increase their
  participation in the urban development process.

  1.5 Original Components (as approved)

  The project was comprised of the following project components as per the Project
  Appraisal Document (August 22, 2005)

  Component A: Municipal Management Strengthening (Appraisal/actual cost: US$5.33
  million/US$3.51 million). The objective of this component was to improve management
  tools and financial resources of Benin's primary and selected secondary cities in order to
  enable them to better provide urban services and maintain implemented infrastructure,
  with support of relevant line ministries and devolved administrations. This component
  was divided in three subcomponents covering: (i) the three primary cities which already
  benefited from studies under Phase I; (ii) strengthening line ministries (through the MFE,
  MISD, MCPD and MEHU); and (iii) newly selected secondary cities.

  Component B: Basic Infrastructure (Appraisal/actual cost: US$21.52 million/US$22.50
  million). The objective of this component was to provide improved access to urban
  infrastructure. This priority program, consisting of 22.5 km of urban road
  reconstruction/rehabilitation works and 4.3 km of drainage construction works (as
  detailed in Annex 4 of the PAD), was: (i) pre-identified by the cities; (ii) it was also only
  made up of investments with a sufficient economic rate of return (IRR >12 percent for
  roads); and (iii) new projects were complementary to existing networks.

  Component C: Community Participation and Integration (Appraisal/actual cost:
  US$2.46 million/US$1.79 million). This component was aimed at improving access to
  basic services for residents of poor neighborhoods. Similarly to Phase I, this component
  was aimed at improving sanitary conditions and the capacity of the cities to respond to
  neighborhood concerns, as well as the capacity of neighborhoods to formulate initiatives

  communities and municipal governments. This component comprised three main

                                                                                             3
subcomponents: (a) neighborhood infrastructure; (b) community-based activities; and (c)
support to community development.

Component D: Solid waste management in Porto-Novo (Appraisal/actual cost: US$5.87
million/US$9.06 million). The objective of this component was to improve solid waste
management in Porto-Novo. The implementation of the component was divided into two
phases: (i) the first phase focused on studies and activities aimed at establishing the
foundations for the long-term integrated management of solid waste and providing
interim measures to avoid further deterioration of the environmental conditions; (ii) the
second phase involved the implementation of a comprehensive solid waste management
plan, as defined in the first phase studies, and included the construction of a landfill.

1.6. Revised Components

Component B was revised when the World Bank Board approved the additional financing
credit (see below). The revision was made to complement the successful works already
being carried out in Cotonou, Porto-Novo, and Parakou under the same component. The
original project was financing 22 km of road works and 4 km of drainage works in the six
cities and the Additional financing included an additional 9.6 km of roads and 10.8 km of
drainage works in the three primary cities.

1.7. Other significant changes

Closing date. The project closing date was extended on three occasions. The first (from
June 30, 2010 to December 31, 2010) concluded during the preparation of the additional
financing credit (for six months) was to allow for planned works to be completed. The
second (from December 31, 2010 to March 31, 2012) was to provide additional time for
the completion of works after the government lost 16 months trying to get Parliament to
approve the additional financing credit, thereby delaying the start of the work. The third
(from March 31, 2012 to June 29, 2012) was to ensure that the government will find the
shortfall amount of US$ 0.315 million equivalent (counterpart fund) and pay it to the
project account. The cumulative extension extended to 23 months.

Additional Financing. Additional financing of US$40 million was approved on
September 12, 2008 to complement the satisfactory work already being carried out in
Cotonou, Porto-Novo, and Parakou under component B. This was based on the
government request of an additional financing of CFA 17 billion. In other words, these
three primary cities had priority work programs for which funding was lacking, and
which the original project was not able to address due to IDA constraints. These
programs included the construction and rehabilitation of 260 km of roads and 167 km of
drainage. Neighborhoods in the three major cities that benefited from the additional
financing suffered from periodic flooding in the rainy season that isolated them from the
rest of the city; it also had a negative impact on people’s health and seriously hindered
access to social services and economic activities; the latter being particularly detrimental
to single, female-headed households.

Reallocation of funds and counterpart funding from the government. Credit funds were
reallocated under the original project (Credit 4117-BEN) on January 28, 2010 to reflect
actual expenses and expected expenses before the project’s closing date. This reallocation
consisted of small adjustments between categories with no change in project activities.
On July 8, 2011, credit funds were reallocated under the additional financing (Credit No.
44900-BJ) to enable the Government of Benin to smoothly complete ongoing work in
different sites and also to start the pavement and drainage works on two new roads in
Cotonou; the road to Abomey-Calavi was one of these new roads and had previously
been included in the original credit (Credit No. 4117-BEN), but was put on hold due to
insufficient funds.

A request for policy exception was approved on June 28, 2012. The request consisted of:
(i) a reallocation of funds under Credit No. 4117-BEN; (ii) a retroactive increase in the
percentage of expenditures to be financed to 100 percent for works under category (1) of
Credit No. 4117-BEN and all expenditure categories under Credit No. 4490-BJ and; (iii)
restructuring the project activities in Credit No. 4117-BEN to correspond with work
activities under Credit No. 4490-BJ. The rationale for the retroactive increase in the
disbursement percentage was to allow the project to utilize the unused funds in the
original financing to pay for outstanding contractor invoices that were to be paid from the
government’s counterpart funds. The government was unable to mobilize sufficient funds
to pay their 10 percent share of the original financing and 15 percent share of the
additional financing. This was largely due to the fact that the government had to use

                                                                                          5
allocated funds to pay for unforeseen social measures that needed to be taken during the
resettlement of communities living near the Takon landfill.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1. Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

This APL originated in 1999 as part of a larger urban sector program which also included
a sector investment loan (SIL) for secondary cities and a learning and innovation loan
(LIL) for an urban land privatization pilot. This programmatic approach was strengthened
by the strong coordination among donors in Benin’s urban sector; the collaboration with
AFD took the form of joint appraisal missions, information-sharing and studies which
were used to design projects. In addition, AFD’s parallel financing almost doubled from
Phase I, reflecting a strong commitment to the urban sector.

The project built on previous experiences from Phase 1, as well as other completed
projects; these consisted mainly of: (i) strengthening central-level coordination to ensure
smooth project implementation; (ii) building capacity within the line ministry to ensure
project sustainability; (iii) reducing staff turnover through signed agreements between the
State and the cities to ensure that municipalities retain key staff during the project
implementation period; (iv) improving the quality of works supervision at both the level
of MEHU and cities’ through specific trainings and technical assistances; and (v)
mitigating social risks by putting in place a resettlement framework 1.

The project was in line with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) which specified,
among others, the need for increased project selectivity and greater donor harmonization,
using Benin’s own institutions, as well as with:

      a) The first Government’s Poverty Reduction Strategy 2 (PRS) which was built on
         four pillars and to which the project responded directly or indirectly to: (i) Pillar
         2, “Developing human capital and environmental management”; by providing
         capacity to the municipalities for carrying out environmental planning and
         implementing and maintaining environmental infrastructure; (ii) Pillar 3,
         “Strengthening good governance and institutional capacity”; by improving
         governance and institutional reforms through support to the decentralization
         process; and (iii) Pillar 4, “Promoting employment and strengthening the ability
         of the poor to participate in decision-making and production processes”; through
         a local participation component, putting in place channels for participation of poor
         neighborhoods in their own infrastructure development; and



1
  Resettlement was not planned during Phase 1. However, some resettlement activity took place without a
resettlement framework being in place.

2
    The PRS paper was approved by the government in January 2003 following broad-based consultations.


                                                                                                          6
      b) The second PRS (2007-2009) that focused on: Accelerating growth; using
         infrastructure development as a tool for growth; developing human capital;
         improving governance; and promoting balanced and sustainable development.

Quality at entry
This ICR rates the quality at entry as satisfactory. The project was designed to directly
respond to key municipal sector challenges in Benin, and notably the: rapid but
uncontrolled urban growth taking place in the country; slow implementation of the
current decentralization process; lack of local capacity and weak municipal management;
weak municipal resource mobilization and utilization; and poor delivery of basic social
services. The overall PDO was consistent with project components and implemented
activities, particularly those focusing on increasing access to infrastructure and basic
services for residents of Benin’s primary cities and selected secondary cities. The
components were straightforward and complementary and linked to the development
objective. The project directly financed basic services and infrastructure investments, and
carefully targeted activities aimed at strengthening financial and management capacities
of municipalities to assure the durability and continuity of municipal investments. The
PDO was also consistent with project components, outputs, and outcomes. The project
was well balanced in terms of infrastructure investments and institutional strengthening
activities aiming at sustaining outcomes.

2.2 Implementation

As previously mentioned, the project closing date was extended on three occasions for a
total of 23 months 3. The Mid-Term Review (MTR) was held in December 2008 after
having been postponed in April 2008 due to delays in the delivery of the socio-
environmental reports related to component D. At mid-term, the government had met all
safeguards and institutional conditions for the construction and operation of a landfill in
Porto-Novo, and all effectiveness conditions for the additional financing were in place,
and the project was on track to meet the end-of-project targets.

The government was unable to mobilize sufficient funds to pay for their 10 percent share
of the original financing and 15 percent share of the additional financing. This was
largely due to the fact that the government had to use allocated funds to pay for
unforeseen social measures that needed to be taken during the resettlement of
communities living near the Takon landfill. These measures consisted of three classroom
blocs, eight toilets, roads, clinics, a community center, electricity and a small-scale water
supply; these were supplied to compensate communities whose land was acquired for the
construction of the landfill at Takon, Porto-Novo, amounting to CFA 830 million.

Due to the inability to fulfill the counterpart financing requirement, the government
requested a reallocation of funds, and on July 8, 2011, credit funds were reallocated

    Refer to section 1.7 for further details.


                                                                                           7
under the additional financing (Credit No. 44900-BJ) to enable the government to
complete ongoing work at different sites, and also to start the pavement and drainage
works on two new roads in Cotonou, particularly the road to Abomey-Calavi which was
previously under the original credit (Credit No. 4117-BEN), but had been put on hold due
to insufficient funds.

Based on the supervision missions, as well as the technical audit that was conducted, all
project activities were satisfactory completed and delivered in a timely manner. On the
other hand, at closure, the Takon landfill was still not being exploited, and the operating
contract was only signed six months after project closing date. Those delays were
primarily due to clearance delays at the level of the national board for procurement
control.

The project was implemented using in a participatory approach, which included the
establishment of neighborhood development committees charged with supervising and
operating social infrastructure projects, local supervision committees and beneficiary
committees with a specific role of supervising works in their neighborhoods; and
empowering beneficiaries on the management of assets. This collaborative approach
reduced potential tensions during implementation and increased the sense of ownership
among communities, thereby ensuring the optimal usage and sustainability of assets.

2.3. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E design. A total of 17 project indicators were identified in Annex 3 of the PAD.
These are presented in the data sheet along with baseline values, targets, and progress by
project closure. The indicators were not modified during project implementation and
targets of component B indicators were only updated to reflect new additional financing,
which reflects the proper design. Project indicators covered both project outputs and
outcomes, which makes it possible to cross check results.

M&E implementation and utilization. Monitoring and evaluation activities were carried
out by the task team in partnership with the coordination and implementation units on the
basis of the agreed-upon indicators. Arrangements for results monitoring were
established at the design stage; this included defining the frequency, the instruments, and
who had responsibility for data collection and updating the indicators. In addition to
normal supervision practices and reporting, the indicators were updated during every
mission and reported in both the AM and ISRs. On the other hand, some challenges were
faced when updating municipal performance indicators, especially those related to
increases in municipal revenues. In addition, access to infrastructure indicators, and
specifically those on access to primary and secondary roads and population protected
from periodic floods, were reported differently (different baselines) in the ISRs than in
the AF documents. Appropriate data collected on the indicators was evaluated and used
during supervision missions, and also for decision-making on policy work. Indicators
related to fiscal revenues and expenditures continue to be used by municipalities as
benchmarks to auto-monitor their performances.



                                                                                         8
2.4. Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards

The project was classified as a category “B” project and complied with all safeguard
requirements. The project triggered two safeguard policies, namely: Environmental
Assessment (OP/BP 4.01) and Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12). At entry, the
required and appropriate safeguards instruments: environmental and social management
framework (ESMF) and resettlement policy framework (RPF) were prepared and
disclosed in-country and the Infoshop on May 19, 2005 and May 20, 2005, respectively.
During implementation, environmental impact assessments (EIAs) with detailed
environmental and social management plans were prepared and implemented for project
activities in Cotonou, Parakou, and Porto Novo. Further, elaborate resettlement action
plans (RAPs) were prepared and implemented prior to the commencement of civil works;
EIAs and RAPs were used during the work on the landfill at Takon (Porto Novo) and
during the construction and rehabilitation of drainage collectors in Cotonou, Parakou and
Porto Novo.

The project benefited from regular safeguards supervision by Bank safeguards specialists
(environment and social) based in the field. The project also benefited from monitoring
visits from the Benin Environment Agency, which in most cases certified the project’s
adherence to national environment assessment policy by approving and providing the
certificate of environmental conformity of all the civil works carried out under the project.
The implementing agencies (AGETUR and SERHAU) who were in charge of
implementing the first phase of this APL have acquired experience in dealing with
environmental and social impacts of urban infrastructure investments such as those
financed under the project; they also ensured that supervising consultants adhered to the
recommendations and procedures contained in the enterprise ESMP. This was confirmed
by World Bank safeguards specialists during supervision missions.

Finally, the project helped build environmental management and assessments capacities
in the participating cities and municipalities through the organization of training seminars
on environmental and social assessments facilitated by the Bank’s safeguards specialists.
These training workshops were well received by government officials and consultants
participating in the workshops. The rating for safeguards is satisfactory.

Fiduciary

The project had an adequate project financial management system that provided, with
reasonable assurance, accurate and timely information that funds were being used for
their intended purposes. The project’s accounting and financial reporting systems were in
line with national and Bank procedures. Special project accounts were created and
financial statements and reports were prepared in line with Bank procedures. In addition
to annual financial audits 4, an effective internal control system was maintained to ensure

    Financial audits were not qualified
                                                                                           9
that project expenditures were properly authorized, supporting documents were
maintained, accounts were reconciled periodically, and project assets, including cash,
were safeguarded.

Yearly procurement plans were developed and shared with the Bank team for review. The
updated procurement plans were disclosed publicly in time in accordance with the Bank’s
requirements. Procurement of all works and goods, as well as selection of consultants
under this project was carried out satisfactorily by following the Bank’s procurement and
consultants guidelines. Procurement documents were found to be properly maintained,
and the two PIUs had adequate capacity with qualified staff in carrying out procurement
under the project. The project funds were used for their intended purpose.

2.5. Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

All new assets have been handed over to relevant municipalities. Some equipment will be
operated in coordination with line ministries, such as the Ministry of Education with
regards to schools, the Ministry of Health with regards to health centers, and the Ministry
of the Environment with regards to solid waste management facilities. Although the pre-
collection, collection and transfer services of solid-waste in targeted areas in Porto-Novo
has been launched and has proven satisfactory (pre-collection is managed by local NGOs,
while collection and transfer are being contracted to local firms) the Takon landfill was
still not operational.

The oversight and operation of social infrastructure (health centers, schools, community
development centers, water fountains, etc.) will fall under the responsibility of
neighborhood development committees (NDC) that are already ensuring proper O&M,
and are to a certain degree financially viable. Having said that, some NDCs still require
financial and technical support from municipalities, and management contracts between
the municipalities and NDCs have yet to be signed. These contracts will clearly assign
roles and responsibilities (including financial responsibilities and commitments) between
both parties.

In addition, the project supported municipalities to put in place O&M processes for
infrastructure assets through numerous TA activities. These resulted in: (i) creating a
separate budget line for maintenance purposes; (ii) setting targets on budget
commitments for O&M budget allocation; and (iii) creating municipal maintenance teams.
Roads are regularly cleaned and primary and secondary drainage networks are
maintained prior to each rainy season. Although municipalities are committed to
sustaining their assets, their financial and technical capacities are still too limited to cope
with the pool of existing and newly handed-over assets.

To sustain project outcomes, the project focused on improving municipal capacities
through: (i) improving municipal finances; and (ii) designing and putting in place
municipal procedures and operations (MPO) manuals. The impact of the studies on
improving municipal finances was positive enough to ensure their financial viability



                                                                                           10
amidst the push for decentralization, as shown in the table below. All municipalities
overachieved, especially the secondary cities subject for the first time to such reforms 5.

Those outcomes were strengthened by the studies on municipal cash-flow; the
establishment of transparent and rigorous finance systems; and the elaboration of an
urban land registry system, allowing the identification (and ensuing increase) of taxable
assets, as well as improving the transparency of the collection process. In addition, the
elaboration of the MPO manuals identified strengths and weaknesses in project
performance, as well as areas in the program where changes were needed. Having said
that, those activities would have further benefited from a programmatic follow-up process
to ensure all measures had been implemented and to update inadequate measures.

The positive outcomes of this project, coupled by the major challenges and opportunities
urban areas present, led the country management unit to make urban as its priority sector
in the new CAS. Furthermore, the Government of Benin requested additional Bank
engagement in the urban sector. A preparation mission was carried out and a project
concept note was approved with the objective of “improving urban management to
increase access to urban services in targeted cities of Benin.” This new urban project
which is being designed to pursue a similar programmatic approach and build on
previous experiences will focus on: (i) improving service delivery in a larger number of
cities, with a focus on local economic development; (ii) improve municipal capacities in
investment planning and programming, financial management, procurement, safeguards,
M&E and the development and maintenance of infrastructure and services; and (iii)
improve performance and transparency by targeting weaknesses in the fiscal transfer
system on the local and national levels. Those activities and others are still being
discussed with the government.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1. Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The objective remains highly relevant and reflects the proper diagnosis of development
priorities. Long-term and sustained efforts in the municipal development sector have
resulted in substantive improvements in infrastructure and local service provision. Project


5
    PGUD-1conducted similar reforms targeting primary cities.


                                                                                        11
objectives and design were consistent with the PRSP-2 (2007-2009). Although
infrastructure has been improved in six cities, infrastructure and service demands are still
huge across the country. Improving living conditions and access to economic
opportunities continue to be relevant in a country where more than a third of the
population lives below poverty line. The PDO remains relevant to Benin’s new poverty
reduction strategy for 2011-2015, the Stratégie de Croissance pour la Réduction de la
Pauvreté (PRSP-3), which retains the same strategic pillars as PRSP-2 in that it foresees:
(i) accelerating sustainable growth that will contribute to transforming the economy; (ii)
infrastructure development; (iii) reinforcement of human capital; (iv) improving the
quality of governance; and (v) promoting equitable and sustainable national development.

The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Benin for FY09-12 (Report No 46485 – BJ)
was discussed by the Board on February 26, 2009. The CAS has three key pillars: (i)
strengthening competitiveness and accelerating private sector-led growth; (ii) improving
access to basic services; and (iii) promoting better governance and strengthening
institutional capacities. The project directly supported the second and third pillars by
financing the construction of basic community infrastructure and supporting the
government’s decentralization efforts and help local authorities to align their
development plans with community priorities.

3.2. Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The development objective of the second phase of the APL was to increase access to
infrastructure and basic services for residents of Benin's primary cities (Cotonou, Porto-
Novo and Parakou) and selected secondary cities (Abomey-Calavi, Lokossa and Kandi),
and this objective was achieved. The project accomplished concrete and tangible results
by contributing to the financing of infrastructure in the six cities. The borrower’s
evaluation shows that activities were implemented and, to a large extent, achieved
satisfactory targets in all six cities 6.

Under the project, the construction of 37.63 km of paved roads (against a target of 32.18
km promised in the PAD), 15.41 km of primary drainage networks, and 45.5 km of
secondary drainage networks (against a total target of 14.8) was completed. Those
outputs allowed 446,520 more people (against a target of 336,000) to have access to
paved roads and 526,184 people to benefit from reduced exposure to flood risk of
(against a target of 114,000 persons). In addition, the project built nine three-class and
two two-class modules, 21 four-block latrines, two equipped health centers and the re-
equipping of others, 14 water kiosks, three public gardens and two markets. The
construction of new classrooms increased the number of pupils attending the beneficiary
schools to more than 1,300 and health centers have been visited regularly for
consultations (an average of 20 consultations daily per HC); assisted deliveries also
increased (between two and eight a day depending on the HC). The markets that were
built provided additional resources for the beneficiary cities. On top of these results,
property and rental prices increased along newly paved roads, and numerous commercial

activities were established, affecting social well-being, as well as tax revenues for
beneficiary cities.

In addition, the project completed the construction of a new landfill, five new and nine
rehabilitated secondary refuse transfer stations, the procurement of rolling stocks, and the
elaboration of numerous studies to build SWM capacities in Porto Novo and Cotonou
municipalities. Thanks to the project, 115,000 additional people have access to improved
solid waste collection, with direct benefits to local environmental quality and public
health, as well as the employment of local NGOs to undertake the pre-collection of waste.
The landfill was not operational at project closure as construction works had only just
come to a close before the project closed, thus the full benefits have not yet been attained.

Furthermore, numerous activities 7 were conducted to build municipal capacities in areas
related to municipal finances and management. Specifically, those activities supported
municipalities’ efforts to increasing their revenues ranging from 23 to 223 percent over
the project’s duration, as well as improving their budget management and overall
municipal procedures. More specifically, those activities supported: (i) the improvement
of municipalities’ financial viability; (ii) the decentralization process; and (iii) building
municipalities’ capacities to better sustain newly transferred assets, particularly through
proper budget planning.

3.3 Efficiency 8

An ex post economic analysis was performed for the Second Projet de Gestion Urbaine
Décentralisée over the lifetime of the project, i.e., the 2006-2011 periods or 6 years
although an economic analysis was not performed ex ante except for the road
subcomponent that yielded an economic rate of return (ERR) discounted at 12% of 24%
with a Net Present Value (NPV) of US$ 9.5 million. Yet, it is expected that the benefits
will accrue beyond the project implementation but were not calculated. Moreover, the ex post
economic analysis covered the implemented project components as considered in the
Proposed Project Restructuring of June 26, 2008 (PR Report No: 65871-BJ).

Deriving the economic analysis benefits is made difficult by the complexity and
heterogeneity of the health (e.g., less water-borne diseases although vector-borne could
not be considered), environmental (less seepage, etc.), economic (numerous benefits
although job creation was not accounted for) and social (numerous in terms of access,
quality of life, etc.) outcomes from improving 4 components. Nevertheless, the benefits
derived for component A were derived from the incremental municipal revenues in all the
communes from 2006 to 2010 as compared to 2005 in constant terms. Most of the
benefits for components B, C and D were derived from a survey that was conducted in
the early 2012 (AGETUR and BOPEN, 2012). Most of the survey questions helped
derive the perceptions of the targeted population in 6 communes, namely Cotonou,
Abomey-Calavi, Kandi, Parakou, Lokossa and Porto-Novo housing a total population of

562,142 inhabitants. Although the survey quantitative results were robust and
representative (sample of 1,646 with 95% confidence level and ±3% confidence interval),
only a fraction of the perception results was monetized and used to derive the project
benefits which however represent a very conservative share of the overall short to long
term benefits.

The project economic NPV discounted at 10%, the benefit/cost ratio, the ERR and the
MERR are illustrated in Table 5. Although the road subcomponent is not considered in
the economic analysis, it is definitely positive based on the ERR at appraisal (24%) and
the achievements that exceeded the planned road subcomponent (37 km instead of 22.4
km). Moreover, a lower weight was assigned to Component A as not all the increase in
fiscal revenue is considered to be attributable to the project.

The project is economically viable with a NPV reaching US$ 96.4 million with an ERR
and a MERR of 56% and 40% respectively and a PV B/C ratio of 1.4. No sensitivity
analysis is needed as this is an ex-post evaluation with the benefits considered accruing
during the implementation of the project (Table 5). Nevertheless, with proper operations
and maintenance, the benefits will keep on accruing over the next years.

3.4. Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

The overall project outcome is rated satisfactory as the project succeeded in achieving
PDO indicators, as well as all intermediate indicators. Living conditions were improved
according to the indicator targets set at project design, with minor targets undergoing an
upward adjustment at additional financing. Service delivery clearly improved, and at a
satisfactory level of efficiency. The project further remains highly relevant to current
government and Bank priorities. Furthermore, the analysis of project efficiency revealed
positive results, particularly with regard to design and implementation.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

With PGUD-2 investments in selected cities, local populations felt engaged in the design,
implementation, and operation processes. The framework the project adopted through the
establishment of NDCs, CLSs, and NCs only strengthened this approach. The project
improved: (i) access to roads and enhanced mobility, and reduced flood impacts; and (ii)
social well-being through improved and frequent streets cleaning, access to parks, health
centers and schools, as well as improved solid waste management in selected

                                                                                          14
neighborhoods of Porto-Novo. Specifically the project improved, through the
construction of health centers, access to maternal and neonatal care; the enrollment of
girls in education was supported through the construction, equipping, and rehabilitation
of schools; and through the landscaping of public spaces for families to access safe and
clean playing and recreational areas. The project adopted labor-intensive construction
techniques to increase short term-employability. In addition, many sustainable jobs were
created around maintenance services (street cleaning and drain network maintenances), as
well as SWM especially with the micro-collection via contracting numerous NGOs and
enterprises.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

Although the PDO did not come to mention institutional reforms, the project did support
decentralization and local government reforms. Specifically, the project undertook
numerous studies that did induce change through building capacities at the level of
selected municipalities, specifically in the areas of: (i) increasing municipal revenues; (ii)
managing resources and sustaining assets; (iii) improved technical and administrative
municipal management; (iii) improved solid waste management; and (iv) increased the
quality of local participation.

(i)        Increasing municipal revenues: The project conducted six studies 9 on finding
           ways to increase municipal capacity to generate additional revenues, as well as
           improve tax collection decentralized services. The implementation of the studies’
           recommendations led to a large increase in both fiscal and non-fiscal revenues
           (refer to Table 4. Municipal revenues trends - 2005 to 2010). Nevertheless, some
           challenges were faced in the collaboration between the regional tax authorities
           and municipal revenue collection teams. Those revenue increases allowed
           municipalities to respect their commitments with regards to budget allocations for
           maintenance services.

(ii)       Managing resources and sustaining assets: The project included asset
           maintenance programs, as well as the establishment of municipal maintenance
           teams. This allows municipalities to programmatically budget and plan for
           maintenance services, depending on the type of infrastructure. In addition, budget
           performance indicators were assigned to each municipality, notably: a) ratios of
           recurrent costs budget allocated and spent on infrastructure and basic services, i.e.
           all recurrent costs by administrative operating expenses (as a percentage of total
           expenditures); and b) the share of municipalities’ recurrent costs budgets allocated
           and spent on routine road maintenance (as a percentage of total expenditures).
           Although not properly monitored, those ratios were to a large extent respected,
           allowing a larger share of increases in revenues to feed into sustaining existing
           and newly-built assets, as well as further expanding infrastructure networks.

        A: Administrative operating expenses
        I: Budget allocated and spent on infrastructure and basic services


(iii)   Improved technical and administrative municipal management: A new MOP
        manual for technical and administrative management for the three main cities was
        drafted under the project, in close collaboration with relevant departments. In
        addition, it provided equipment and relevant trainings to build proper archiving
        systems. Positive outcomes were visible, especially with regard to the efficiency
        of some administrative processes. The MOP manuals became relatively obsolete
        and documents were selectively implemented due to the lack of proper monitoring,
        evaluation and updating framework.

(iv)    Improved municipal management: In addition to financing needed infrastructure,
        the project conducted numerous studies targeting the management and financing
        of the SWM sector at the municipal level to ensure its viability and replicability.
        Those activities allowed the organization of SWM from micro-collection to
        disposal integrating multiple stakeholders (households, NGOs, firms, SWM units,
        media, municipality and the State). Lessons learned from this experience are
        being replicated in other municipalities.

However, the project lacked a comprehensive implementation process for many
institutional capacity-building activities. Neither adequate resources nor time were
invested to make sure those were properly implemented, and successes were mostly
based on the enthusiasm and goodwill of PIUs and municipalities.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

In addition to the above-mentioned outcomes, the studies and methodologies utilized to
improve municipal management and solid waste management processes are being
exploited across the country. In addition, the government and municipalities are
increasingly adopting a balanced approach between infrastructure investments on one
hand, and institutional development, building and transferring of capacities and including

                                                                                                  16
beneficiaries in the design, implementation, and operation of assets on the other. This
resulted in increased demands by the government to further focus on the institutional
aspects in future Bank engagements. Furthermore, fiduciary and safeguard skills
developed during the project by government agencies and firms are to a certain extent
being utilized across different projects.

3.6. Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

A beneficiary survey was conducted in early 2012 as part of the client’s elaboration of
the Socio-Economic and Environmental evaluation of the project, specifically those
related to components B, C and D (AGETUR and BOPEN, 2012) 10. Most of the survey
questions helped derive the perceptions of the targeted population in the 6 cities, namely
Cotonou, Abomey-Calavi, Kandi, Parakou, Lokossa and Porto-Novo housing a total
population of 562,142 inhabitants. The survey quantitative results were robust and
representative (sample of 1,646 with 95% confidence level and ±3% confidence interval).

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

The overall risk to the development outcome is rated as moderate given the commitment
level of the Government of Benin, and in particular municipal authorities (mayors), to
sustain project outcomes. The discussion of the key risks to development outcomes are as
follows:

      •    Institutional risks to development outcome are moderate. Capacities built on the
           municipal level are embedded in the systems and staff at different levels, reducing
           the potential negative impacts of limited future staff mobility. Municipalities are
           committed to sustaining efforts aimed at improving their processes, as well as
           further implement studies’ recommendation.
      •    Financial risk to development outcomes is moderate. Although municipalities still
           face large financial challenges, the project aimed at improving their financial
           situations. Financial and sustainability indicators were designed to help sustain
           development outcomes. As noted in section 2.5, fiscal and non-fiscal revenues of
           municipalities have increased dramatically under the project, and as section 3.5
           shows, municipalities are making serious efforts to respect expenditure ratios. In
           addition to ensuring financial viability, those measures will help ensure
           availability of funds for operations and maintenance which would help sustain the
           rehabilitated and newly-constructed infrastructure.
      •    Infrastructural risk to development outcomes is low. The rehabilitation and
           installation of key infrastructure assets have improved the access to services
           (including social services) in targeted areas. With improved own revenues, these

       development outcomes should be maintained as municipalities will be able to
       undertake regular maintenance of the facilities.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1. Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

Bank performance at project preparation is rated as satisfactory. During project
preparation, the Bank maintained an intense dialogue with the government via the inter-
ministerial committee (COSUCO), the project coordination unit under the Ministry of
Environment, Housing and Urban Development (MEHU), implementing agencies
(SERHAU SA and AGETUR), as well as local authorities, decision makers, local
communities, and other key stakeholders. The Bank team integrated lessons learned from
previous projects, especially the PGUD-1, and made full use of studies undertaken under
the PGUD-1. These have laid a solid base for development and adoption of the project
with the introduction of targeted institutional building activities in all six cities. As
previously mentioned the M&E (design of results framework and project indicators) was
highly relevant to development objectives and reflected both outputs and outcomes.
Project indicators were not modified during project implementation, reflecting the
relevance and simplicity of design.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank’s team provided a high degree of coordination not only with the coordination
and implementing agencies (SERHAU SA and AGETUR), but also with the oversight
ministry. Two supervision missions were undertaken each year by the Bank. A number of
field visits were undertaken to ensure compliance with safeguard policies, and to verify
physical progress and achievements. There were also regular, monthly and (even) bi-
weekly follow-up reviews in instances where the project was facing substantial delays or
needed to be put back on track. The Bank’s implementation status reports (ISRs)
realistically rated the performance of the project and provided project progress
information to Bank management. There was also a very high level of inputs from the
Bank’s procurement, financial and safeguards staff throughout the project, both in
ensuring that fiduciary requirements were met, and in providing specific relevant
trainings.

The significant project implementation delays were discussed with Bank management;
the latter provided sufficient guidance to the task team to assist relevant counterparts in
addressing project issues. The Bank team closely worked with the project coordination
unit (PCU) and the two PIUs once the progress milestones were agreed and appropriately
adjusted the project activities in order to minimize the negative aspects those delays
could have incurred. Those efforts minimized the negative impacts the delays could have
incurred. During implementation, the Bank showed its readiness, and not only acceded to

                                                                                        18
all the requested extensions but also responded positively for additional financing request.
The project’s implementation was rated satisfactory in most ISRs.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory.

On the basis of the above assessment of Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry
and in supervision, overall Bank performance is rated satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

Although it proved to be very committed to the success of the project, and provided the
needed support to its preparation and implementation, the Government performance is
rated Moderately Satisfactory due to (i) the substantial delays for approving the
additional financing; and (ii) failing to deliver to its committed counterpart funding. At
the municipal level, the municipal authorities were very committed, and were involved at
all stages of project preparation and implementation. For example, a majority of the
mayors were committed to successful implementation of project interventions, assisting
and intervening directly, resolving key implementation issues with the PCU and PIUs.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory.

The implementation agencies’ performance is rated as satisfactory. The PCU and PIUs
worked closely with the Bank team in ensuring quality of project preparation. The PCU
and PIUs, in collaboration with the municipal authorities, played an effective role in the
preparatory work for the selection of projects at municipal and community levels, guiding
the municipalities and the communities to meet all pre-set criteria for projects selection.

The PIUs performed remarkably because of their prior experience with Bank financial
management and procurement procedures, and the quality of its management and staff.
The PCU ensured that Bank procurement and disbursement rules and procedures have
been followed, and safeguards properly observed. It facilitated all supervision missions
and effectively served as a link between the Bank and the PIUs, as well as the
government.

During implementation, the PCU as well as PIUs were very committed to the
achievement of the PDOs. They worked diligently to respond to all queries from the
Bank team as well as those from the government. They maintained high standards for
civil works through regular monitoring and supervision of subproject activities. When
substandard work was observed on some sites, pragmatic measures were implemented
and site visits were constantly organized with different consultants to supervise and
monitor works progress, significantly improving implementation and outcomes. Findings


                                                                                        19
from independent audit and evaluation reports acknowledge the PCU and PIUs handled
management of project implementation very well.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory.

On the basis of the above assessment regarding government and implementing agencies’

6. Lessons Learned

The lessons learnt from the project can be summarized as follows:

   •   Keeping the scope of the project straightforward and simple and at the same time
       including some forward looking developmental elements. The maximum feasible
       amount of flexibility in implementation greatly facilitates the successful
       implementation of projects of such nature.
   •   A programmatic project approach (over 10 years), targeting a limited number of
       cities increases both the sustained access to infrastructure, as well as the
       institutional building positive impacts.
   •   Scaling-up the approach is necessary to reflect seriousness with regards to
       supporting the decentralization process. Limiting the scope to the city-scale
       might hinder the capacity to impact national urban policies, especially those
       related to fiscal transfers, urban planning, among others. The Bank must consider
       scaling-up to a broader national program targeting the urban environment, while
       keeping a specific focus on large cities as well as local engagement.
   •   Taking advantage of existing implementation capacity and extending the life of an
       already proven and tested PCU and PIUs rather than creating new structures
       helped safeguard institutional memory, and improved the success of the project
       through challenging instances. This project built on what was already there and
       working.
   •   Designing a proper implementation framework for institution-building
       components improves outcomes. Although the project conducted very interesting
       studies and capacity-building exercises, they did not fit into a comprehensive
       framework that could incorporate M&E and fine-tune approaches with regards to
       institutional activities.
   •   Experience sharing on decentralization will facilitate Bank dialogue on potential
       reforms and reassure counterparts. Many countries in Africa have been through
       similar decentralization processes; many lessons learned need to be shared with
       the Government of Benin in order to integrate them in their decentralization
       action plan. This will clarify challenges the government and local authorities
       might envisage during the process, learn from others’ failures and successes, and
       plan accordingly.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

A. Background

1. An ex post economic analysis was performed for the Second Projet de Gestion
   Urbaine Décentralisée over the lifetime of the project, i.e., the 2006-2011 periods or
   6 years although an economic analysis was not performed ex ante except for the road
   subcomponent that yielded an economic rate of return (ERR) discounted at 12% of
   24% with a Net Present Value (NPV) of US$ 9.5 million. Yet, it is expected that the
   benefits will accrue beyond the project implementation but were not calculated. Moreover,
   the ex post economic analysis covered the implemented project components as
   considered in the Proposed Project Restructuring of June 26, 2008 (PR Report No:
   65871-BJ).

2. The project has 4 components and sub-components of the four components were
   covered under the economic analysis:
     • Component A: Municipal Management Strengthening
     • Component B: Basic infrastructure in urban areas
     • Component C: Community participation and integration
     • Component D: Porto-Novo solid waste management

3. The economic costs of the project were adjusted for shadow pricing (see Attachment
   1 for more details) and are illustrated in Table A3.1.

4. Deriving the economic analysis benefits is made difficult by the complexity and
   heterogeneity of the health (e.g., less water-borne diseases although vector-borne
   could not be considered), environmental (less seepage, etc.), economic (numerous
   benefits although job creation was not accounted for) and social (numerous in terms
   of access, quality of life, etc.) outcomes from improving 4 components. Nevertheless,
   the benefits derived for component A were derived from the incremental municipal
   revenues in all the communes from 2006 to 2010 as compared to 2005 in constant
   terms (Egbeto, 2012). Most of the benefits for components B, C and D were derived
   from a survey that was conducted in the early 2012 (AGETUR and BOPEN, 2012).

                                                                                                          38
    Most of the survey questions helped derive the perceptions of the targeted population
    in 6 communes, namely Cotonou, Abomey-Calavi, Kandi, Parakou, Lokossa and
    Porto-Novo housing a total population of 562,142 inhabitants. Although the survey
    quantitative results were robust and representative (sample of 1,646 with 95%
    confidence level and ±3% confidence interval), only a fraction of the perception
    results was monetized and used to derive the project benefits which however
    represent a very conservative share of the overall short to long term benefits.

B. Economic Analysis Results

5. The project economic and dataset are illustrated in Tables A3.2 and A3.3 respectively.
   Only the net incremental municipal revenues in constant terms over the 2006-10
   periods are considered as benefits in the economic analysis and increase by 6.2% per
   annum over the period. Moreover, all the costs associated with the component are
   considered and annualized over the first 5 years of the project life.

Economic Analysis for Component B - NPV, ERR, MERR and PV Benefit/Cost Ratio

7. The project dataset and economic analysis are illustrated in Tables A3.4 and A3.5
   respectively. One of the 2 subcomponents is considered:
   • the drainage subcomponent with benefits derived from the hedonic value increase
       of the lots around the drainage system (150 m on average from each side of the
       drainage installed) where the perceived net incremental price of land is calculated
       in Table A3.5; and the people no longer affected by flooding during the last 2
       years with a monetization in terms of gross value added at factor cost/capita per
       day by 20 days of forgone flooding by the population no longer affected by
       flooding (981,000 residents), which is assumed to represent a share of the gained
       economic activity as perceived by the surveyed population (Table A3.4).
   • The roads subcomponent was not considered as the traffic count was not
       performed at the end of the project. However, since the road implementation
       exceeded the original estimates from 22.4 km to 37.5 km in the 6 communes, it is
       safe to assume that the project exceeded the ERR calculated at appraisal of 24%
       with a sensitivity of 15%. Moreover, the final ERR of roads in the parent project
       funded by AfD was calculated using the Roads Economic Decision Model (RED)
       to be 26.5% surpassing the initial while the one for the additional financing was
       calculated to be 55% also surpassing the initial estimates.

14. Component D is not economically viable with a NPV reaching US$ -4.2 million with
    a negative ERR and MERR, and a PV B/C ratio of 0.2. Most expenditures in terms of
    the rehabilitation of dumps are sink costs that will not generate any revenues and are
    due to past neglect. Moreover, by the end of the project, the target of 100% collection
    was not attained. Both factors contributed towards a negative ERR and MERR.

15. The project economic NPV discounted at 10%, the benefit/cost ratio, the ERR and the
    MERR are illustrated in Table A3.9. Although the road subcomponent is not
    considered in the economic analysis, it is definitely positive based on the ERR at
    appraisal (24%) and the achievements that exceeded the planned road subcomponent
    (37 km instead of 22.4 km). Moreover, a lower weight was assigned to Component A
    as not all the increase in fiscal revenue is considered to be attributable to the project.

16. The project is economically viable with a NPV reaching US$ 96.4 million with an
    ERR and a MERR of 56% and 40% respectively and a PV B/C ratio of 1.4. No
    sensitivity analysis is needed as this is an ex-post evaluation with the benefits
    considered accruing during the implementation of the project (Table A3.9).

                         Attachment I to the Economic Analysis

A. Background

1. Financial analysis (i.e., commercial profitability analysis) and economic analysis (i.e.,
   national profitability analysis) differ in several ways. The objective of commercial
   profitability analysis is to assess the net financial results of a project from the investor
   point of view, while the national profitability analysis aims to identify and measure
   the net economic benefits of the project from the society point of view. Moreover,
   commercial profitability analysis is based on prevailing market prices, while national
   profitability analysis is determined with the help of adjusted prices (i.e., shadow
   prices) that are deemed to be an approximation of true economic prices (reflecting the
   social opportunity cost). Similarly, for commercial profitability analysis, the time
   value of money is tackled by application of the private discount rate based on the
   prevailing interest rate of the capital market, while in the case of national profitability
   analysis, the social discount rate is applied, i.e., the rate at which Benin can borrow
   money taking into consideration the country risk.

2. Three to four indicators are usually considered in the economic analysis to determine
   the viability of the project:
    • The Net Present Value (NPV) which is the difference between the discounted
        total benefits and cost;
    • The Internal Rate of Return (ERR), which is the discount rate that zeroes out the
        NPV or, the interest rate that makes the NPV of all cash flows equal to zero. In
        other words, the ERR estimates the actual return on the project, expressed as a
        percentage or interest rate.
    • The modified Internal Rate of Return (MERR), which is the discount rate that
        zeroes out the NPV, considers that positive cash flows are reinvested at the
        country financing cost whereas the ERR assumes the project cash flows are
        reinvested at the rate of the ERR and therefore, the MERR more accurately
        reflects the cost and financial viability of a project; and
    • The Benefit-Cost Ratio, which is the ratio of the present value (PV) of benefits
        over the PV of costs over the lifetime of the project. Sometimes the Benefit-Cost
        Ratio is based on undiscounted benefits to costs, but this is a less useful measure.

B. Economic Analysis Process

3. The major difference between the financial and economic analysis is that the
   economic analysis consists in eliminating all the distortions of prices on the inputs
   used for the solid waste management process. There is therefore a need to identify
   and quantify price distortions that affect the operating expenditures as well as the
   investments. The evaluation of these distortions makes it possible to rectify the
   financial prices and to obtain the economic prices. From the corrected structure of the
   economic prices, the revaluation coefficients were estimated.



                                                                                            44
4. By looking at the social profitability of a project, shadow prices" or "opportunity
   costs are used in an economic analysis instead of market prices (real) that will help
   determine the social profitability of an investment. Shadow prices are adjusted in the
   following way:
       • Determination of Price Distortions. The conversion of the financial costs into
           economic costs is essential to reflect the value of the output for the
           community. The objective of this calculation is to determine the opportunity
           costs of both the inputs and outputs. As taxes, duties and especially subsidies
           such as for electricity constitute internal flows in the national economy, those
           were not taken into account in the calculation of the economic costs. A current
           subsidy runs at 120% of cost recovery of the Energy utilities is used to adjust
           OMEX for energy prices. 11
       • Transportation costs should be increased by 200% increase for OMEX
           transportation prices as most petroleum products were subsidized and
           smuggled from Nigeria. 12
       • Equipment, Goods and Infrastructure. A conversion factor of 0.85 has been
           applied to calculate the economic costs of equipment, goods and infrastructure
           in order to deduct from them the included taxes (construction).
       • Labor. The wages applied for unqualified skills is the minimum wage without
           the social contribution. For the skilled job salaries, the conversion factor is
           taken equal to 1 but the social contributions are not considered. Moreover,
           most labor needed for the whole project and other activities are assumed to be
           locally hired.

The conversion factors used are summarized in Table A1.1. The conversion factors used
are summarized in Table A1.1.

5. A number of additional key assumptions has been considered for the economic
   analysis:
       • A real discount rate of 10% per annum is used for the economic analysis and
           10% for the modified ERR

             •   The right-of-way including the price of land and any structures upon it is not
                 accounted in the analysis
             •   Benefits are assumed to accrue over project implementation (see Table A1.3)
                 at various periods

Risk Reduction for the Water Kiosk and Sanitation

As many of the benefits of reliable and improved water supply and improved sanitation
are difficult to quantify, the economic analysis is limited to:
 − reduced incidence of diarrheal disease;
 − reduced mortality from diarrheal disease; and
 − reduced mortality from infectious diseases associated with improved nutritional
   status in young children from reduced incidence of diarrhea.

Some clarification of these expected disease and mortality reductions are warranted. It is
considered that people without proper potable water and unimproved sanitation
represents 20% of the total population surveyed in the 6 communes. A 60% reduction in
disease and mortality is expected from having access to kiosk water and improved
sanitation. 13

Clean-up Cost

The following assumptions are used for the avoided cost of cleaning up the waste
discharged from improving the collection of 40% of the population (25% at the onset and
65% at the end of the project):
• The depth of discharge is from 1 meter.
• The average density of waste dumped is 340 kg /m³.
• Reducing the volume through the wildfires in landfills is 2/3 leaving a balance of 1/3.

The total municipal waste generated per year is used in the economic analysis. These
wastes have the potential to pollute (65,405 t) * 1/3 * 1/340 =12,000 m2. To clean the
dumps, CFA 7.6 m3 per ton (1 m2 per 1 m depth) was adopted. The avoided cost of
cleaning up is US$ 93,433 in 2012. .

Hedonic pricing of land around the landfill

The hedonic pricing model is widely accepted as a method for estimating the spatially
delineated disamenities. Although there is no such study that was performed in Benin, a
benefit transfer was applied on a study that derived very conservative results. 14 The 12
dumpsters were considered as circles to derive the first ring and the second ring of the
decrease in land value: ± 15% reduction in land prices up to 30 m in circumference
around the landfill, and ± 10% reduction in prices land in a circumference of 30 to 100 m
around the landfill. The cost per m2 was very conservative and set at CFA 10,000
whereas each dumpster area was estimated at 7,000 m2. The results are illustrated in
Table A1.4. The benefits accrue at the end of each phase and are considered for only one
year. The benefits amount to US$ 1.02 million.

Annex 5. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

The Government of Benin concluded an agreement with the World Bank for the implementation
of the Decentralized Urban Management Project (PGUD-2). This project received funding in two
stages after the initial credit was found to be insufficient to cover the priorities identified:

      The initial credit of the IDA Credit Agreement, 4117- BEN, entered into force on March, 8
        2006. The total cost of the Project was US$37.6 million, and may be broken down as
        follows: (i) World Bank: US$35 million; (ii) State of Benin: US$1.4million and (iii)
        municipalities: US$1.2 million.
      Additional funding from the IDA Credit Agreement, 4490 BJ, entered into force on June
        16, 2009. The total amount is US$47.09 million, broken down as follows: (i) World
        Bank: US$40 million; (ii) State of Benin: US$4.730 million; (iii) municipalities:
        US$2.360 million.

PGUD-2 (initial and additional) should have ended on 31st December 2010, but was first
extended to March 31, 2012, then to June 30, 2012. PGUD-2 additional financing is intended to
strengthen component B of the initial credit in cities with a special status, such as Cotonou, Porto-
Novo, and Parakou.
Project management for these operational components was delegated to two agencies, which
divided the tasks as follows:
     -   SERHAU-SA for components A, C and part of component D;

     -   AGETUR-SA for component B and part of component D.

A.       Project Outputs: After six years of project implementation, the results are as follows:

Component A results: The implementation of this component focused mainly on the
preparation of numerous studies and the training and provision of equipment to the various
stakeholders involved in the project. All of the activities planned for this component, with the
acquiescence of the World Bank, were implemented. The sole exception was the study on the
development strategy for the urban sector, which was postponed and will now be conducted as
part of the next urban project currently under preparation. The following studies, among others,
have been undertaken:

      Studies on local revenues: They have resulted in more efficient organization of the
       fiscal and non-fiscal system and yielded positive results in terms of increased
       resources for municipalities. These studies have also facilitated the adoption of
       procedural manuals on financial management and modern accounting methods,
       thereby improving municipal governance;

      Studies on procedures and institutional organization: As a result of these studies, new
       organizational charts have been developed, with a clearer delineation of functions, and
       career profiles which take account of the interests and expectations of staff members.
       Since the introduction of the organizational charts, municipalities have been able to
       increase staff numbers, following a quite rigorous recruitment process;




                                                                                                   51
     Technical studies on infrastructure, civil engineering and the environment. These
      studies have led to plans to undertake new construction work and sanitation
      infrastructure, drainage and waste collection in beneficiary communities, as well as
      community infrastructure, such as water kiosks and classroom modules. A national
      waste management strategy was developed to define the guiding principles and
      strategic guidelines, as well as the management options for this sector;

     Study on records management: as a result of this study, municipalities have been
      equipped with modern and well-appointed registries which meet the main criteria for
      records management. Archivists have been recruited and members of the mission
      noted that documents in the municipal offices visited have been properly handled;

     Studies on central administration: These studies on capacity-building in central and
      decentralized State services (MUHRFLEC, MEF, MDGLAAT, MPDEAP, MEPN) and
      the CPS/PGUD-2, were aimed at a more efficient coordination of activities on the
      ground;

     Fight against HIV/AIDS: The studies facilitated the development of a plan of action to
      step up the fight against the HIV/AIDS pandemic in urban centers and in municipalities
      with a special status.

In addition to the studies, component A provided financial resources for the extensive training of
stakeholders involved in project implementation. The various beneficiaries (municipalities,
ministries, CPS/PGUD-2) were provided with office supplies and equipment, such as vehicles,
motor cycles, IT material, office furniture, etc.

Component B results:

     Studies: Consultancy services include the various activities associated with project
      implementation, namely: (i) engineering studies; (ii) missions to monitor and control
      implementation of works, (iii) environmental and social impact assessment; and (iv)
      technical assistance to SMEs which have been awarded contracts for works and for
      various specific tasks.


     Works: In accordance with the initial Credit Agreement (Credit 4117-BEN), paving and
      drainage works were planned for the following cities : Cotonou, paving and drainage
      over a distance of 4.5 km, Porto-Novo (1.8 km), Parakou (8.8 km), Abomey-Calavi (3
      km), Kandi (2.4 km), and Lokossa (1.9 km). The additional financing agreement (Credit
      4490-BJ), provided for the completion of at least 9.6 km of urban roads and 10.8 km of
      drainage networks in the main cities. That amounts to a total of 32,000 ml of paved
      roads and 15,100 ml of drains (initial credit and additional financing).

As of June 30, 2012, the following had been achieved as a result of PGUD-2:
               37 633 ml of paved roads,
               1 335.33 ml of macadamized roads,
               45 500 ml of secondary drains,
               15 414 ml of primary drains



                                                                                               52
There have been a number of delays in the execution of these projects because of difficulties in
accessing counterpart funds from municipalities and particularly the State. Delays were also
attributed to insufficient equipment and the inexperience of some enterprises. External factors,
such as rain and the lack of cement, also contributed to the delay. Actions under PGIE and PARC
were on the whole well executed. Indeed, the targets for this component have been surpassed.

Component C results: The following activities are included under this component: (i) Technical
studies on the execution and monitoring of a number of construction projects; (ii) Studies on the
establishment of bodies, such as the neighborhood development committees; (iii) equipment and
supplies; (iv) works.

     Studies realized: All the planned studies were carried out. Technical studies dealt with
      the definition of an architectural plan to harmonize the lifestyles of the beneficiaries with
      their actual surroundings.

     Studies on the establishment of neighborhood development committees: As a result of
      these studies, it was possible at the end of PGUD-2 to set up 14 neighborhood
      development committees (CDQs) in six municipalities, which enjoy the strong support of
      support services for community initiatives – SAIC – established in these municipalities.
      The SAICs have, in collaboration with the CDQs, participated actively in the
      development of local projects, and in the implementation of re-installation plans. It must
      be emphasized that local monitoring committees – CLS – also play an important role.
      These committees are chaired by the General Secretaries of the municipalities involved,
      whose role is to supervise implementation of the projects at the local level.

    Works carried out: Rehabilitation work was carried out to the social and economic
     infrastructure in disadvantaged neighborhoods targeted by the project. These included, in
     particular, primary schools; primary health care centers; small shops and markets; water
     kiosks; community development centers; and latrines and public squares.

Component D results: Under this component, the following projects were realized: (i)
technical and environmental studies and a strategic plan of action for solid waste management;
(ii) infrastructure development; (iii) capacity building; and (iv) supplies and equipment.

     Studies: Several studies have been conducted. These include technical missions on the
      implementation, monitoring, and oversight of works, which have facilitated the
      completion of the works envisaged under this component.

     Capacity building: The following activities were carried out: (i) establishment of a solid
      waste management unit; (ii) provision of equipment for the unit; (iii) training of garbage
      collectors, landfill operators, and municipal service personnel involved in the
      management of solid waste.

     Development of a Strategic Plan of Action for solid waste management. At the start of
      the plan, a landfill site was selected, and during its initial phase, a complete evaluation of
      the environmental and social effects was carried out and an awareness-building program
      implemented.

     Infrastructure projects: The following activities were carried out : (i) destruction of
      open dumpsites; construction of nine of 12 planned waste collection centers ; (iii)
      purchase of 42 garbage skips; (iv) construction of the Takon landfill ; (v) building of



                                                                                                 53
        schools, a health center, recreation area, installation of a system for piped water,
        electrification and the improvement of the Aidjèdo access road. All these support
        infrastructure projects were covered by funding provided for the construction of the Takon
        landfill.

B.      Outcomes and Impact of the Project:

Component A: By focusing on the strengthening of the management capacity of the
municipalities, the PGUD-2 project produced the following results: All municipalities, without
exception, have seen a significant rise in the level of their resources. The use of the procedural
manual has facilitated the rapid processing and more efficient dissemination of information. The
adoption of a new organizational chart has helped to better define the attributes and
responsibilities of staff members, thereby minimizing conflicts.

The provision of new equipment and supplies helped to modernize working methods and improve
working conditions. Reports are of a higher standard and now produced in record time. Visits by
agents to municipal project sites are more frequent. Indeed, PGUD-2 has helped to increase
efficiency and effectiveness in the systems and processes of urban governance and has improved
revenue generation.

Component B: The construction and installation of basic infrastructure has produced the
following benefits: the creation of new jobs; the incentivization of the private sector; protection of
the population against flooding; and favorable economic spin-offs. There have also been
improvements in public health, particularly among the most vulnerable (children and the elderly).
Social communication has been enhanced, as residents have gained easier access to municipal and
State services, following the “opening up” of communities as a result of road improvement.
Social cohesion has also increased due to the implementation of community projects, such as
waste management and sanitation.

Component C: The following positive results from the encouragement of initiative and a
participatory approach in grass-roots communities are worthy of note:
Renewed confidence on the part of the population of grass-roots communities due to their
involvement in decision-making on priority infrastructure projects (schools, health centers,
community development centers, markets, water kiosks, etc.), in a context where projects are
often developed without taking into account the needs of beneficiaries, simply because they have
not been consulted or involved in the project;
Creation of a participatory approach dynamic: The creation of CDQs and SAICs favors this
dynamic, which is a key factor in promoting stakeholder buy-in and the sustainability of the
project.

Component D: PGUD-2 has contributed to promoting a healthy environment and ensuring
disease prevention in the city of Porto-Novo through the following initiatives: the strategic waste
management plan, destruction of open dumpsites, and rehabilitation of former garbage collection
centers, development of new sites and construction of the technical landfill center for solid waste.

C.       LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS

C.1.     Lessons Learned

Almost all performance indicators have been met and exceeded, thus confirming the outstanding
success of PGUD-2. The following lessons learned should be analyzed with a view to applying
them to future projects.

      Coherent programs and efficient organization are essential to achieve success in urban
       development;

      Implementation of PGUD-2 has shown that three key ingredients must be present if the
       desired objective is to be attained: (i) a project which is in keeping with the real needs of
       the beneficiaries; (ii) a project developed with the participation of the beneficiaries; (iii)
       A project that satisfies professional, technical, and financial standards. The involvement
       of technical bodies, such as AGETUR and SERHAU, under the coordination of
       CPS/COSUCO in a successful partnership, has without a doubt been one of the main
       reasons for the success of the Project;

      Good project management is an asset for the State, in that it helps to strengthen the
       interest of donors to continue to provide financial support;

      Non-adherence to commitments for the implementation of the Counterpart Fund in
       PGUD-2 is a disincentive to the private sector as a key stakeholder in urban development.
       Furthermore, it causes construction delays and escalating costs, to the detriment of the
       beneficiaries ;

      The technical agencies have involved beneficiary municipalities as Project Managers in
       the preparation of annual programs, the procurement of contracts, and the monitoring of
       project implementation. This has had the effect of helping to guarantee effective
       stakeholder ownership of the works carried out;

      With regard to a participatory approach to encourage grass-roots involvement in project
       conception and implementation, the following observations may be made:

         •   In interaction with a number of CDQs, members of the mission observed that the
             participatory approach involves many stakeholders who are given responsibilities for
             which they have not always been sufficiently prepared. Sufficient time must
             therefore be allowed to enable stakeholders to build professional relationships of trust
             and acquire the technical and organizational skills necessary to implement a project.
             This lesson is all the more valid where there has been no tradition of collective or
             participatory action, and where it is necessary to create a local dynamic along the
             lines of the CDQs.
         •   In order for local residents to gain ownership of a project, their involvement must
             begin in the earliest possible stages, through representatives who are widely known
             and respected throughout the community. It should be possible for them to acquire
             greater responsibilities over time, to move, for example, from a simple advisory role
             to more active involvement in joint management of the project.
         •   Although CDQs have limited budgets, they are nevertheless an effective means of
             ensuring extensive and well-coordinated representation of the different needs of a
             community. The CDQs should therefore be encouraged and mobilized through


                                                                                                  55
           subsidies, revenue-generating activities and training for capacity- building. They, in
           turn, will be able to mobilize individuals and ensure that the projects are perceived as
           sustainable by the population, local authorities, and stakeholders.

    The flexibility, professionalism and adaptability of the World Bank Team has made it
     possible to maintain an ongoing and constructive dialogue, to the overall benefit of the
     project;

    Commitment and empowerment of national stakeholders are essential to ensure the
     success of a project.

C.2.   Recommendations

In view of the overwhelming needs in urban development and the positive results obtained in the
implementation of PGUD-2, the partnership between the Government of Benin and the World
Bank must be strengthened. Furthermore, the new project should include the following aspects
which were insufficiently taken into account in PGUD-2:

    The culture of maintenance/upkeep. Infrastructure maintenance must be taken into
     account as soon as contractual documents are drawn up and signed. The mission
     observed cracked tiles, and noticed that the grills of a number of garbage collectors had
     been removed, leaving gaping holes that if not replaced, could pose a danger for the
     security of children and the population in general. In the future, consideration must be
     given to using grills that residents would find extremely difficult to remove, as well as
     more resistant tiles. Such a practice would reduce maintenance costs for cash-strapped
     municipalities. An incentive system should also be introduced for those municipalities
     that carry out regular, professional maintenance of their infrastructure.

    The private sector. For the PGUD-2 project, companies procured contracts on the basis
     of public tenders. These contracts were awarded to the most economically advantageous
     bids, following an analysis of the company’s technical capacity and the conformity of the
     tender with specifications included in the contractual terms and conditions. Often,
     companies make bids that are abnormally low and thereby secure the contract.

       However, they encounter great difficulty in completing construction works, due to poor
       workmanship. This has negative repercussions on the quality and durability of the work.
       The World Bank mission believes that while scrupulously observing the principles for the
       procurement of public contracts, one may consider the possibility of breaking down
       public construction works into smaller contracts (small, medium-sized, large) and
       demanding that technical criteria and equipment are adapted to the size of each contract.
       This will allow for healthy competition and higher construction standards.

       No provision was made in the project for training and retraining the contractors involved
       in the project. Training in new approaches and technologies in the construction and civil
       engineering sector would contribute greatly to enhancing professionalism and quality in
       construction. In a further bid to improve quality, a system of rewards for excellence
       could be implemented using a transparent and participatory process. This could help to
       create healthy competition within the sector. Moreover, failing enterprises could be
       blacklisted.




                                                                                                56
        With regard to funding, it would be desirable for the World Bank to provide funding to
        cover all of the operations of the enterprises, thereby preventing their dependence on
        counterpart funds. It is illogical to try to stimulate the private sector, while depriving
        them of a part of their much needed profits, in favor of the State.

     Counterpart funds. Due to the many obligations of the State, the use of counterpart
      funds has posed a problem and will continue to do so. Experience on the Takon
      construction site, where disbursement of World Bank funds was conditional on the
      availability of counterpart funds, is an option that could be explored, as a means of
      encouraging the State to fully assume its responsibilities.

     Building the capacity of municipal agents. One of the key areas where one would be well
      advised to continue actions undertaken in PGUD-2 is in the implementation of systems and
      practices of good governance. This may be achieved by strengthening the capacity of agents
      in planning/programming, conducting fiduciary scrutiny, monitoring to ensure transparency
      in management practices, maintenance, etc. Capacity building in municipalities is a key
      factor, and is of interest to more than one country in the sub-region. The creation of a
      Regional School of Municipal Management in Porto-Novo or elsewhere in the region
      would be beneficial on several counts, because of the economies of scale and the
      advantages that it would engender. The benefits created would be for donors as well as
      for the States in the sub-region.

     Revenue-generating activities in municipalities. Infrastructure development calls for
      extensive and long-term funding, a situation which neither municipalities nor commercial
      banks can sustain. This sector will therefore be dependent on funding from its Technical
      Partners for a long time to come. Municipalities can, however, initiate short and
      medium-term revenue-generating projects, with the help of commercial banks. Technical
      assistance extended to the municipalities to help them identify such projects and funding
      sources for their implementation could contribute to their progressive ownership and
      control.

     Replicating some of the successes of PGUD-2 in other municipalities. Synergy must be
      created among government institutions to exploit some of the gains that could be
      replicated at a lesser cost in other municipalities that have not as yet benefitted from
      projects such as PGUD-2.

CONCLUSION

After six years, it must be noted that PGUD-2 has brought about significant changes in those
cities where it was implemented, as well as in the lives of the residents. These changes have been
positive. Firstly, if one examines the relevance of the projects, one may recall that the targeted
neighborhoods had been prone to flooding and isolated, with very few of the basic social services.
An examination of the objectives of the project will reveal that it has brought about new faith and
confidence within the municipalities and changed the face of several neighborhoods. As far as
the impact of the project is concerned, it has improved the lives of residents and reduced some
sources of day-to-day inconveniences. It has also, among others, led to a significant increase in
municipal resources and created a participatory community dynamic.

The PGUD-2 has therefore been entirely satisfactory in: (i) its overall implementation; (ii)
financial and technical management; (iii) its adherence to the procedures for granting contracts;
(iv) follow-up and evaluation of performance indicators; and (v) its impact on beneficiaries.


                                                                                                57
There has been one drawback, however. Due to delays in disbursement, counterpart funds from
the municipalities, and especially from the State, have tended to hold up the implementation of
the project, but have not compromised the project itself.




                                                                                            58
