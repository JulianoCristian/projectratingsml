The\n            achievement of the project is as follows: (i) the\n            rehabilitation (paving and drainage) of 33.9 kilometers of\n            urban roads is completed (about 126 percent of original\n            project target) providing to 355,000 residents better access\n            to the city centers (121 percent of end of project target);\n            and (ii) the construction of 17.4 km of primary drainage\n            network, protecting more than 981,000 residents from\n            periodic flooding (end of project target exceeded). The\n            implementation progress rating is satisfactory and the\n            project development objective rating is also satisfactory."}, "docdt": "2012-07-05T00:00:00Z"}
