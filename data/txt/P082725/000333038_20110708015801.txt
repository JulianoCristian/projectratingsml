2.       The overall project implementation is progressing well. As of June 20, 2011,
more than 86% of the additional financing credit had been disbursed:i) the rehabilitation
(paving and drainage) of 28.8 kilometers out of 31.8 km of urban roads is completed and
providing to 304,000 residents better access to the city centers (90.5% of end of project
target); and (ii) the construction of 15.5 km of primary drainage network, protecting
more than 91,000 residents from periodic flooding (end of project target exceeded). The
Implementation Progress rating is satisfactory and the Project Development Objective
rating is also satisfactory and is likely to be achieved.To ensure that the Project
Development Objective is achieved, a reallocation of the project proceeds is necessary.
During project implementation it has been realized that the original estimated costs of the
activities planned under the project were significantly different from the actual costs.

3.     The proposed reallocation is necessary to enable the Government of Benin not
only to smoothly complete on-going works on different sites and also to start the
pavement and drainage works on t wo new roads in Cotonou, particularly the road to
Abomey-Calavi which was previously under the original credit (Credit No. 41170-BN)
but     was      put       on hol      d      due       to     insufficient   fund.
