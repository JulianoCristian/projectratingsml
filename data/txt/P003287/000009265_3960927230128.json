To\n            address this situation the project will consist of three\n            major components : 1) rural forestry through the\n            conservation of forests and the environment, the expansion\n            of rural afforestation, agroforestry development, and\n            woodland management; 2) wildlife and forest grazing\n            management; and 3) commercial forestry development through\n            improvement of the wood processing industry by upgrading the\n            logging, extraction, sawmilling and manufacturing operations."}, "docdt": "1990-02-26T00:00:00Z"}
