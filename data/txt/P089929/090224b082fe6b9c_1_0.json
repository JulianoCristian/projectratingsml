was\n            as follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, risk to\n            development outcome was substantial, Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            streamlined projects with focused activities may prove\n            easier for low-capacity Borrowers to implement.\n            Institutional reforms require strong commitment and priority\n            from the government. Ensuring institutional capacity to\n            sustain results, both in terms of institutional change and\n            infrastructural improvements, must start at preparation.\n            Stakeholder and partner input during preparation may not be\n            sufficient to create a sustainable participatory process.\n            Integration of co-executing agencies is essential for\n            efficient execution. When strengthening the landscape\n            restoration aspect and increasing environmental and economic\n            benefits, replication initiatives should include\n            complementary actions to restore riparian vegetation, as\n            well as to delimit, formalize, and restore permanent\n            preservation areas and legal reserves within the watershed.\n            When irrigation perimeters rely on multi-purpose reservoirs,\n            it is essential to establish criteria and conditions for\n            negotiated water allocation."}, "docdt": "2015-06-30T00:08:05Z"}
