F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

PAD: The specific project development objective is to implement an integrated water resources
management system that will support more environmentally sustainable use of water resources
while also increasing access of poor families to reliable potable water and decreasing operational
and maintenance costs of water allocation and distribution systems.

Loan Agreement: The objective of the Project is to promote economic, social and environmentally
sustainable development in the Borrower’s territory through the implementation of an integrated
water resources management system, including the preparation of a water sector strategy and a
long-term investment program to promote an efficient use and adequate supply of water resources.

As there is a discrepancy in the PDO statements, this evaluation will be based on the objective from
the Loan Agreement1. It is however clear from the PAD2 that “promote economic, social and
environmentally sustainable development” is the higher level objective to which the project will
contribute and the intended objective of the project focuses on implementation of an integrated
water resources management system. Thus this evaluation will center around the achievement of
the objective statement in the Loan Agreement that follows after “through” i.e. the implementation
of an integrated water resources management system, including the preparation of a water sector
strategy and a long-term investment program to promote an efficient use and adequate supply of
water resources.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.   Country and sector background and rationale for Bank assistance. Brazil has twelve percent
     of the world’s total fresh water but it is extremely unevenly distributed. About 73 percent of
     the country’s water is concentrated in the Amazon River Basin, while the semiarid Northeast,
     where the State of Rio Grande do Norte (RGN) is located, has only three percent of the
     country’s water resources. With average annual rainfall of about 700 mm and annual per
     capita water availability of less than 1,200 m3, RGN has one of the largest water resources
     deficits of all Brazilian states, as well as a high risk of drought occurrence, large intra- and
     inter-annual rainfall variations, high evapotranspiration, few perennial rivers, and serious
     water storage and management problems.

2.   At the time of project preparation (2004-2007), the project formed an integral part of the water
     resources management (WRM) strategy which the Bank had been supporting in Brazil for
     over a decade through federal and state projects which had helped states to develop
     institutional capacity and improve infrastructure to manage their water resources efficiently.
     This was particularly crucial in RGN since the State’s economic growth depends on the
     preservation and more equal distribution of its scarce water resources. This increased capacity
     would also prepare the State to better face the cyclical droughts to which it is prone and to
     better manage its infrastructure to improve water quality and security.

3.   In the State overall, over 40 percent of the population lived in extreme poverty at the time of
     appraisal. In particular, the “Seridó”, the State’s semi-arid, largely rural southern zone and
     home to about ten percent of the State’s population, concentrated a disproportionate
     percentage of the State’s poor population. In this region, serious cyclical droughts, chronic
     water shortages, and poor management of a scare resource base jeopardized inhabitants’
     livelihoods.

4.   Rio Grande do Norte’s State water management structure was unable to cope with increased
     pressure on scarce water resources due to growing demand and pollution of existing resources
     (largely from untreated sewage discharge). Specific challenges for the State included over-
     exploitation and pollution of groundwater reserves, aging infrastructure (including dams,
     irrigation, and water distribution systems), deficient O&M and hydrological information
     systems, and a lack of basic information on the water resources sector to inform investment-
     related decisions.

5.   CPS alignment at appraisal. In order to tackle these issues, the Project planned to improve
     the State’s WRM framework and investment planning capacity in the water sector (instituting
     an Integrated Water Resources Management model), as well as to undertake direct
     infrastructure interventions to improve water supply. The Project was designed to support the
     2004-2007 Brazil CAS goals of improved sustainability (through improved water quality and
     WRM), equitability (through more equitable access to local services), competitiveness
     (through efficiency-increasing infrastructure and improved resource allocation), and public
     sector management (both for local water users associations and basin committees and State-
     level water management actors).

6.   Other Bank engagements in the sector/region. This loan followed the PROAGUA Semi-Arid
     program, a regional WRM program in Brazil’s Northeast (including RGN), and its additional


                                                 1
     financing, which scaled up activities to other regions (National PROAGUA7), and the federal
     Sanitation Sector Modernization Project8 (PMSS) to modernize Brazil’s sanitation sector. The
     Bank had also financed four neighboring state-level WRM projects in Ceará9 and Bahia10.
     After approval of this Project, the Bank also financed several contemporary multi-sector
     projects to improve water management and infrastructure in neighboring Northeast states of
     Pernambuco and Sergipe11.

7.   Lessons incorporated from previous Bank engagements. The Project drew heavily from Bank
     international and local experience and expertise in rural development and Integrated WRM
     projects, cross-sector project implementation, water use regulation and charges, links to state
     poverty reduction and economic growth policies, and concentration of critical infrastructure
     for the greatest efficiency and distributional impact. In the Northeast Brazil region, WRM
     systems developed in Ceará and Bahia were used as models for implementation in RGN.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

8.   The PDO in the Loan Agreement is “to promote economic, social and environmentally
     sustainable development in the Borrower’s territory through the implementation of an
     integrated water resources management system, including the preparation of a water sector
     strategy and a long-term investment program to promote an efficient use and adequate supply
     of water resources”.

9.   As worded in the PAD, “The specific project development objective is to implement an
     integrated water resources management system that will support more environmentally
     sustainable use of water resources while also increasing access of poor families to reliable
     potable water and decreasing operational and maintenance costs of water allocation and
     distribution systems.”

10. The key indicators included in the Annex 3 of the PAD are listed below12.

     a) A fully operational water resources monitoring and information network;
     b) Reduction in water loss from three large water distribution pipelines;
     c) Reduction in water loss from the water distribution systems of municipalities served by
        the Monsenhor Expedito pipeline;
     d) Additional families with access to reliable potable water;
     e) Increase in the economic efficiency of the Itans and Cruzeta irrigation perimeters;
     f) State Water Resources Legislation revised, defining a new legal framework for the
        management of water resources in the state;

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

11. The PDO was not revised during the Project implementation. Some indicators and targets were
    adjusted for better alignment with activities prioritized within the scope of the Project and
    available funds. Three PDO indicators were modified to better reflect the results that could be
    measured within the Project’s duration and scope. Intermediate indicators were also modified,
    dropped or added. A detailed description of the original indicators and revisions made during
    the restructurings is presented in Annex 2, Appendix 1.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

12. While the PAD did not specify a primary target group, activities under the project were
    designed to benefit both the larger community of water users and water agencies in Rio Grande
    do Norte through improved management of the sector, as well as specific direct beneficiaries
    of targeted pilots and interventions. These included: small rural producers benefitting from
    pilot programs in Cruzeta irrigated perimeter and Cobra micro-watershed; over 3,700 families
    that received water supply from new systems and 8,000 from rehabilitated or new desalination
    units; and beneficiaries supplied by the rehabilitated Monsenhor Expedito pipeline system,
    estimated at 300,000 inhabitants. Specific activities under Components 2 and 3 were
    geographically concentrated in the rural areas of Seridó, the poorest region of the State in both
    socioeconomic and natural resources terms.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

13. Component 1. Institutional Development and Water Resources Management Instruments
    (US$15.2 million, 25.4% of project cost; of which Bank US$11.9 million). The objective of
    this component was to improve the State’s WRM capabilities and develop adequate WRM
    instruments. Project activities were directed mainly at consolidating the design and operation
    of an integrated WRM system, with effective stakeholder participation and the watershed as
    the basic territorial management unit, to ensure equitable and efficient development that is
    socially, economically and environmentally sustainable. This component had five
    subcomponents: (1.1) Improvement of the Legal and Institutional Framework; (1.2) Water
    Sector Planning Instruments; (1.3) Information Instruments; (1.4) Operational Instruments;
    and (1.5) Studies and Special Projects.

14. Component 2. Natural Resources Conservation and Protection (US$5.1 million, 8.5% of
    project cost; of which Bank US$2.4 million). This component supported the preservation of
    water quality, improved efficiency in water use by reducing water losses in state-owned public


                                                 3
     water supply infrastructure, improving water conservation in agricultural and industrial
     activities, and generating water-saving technologies, including using treated wastewater; and
     promoted the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices on irrigate lands. There were five
     subcomponents: (2.1) Microcatchment Pilot Projects; (2.2) Prevention of Losses in the State’s
     Bulk Water Transmission Networks; (2.3) Prevention of Losses in the Public Water Supply
     System; (2.4) Uses of Treated Wastewater; and (2.5) Sediment Control.

15. Component 3. Water Infrastructure (US$35.4 million, 59.2% of project cost; of which Bank
    US$18.2 million). The objectives of this component were to enhance the State’s water
    management capabilities and to improve general water availability. It provided technical and
    financial assistance to improve water availability through the rehabilitation of existing bulk
    water infrastructure; construct supplementary water infrastructure works to improve water
    supply for the population being served by Monsenhor Expedito pipeline system and for poor
    scattered rural populations; and implement pilot interventions for improved irrigation
    efficiency. There were four subcomponents: (3.1) Rehabilitation and Maintenance of Existing
    Water Infrastructure; (3.2) Expansion of Water Infrastructure; (3.3) Water Supply Systems
    for Small Rural Communities; and (3.4) Pilot Interventions for the Rehabilitation and
    Modernization of Small Farmer Irrigation Schemes.

16. Component 4. Project Management (US$4.1 million, 6.9% of project cost, of which Bank
    US$3.4 million). This component was responsible for overall project execution and M&E
    system, as well as communications and dissemination, and preparation of the concept
    document for a possible second-phase project. There were four subcomponents: (4.1) Project
    Management, (4.2) Monitoring and Evaluation, (4.3) Support to the Preparation of the Second
    Phase, and (4.4) Project Communication and Dissemination.

1.6 Revised Components

17. Components were not revised during implementation. However, subcomponents were
    adjusted to reflect the prioritization of activities based on available funds.

1.7 Other significant changes

18. A Level II Restructuring approved on August 9, 2012 included a closing date extension of 16
    months; reallocation of Loan proceeds among categories; and adjustments of Project targets
    and indicators. A second Level II Restructuring was approved on March 20, 2014. It included
    another closing date extension of six months; reallocation of Loan proceeds among categories;
    increase in the percentage of Bank financing from 66 to 100 percent for disbursement category
    2 – Works, and from 75 to 100 percent for disbursement category 4 – Operating Costs; and
    adjustments of Project targets and indicators.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

19. Lending Instrument. Although the original proposal called for a three-phase Adaptable
    Program Loan (APL), the Government of Brazil (GOB) and the Bank agreed to implement a
    five-year Specific Investment Loan (SIL), which could be followed by a second phase. The
    sector changes and the experience of this first phase were seen as critical for better



                                                4
     understanding the long-term needs and prospects of the State’s water sector and a possible
     second operation.

20. Strategic alignment. The project formed an integral part of the WRM strategy which the Bank
    had been pursuing in Brazil for over a decade through federal and state projects. It continued
    the long-standing commitment to promoting equitable and sustainable water resources
    management by bringing Rio Grande do Norte’s WRM capacity up to par with that of the
    leading states in the Northeast region.

21. Technical design. The composition of the Bank team was appropriate and the team members
    possessed the relevant skills to properly design the Project. The design was well-aligned with
    the Government’s objectives for the sector. It adequately identified and addressed major
    constraints to sustainable development in RGN: poor management of water and natural
    resources resulting in inefficient use and risk of their deterioration; and improved efficiency
    of water use while increasing water supply to poor and rural areas. The Project design adopted
    an integrated water resources management approach, including appropriate institutional
    development, water resources management instruments, infrastructure rehabilitation and
    construction, and natural resources management. The use of an IWRM approach at the state,
    basin and local levels to reconcile cross-sectoral water demands was the foundation of the
    Project design, based on lessons from previous Bank investments.

22. Results and Risk Assessment. The linkages between project activities and intended outputs and
    outcomes were clear. Some of the indicators included in the original results framework had
    unrealistic targets and lacked baselines, which made it difficult to be measured during the life
    of the Project. The risk assessment included important risks that were correctly identified
    during preparation but some risks were underestimated. With hindsight it is clear that the
    “lack of central governmental commitment to carry out the necessary institutional reforms to
    implement an IWRM system and promote the sustainable use of natural resources” should
    have been rated as Substantial.

23. Scope of Project Activities. While the Project scope tried to tackle complementary activities
    that would lead to improved management of water resources and access to water services, it
    included a broad variety of activities that went beyond the mandate and capacity of the
    executing agency. Project design was relevant to the State’s needs but highly ambitious.
    Planning for Project activities could have been more streamlined to limit the areas of
    intervention to activities that would focus only on strengthening the water resources system
    SEMARH-IGARN and improve the State’s capacity to manage its water resources.

24. Stakeholder Involvement. Preparation was based on a demand-driven approach with intensive
    stakeholder involvement. Strong user participation during preparation helped to broaden local
    ownership beyond the State government. Facilitating consensus among sector users and actors,
    instituting conflict resolution mechanisms, and clearly delineating areas of authority and
    responsibility for the sector were crucial elements of the Project design.

25. Complementarity with other Sector Investments. One of the key strategic aspects of the
    Project’s design was its pursuit of complementarity with other projects and programs being
    implemented in the state and the sector. At the time of preparation of the Bank project, KfW
    and CEF were also preparing or implementing water activities in RGN. Some CEF-financed
    CAERN activities were incorporated into the Bank project as counterpart contributions, and
    projects overall were coordinated to avoid overlap and to ensure complementarity.



                                                 5
2.2 Implementation

26. Startup delays and prioritization of activities. There was a long gap between Appraisal and
    Effectiveness, mainly caused by requirements of the Federal Government (guarantor) that had
    to be met by the Borrower prior to negotiations and, later, to signing, such as the payment of
    State’s dues or documentation of expenses made with transfers from the Federal Government.
    Due to this delay, the Project faced difficulties once implementation began. First, the estimates
    for resources required were outdated, and the amounts allocated were no longer sufficient for
    the full scope of activities foreseen at Appraisal. It was also found during implementation that
    engineering designs for some activities were out of date, and/or that insufficient time and
    funds for works had been budgeted during preparation. As a consequence, the planned
    activities had to be prioritized in line with available funds and some were cancelled.
    Prioritization was made with focus on the main activities that could directly contribute to the
    achievement of the PDO as measured by the results matrix.

27. Borrower Commitment and Financial Capacity. Despite the challenges imposed by the delays,
    after Effectiveness, once priorities were adjusted to the available resources, implementation
    of activities started well. The State team was highly committed over the first eighteen months,
    many bidding processes were initiated and some activities were contracted; however, a
    setback was felt in 2010 caused by the electoral year. A new Administration took office in
    2011 and made good progress after an initial period of six months. The new team was
    committed and focused on strengthening implementation. All ongoing contracts were
    reviewed, technically and financially audited, to ensure their adequate execution. In addition,
    important activities that had been put on hold in the previous year were successfully initiated.
    In 2013, the overall budgetary constraints faced by the State interfered with the execution of
    activities, mainly the works, due to delays in counterpart funding. These implementation
    constraints did not represent a lack of relevance of the Project to the Government, but rather
    was a reflection of competing needs for scarce resources.

28. Institutional capacity. Intensive training and capacity building at regional and central levels
    were expected to mitigate the risks associated with limited Borrower capacity. However, the
    scale of the financial and budgeting difficulties, as well as administration changes and staff
    turnover were underestimated at preparation. Implementation also suffered at times due to
    limited PMU capacity to execute and coordinate Project activities, as well as difficulties in
    complying with Bank rules and procedures. During contracting of initial activities, the PMU’s
    lack of market knowledge led to weaknesses in drafting Terms of Reference and evaluating
    of contractor proposals. Also, limited PMU capacity in terms of insufficient contract
    management and oversight of contractors, combined with weak contractors resulted at times
    in poor quality of outputs13. This also led to activities14 being unfinished or reduced in scope.
    The PMU team was considerably strengthened in 2011 with skilled technical and operational
    consultants and a highly qualified coordinator, and this team was kept until Project closing.
    As a result, these constraints were gradually dealt with although implementation delays could
    not be completely resolved.



13
   Issues with contractors included low product quality, delays in delivering final products, failure to
incorporate PMU inputs, and unexpected conflicts with stakeholders.
14
   The most important of these include updating of the State Water Resources Plan, planned dam
rehabilitation (for which only engineering designs were completed, not actual works), and watershed-level
water management plans.


                                                   6
29. Institutional integration and coordination. The Project executing agency was SEMARH,
    where the PMU was located. The co-executing agencies as described in the PAD were
    SEPLAN, SAPE, EMATER, EMPARN, IGARN and CAERN15. Active participation by co-
    executing agencies occurred during the initial stages of preparation. However, the lack of
    priority assigned by these agencies to the Project16 led to lack of communication and weak
    coordination in terms of planning both during preparation and implementation. Financing and
    execution capacity was concentrated within SEMARH, making it more difficult to motivate
    execution by co-executors.

30. Implementation performance. Even though Project implementation suffered set-backs, the
    main activities were implemented allowing for the achievement of most of the targets. There
    were several examples of strong project management, including the coordination to ensure
    that the different actors (DNOCS, APICRUZ) were engaged in the activities in Cruzeta
    irrigated perimeter; the successful implementation of Cobra Microcatchment Pilot activities
    with the strong involvement and participation of beneficiaries; and the solid compliance with
    environmental safeguards and implementation of environmental impact compensation
    measures. Seventy one percent (71%) of the Project activities (27 out of 38) were completed17.
    However, some important planned activities were dropped due to the need to focus on fewer
    strategic areas in light of the resources available, and the difficulties of achieving satisfactory
    results from contractors18.

31. Disbursements. Despite the lack of funds for implementation of originally planned activities,
    28 percent of the Loan funds were not disbursed and had to be cancelled after the closing date.
    These funds had been reserved for the rehabilitation of dams. However, the bidding process
    for these works failed due to lack of proposals and had to be cancelled without enough time
    for reallocation of funds to other activities.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

32. M&E Design. The intervention logic was clear and based on lessons from other projects. The
    results indicators for the most part captured well the outputs and results expected from the
    Project. The results framework however also presented some shortcomings including a few
    unrealistic targets and missing baselines. Due to the need to prioritize activities and align with
    available funds, some indicators were later dropped and others were revised during Project
    restructurings.

33. M&E Implementation. During preparation, the PMU planned to use the federal Environmental
    Management Information System (SIGMA) as an information management tool for
    monitoring project implementation. However, due to issues with the operation and
    maintenance of the system at the Ministry of Environment level, it was not operationalized.
    Progress data was collected and reported on a manual basis. A Project information system was



15
   SEPLAN (State Secretariat of Planning and Finance), SAPE (Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock and
Fishing), EMATER (Technical Assistance and Rural Extension Institute), EMPARN (Rio Grande do Norte
Agriculture and Livestock Research Company), IGARN (State of Rio Grande do Norte Water Management
Institute), CAERN (Rio Grande do Norte Water and Sewage Company)
16
   The co-executing agencies prioritized activities under their direct responsibility, outside the Project scope,
due to their limited human resources capacity and constant staff turnover.

     implemented during the last year of execution, including a Physical and Managerial
     Monitoring and Evaluation module, which will be used for other programs and projects being
     implemented by SEMARH. This system is considered best practice by the Bank.

34. M&E Utilization. Borrower progress reports were delivered in a timely and accurate manner.
    Additionally, normal Bank requirements for outputs (ISRs, Aide-Memoires) were met by the
    Supervision team. The lack of an operational M&E system at Effectiveness and the delay in
    the installation of an adequate system made management and coordination of Project activities
    more difficult than foreseen. The co-executing agencies also failed in providing necessary
    information.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

35. Bank Safeguards. This project was classified as Environmental Category B at Appraisal,
    triggering the following safeguards: OP/BP 4.01 Environmental Assessment; OP/BP 4.04
    Natural Habitats; OP/BP 4.09 Pest Management; and OP/BP 4.37 Safety of Dams. A thorough
    and well-prepared Environmental Assessment Report (EAR) was produced, consulted and
    disclosed by the State. The EAR included an adequate Environmental Management Plan
    (EMP), containing mitigation actions to address adverse impacts, the associated costs and
    responsibilities, as well as the EMP implementation schedule. No resettlement was planned
    or required by the Project. A Dam Safety panel was successfully created to comply with the
    Bank’s safeguard requirement to accompany the preparation of designs for dam rehabilitation.

36. Environmental Compliance. The Project team ensured full environmental compliance of
    activities under the Project, despite initial challenges during the first two years of
    implementation in proper environmental management and licensing 19 . Challenges were
    overcome, and all activities carried out were properly licensed. In addition, the Project has
    built excellent experience and examples on how to regularize the deficient and historic lack
    of environmental compliance of water works such as old dams, water distribution and
    treatment systems in small towns, and old irrigated perimeters. However, the cost and time
    requirements of environmental licensing and safeguard compliance were not adequately
    planned or budgeted for at preparation, leading to significant delays during implementation.

37. Additionally, to fulfil an important compensation measure required under the environmental
    license of the expansion works of Monsenhor Expedito pipeline, the project hired a
    consultancy firm to prepare, through a participatory process, a territorial zoning proposal to
    support the development of the Management Plan for the Bonfim-Guaraíras Environmental
    Protection Area, where all the water that feeds the Monsenhor Expedito system is collected.
    At project closing, the zoning proposal had already been submitted to a first round of public
    consultations in all three municipalities that hold parts of the protected area. It is important to
    note that this participatory process was the first time that SEMARH and the State’s
    environmental agency, IDEMA, worked together to lead a participatory process to build an
    important management instrument for a state protected area (an activity usually carried out
    only by IDEMA).


19
   Issues were identified with the drilling of wells as part of the Monsenhor Expedito system, which was
initially carried out without proper environmental licensing by the contractor, and with the small rural water
supply systems, which were initially constructed without proper licensing. Both of these were resolved and
all corrective actions were carried out with results satisfactory to the Bank. The Project team demonstrated
exceptional dedication, commitment and efforts during the environmental rehabilitation/mitigation process.


                                                      8
38. Fiduciary Compliance. The procurement arrangements established during the preparation of
    the Project changed in the initial stage. Instead of hiring a Consulting management firm (PAD,
    Annex 8, Table 2) for supporting the operation of the Project; SEMARH entrusted this
    responsibility to a group of individual consultants. The Bank agreed with this approach with
    the overarching goal to enhance SEMARH in-house capacity and minimize the administrative
    cost of the project.

39. Although most of the key activities of the procurement plan were completed, these were
    executed at a low pace throughout the life of the Project. Consultant selection processes
    suffered from significant delays, on average 300 days were devoted to the selection of a
    consulting firm. This rate is substantially higher than the 180 days expected for this kind of
    processes, and contracts underwent significant extensions (some of them reaching three times
    their initial expected contract execution period) and value addendums. The delays in the
    procurement processes and contracts were due to several reasons, including difficulties to
    produce timely and quality terms of reference, and difficulties in attracting and maintaining a
    qualified procurement specialist, weak bidding documents requiring several rounds of review
    from the Bank, lack of interest of the private sector, inadequate contract management, and
    unsatisfactory performance of consulting firms. The Bank closely supported the procurement
    activities and provided specific training. The PMU staff appointed after 2011 helped in
    improving the quality of the procurement and consulting selection processes. However,
    SEMARH suffered from continuous budget constraints which reduced its capacity to provide
    the necessary support to the Project.

40. Financial Management (FM). A financial management post review carried out in August 2014
    found very satisfactory results, concluding with a Highly Satisfactory rating. The project's
    financial management went beyond expectation in terms of controls, SEMARH's improved
    institutional capacity and strengthening. Several FM supervision missions were carried out at
    SEMARH throughout the project cycle to review all FM arrangements set up for the Project,
    as well as to follow up on any actions agreed on during missions. These missions reviewed
    the staffing/personnel arrangements, budget/accounting, funds flow and disbursements,
    systems and reports.

41. Overall, the Project (mainly after the new project management administration took over in
    2011) consistently demonstrated that the arrangements that had been set up were
    functioning. SEMARH has a team of qualified professionals capable of carrying out the FM
    activities. Proper Internal Controls were always in place, allowing control of all steps of
    approval and use of funds, as well as the reports to the Bank. The missions in general,
    identified very minimal shortcomings in financial management, and whenever these were
    present, SEMARH was always able to overcome them, assuring the timely and accurate
    provision of information required to manage and monitor the implementation of the Project.

42. Noteworthy is the implementation of the Project's information system, including several
    modules (Planning and Control, Financial, Accountant, Physical and Managerial Monitoring
    and Evaluation). The successful completion of the system achieved one of the main goals and
    targets for financial management. The system can also be used for future projects implemented
    by SEMARH, with or without external financing. This successful FM experience has gone
    even further, and is being extended to other secretariats within the GoRN. It is also being
    shared with other subnational governments in Brazil.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

43. Continuing activities. The Borrower successfully completed a few small complementary
    activities (including installation of water monitoring stations and macro-meters) over the
    months following Project closure. The PMU consultant team will remain in SEMARH for one
    additional year after the closing date (until September 2015) to support the closing of activities
    and remaining payments, preparation of the project's evaluation report, and the consolidation
    of its activities.

44. Borrower institutional capacity. The Project supported the Borrower in developing a strong
    IWRM system aimed at promoting rational investment decisions and allocation of resources,
    contributing to the sustainable development of the water sector in RGN. In addition, the post-
    completion operation of Monsenhor Expedito pipeline and distribution systems is guaranteed
    by CAERN, while the producers’ association in Cruzeta has taken over responsibility for
    maintaining the interventions made in the irrigated perimeter. However, the sustainability of
    some Project interventions is not clear due to the current institutional capacity constraints,
    especially lack of technical staff, of SEMARH and IGARN. In the case of the rural water
    supply systems, the actual activities to ensure sustained O&M were neither set up nor funded
    during preparation, and management responsibility going forward has not been defined yet.
    Sustainability of these systems will depend on the capacity of the municipalities and CAERN
    to cover O&M costs associated with the capacity and willingness of the consumers to pay for
    the provision of services. Nevertheless, the current State Government that took office in early
    2015 is taking the initial necessary measures such as transfer of responsibilities from
    SEMARH to IGARN following the revised regulation and adequate staffing, to strengthen the
    institutions and define responsibilities.

45. New loan proposal for Rio Grande do Norte. SEMARH has expressed interest in a new water
    sector loan in the State, and is in the process of preparing a proposal for discussion with the
    Federal Government (as loan guarantor) for such a project. The Project team also coordinated
    with the Bank-financed Rio Grande do Norte Sustainable Rural Development Project20 (RN
    Sustentável) team to disseminate lessons learned and results of the successful Cruzeta irrigated
    perimeter and Cobra microcatchment pilots for scaling up in other areas of the State.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Relevance of Objectives: High

46. Relevance to the CAS at Appraisal and current CPS. The relevance of the Project
    Development Objectives is high because of the Project’s close fit with all the four goals of the
    World Bank Group’s former Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Brazil covering 2003-
    2007, effective at the time of Appraisal21. The Project continues to be highly relevant under

  Brazil CAS 2003-2007 (Report No. 27043-BR), discussed by the Executive Directors on December 9,
2003. From PAD: “With regard to increasing the sustainability of natural capital and local services, the
project will support the CAS objectives through better water quality and WRM; more sustainable land, forest,
and biodiversity management within the context of improved WRM; and more equitable access to local
services. Through its infrastructure improvement activities, which will increase the efficiency of the water


                                                    10
     the current 2012-2015 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS)22 , which lists water infrastructure
     and management as top concerns and includes a larger strategy of increased engagement with
     Brazil’s Northeast (including RGN). The 2012-2015 CPS includes “Expanding access to
     improved basic sanitation23” as a priority under Objective 3: Promoting regional economic
     development, and includes as areas of focus supporting the strengthening of Government
     capacity to perform regulatory and policymaking functions, supporting improved coordination
     with sub-national Governments, helping develop an integrated approach to water resources
     management and water supply and sanitation (IWRM-WSS), and supporting efficiency
     improvements and promoting the use of innovative technologies and service delivery models.

47. Borrower relevance. In terms of Borrower relevance, the Project addressed a major and
    continuing constraint to sustainable development in RGN, as well as a priority area for the
    State Government (including for the new administration, which took office during the ICR
    drafting period): poor management of water and natural resources resulting in inefficient use
    and risk of their deterioration. The Borrower’s interest in a new loan in this area illustrates its
    continued relevance for the State. Regionally, the serious ongoing drought in Northeast Brazil
    has made the importance of effective and efficient water management even more critical.

Relevance of Design: Modest

48. As described in Section 2.1, the Project’s design was relevant. The operation’s design
    incorporated a number of lessons learned from other projects and identified correctly, potential
    risks to the Project’s effective implementation. At the same time the design was ambitious and
    the preparation underestimated a number of potential challenges, including: (i) the limited
    capacity of the implementing agency to carry out the broad array of proposed activities; and
    (ii) the difficulty of keeping co-executing agencies engaged throughout the life of the project.
    There were also some shortcomings in the results framework.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

49. PDO from Loan Agreement: The objective of the Project is to promote economic, social and
    environmentally sustainable development in the Borrower’s territory through the
    implementation of an integrated water resources management system, including the
    preparation of a water sector strategy and a long-term investment program to promote an
    efficient use and adequate supply of water resources.24



sector, the project will contribute to enhancing the state’s competitiveness through improved resource
allocation. In addition, by increasing the role played by local water users associations and basin committees
in WRM, the project will lead to better local-level governance.”

   Brazil CPS 2012-2015 (Report No. 63731-BR), discussed by the Executive Directors on November 1,
2011.
23
   The definition of basic sanitation includes water supply and sanitation.
24
   As noted in section F of the ICR Data Sheet, there is a discrepancy in the PDO statements. This evaluation
is based on the objective from the Loan Agreement. It is however clear from the PAD that “promote
economic, social and environmentally sustainable development” is the higher level objective to which the
project will contribute and the intended specific objective of the project is to implement an integrated water
resources management system. Therefore, this evaluation will center around the achievement of the objective
statement that follows after “through” i.e. the implementation of an integrated water resources management
system, including the preparation of a water sector strategy and a long-term investment program to promote
an efficient use and adequate supply of water resources.


                                                     11
50. The project was designed to benefit both the larger community of water users and water
    agencies in Rio Grande do Norte through improved management of the sector, as well as
    through specific targeted pilots and interventions in the rural areas of Seridó, the poorest
    region of the State in both socioeconomic and natural resources terms. As of Project closing,
    98% of the PDO indicator targets were achieved along with 84% of the intermediate indicator
    targets; some intermediate outcomes surpassed the target. Through the Project, 3,700 rural
    families gained access to water supply from new systems and 8,000 families from rehabilitated
    or new desalination units. The rehabilitated Monsenhor Expedito pipeline system is
    benefitting an estimated 300,000 inhabitants with significant environmental benefits. The pilot
    of Cruzeta created a showcase example of a modernized irrigation system and a solution for
    improving efficiency and sustainability of similar small irrigated perimeters in the Northeast
    region. The PDO has two parts - achievements under each of these is discussed below.

     1. Implementation of an integrated water resources management system, including the
        preparation of a water sector strategy: Substantial

51. The Project aimed at the implementation of an integrated water resources management system
    translated into (i) policy, (ii) legal and institutional, (iii) management and planning actions for
    the adequate management of the State’s water resources. These aspects formed key pillars for
    a water sector strategy for efficient WRM by the state. They were successfully achieved with
    actions for strengthening the regulation of water resources via the update of the State Water
    Resources Policy, the establishment of revised legal and institutional frameworks, the
    increased technical capacity for the implementation of water resources management
    instruments (information, planning, water rights).

    (i)    Policy: The State Water Resources Policy Law was updated to incorporate the principles
           of integrated water resources management, focusing on water quality and quantity,
           groundwater management and improved water licensing criteria to strengthen the
           mechanisms for sustainable water allocation. The Project originally planned support to
           the creation of State water reuse and irrigation policies. However, these activities were
           not prioritized when implementation started.
    (ii)   Legal and Institutional: Regulation of water resources was successfully strengthened via
           the establishment of revised legal and institutional frameworks. The revision of the
           frameworks focused on the structuring of the State water resources sector aimed at
           enabling adequate management of the resources and responding to the State’s
           development needs. The revised state water resources legislation and structures for
           SEMARH and IGARN were approved by the State Assembly in January 2013. The new
           legislation regularized IGARN functions giving legitimacy to its actions. The issuance
           of the decrees that will regulate the operation of each entity has been authorized by the
           new Administration that took office in early 2015. The transfer of staff and
           responsibilities from SEMARH to IGARN, following the revised legislation has been
           initiated, with the transfer of analysis and issuance of water rights and water monitoring.
           Other activities such as operation of reservoirs as well as surveillance of water use are
           being gradually transferred.
           One of the main principles of IWRM is participation and stakeholder involvement. The
           Project supported the creation, strengthening and functioning of river basin committees,
           including training and mobilization activities as well as logistical support for execution
           of main activities. In addition, the State’s water resources management system




                                                  12
           institutions (CONERH 25 , SEMARH, IGARN, CBH 26 ) actively participated in the
           implementation of the Project. Further institutional strengthening was provided to
           SEMARH and IGARN with the provision of specialized expertise on water resources
           management activities, physical infrastructure, logistical support, and technical
           equipment for carrying out water monitoring activities and surveillance of water use.
     (iii) Management and Planning: The Project successfully supported the creation of a
           significant base of scientific data to improve water resources management and decision-
           making going forward, as well as plans and studies to enhance the State’s water resources
           management 27 at both the State and local levels. A fully operational water resources
           monitoring and information network has been put in place in partnership with the
           National Water Agency (ANA)28. Collected data are made available to SEMARH in its
           Situation Room and used for improving the operation of reservoirs and water allocation
           due to the real time monitoring of water availability. The Project also foresaw the
           implementation of an Information System to keep the data and make it available to other
           institutions and users. This could not be implemented due to lack of resources. Another
           shortcoming was the unsuccessful attempt to update the State Water Resources Plan.
           With the perspectives of improving groundwater management and planning, the
           contributions of the Project’s hydrogeology-related activities were key in improving
           water resources management and planning, ranging from the elaboration of regional
           hydrogeological studies, up to the execution of localized geophysical and
           hydrogeological research for the solution of specific water supply issues. In addition, the
           Project provided equipment and other tools for the monitoring of groundwater levels and
           groundwater quality all over the State. The activities supported by the Project deepened
           the knowledge of the State’s most strategic aquifers, indicating its vulnerabilities and
           potential for securing water for development, signaling the possibilities of expansion of
           water supply systems, and providing indication of actions for rational use and
           conservation.

      2. Implementation of a long-term investment program to promote an efficient use and
         adequate supply of water resources: Substantial

52. A long-term investment program was built with strategic actions that contributed to promoting
    efficient use and adequate supply of water resources in the State focusing on strategic
    investments as well as pilots to demonstrate new approaches, such as the: (i) increased access
    of poor families to reliable potable water, (ii) management of water demands, increased
    measurement of water production and consumption, and reduction of water losses in the
    Monsenhor Expedito pipeline and distribution systems, and (iii) water security actions with
    the expansion of water supply and engineering designs for rehabilitation of dams.

53. In addition, the modernization of irrigation techniques in the Cruzeta irrigated perimeter, and
    the water and soil conservation, and hydro-environmental works to sustainably capture water

27
   The hydrogeological and hydrodynamic studies of Barreiras aquifer system (only source of drinking and
irrigation water all along the state eastern coastal area) provided organized knowledge base, more accurate
water balance, and other tools to better understand, model and analyze system. It has also impacted in
improved availability information for the concession of groundwater use licenses.
28
   The Project purchased and installed 33 stations, complemented by 17 installed by ANA to monitor surface
water, and 56 data loggers were installed for monitoring groundwater.


                                                    13
     for rural producers were successfully concluded. These works will both directly impact rural
     beneficiaries, by contributing to the establishment of a sound basis for economically and
     environmentally sustainable development in vulnerable areas, as well as providing models for
     drought resilience enhancement throughout the State.

54. Increased access of poor families to reliable potable water. The Project supported the
    construction of water supply systems to serve 33 small rural communities, which currently
    supply water to 3,700 beneficiaries29. In addition, the rehabilitation and installation of 125
    desalination units serving small communities directly benefited 8,900 families. Due to the
    drought period, some of the water sources have shown to be insufficient to respond to the
    demand, leading to irregular supply of water in some of the communities. A solution is being
    sought by the Government with alternative sources to deal with the crisis.

55. Monsenho Expedito system water management, measurement and loss reduction. The Project
    originally foresaw investing in the reduction of water losses in main water distribution
    pipelines and systems. These investments would be complemented by other water losses
    reduction actions financed by KfW and CEF to support CAERN. Due to the funding available,
    the actions for Bank support were revised and it was agreed that the Project would focus on
    Monsenhor Expedito pipeline, complementing water losses measures being taken by
    CAERN30. The Project supported the initial actions with the purchase of 133 macro-meters –
    56 installed in productive units and 77 in the derivations to rural communities. The Project
    also purchased and installed 25,000 micrometers 31 . All the activities combined led to
    reductions in water losses in Monsenhor Expedito pipeline and distribution systems from 46
    percent estimated losses in 2008 to 38 percent in 201532.

 56. Monsenhor Expedito pipeline system expansion. The Monsenhor Expedito pipeline supplies
     water to 30 municipalities and 280 small communities in the interior of the state, benefiting
     some 300,000 inhabitants. The Project expanded and improved the coverage of water supply
     systems with the investment made to Monsenhor Expedito pipeline system, through expansion
     of the pipeline and drilling of 12 new wells for complementary water production. Originally,


29
   As a result of the severe drought period that is affecting the State, 27 percent of the communities currently
have intermittent water supply. Management, operation and maintenance of the systems, in most cases, have
been handed over to the communities, some of them with the support from CAERN. Despite the Project
efforts to find alternatives for sustainable management, operation and maintenance of rural water supply
systems in Rio Grande do Norte, it has not been possible to achieve a consolidated State strategy yet. Twenty-
three systems show that revenue from water tariffs does not cover operating costs and twelve still did not
have water tariff implemented by the Project closing date. Maintenance costs are eventually subsidized by
the municipalities or by CAERN. Beneficiary survey results are presented in Annex 5.
30
   Rehabilitation of infrastructure, preparation and implementation of rules and procedures for rural water
supply, increased penalties for illegal water connections, cadaster of rural communities, installation of water
loss prevention equipment in the pumping stations, rehabilitation of pumping stations and several reservoirs.
31
   20,911 units were installed by CAERN. In addition, CAERN also purchased and installed 10,900
micrometers.
32
   The baseline of 46% was established with the information available at the time. It is an estimation of losses
based on the billing of consumers versus revenues. The actual systems losses are being refined as more
information becomes available with the installation of meters and diagnosis of the infrastructure. The actual
losses identified after Project closing is 38%.




                                                      14
     the main benefit from this intervention would be to protect the water resources of Lagoa do
     Bonfim, while meeting the population’s demand for water. Specific results of the interventions
     are: (i) the direct and indirect intake from Lagoa do Bonfim has been reduced to 212 l/s33; (ii)
     growth in CAERN’s net revenue from an increase in the volume of supplied water and in the
     share of active connections with water meters from 60 to 89 percent, as well as an
     improvement in energy efficiency; and (iii) improved access to water by new users or users
     who used to receive small and erratic quantities of water.

57. Cruzeta Irrigated Perimeter Pilot created a showcase example of a modernized irrigation
    system that allowed improved production, increased efficiency, increased resilience to
    extreme events, improved O&M, and diversified agriculture. The pilot integrated structural
    and non-structural approaches to drought management, improving both the economic and
    environmental sustainability of local agriculture. Project activities consisted of both
    investments in the improvement of water efficiency in the scheme and a proposed water
    allocation protocol for dry years. Water availability to the perimeter is limited by competing
    uses, mainly the water supply of the city of Cruzeta. Structural and non-structural approaches
    aimed at increasing the perimeters resilience to lower water allocations. Expected benefits
    deriving from the interventions will include: increase in irrigated area for the same volume of
    available water due to the water efficiency gains from water-saving irrigation techniques; and
    greater certainty about water availability for irrigation leading to smaller losses of annual
    crops and better planning of the surface to be installed with permanent crops, resulting in
    stable outputs and less damaged orchards during dry years34. Cruzeta is a model project for
    the region in terms of alternatives for improved efficiency of small irrigation schemes, which
    are very common in the Northeastern Brazil.

58. Cobra Micro-Watershed Pilot: Like Cruzeta, this pilot project was successful in
    demonstrating improved agricultural production and resilience through implementation of
    environmentally sustainable water and water soil conservation practices. Cobra micro-
    watershed covers 130 km2 and the river flows through three municipalities of the semi-arid
    region of the Western Seridó. The Project used the entire micro-watershed as a planning unit
    to design a landscape restoration process focused in benefitting subsistence rural production
    combined with positive environmental impacts. It supported the conservation and restoration
    of top soil and water, slow down erosion and siltation processes, promote vegetation
    restoration, and increase the viability of smallholder farming 35 . This initiative has been
    nationally recognized as an important approach to combat desertification in the Northeast



33
   At appraisal, the system was extracting 228l/s from the lake and 176l/s from wells drilled close to the lake,
resulting in a combined extraction from the lake’s water resources of 404 l/s. The PAD argued that the direct
and indirect water extraction would be reduced to 230 l/s as to guarantee that even under extreme droughts
the lake would be preserved.
34
   Due to the current severe drought period, the irrigation perimeter is not receiving water from the
reservoir as supply is prioritized to the city of Cruzeta. Some farmers have been able to continue production
with the use of alternative sources such as shallow wells or downstream river flows.
35
   The supported technologies included: (i) the control of sediment run-off and retention of organic matter to
contain erosion and maintain soil for agriculture, with the placement of line-barriers built with local rocks;
and (ii) the construction of underground water retention structures across stream channels, using tarp and
rocks. Each underground barrier was complemented with a well, placed upstream from the tarp to collect
water accumulated within the soil. The results of the interventions were felt mostly during the initial years
with the farmers being able to continue production after the start of the dry period. However, due to the severe
drought, benefits have not been felt in recent years.

        region and certified with the Dryland Champions Program, supported by the Ministry of
        Environment and the UNCCD36.

59. Rehabilitation of key bulk water infrastructure. Due to delays and adjustments in dam
        rehabilitation designs and works due to the need to draft new designs and difficulties with the
        contractor, the Project closed before a successful bidding process for rehabilitation works
        could be concluded. However, almost all licenses for rehabilitation were obtained by project
        closing, and 12 engineering designs were completed. The failure to contract dam rehabilitation
        works, led directly to an undisbursed amount of about US$10 million (28% of the total) at
        Project closing. SEMARH is seeking support at the Federal Government level, with the
        Ministry of National Integration, to implement these works.

3.3 Efficiency

60. Improved WRM is key to providing socially and environmentally sustainable economic
    development in RGN and, by its very nature, the impact of the project would be felt throughout
    the economy of the State and by all segments of society. Moreover, improved efficiency in
    water use would lead not only to direct economic benefits, but also to environmental benefits
    such as less pressure on water sources, which are not easily quantifiable. Consequently, the
    Project is not amenable to traditional cost-benefit analysis.

61. The actual Project cost distribution is considerably different from that foreseen at Appraisal.
    Water supply systems for small rural communities are the second largest investment,
    representing 11 percent of the Project costs. Hence, an analysis of these investments was
    undertaken in addition to the analyses undertaken in the PAD for the investments in
    Monsenhor Expedito Water Supply system and the Pilot rehabilitation and modernization of
    small farmer irrigation schemes. The analyses followed as much as possible the methodology
    adopted for the PAD. However, there were substantial differences between the actual and
    estimated types of costs and benefits that needed to be considered.

62. The PAD expected that the main benefit from the Monsenhor Expedito Infrastructure
    intervention would be to protect the water resources of Lagoa do Bonfim, while meeting the
    population demand for water. At Appraisal, the system was extracting a combined volume of
    404 l/s from the lake’s water resources and the PAD argued that the direct and indirect water
    extraction would be reduced to 230 l/s so as to guarantee that even under extreme droughts,
    the lake would be preserved. These environmental benefits could not be quantified in the PAD,
    but the intervention could be justified by the benefits obtained from the assumed savings by
    current consumers from changing to a cheaper source of water supply and increased
    consumption of water at a lower price by both current and new consumers. The E-IRR was
    estimated to be 18.7 percent and considered to be substantially efficient.

63. The actual major quantifiable financial benefits are the growth in CAERN’s net revenue from
    an increase in the volume of supplied water, in the share of active connections with water
    meters and in energy efficiency. The major economic benefit is the improved access to water
    by new users or users who received small and erratic quantities of water. The investments
    yield a financial IRR of 10 percent and an E-IRR of 14 percent. In addition, the water intake
    from Lagoa do Bonfim was reduced to 212 l/s. Despite the differences identified in cost

                                                    16
     distribution and benefits when compared to what was foreseen at Appraisal37, the efficiency
     of the investments made in Monsenhor Expedito pipeline is substantial.

64. With regards to the Pilot intervention for the rehabilitation and modernization of the water
    supply system associated with the Cruzeta Dam, the PAD did not consider the occurrence of
    drought years or the benefits from increased irrigation efficiency and improved water
    management on sectors other than agriculture. For the PAD, three alternative models were
    built which resulted in E-IRR estimates between 18.5 and 31.8 percent. The model used for
    the current analysis improved some analytical aspects and considered the current cropping
    pattern in the irrigation scheme, different from that in the PAD, as demand for agricultural
    products has changed. The estimated E-IRR is 11 percent, a good result considering the
    drought of the last three years. Thus, efficiency is considered substantial.

65. The investment made in the installation of 33 small water supply systems provided water
    access to 33 small communities. The financial analysis assessed whether the revenue from
    water tariffs is sufficient to generate a positive net present value or as a minimum, cover
    operation costs. The economic results express the net benefits from supplying piped water to
    the beneficiary population. The E-IRR was estimated at 29 percent should the investments’
    sustainability be ensured by the municipalities. However, two water supply systems have not
    yet been connected to the water supply network and 23 systems show negative financial NPV
    and 13 negative gross margin (revenue from water tariffs does not cover operation costs).
    These results mostly reflect problems with complementary infrastructure planning, lack of
    capacity from some municipalities to implement an adequate tariff policy and, in two cases,
    low cost effectiveness due to a high dispersion of the beneficiary households. Only 43 percent
    of the communities are paying tariffs to cover operational costs.

66. Although not all Project investments clearly demonstrate positive efficiency ratings, the
    efficiency of the largest investment (65 percent) of the Project, expansion of Monsenhor
    Expedito pipeline, is rated substantial. In addition, important investments made in Cruzeta
    irrigated perimeter have also demonstrated substantial efficiency. Therefore, overall
    efficiency of project investments is rated substantial.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

67. Overall Outcome rating of the Project is “moderately satisfactory”, in line with the relevance
    of objectives, design and implementation, the efficacy of results achieved and level of
    efficiency discussed above. The Project achieved the majority of its indicators and almost all
    PDO indicators. Substantial results with a significant number of beneficiaries were achieved
    through works and pilot projects, and institutionally, it represented a strategic tool for the
    development of the water resources sector in the State of Rio Grande do Norte. The results
    were achieved with substantial efficiency. The Project helped create an institutional, legal and
    policy foundation for Integrated Water Resource Management in the State.

68. This is all the more important as the water sector continues to be an even more critical area
    for Brazil as a whole due to increased urbanization and climate change. The results of project


37
  Investments in the expansion of Monsenhor Expedito pipeline system were foreseen as 34% of the total
Project cost. Actual costs were 65%. At Appraisal, the main benefit expected was the reduction of water
extraction from 404l/s to 230l/s.


                                                  17
     interventions will provide tools for increasing drought resilience and managing an
     increasingly scarce water resource. There were however also some challenges in
     implementation, which led to delays, non-completion of some activities and undisbursed funds
     at Project closing.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

69. All of the outcomes of the project were actually intended. The poverty impact is expected to
    have been highly significant for the Project, in particular Components 2 and 3, focused on the
    geographic region of the Seridó, Rio Grande do Norte’s poorest and least-developed area and
    home to ten percent of the State’s population. The activities focused on provision of basic
    services and strengthening living conditions of rural populations in the semiarid areas which
    experience cyclical droughts.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

70. The Project had an explicit focus on improving institutional management through Component
    1. Important structural changes in the sector were initiated under the Project, the most
    noteworthy being the approval of the water resources sector institutional reform. Additionally,
    the institutional coordination and integration required during implementation, while
    challenging, provided an important opportunity for growth and improvement for participating
    institutional actors in the sector, as well as identifying areas where additional development is
    required. However, as some activities under this component were not concluded, results with
    regard to institutional strengthening were less than hoped for at Appraisal. Additionally,
    absorption of project implementation capacity into the long-term State institutional structure
    may be limited by the fact that the PMU was composed entirely of consultants whose long-
    term status in the public sector remains unclear.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

71. A survey was carried out with the beneficiaries of the small rural water supply systems when
    all 33 benefited communities were visited. In general terms, all works were completed – 100%
    are able to distribute water to residences. In 2 cases (as of December 2013), the water sources
    have dried up – the former is being supplied by “carro-pipa” and for the latter, the construction
    of a pipeline to bring water from the Piranhas/Acu River is under construction. Of the 33
    communities, 72.8% are supplied with water on a daily basis, with variation in the number of
    hours with available water. In the case of communities in 2 municipalities (27.2%), water is
    supplied normally in intervals of 4 days. The detailed results are presented in Annex 5.

72. A workshop organized by the State Government and the Bank to assess and discuss the
    outcomes and lessons learned of the Project was held in March 2015. Participants included
    SEMARH management, overall technical team and PMU staff as well as staff from other
    entities involved in the implementation of the Project. The event was helpful in highlighting
    the achievements of the Project, as well as the historical context and precedents. The workshop
    was designed as a learning event analyzing the design, management and execution of the
    Project. Some of the lessons identified include: permanent technical staff in the structure of the
    Program's managing body is essential for adequate implementation; political coordination is
    required in order for the "water" theme to be recognized as a priority for the development of



                                                 18
    the State; and the state must define a rural sanitation policy and evaluate sustainable
    management models. The detailed lessons learned are presented in Annex 6.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Substantial

73. As the major institutional improvements – particularly to IGARN and SEMARH—foreseen
    under the Project were not fully consolidated, there is a substantial risk to maintenance of
    some Project development results by the State Government. The ending of the consultant
    contracts for the PMU as well as the possibility of continued staff/administration changes may
    also endanger the sustainability of the Project’s results. However, the new Administration
    (which came into office after Project closing, during the drafting of the ICR) has shown to
    have highly prioritized the sector and placed high value on the studies and results of the Project,
    which may mitigate these challenges.

74. The sustainability of the largest investment i.e. the interventions made in Monsenhor Expedito
    pipeline system is guaranteed by CAERN, responsible for operating and maintaining the
    system. The successful results of the pilot interventions can be replicated in other areas of the
    State. The experience of Cruzeta is also replicable to many other small irrigation schemes
    present in the Northeast region. However, the continuation of such interventions would be the
    responsibility of other institutions, which carry specific mandate for irrigation. Cobra
    microcatchment pilot activities are applicable to several other watersheds in the Seridó region
    of the State.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

75. Project design overall, was technically solid, drawing on extensive previous Bank experience
    in the Northeast region and in Brazil’s water sector. Links with interventions financed by other
    institutions in the State, as well as participation by FAO consultants, were successfully
    incorporated into the Project design. Additionally, the Integrated Water Resources
    Management approach employed addressed both institutional and infrastructural aspects of
    Rio Grande do Norte’s water sector, combining on-the-ground improvements in water supply
    and long-term institutional change. Overall, this was a well-researched preparation process
    driven by client demand.

76. Many of the risks foreseen did materialize - in particular, lack of implementation capacity on
    the part of the Borrower and difficulties with counterpart financing. These were correctly
    identified at Preparation. However, the implementation challenges that would be posed by the
    Borrower’s lack of financial and institutional capacity were substantially underestimated, and
    sufficient mitigation measures were not incorporated into project design. This was
    exacerbated by a project design that, while demonstrating an integrated water management
    vision, was fragmented into a number of small activities requiring increased supervision.

77. While all environmental safeguards and licensing requirements were met, the failure at
    preparation to plan and budget for the costs and time required to ensure compliance led to




                                                 19
     higher costs and longer time periods than expected for execution that could have been
     mitigated by more careful preparation.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

78. The support and continuity provided by the Bank were key in the institutional reform process
    for the water resources sector, bringing international experience in IWRM and institutional
    strengthening to Rio Grande do Norte. In particular, highly specialized technical support
    provided by a multidisciplinary team (WRM, groundwater, soil conservation, environmental
    management)—including FAO input for the Cruzeta irrigation perimeter—was constant and
    of high quality during the Project, bringing about successful results. Additionally, proactive
    restructuring by the supervising team on two occasions allowed the Bank to respond to
    implementation challenges due to counterpart funding, speeding up implementation, and to
    extend the Project to conclude the maximum number of activities possible. Although part of
    the Bank team remained the same throughout implementation, the Project also saw a total of
    five Bank Task Team Leaders—one during preparation, and four during implementation,
    which sometimes led to different approaches during the implementation process. The ICR
    delivery date was extended by three months to June 30, 2015, to allow for adequate completion
    internal quality reviews considering that the necessary information was received from the
    client only in March 2015.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

79. There was substantial continuity between the preparation and supervision processes and
    flexibility during supervision in responding to challenges underestimated at preparation.
    Despite a challenging implementation period, the majority of the Project’s original objectives
    were met by the end of the 22-month extension period. Close Bank support to the Borrower
    during implementation was essential in ensuring these outcomes. At the same time, Project
    design composed of numerous small activities, underestimation of implementation risks and
    overestimated Borrower capacity contributed to the difficulties faced by the Project.

80. Although, quality at entry is considered moderately unsatisfactory, the problems identified
    were adequately dealt with during implementation to avoid negative impacts on the outcomes.
    Therefore the Overall Bank Performance rating is set as Moderately Satisfactory in line with
    the Overall Outcome rating.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

81. Initial prioritization. During preparation, the State Government showed substantial
    commitment to the Project, making a strategic decision to give preference to the water sector
    in the allocation of potential external resources. This commitment continued for the first 18
    months after effectiveness, and for 6 months in 2011 after election of a new State
    administration. However, after an election year in 2010 and a short time after the entry of a
    new administration in 2011, prioritization of the sector and the Project by the higher levels of
    government suffered, in part due to frequent administration changes and non-technical
    leadership at the State Secretariat of Water Resources (SEMARH). This diminished



                                                20
     prioritization manifested itself in less support to the PMU. The project objectives however
     remained relevant.

82. Counterpart funds challenges. Difficulties in making available counterpart funds due to
    budget restrictions led to slow-down of implementation and negative relations with
    contractors for some activities. Additionally, internal controls and clearances for the State for
    bidding processes caused delays.

83. Staff turnover. In addition, the technical capacity of the Secretariat suffered over the course of
    Project implementation. Despite the Bank's efforts to support strengthening of the water
    resources institutions, the State's financial constraints impeded the hiring of permanent staff
    to the Secretariat, and no career plan was implemented for the institution. Throughout
    implementation, both SEMARH and IGARN were fully staffed by personnel lent from other
    government institutions or temporary consultants. Frequent staff and administration turnover
    undermined Project continuity, further delaying implementation.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

84. Overall, the PMU coordinator and team (who were consultants hired by the Project) remained
    engaged and committed to deliver throughout the implementation process. Performance was
    hindered by political decisions and election pressure during 2010. However, as described in
    paragraphs 27 and 28, substantial improvement was felt with the team that took over after
    2011 and remained until closing. The new team was committed and made extra efforts to
    improve implementation. Noteworthy however, was the strong performance in the compliance
    of environmental safeguards and implementation of environmental impact compensation
    measures38. High quality technical performance was also shown in other areas such as the
    implementation of the pilot projects and the groundwater activities. Nevertheless, the Project
    experienced major contracting delays due to limited PMU procurement capacity, which
    slowed implementation—as a result, important Project activities were not completed by
    closing. Additionally, the implementing agency showed limited institutional capacity for
    leadership and coordination among the participating institutional actors for the Project. In
    terms of management of contracted consulting firms, project implementation was hindered by
    the poor quality of services due, in some cases, to lack of adequate supervision and unreliable
    counterpart payments to contractors.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

85. Despite initial prioritization of the Project, relevance of its objectives and overall PMU
    commitment, the Government’s failure to show continued commitment to the Project and to
    provide the necessary institutional capacity to SEMARH and the PMU negatively impacted
    implementation and disbursement, as well as the results achieved for some activities.


38
  Environmental safeguard compliance activities included the regularization of environmental licenses for
Monsenhor Expedito expansion works, construction of small water supply systems, rehabilitation of dams,
and modernization of Cruzeta irrigated perimeter. As part of the compensation measures for environmental
impacts of the expansion of the Monsenhor Expedito water pipeline, a territorial zoning proposal of the
Bonfim-Guaraíras Environmental Protection Area (APA) was prepared to support and guide the preparation
of the APA’s Management Plan.


                                                   21
     Therefore, despite an overall Outcome rating of Moderately Satisfactory, the Borrower
     Performance in many aspects was an important constraint during implementation and is rated
     as Moderately Unsatisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

86. Streamlined projects with focused activities may prove easier for low-capacity Borrowers to
    implement. The project’s diverse objectives and numerous activities created a heavy
    implementation burden. This was difficult for the PMU to support without sufficient
    institutional capacity to manage a long list of activities, and lacking the technical expertise for
    instance, in contracting and contract management and supervision of the Project’s works and
    consultants.

87. Institutional reforms require strong commitment and priority from the Government.
    Addressing the necessary institutional changes for strengthening policies requires strong
    commitment and continued support from all the key decision makers. In a scenario of scarce
    resources and competing needs, it is essential to translate the technical aspects of the sector
    needs and benefits of institutional changes to the central Government level (planning and
    finance) to receive adequate support throughout the process.

88. Ensuring institutional capacity to sustain results, both in terms of institutional change and
    infrastructural improvements, must start at preparation. Major staff and administration
    turnover at SEMARH and the PMU damaged the already relatively low institutional and
    technical capacity of the Borrower to implement and sustain results. The risks of increasing
    politicization of leadership, shifting priorities, and loss of technical capacity with staff changes
    should be considered and addressed at preparation. In this Project, these issues could have
    been mitigated through better integration of the PMU into SEMARH (as career staff rather
    than consultants).

89. Stakeholder/partner input during preparation may not be sufficient to create a sustainable
    participatory process. Better continuity of the participatory process though implementation
    could also have mitigated the problems of staff turnover and co-executing organs acting in
    isolation. In terms of stakeholder participation, care should be taken to make participatory
    events more accessible to a broader cross-section of society, as well as partnering on equal
    footing with municipal actors in intervention areas.

90. Integration of co-executing agencies is essential for efficient execution. Although the required
    legal instruments were in place, more clearly defined mechanisms for coordination and
    integration of co-executing agencies should have been established at preparation. This
    includes integrating staff, financial management, planning responsibility (through feedback
    and restructuring), and execution capacity across all participating institutional actors.
    Allocation and clear definition of responsibilities from the local (activity) to the State (project)
    level is also a necessity. Additionally, better integration of the Project representative for each
    co-executor into their home agencies as well as the PMU could have allowed for more
    effective communication and decision-making.

91. When strengthening the landscape restoration aspect and increasing environmental and
    economic benefits, replication initiatives should include complementary actions to restore
    riparian vegetation, as well as to delimit, formalize and restore permanent preservation areas
    and legal reserves within the watershed. In addition to strengthening the results regarding soil
    and water restoration, this would also contribute to fulfil a legal requirement under the recently


                                                  22
     revised environmental legislation, which established the Rural Environmental Cadaster
     (CAR). In addition, the continuous provision of rural technical assistance for at least two years
     is essential to guide producers in the adequate and full use of these technologies for sustainable
     rural production.

92. When irrigation perimeters rely on multi-purpose reservoirs, it is essential to establish criteria
    and conditions for negotiated water allocation. There must be the establishment upfront of
    different operations criteria depending on the level of the reservoir, aiming at ensuring
    availability to priority uses (human water supply to the city of Cruzeta), while optimizing the
    productive use in the perimeter, ensuring, in particular, minimum availability of water for
    permanent cultures, and limiting upfront the implementation of annual cultures in line with
    the restrictions imposed.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

93. The implementing agency prepared and submitted to the Bank the Borrower’s Final Report,
    which is available in Project files. The comments received from the Borrower to the ICR are
    presented integrally in Annex 7.

94. In summary, the State of Rio Grande do Norte agrees with the content of the Report, considers
    the Project implementation successful and the continuity of the partnership with the Bank,
    including through a new operation, very important to allow continuity of activities initiated
    and consolidation of results.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

1. The detailed Project components and planned outputs are described as follows.

2. Component 1: Institutional Development and Water Resources Management Instruments
   (US$15.1M, 25.2 percent of project cost). The objective of this component was to improve the
   state’s water resources management capabilities and develop adequate water resources
   management instruments. Project activities were directed largely at strengthening the main
   institutions in the water sector and improving the legal framework for their operation;
   consolidating the design and operation of an integrated water resources management system,
   with effective stakeholder participation and using the watershed as the basic territorial
   management unit, to ensure equitable and efficient development that is socially, economically
   and environmentally sustainable; implementing an integrated water resources information
   system to improve the policy and investment decision-making process; and implementing new
   operation and management models, including improved tariff collection mechanisms, for large
   and small water supply systems.

3. Target groups included: water management agencies, including SEMARH, IGARN and
   CAERN; water users and their associations; SEPLAN and the state government

4. Main outcomes included: improved institutional and legal framework for the water sector,
   water rights system and water charges system implemented, consolidation of water users
   associations, water resources management plan, water resources emergency plan, water
   resources M&E network, studies related to water availability and use, and system to monitor
   implementation of the government’s public expenditures programs and assess their impact on
   poverty reduction.

5. This component was implemented through five subcomponents:

6. Subcomponent 1.1 - Improvement of the Legal and Institutional Framework: (i) a review of the
   existing legal framework for water resources management and the presentation of eventual
   legal reforms, including the development and implementation of a water rights system, and an
   assessment of staffing requirements by SEMARH and IGARN to fully carry out their functions;
   (ii) institutional strengthening of the State Secretariat of Environment and Water Resources
   (SEMARH) and the Water Management Agency (IGARN), including the commitment by
   GoRN to fully staff them in accordance with the requirements determined by the
   aforementioned assessment; (iii) technical assistance to strengthen state policies and
   development strategies in the water resources sector, irrigation sector and reuse of treated
   wastewater; (iv) strengthening of 24 existing provisional water users associations (WUAs), the
   creation of 84 new WUAs, including the development of a system of water user fees to
   guarantee their financial sustainability, and the establishment of watershed management
   committees in the watersheds of four rivers: Apodi-Mossoró, Piranhas-Açu, Pitangi and
   Potengi to test a participatory approach to water resources management, using the watershed
   as the basic management unit; lessons learned during establishment and operation of these
   committees would be used in the design and implementation of the second phase project to
   contribute to the successful implementation of a basin-based WRM mechanism; and (v)
   training program, including formal and informal environmental education programs.

7. Subcomponent 1.2 - Water Sector Planning Instruments: (i) an updated State Water Resources
   Management Plan; (ii) the development of a methodology for the preparation of watershed-
   specific WRM plans, which would be applied to the preparation of at least three Water


                                               25
    Resources Management Plans – for the watersheds of Apodí-Mossoró, Pitangi and Potengi;
    (iii) preparation of an emergency plan to minimize the effects of droughts and other extreme
    climatic events on the state’s economy; (iv) preparation of an incentive scheme to promote the
    adoption of efficient irrigation technologies; (v) preparation of hydrological studies on
    groundwater resources and new water supply sources; which together with (vi) preparation of
    a land surface zoning for aquifer protection, would contribute to better management of
    groundwater resources; and (vii) preparation of an Atlas of Water and Environmental
    Resources.

8. Subcomponent 1.3 - Information Instruments: (i) an improved Integral Water Resources
   Information System, incorporated into a Geographical Information System; and (ii) a water
   resources monitoring and evaluation network, are expected to improve investment decision
   making by both the state government and private investors

9. Subcomponent 1.4 - Operational Instruments: (i) development and operation of a water rights
   system, including a cadastral survey of current water users and their respective water rights;
   (ii) development of an efficient water tariff system, using as a basis the conclusions and
   recommendations of the PMSS-financed study on reforms of the current water tariff system ;
   (iii) development of an operational model, including an on-line information system, for state-
   run water infrastructure as well as (iv) a framework for the operation of water supply systems
   for small communities, which would benefit from the results of the analysis of alternative
   scenarios for WSS service provision in the state undertaken by PMSS.

10. Subcomponent 1.5 - Studies and Special Projects: support to undertake several water resources
    management studies. The main studies identified covered issues related to: (i) development of
    a framework for improved management of solid wastes, to build on the experience gained about
    carbon finance activities during project preparation; (ii) identification of resource conservation
    zones directly related to aquifer recharge areas; and (iii) other studies identified during project
    implementation, which would be evaluated on a case-by case basis. Under “Special Projects”,
    the project would finance the design of a Monitoring and Evaluation System for State
    Government Programs and would provide technical assistance to SEPLAN for its operation;
    this would enable SEPLAN to have a central system to monitor the implementation of
    government programs, including investment programs in the water sector, and
    comprehensively evaluate their impact.

                           Purchase of equipment to support IGARN activities.
1.2. Water Sector Planning Hydrogeological and Hydrodynamics Studies of Barreiras
     Instruments           Aquifer Littoral North and Littoral South Areas. The studies
                           were able to deliver the main expected outcomes, which
                           were: characterization of the Barreiras aquifer; identification
                           of main groundwater flow patterns; mapping of pollution
                           risks; global and regional water balances, with estimate of
                           renewable reserves; identification of productive areas (higher
                           specific yields); from the conjugation of renewable reserves
                           and well productivity, identification of regions of higher
                           groundwater resources potentiality.

                              The immediate impact of this activity has been the
                              improvement of the available information for the concession
                              of groundwater use licenses. The expected impact of these
                              studies is to help decision-makers to better manage their
                              groundwater resources, indicating which areas are worth to
                              be studied in detail.

                              As part of the evaluation of the impact generated by this
                              activity, it is remarkable that CAERN (the public state water
                              supply company) drilled four boreholes in the Maxaranguape
                              river area which had been spotted as of high potentiality by
                              the Litoral Norte study. The average well yield obtained of
                              130 m3/h, confirmed the expectations. According to the
                              information received from CAERN, after the initial
                              promising results, this company was able to obtain federal
                              funds for conducting a detailed hydrogeological and
                              geophysical study of this area in order to determine whether
                              it could become a new source of bulk water for the city of
                              Natal.

                                   within SEMARH for public response, analyses and
                                   assessment of processes, and preparation of the Water Rights
                                   and Licensing Manual.

                                        Hydro-geophysical research of Boa Cica area to complement
                                        the hydrogeological information of Barreiras aquifer. The
                                        Project supported a geophysical study of the Boa Cica region.
                                        The study concluded that hydrogeological conditions in the
                                        northern part of the expropriated area seem to be similar to
                                        those found in the existing well field supported by the Project
                                        to expand the production of Monsenhor Expedito pipeline.
                                        Thus, production well yields would be similar. Moreover, the
                                        study showed that the groundwater flow and storage in the
                                        Dunas-Barreiras aquifer system is significantly controlled by
                                        tectonics. This reinforces the overall assessment on the
                                        fragility of this aquifer system in Boa Cica, and the need for
                                        a tight monitoring.


12. Component 2: Natural Resources Conservation and Protection (US$5.1M, 8.5 percent of
    project cost). This component was to support the preservation of water quality; improve water
    use efficiency through reducing water losses in state-owned public water supply infrastructure,
    promoting better water conservation practices among users, and generating water-saving
    technologies, including using treated wastewater; and promote the adoption of sustainable
    agricultural practices on irrigated lands.

13. Target groups included: water users in the pilot microcatchments and in the state as a whole,
    and public water agencies.

14. Main outcomes included: implementation of pilot natural resources management plans in two
    microcatchments; improved maintenance and operation of bulk water transmission pipeline, as
    well as billing and collection in water distribution networks to prevent physical and financial
    losses; potential uses of treated wastewater researched, and incentive schemes to promote its
    use designed and tested; construction of at least 350 small soil retention schemes in streams or
    brooks located in areas of heavy erosion to control sedimentation and improve water quality.

  This activity originally foresaw the studies of alternatives, environmental assessment and basic design of
Canal do Sal. However, constant delays from the contractor and insufficient capacity to deliver the results
led to the cancelation of the contract. The studies of alternatives was the only product delivered and approved
by SEMARH.

15. This component included the following four subcomponents:

16. Subcomponent 2.1 - Microcatchment Pilot Projects: The project would finance the
    participatory preparation and implementation of pilot projects in two microcatchments. The
    first one would be implemented in the watershed of the Cobra River in Seridó, which is
    characterized by severe environmental degradation. The second one would be implemented in
    the watershed of the Sal e Una River, located in the coastal areas of the eastern parts of the
    state, where native forest and vegetation are threatened by deforestation and unsustainable
    agricultural practices. The project would finance a participatory diagnostic of the present state
    of each microwatershed and the design and implementation of appropriate natural resources
    management plans to promote soil conservation practices as well as the recuperation of native
    vegetation and the adoption of a regulated use of agrochemicals.

17. Subcomponent 2.2 - Prevention of Losses in the State’s Bulk Water Transmission Networks: (i)
    network maintenance; (ii) macro-measurements along the water transmission systems to
    monitor water losses; (iii) a program for the prevention of illegal network connections; (iv) a
    cadastral survey of water users; and (v) a program to improve the tariff collection system.

18. Subcomponent 2.3 - Prevention of Losses in the Public Water Supply System: This
    subcomponent would consist of investments made through CAERN’s CEF-financed
    institutional development program, of which approximately US$2.5 million would be accepted
    as project counterpart funding. Investments would be made in information processing
    equipment for billing and collections and for the installation of micro- and macro-measurement
    equipment.

19. Subcomponent 2.4 - Uses of Treated Wastewater: This subcomponent would finance research
    on possible uses of treated wastewater and the design of incentive schemes to promote its
    appropriate use.

20. Subcomponent 2.5 - Sedimentation Control: This would finance the construction of about 350
    small soil retention schemes in streams or brooks located in areas of heavy erosion, as a means
    of controlling sedimentation and improving water quality.

     2.1. Microcatchment Pilot   Interventions under the project were implemented within
         Projects                Cobra micro-watershed to support the conservation and
                                 restoration of top soil and water, slow down erosion and
                                 siltation processes, promote vegetation restoration, and
                                 increase the viability of family agriculture. The Project built
                                 57 underground water barriers strategically located along the
                                 main course and some tributaries of the Cobra river. All
                                 barriers were complemented with wells to collect retained
                                 water, 45 of which built with project funds, and 12 built or
                                 repaired under a partnership with local governments. The
                                 project also built 58 rock barriers to retain sediment runoff
                                 and repair erosion processes in critical sites along the
                                 watershed. In total, 12,478 meters of line barriers were placed


                                                 29
                               along contour lines with two functions: retain sediment runoff
                               in agricultural fields and restore top soil. All works were
                               carried out with the assistance of a contractor and the
                               benefitted rural producers, which increased ownership of
                               project investments and functioned as hands-on training on
                               the supported technologies.

                               A technical partnership with the Federal University of Rio
                               Grande do Norte (UFRN) allowed the development of several
                               research projects, which provided important validation data
                               to the project. Research results proved that underground
                               water barriers in the micro-watershed, and even older ones in
                               the larger watershed, did not cause salinization of soil nor
                               water. This supportive result is particularly relevant as the
                               salinization of soil and water is a common cause of concern
                               in the semi-arid region. An on-going research project seeks to
                               define the ideal depth of wells associated with underground
                               water barriers, as initial data collection revealed that older
                               wells that were deepened maintained more water that the
                               shallower ones, even in long drought periods.

                               To build capacity among benefited producers and ensure
                               adequate and full use of the supported hydro-environmental
                               technologies, the project built strategic partnerships with
                               IDEMA, the private mining company SUSA, and municipal
                               governments to provide training to producers. A training
                               program in four modules was jointly structured by the
                               project’s technical team, IDEMA and SUSA; and logistics
                               arrangements were shared among the project, SUSA and
                               municipal governments.

                               Stimulated by these activities enabled by the project, UFRN
                               also developed and implemented a training module for
                               producers on monitoring the underground water barriers and
                               their effects on the natural environment. Furthermore,
                               IDEMA decided to develop additional modules on agro-
                               ecological economic development, addressing themes such as
                               ecosystems, biodiversity and agro-biodiversity, rural tourism,
                               among others, to be taught at the Cobra micro-watershed.
                               Additionally, taking advantage of an existing contract with a
                               communications company, the project’s technical team
                               developed and implemented a series of talks, theatrical
                               presentations and participatory workshops on sustainable
                               water use and solid waste recycling at the Cobra
                               municipalities.
2.2. Prevention of Losses in   Monsenhor       Expedito     pipeline:      rehabilitation  of
    the State’s Bulk Water     infrastructure, preparation and implementation of rules and
    Transmission               procedures for rural water supply, cadaster of rural
    Networks.                  communities, installation of water loss prevention equipment
                               in the pumping stations, rehabilitation of 14 pumping stations

                                         and several distribution reservoirs40. The Project financed the
                                         purchase and installation of macrometers in productive units
                                         and derivations to rural communities.
        2.3. Prevention of Losses in     Monsenhor Expedito distribution system: rehabilitation of
            the Public Water             infrastructure, installation of 35,900 micrometers.
            Supply System
        2.5. Sedimentation Control       Construction of 58 sediment control barriers and 12,478m of
                                         line barriers as part of Cobra micro-watershed pilot activities.


22. Component 3: Water Infrastructure (US$35.1M, 58.8 percent of project cost). The objectives
    of this component were to enhance the state’s water management capabilities and to improve
    general water availability. Technical and financial assistance was provided to: improve water
    availability through the rehabilitation of existing infrastructure; construct supplementary water
    infrastructure works to improve water supply for the population being served by the Monsenhor
    Expedito transmission main and for poor scattered rural populations; and implement pilot
    interventions for improved irrigation efficiency.

23. Target groups included: the state’s poor rural population, including small farmers in the pilot
    irrigation projects; water users and their associations throughout the state; and water
    management and supply entities throughout the state.

24. Main outcomes included: rehabilitation, maintenance and improved operation of at least 20
    existing dams and reservoirs for multiple use; improved capacity of the Monsenhor Expedito
    Water Transmission System thereby improving the reliability of water supply to the population
    of about 160,000 people currently served by the system; rehabilitation and improvement of
    small water supply systems to supply drinking water to about 160 communities that currently
    live without adequate water supply in rural areas; and rehabilitation and modernization of small
    farmer irrigated production systems and improved water resources management system in the
    Seridó region through participatory pilot interventions.

25. This component was implemented through four subcomponents:

26. Subcomponent 3.1 - Rehabilitation and Maintenance of Existing Water Infrastructure: which
    would finance approximately US$3.5 million in feasibility studies, designs and implementation
    of rehabilitation and maintenance works, and the development and implementation of improved
    operation plans of at least 20 dams and reservoirs. The reservoirs to be rehabilitated, with a
    capacity of over 5 million cubic meters each, were prioritized according to the degree to which
    they are structurally compromised. Additionally, the project would update the technical
    information on the remaining 25 of the 45 total state-run dams. These 25 dams would be
    rehabilitated during the second phase project.

27. Subcomponent 3.2 - Expansion of Water Infrastructure: improve the Monsenhor Expedito
    Water Transmission System that serves a population of 160,000 people in the center of the
    state. The Bank-financed improvement of the system –approximately US$8.7 million–
    concentrated on upgrading its intake to expand capacity so the water supply can reliably meet
    the population’s current and future water demand and simultaneously protect the Lagoa Bonfim



40
     These activities were carried out directly by CAERN with counterpart funds.

     – one of the systems water resources. It will also include the automation of the pipeline
     operation and a macro measurement system to enhance control of the distribution of the water
     volume. In addition, it will expand service to seven municipalities and connect them to the
     distribution system to provide a reliable water supply to a population of about 10,000 not
     currently connected to the water transmission network. This latter activity will be non-Bank
     financed; it will be financed through a CEF-financed CAERN program, and approximately
     US$9.1 million will serve as part of project counterpart.

28. Subcomponent 3.3 - Water Supply Systems for Small Rural Communities: the project would
    finance approximately US$8.2 million for works, equipment and training for the rehabilitation
    of approximately 60 small desalinization units as well as the construction of 35 new ones and
    the improvement of at least 60 new small water supply systems, to reliably supply drinking
    water to disperse rural population without adequate water supply in some 30 municipalities.

29. Subcomponent 3.4 - Pilot Interventions for the Rehabilitation and Modernization of Small
    Farmer Irrigation Schemes: the project would finance works, equipment and technical
    assistance to rehabilitate two irrigation schemes in the Seridó and promote, with beneficiary
    co-financing, the adoption of modern irrigation technology and sustainable production systems
    by beneficiaries of the pilot intervention, who are largely poor small farmers. Additionally, the
    project will promote the adoption of an improved water resources management system in these
    areas, with strong participation of beneficiaries in the decision-making process and in the
    management of the irrigation main network, managed so far by DNOCS. This subcomponent
    will also support the participatory design, implementation and operation of the proposed pilot
    irrigation rehabilitation projects. Implementation of this component will begin during the first
    year with the implementation of the pilot in the Irrigation Scheme of Cruzeta. A second pilot
    irrigation rehabilitation project will be identified and implemented in subsequent years.
    Lessons learned from implementation of these pilot projects are expected to be used for the
    design of irrigation sector rehabilitation and modernization program to be implemented during
    the second phase project.

  Due to several delays from the contractor on the completion of the environmental assessments and
engineering designs, the actual works could not be financed during Project implementation. One attempt to
contract the works of six dams was made but the bidding process failed to receive any proposal.

    Expedito pipeline
    Revision: 1st restructuring: replaced “three large water distribution pipelines” with
    “Monsenhor Expedito water supply pipelines”. Baseline included.
    2nd restructuring: indicator changed from reduction in water losses to control of water losses
    and measurement as the reduced availability of Loan resources limited the implementation of
    other important activities aiming at water loss reductions. The systems diagnosis made in the
    initial years of implementation prioritized the activities needed for achieving reduction in
    water losses either from either large state pipeline systems or Monsenhor Expedito pipeline.
    The Project supported part of the activities in complement to the actions being implemented
    by CAERN. Combined, the activities supported contributed to the reduction of water losses
    from 46% in 2008 to 38% in 2015.

     Revision: 1st restructuring: indicator changed from increase in economic efficiency of Itans
     and Cruzeta to preparation and implementation of Management Plan of Cruzeta.
     Due to the prioritization of activities, the Project focused only on Cruzeta irrigation
     perimeter. The increase in the economic efficiency was considered not measurable within
     the life of the Project, although the estimated IRR of the Cruzeta irrigation pilot is 11
     percent which is considered a good result in this Region of Brazil given the drought and the
     lack of alternative sources of income generation44.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1. The Integrated Water Resources Management Project invested in Rio Grande do Norte through
   four components: (i) Institutional Development and Water Resources Management; (ii) Natural
   Resources Conservation and Protection; (iii) Water Infrastructure; and (iv) Project
   Management.

2. The actual Project cost distribution is considerably different from that foreseen at appraisal.
   During Project implementation, the investments in the improvement of the Monsenhor
   Expedito Water Supply system gained more relevance than originally expected and represent
   65 percent of the total Project costs. Water supply systems for small rural communities are the
   second largest investment representing 11 percent of the Project costs. These two areas of
   investment concentrate 76 percent of the total investment. The remaining investments regard
   institutional development and water resources management (10 percent), rehabilitation and
   maintenance of infrastructure (4 percent) and project management (7 percent).

3. Due to the different nature, scope and scale of the investments under each component of the
   Project, an ex-post cost benefit analysis of the project as a whole is not warranted. As for the
   ex-ante analysis in the PAD, the present analysis is made separately for the different Project
   interventions. In particular, this analysis will focus on the two most significant areas of
   investment, as well as on the investment in a Pilot intervention in the rehabilitation and
   modernization of a small farmer irrigation scheme (3 percent of total costs) due to the strategic
   importance of this pilot intervention for the Northeast of Brazil and to the fact that it was
   analyzed in the PAD.

4. Estimated financial impact indicators for the three cases include Economic Net Present Value
   (E-NPV) at 6 percent discount rate45 and Economic Internal Rate of Return (E-IRR) for a period
   of 20 years. The analysis was undertaken using constant prices, with 2009 as price reference
   year.

     1. Monsenhor Expedito Water Supply Infrastructure Pilot Intervention

5. The PAD expected that the main benefit from this intervention would be to protect the water
   resources of lagoa do Bonfim, while meeting the population demand for water. At appraisal,
   the system was extracting 228l/s from the lake and 176l/s from wells drilled close to the lake,
   resulting in a combined extraction from the lake’s water resources of 404 l/s. The PAD argued
   that the direct and indirect water extraction would be reduced to 230 l/s as to guarantee that
   even under extreme droughts the lake would be preserved. The additional demand would be
   met by expanding the sources of water to wells drilled in areas that would not pose threats of
   large negative environmental impacts. Additionally, the project intervention would improve
   the supply of drinking water both in terms of quantity and quality.




45
   This analysis uses a discount rate lower than the standard 12 percent due to the following reasons: (i) the
Project intervened in one of the poorest regions of the country, where investment opportunities are scarce
and return on investment often low; (ii) the Project is meant to improve the access of basic services to poor,
climate vulnerable and isolated populations; (iii) real return on investment of 6 percent compares favorably
with the current nominal reference interest rate in the country (12.25 percent with inflation at 7.14 percent
according to the Banco Central do Brasil); (iv) most Project investments generated a number of positive
externalities that could not be quantified.


                                                     42
6. The environmental benefits could not be quantified in the PAD, but the intervention could be
   justified by the benefits obtained from the assumed savings by current consumers from
   changing to a cheaper source of water supply and increased consumption of water at a lower
   price by both current and new consumers.

7. However, the major quantifiable benefits from the intervention – which invested mostly on the
   substitution and installation of water meters and on network expansion and repairs – are
   different from those initially expected. Actual identified Project benefits are as follows:
     (i) the direct and indirect intake from Lagoa do Bonfim has been reduced to 212 l/s, the
           remaining 214 l/s that are necessary to supply to the current level of demand are extracted
           from new wells which comply with the Environmental Safeguards Policies of the World
           Bank. As in the PAD, this benefit could not be quantified;
     (ii) financial benefits consist of a growth in CAERN’s net revenue from an increase in the
           volume of supplied water and in the share of active connections with water meters from 60
           to 89 percent, as well as an improvement in energy efficiency;
     (iii) the main economic benefits derive from the improved access to water by new users or users
           who used to receive small and erratic quantities of water.

     1.1 Methodology

8. The methodology used for the PAD was adapted to consider the actual Project benefits. The
   main assumptions in the current analysis are as follows:
     - Costs and revenue in the situation with project are as reported by CAERN.
     - The number of connections added each year in the without project scenario would be the
       same as in the scenario with project, except for the water supply network added through
       project investment in seven municipalities that would not exist without the project.
     - In the without project scenario CAERN would do the necessary repairs to keep the water
       supply network functioning, but would only substitute as many water meters as those that
       were self financed during the project period (10,900 and instead of 11,694); only 60
       percent of the new connections would have water meters installed.
     - In the situation without project, the system losses (1-billed volume/abstracted volume)
       would remain unchanged.
     - From 2015 the new wells will permit an increase in water supply of 12 percent as
       indicated by CAERN.
     - Financial incremental benefits correspond to the change in CAERN’s revenue flow from
       water bills and decrease in energy costs for each supplied cubic meter of water.
     - Estimated economic incremental benefits correspond to the marginal value of the
       additional consumed water volume (see appendix for assumptions on marginal value of
       consumed water).
     - The conversion factors were obtained from the PMSS-financed study46 as in the PAD.

     1.2 Results

9. The investments in the system are justified in terms of financial efficiency as the increase in
   CAERN’s average revenue from R$1.4/m3 to R$2.0/m3 of billed water is estimated to yield
   an IRR of 10 percent and an NPV of over R$ 9 million.

10. The additional volume of water supplied to populations previously suffering from water
    shortages are translated into an estimated E-IRR of 14 percent and E-NPV of R$26.7 million.
    These net incremental benefits are additional to the non-quantified economic benefits described
    above.

    1.3 Sensitivity analysis

11. Two major assumptions were made in the analysis: (i) the average marginal value of the
    additional volume of water supplied due to the project (only for the economic analysis) and (ii)
    the volume of water that would be available for consumption in the without project scenario.

12. Minimum, maximum and expected average marginal values of water and volume of water

    financial and economic indicators. Table 1 summarizes the assumptions (see appendix 1 for
    details on water marginal values).

13. The results of the sensitivity analysis are shown in Figure 1. In the case of the E-IRR the two
    variables were used to calculate a matrix with a range of possible E-IRRs. For example, the
    upper left corner of the matrix depicts the E-IRR when average marginal value of water and
    Volume of water available for consumption without project are both its lowest level.
    Conversely, the lower right corner shows the E-IRR when the variables are both at their
    maximum. The cell in the center is the E-IRR for the scenario with the expected values for both
    variables.

     2. Water Supply systems for small rural communities

14. The investment made on the installation of 33 small water supply systems provided water
    access to 33 small communities which size ranges from 14 to 251 connected households and
    to a total population of 11,580 beneficiaries.

     2.1 Methodology

15. A cost-benefit analysis was performed to obtain the financial and economic results of the
    intervention. The financial analysis assesses whether the revenue from water tariffs is sufficient
    to generate a positive net present value or as a minimum to cover operation costs. The economic
    results express the net benefits from supplying piped water to the beneficiary population.

16. The analysis used the actual investment costs and number of connected households and
    beneficiaries from the project monitoring system. Operating costs and tariffs were obtained
    through field work undertaken in October and November 2014 and may vary in the next years.
    It was assumed a water consumption of 102l/person/day, the estimated average consumption
    in the Monsenhor Expedito system. The water shadow price was assumed to be the same as
    considered for the remaining interventions (see appendix 1).

     2.2 Results

17. Two water supply systems are not operating as they have not been connected to the water
    supply network47. Twenty-three of the remaining 25 supported water supply systems show
    negative financial NPV and 13 negative gross margin (revenue from water tariffs does not
    cover operation costs). However twelve systems had no water tariff implemented until the time
    of this evaluation and thus no revenue. The one case with implemented water tariff and negative
    gross margin owes its results to a low tariff (R$1.3m3) and high labor costs with the system
    operator. This system is partially subsidized by the municipality.

18. The supply systems with negative NPV and positive gross margins are mostly cases where the
    investment costs per beneficiary (R$577) were above the median (R$318) due to a higher
    dispersion of the connections and the tariff generally below the standard of R$1.61m3, i.e. cases
    of lower cost efficiency and apparently inadequate tariff setting. Seventeen water supply
    system’s costs are totally or partially supported by the municipalities or by CAERN.

19. The overall E-IRR for these investments was estimated at 29%, while the E-NPV at R$ 10
    million, assuming that the municipalities will ensure their sustainability. The economic results
    of the 25 systems in operation are all positive with two exceptions48: one case with a disperse
    community and therefore investment costs per beneficiary above $1500; another case with only
    14 connections, thus not producing enough benefits to cover the fixed labor costs with the
    system’s operator. Tables with economic and financial results per system can be found in
    Appendix 2.




47
   In one case, the original water source dried up as a result of the drought and a new water source will be
made available with the construction of the water supply network. The other case refer to a community that
will have its water supply system linked to a main network currently under construction by SEMARH.

   2.3 Sensitivity analysis

20. A Monte Carlo Simulation was conducted attributing variation ranges to the most uncertain
    variables. The variation range considered for each variable is shown in
21. Table 2. The results are presented in Figure 2.

   Table 2 - Variables, variation ranges and expected values used for the Monte Carlo
   Simulation

    Operating costs            Minimum: -62% of expected costs (maximum variation
                               below the median)
                               Expected: Value observed in the field for each system
                               Maximum: 790% of expected costs (maximum variation
                               above the median)

   ranges for each variable (1000 iterations)




22. The results are robust as mean E-IRRs remain within the spectrum of 13 to 60 percent when
    the variables are allowed to change within the established ranges.

    3. Pilot intervention for the rehabilitation and modernization of small farmer
       irrigation perimeter: The water supply system associated to the Cruzeta Dam.

23. The water stored in the Cruzeta Dam serves an irrigation system of 124 hectares, over 6500
    inhabitants of the town of Cruzeta, approximately 52 hectares of irrigated agriculture upstream
    to the dam, and a local ceramic industry. In the period of 1936-1989 (period with available
    data) the levels of precipitation in the watershed were not enough to fill the reservoir in 37
    percent of the years. This means that the water users may be subject to water restrictions in dry
    years and that efficiency gains, i.e. water savings, in such years by one sector will benefit all
    water users.

24. Hence, the Project consisted of both investments in the improvement of water efficiency in the
    Cruzeta irrigation scheme and a proposed integrated water management framework for dry
    years. Table 3 summarizes the Project investment costs in the Cruzeta irrigation system.
    Investments in new plantations are additional to these and were included in the crop budgets.

25. The analysis modeled the following benefits derived from the Project intervention:
    - Increase in irrigated area for the same volume of available water due to the water efficiency
      gains from changing from furrow to drip irrigation.
    - Greater certainty about water availability for irrigation leading to smaller losses of annual
      crops and better planning of the surface to be installed with permanent crops, resulting in
      stable outputs and less damaged orchards during dry years.
    - Decrease in the number of months without piped water supply to the town of Cruzeta.

    3.1 Methodology

26. The model considers shifts in water availability in the dam along the 20 years of analysis
    according to historic weather patterns in the watershed. As such, it models the area under
    production, crops costs and benefits and the available water for domestic consumption for each
    year, according to overall water availability. This allows estimating the crossed impacts
    between sectors and the benefits from improved water management and of water supply
    reliability to the town and the irrigated perimeter of Cruzeta. The main parameters and
    assumptions in the model are described below. They differ from those in the PAD, which did
    not consider improvements in water management across sectors or inter-annual changes in
    water availability.




                                                 47
- The financial model assumes that in the situation with project the maximum water volume to
  be supplied to each sector is established at the beginning of each dry season depending on
  the volume stored in the dam and according to the criteria established during the Project. The
  farmers never sow annual crops that will not be irrigated under the water restrictions for the
  year. In the situation without project, annual crops are sown in the first year of water scarcity
  and suffer losses due to water reallocation to the remaining sectors.

- The project made assumptions with regards to water demand as summarized in the table
  below:

                           partially or completely        supply is capped to 80%,
                           interrupted without warning    63%, 55%, 19% or 0% of full

                           as it is available.            regards to this demand.

- The volume of the reservoir at the beginning of each dry season is modeled for the watershed
  hydrologic characteristics from historical climate data for the period from 1963- 1979 and
  from the estimated demand from all sectors. The three first years in the 20 years’ time series
  were considered as being dry as it has actually happened during implementation. Total water
  availability for each sector is estimated from this model and from Project field data on direct
  intake and shallow wells water availability in the Cruzeta irrigation scheme.

- The area of perennial crops is 80 percent of that which can be guaranteed by alternative
  sources (direct intakes and shallow wells) during dry years and perennial crops keep
  producing during dry years. A decrease in productivity is considered due to a presumable
  decrease in water quality after a dry spell of two years or more.

- The crop mix remains the same with changes in cropped areas of each crop. Changes in the
  cropping pattern were modeled after the results of a workshop with the farmers and field
  observations.




                                             48
       - The crop budgets for annual and perennial crops and the development models of perennial
         crops were constructed based on data from the Banco do Nordeste for the region. Input and
         output quantities and prices were adjusted recurring to field data collected by the Project.
         The situation with project is conservative (5 percent changes) with regards to improvement
         in crop yields and savings in weeding and soil preparation as it is too early to assess actual
         changes.

       - Energy costs were modeled for each year depending on the water actually supplied to each
         plot (Energy costs= f(Evapotranspiration, cropped area, precipitation, water availability for
         irrigation, irrigation efficiency, period of irrigation under each energy tariff).

27. The benefits for the inhabitants of Cruzeta were estimated based on the increase in the volume
    of available water during the months that would be subject to water shortages in the situation
    without the project. According to CAERN’s and Eurostats data, water withdrawal per capita is
    higher in Cruzeta than in most European countries. Given the high consumption and the fact
    that water in Cruzeta is priced with a flat rate which provides no incentive for water savings, it
    was considered that the marginal value of water of the last 80% of consumption in a month
    with full supply is zero. On the other hand, when this saved water is supplied during what
    would be a month without water availability in the situation without project (lower irrigation
    efficiency and inexistent water management), its value49 is considered to be R$5.53/m3.

       3.2 Results

28. The Component’s results need to be interpreted considering a context in which the investment
    was made in one of Brazil’s poorest and most vulnerable to weather variations regions.
    Alternatives to investment in income generating activities are scarce and peoples’ livelihoods,
    including those of the farmers of the irrigation scheme, are extremely vulnerable to weather
    conditions. Hence, the expected IRR is of 11 percent can arguably considered a good result in
    this region of Brazil. The results show that the average gross margin per hectare has also
    increased considerably for the perennial crops as the project, in addition to contributing to an
    increment in yields and a reduction in operational costs, enabled their irrigation with water
    from alternative sources in dry years. This has resulted in lower decreases in yields in dry years,
    uninterrupted plantation development and reduced plant mortality. A summary of the results is
    presented in Table 4.

    water volume available in the dam is not enough to satisfy the demand of the town of Cruzeta.
    Figure 3 shows the decrease in the number of occurrences of water shortages in each month of
    the year for a time series with the climate characteristics of the period from 1963-1989. The
    three first years were considered as being of drought.

    project variables. The variation range considered for each variable is shown in

     Figure 5 – Changes in average IRR across the established variation ranges of each

32. The results are robust as the Monte Carlo Simulation produces mean IRRs virtually always
    above 6% and the probability of attaining an IRR of 12 is considerably high (over 50 percent
    according to the simulation). The mean IRR obtained from the simulation is 12.3 percent, 1.6
    percentage points above the value estimated through the deterministic model.

33. Mean IRRs remain within the spectrum of 11 to 13 percent when the variables are allowed to
    change within the established ranges, with exception of the domestic water shadow price. For
    the lower considered values for domestic water shadow price, the intervention mean IRR could
    drop below 8 percent. However, it is not expected that the economic value of water is within
    the lower spectrum of the considered range (see appendix 1).




                                                               51
     Appendix 1 – Establishment of possible range for the shadow price of water

1. The results of the analysis made for the three interventions largely depend on a common
   variable, the marginal value of the volume of water that is provided to the beneficiaries due to
   the Project’s investment.

2. The analysis assumes that the CAERN’s tariffs are not a good approximation of the social value
   of water. CAERN’s prices increase with consumption level (which is sensible in terms of
   incentivizing a rational and fair water consumption), but the marginal value of water should
   actually decrease once basic needs are satisfied. It is also difficult to estimate the willingness
   to pay for the incremental volume of water received in a context in which many beneficiaries
   are poor and the answers could reflect instead their capacity to pay. Access to water would then
   have different values for different social strata. As such, this analysis considered the following
   benchmarks for the shadow price of water:

     Minimum value = R$2.81/m3 – CAERN’s residential supply price per m3 of water for the
     first consumed 10m3

     Expected value = R$5.53/m3 – Median of the average water prices charged in 27 European
     countries converted to Brazilian Reais in GDP Purchasing Price Parity50.

     Maximum value = R$13.58/m3 – Maximum average water price charged in 27 European
     countries converted to Brazilian Reais in GDP Purchasing Price Parity.

     The values are below the price of water supplied by tanker trunk considered for the Economic
     and financial analysis of a Project in the State of Bahia in 2014 – the prices ranged between
     R$13 and 21 per cubic meter.

3. The analysis chose the water prices in Europe as they enabled considering a benchmark
   composed by over 20 countries where access to and capacity to pay for piped water is virtually
   universal. It is thus assumed that the prices charged in these countries are still below the
   marginal willingness to pay for piped water, but provide a better approximation to the average
   value of water than CAERN’s tariffs.

4. The benchmarks should not be interpreted as the actual social value of water, but as a means to
   assess whether the Project incremental costs possibly remain below the benefits generated by
   the increase in the volume of supplied water.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results: Small Water Supply Systems implemented by the
Project – March 2014

    1. Introduction

1. This was a subproject under the Project Component 3, Subcomponent 3.3. It had as its objective
   the expansion of water supply to small rural communities, including those previously supported
   by Bank Loan 4120-BR.

    1.1 Objective of Report

2. Present the results obtained through the application of on-site questionnaires for 33 small water
   supply systems implemented by the Program.

    1.2 Overview of Methodology

3. The methodology employed consisted of field observations of the O&M situation for the 33
   systems through a pre-defined questionnaire, considering both (i) systems receiving treated
   water through CAERN-operated adductors [5 systems, 11 rural communities] and (ii) systems
   supplied by their own water source and treatment systems [13 systems, 22 rural communities].

    2. Communities Data

    2.1 Socioeconomic Data

    2.1.1 HDI-M and Income (by Municipality, 2010)

4. Of the rural communities, 18 have Municipal Human Development Index ratings of 0.591-
   0.641, 10 have ratings of 0.642-0.684, and 5 have ratings of 0.685-0.710 (a rating closer to 1
   indicates higher human development). Of the 33 communities, 21 (67.7%) are located in Rio
   Grande do Norte’s Serido region. The original proposal under PSP was to include only
   communities located in this region. The state’s overall Municipal HDI in 2010 was 0.684, while
   the average for the communities benefited was 0.641, varying from 0.591 to 0.710 (in Caico,
   the only municipality with an index above the State average). 28 communities (84.8%)
   presented indexes below the State average.

5. Average income in 2010 for the 33 communities was R$276.10, 48.3% higher than the State’s
   rural average of R$186.17. 1 community fell in the R$ 186.17-195.52 range, 15 in the range
   of R$195.53-2276.10, and 17 in the range of $267.11-531.62. All of the benefited communities
   presented average income higher than the State’s rural average.

    2.1.2 Size of Communities

6. The average number of families per community is 112, varying between 12 and 276. 87.9%
   had up to 200 families, 15 communities with 1-100 families, 14 with 101-200 families, and
   only 4 with more than 200.

    2.1.3 Equipment and Infrastructure

7. The communities possessed equipment/infrastructure as follows:

    2.2 Data on Water Supply Associations

    2.2.1 Time in Existence and Participation in Associations

8. 81.8% of the local associations were less than 20 years old, with the majority created through
   the incentive of the Seridó Development Agency-ADESE and the Support Service to
   Alternative Community Projects-SEAPAC in 1993. 54.5% of the community associations met
   monthly.

    2.2.2 Strengthening of Associations through the Project

9. The majority of the associations (69.7%) considered that the PSP intervention allowed more
   discussions with the community and the local governments to improve local conditions, even
   given that the planned capacity-building activities under SEMARH’s responsibility did not take
   place. 10 communities considered that PSP, in general, did not stimulate associative
   strengthening.

    2.2.3 Productive and Social Projects Developed

10. All of the participating communities developed productive and/or social projects (in the case
    of the latter, continuance of existing municipal or state projects). 100% have cisterns installed,
    although there is no management plan for these. 4 productive projects (12.2% of the total) were
    developed.

    3. Project Impact on Rural Water Supply Systems in Small Rural Communities

    3.1 Previous Situation

    3.1.1 Previous Water Projects

11. 63.6% (21) of the communities already had a water supply systems, with irregular distribution
    networks. The communities without a system (12 communities) had water access through dug
    wells, tube wells, and distribution by “carro pipa”.

    3.2 Characteristics of the Project

    3.2.1 Sources of Water Production and General Typology

12. Through the Project, 11 communities (33.3%) are now attended with treated water distributed
    by CAERN, benefiting 1,145 families. CAERN also carried out capacity-building in these
    communities before signing a self-management contract which will allow for water supply to
    the communities at a cost of R$1.61/m3. In 5 communities, although there is no interest by the
    utility in operating the systems, water is being distributed free of charge by decision of
    CAERN’s general directorate.

13. In the 22 (66.7%) communities with their own water source and treatment systems, there is
    generally not filtration of water or adequate chemical treatment. Generally, treatment is carried
    out with chlorine distributed by local health centers. 12 communities (36.4%) are attended by
    tube wells with brackish water and low flow, a situation that worsens during the dry season. 11
    communities are supplied by dug wells located on riverbanks and temporary creeks. Some
    communities use more than one of these sources, depending on availability.

    3.2.2 Units Installed

14. In both system types, the Project installed systems for water capture, pipelines, distribution
    lines, branch lines, reservoirs, and water meters, depending on each community. For the
    CAERN-supported systems, elevated reservoirs, a distribution network, and water meters were
    installed in all cases. In 2 cases, the installed systems are not being used (in one case due to a
    pipeline still to be constructed by the municipality, and in the other due to the community not
    accepting distribution of desalinated water due to the energy costs).

    3.3 Operational Conditions

    3.3.1 Works

15. In general terms, all works were completed – 100% are able to distribute water to residences.
    In 2 cases (as of December 2013), the water sources have dried up – the former is being supplied
    by “carro-pipa” and for the latter, the construction of a pipeline to bring water from the
    Piranhas/Acu River is under construction. None of the technical designs were modified from
    the originals drafted by the State and contracted under the Program.

    3.3.2 Functioning of Completed Systems




                                                 59
16. Of the 33 communities, 72.8% are supplied with water on a daily basis, with variation in the
    number of hours with available water. In the case of communities in 2 municipalities (27.2%),
    water is supplied normally in intervals of 4 days.

17. 57.6% of the communities do not pay for the use of water, with O&M costs under the
    responsibility of the municipality (there is little interest locally in changing this system). For
    the systems supplied by CAERN alone, 40% do not pay water charges—those that the CAERN
    directorate has not expressed interest in operating. However, the utility continues to pay the
    costs for distribution of water to these residences without charge or control.

18. In the communities without water charges, the community members meet and together arrange
    the necessary resources for the execution of services as needed.

       1. Outcomes of the Lessons Learned Workshop of the Potiguar Semi-arid Program51

1. As indicated above in the Methodology section, the panels of each stage of the project were
   initially filled out by the working groups, a process which was followed by discussions and
   adjustments in the plenary and a synthesis of the themes worked on (with particular focus on
   lessons learned).

2. The complete records obtained were presented at each stage and panel, concluding with a
   summary of lessons learned in each of the stages of the workshop.

       1.1 Structuring, Implementation and Monitoring of the Potiguar Semi-arid Program

3. The elements generated by the teams were then presented in detail for each component of the
   panels under discussion, which were subdivided according to the respective stages: preparation
   of the PSP; implementation of the PSP; and monitoring of the PSP. The panels of each working
   group were presented with their respective contributions, which was followed by a general
   synthesis of the lessons learned.

 Preparation Phase of the Potiguar Semi-arid Program
 Major         • Preparation was done by a hired consultant, with little ownership by the
 challenges       state;
 faced         • Preparation by consultancy company, with lack of ownership by the state;
               • High staff turnover. Representatives from entities involved changed at
                  virtually every meeting;
               • Lack of a participatory process to define scopes with co-implementers;
               • Lacked integration between co-implementers and SEMARH for the correct
                  implementation of project activities;
               • High diversity of project actions led to high diversity of types of expertise
                  required and high level of coordination required between co-implementers,
                  increasing implementation complexity;
               • Scattering and lack of focus;
               • Diversity of goals without corresponding diversity of experts;
               • Delay of two and a half years between technical preparation and approval
                  of the project (change of priorities and estimated costs);
               • Underestimated budget;
               • Turnover of technical staff and co-implementers.
 Lessons       • A participatory process and staff continuity are necessary for acceptance of
 learned          the program design and ownership of the program's proposal by
                  implementers and participating entities;
               • Co-implementers must be engaged with and integrated into the Secretariat
                  from the very outset, avoiding concentration and isolation of preparation

                the program, to ensure understanding and support for the program and internal
                uptake of management tools;

 Monitoring Phase of the Potiguar Semi-arid Program
 Major challenges • Inadequate management of some contracts;
 faced               • Team turnover along the process;
                     • Reduced program and co-implementer technical staff to monitor

                     • Delay in implementing the monitoring system.

 Lessons learned       • It is essential to have a stable and qualified technical staff in the
                         Secretariat and the co-implementer agencies;
                       • Implement the monitoring system at the beginning of
                         implementation.


   1.1.4   Stage 1 - Summary of Lessons Learned from the Structuring, Implementation
           and Monitoring of the Potiguar Semi-arid Program

4. Regarding the PSP's structuring phase, the following were summarized as the main lessons
   learned:

   •   Structuring the PMU and training its team from the very beginning (and during the whole
       period) is critical to ensure the success of the program at its different phases;
   •   Team changes must be reduced to a minimum throughout the program in order to optimize
       learning and performance. Ever-changing teams lead to constant loss of program
       management and execution capacity, slowing down overall progress and producing errors;
   •   Avoid isolation of the PMU and achieve greater integration with the co-implementers’
       structures from the outset and at all stages of the project;
   •   Involving different players - engineers and co-implementers - in the preparation phase is
       critical to ensure identification with - and ownership of - the program design by those
       involved;
   •   The diversity of goals and the wide range of associated actions, as in the case of the PSP,
       reduces focus and pulverizes efforts, requiring diverse professional teams and a great deal
       of coordination, resulting in loss of efficiency and effectiveness;
   •   Underestimated budgets, associated with multiple objectives and actions, led to constant
       reviews in planning and actions of little effectiveness in face of the issues and matters the
       program set out to address;
   •   Foreign exchange variations and environmental risks need to be considered from the
       project design phase;
   •   The delay between program preparation and approval, associated with intermediate
       changes in governments, reduces understanding of and commitment to the initial program
       design.



                                                63
5. As for the PSP's implementation phase (planning, procurement, physical implementation,
   financial execution), the following lessons learned were summarized:

   •   The implementation of the program depends, in large part, on a properly structured PMU,
       as well as on its capacity for project planning / management and mastery of IBRD rules;
   •   Planning is essential to ensure good physical implementation and financial execution;
   •   Effective integration of PMU staff with co-implementer teams, without frequent changes
       of these actors, is essential to ensure performance gains in program implementation;
   •   Sharing of and commitment to the program's design among Secretariat officials and co-
       implementer agencies is crucial to ensuring support for the implementation phase. The
       eligibility criteria and requirements for contract signing should emphasize this aspect,
       among others;
   •   Guarantees of compliance with financial consideration commitments by the state, when
       required (as is the case with the PSP), are a key condition for smooth implementation.
       Without this, downtime and interruptions multiply, affecting implementation and
       generating distrust on program teams, their beneficiaries and contractors;
   •   Political interference is a hurdle in ensuring regularity in the program's implementation,
       especially when it leads to the hiring of people without the required profile for teams and
       changes what had been planned for the implementation of actions;
   •   Environmental risks need to be anticipated in the planning phase and properly measured.
       Identification and treatment of such risks only in later stages hinders, burdens and delays
       implementation, and in some cases makes it unfeasible;
   •   The implementation of a program funded by an international organization implies the need
       to adopt and practice the rules of the financier, which require changes and adjustments to
       local management rules, standards and processes. Such changes will often lead to conflict
       with legal regulations to which governments are subject, leading to reticence and delays. It
       is not easy to learn and accept to work under international standards;
   •   It is important to seek to expand the use of resources and capacities in management and
       co-implementer structures in order to avoid the isolation of the PMU and conflicts between
       the project and the local public administration;
   •   Knowledge of the market and of the government's credibility as a contracting party are
       essential to attracting qualified companies to procurement processes. In the case of the PSP,
       the "bad payer" reputation of the Government severely hampered the implementation
       process, leading to several deserted bids;
   •   Counting on a monitoring and evaluation system from the very beginning is crucial to
       supporting decision-making processes and program implementation;
   •   In the case of the PSP, the discovery by the co-implementers that they would not be able
       to rely on program resources led to disinterest on their part regarding its implementation;
   •   Partnerships with local universities and institutions are fundamental in attracting local
       knowledge and mobilizing and developing local expertise during program development.

6. Finally, with regard to the monitoring phase, the following lessons learned from the PSP were
   highlighted:




                                               64
    •      Monitoring should be understood as a permanent task, undertaken from the very beginning
           of the project. As such, it is crucial to be able to rely on a system from the very outset to
           support monitoring and evaluation activities. Without it, each World Bank mission
           represents a work burden and a challenge to get last-minute data;
    •      Program management should be by permanent Government staff in the PMU, minimizing
           the use of temporary staff whenever possible.

    1.2.1         Outcomes of the Components of the Potiguar Semi-arid Program

9. Below are the outcomes discussed in the Workshop regarding each of the components of the
   PSP.

    1.2.1.1 Component 1 - Water Resources Management

                       PSP - Outcomes and Lessons Learned from the Development of
                              Component 1 - Water Resources Management
 Significant                • Definition of the SEMARH + IGARN organizational structure,
 Outcomes                      eliminating overlaps and clearly defining the role of each of the bodies
                               in managing water resources in the State;
                            • Adoption of laws defining the duties of - and unquestionably legalizing
                               - IGARN;


                                                                               65
                  •   First steps of the institutional strengthening of IGARN;
                  •   Expanded knowledge of the Barreiras aquifer and organization of
                      existing (and previously scattered) data sets;
                  •   Zoning of areas of higher water potential, which is already being
                      undertaken by CAERN for water production aiming at supplying the
                      NMR;
                  •   Aquifer vulnerability and water quality zoning, making it possible to
                      identify areas for aquifer protection;
                  •   Discussion about the importance of water management in the Barreiras
                      aquifer and dissemination of the information to society;
                  •   Acquisition of network monitoring and automation equipment, allowing
                      for reduced levels of incorrect data, more frequent information updates
                      and, possibility (for the surface network), real-time data access;
                  •   Creation and installation of the Apodi Mossoró Watershed Committee,
                      which is now in full operation;
                  •   Support for the operation of other state Committees.

Frustrations      •   Regulatory Decrees were not approved, preventing the continued
                      implementation of the new organizational structure proposed;
                  •   Lack of political will / prioritization of implementation;
                  •   Risk of study results not being leveraged for the protection of the
                      Barreiras aquifer in the area;
                  •   Not all surface monitoring stations were completed;
                  •   Quantitative monitoring network was not integrated with the qualitative
                      one;
                  •   Lack of a system for storage and processing of the data received;
                  •   The Potengi Committees were not created or installed, and the Pitimbu
                      Committee was not expanded;
                  •   Water reuse and multiple use;
                  •   State Water Resources Plan and Basin Plan.

Lessons           •   Political coordination is required in order for the "water" theme to be
Learned               recognized as a priority for the development of the state;
                  •   Valuing planning studies with local consultants/businesses;
                  •   Importance of well-designed TORs to better understand the demand for
                      contractors
                  •   Finding that previous visits to the site facilitate subsequent installations
                      of equipment;
                  •   Importance and permanence of the mobilization process - constant
                      presence of advocates in the basin.


  1.2.1.2 Component 2 - Protection and Conservation of Natural Resources

             PSP - Outcomes and Lessons Learned from the Development of
            Component 2 - Protection and Conservation of Natural Resources
Significant     Cobra Micro-Watershed and its Environmental Works:
Outcomes            • 57 underground dams and 40 wells, 58 silt fences, 12,000 m of rows,
                        22 demonstration technical units;


                                             66
                   •  Beneficiaries received structures to accumulate water and reduce
                      sediment carrying (soil retention);
                  • Capacity Building with Beneficiaries;
                  • Appropriation of technologies and of their importance to
                      beneficiaries;
                  • Strengthening of the partnership between SEMARH and IDEMA and
                      building other partnerships (SUZA, UFRN);
                  • Generation of research and publications on the effectiveness of hydro-
                      environmental works;
                  • Underground dams provided for production of food (subsistence
                      farming) and fodder in some areas, in addition to allowing the
                      resurgence of riparian vegetation, even with little rain.
               Protected Area Zoning:
                  • Work developed with the SEMARH and IDEMA team (technical-
                      institutional growth);
                  • Holding of participatory diagnosis and zoning workshops;
                  • Socialization of technical knowledge acquired and stronger
                      engagement by popular participation, with suggestions being
                      absorbed by the public;
                  • Enhanced knowledge of environmental management tools and
                      processes.
               Environmental Licensing:
                  • Licensing and Regularization of all works of the PSP;
                  • Understanding of the licensing process by the PMU and introduction
                      of a licensing routine for PSP actions;
                  • Reforestation project of the Arituba Lake (compensation for the
                      Monsenhor Expedito water pipeline).

Frustrations   Cobra Micro-Watershed and its Environmental Works:
                  • Lack of rain;
                  • Implementation period interrupted due to abandonment by
                      contractors, leading to the need to rebuild trust in the community;
                  • Delay in resuming the process.
               Protected Area Zoning:
                  • Lack of clear definition of the Management Council's attributions;
                  • Insufficient preparation of Counselors to pursue a constructive role;
                  • Unrealistic deadlines in the schedule offered by the contracted
                      consulting services.
               Environmental Licensing:
                  • Insufficient involvement of DNOCS in the regularization process for
                      the Cruzeta perimeter;
                  • Relationship with IDEMA in the licensing process;
                  • Lack of maturity in the state’s environmental system: unclear
                      assignments, difficult relationships.
               General Frustration with Component 2:
                  • Term of the PSP: inability to complete actions due to late involvement
                      by the new staff and the time required to correct previous actions and
                      incorporate design procedures.




                                          67
Lessons        Cobra Micro-Watershed and its Environmental Works:
Learned           • Continuity of actions is essential to ensure involvement and trust
                      relationship with the communities;
                  • More accurate control (supervision) of measurements and technical
                      inspection of the execution of the works could have prevented
                      interruptions;
                  • Changes in conducting the process in the second stage ensured
                      smooth progress of the actions;
                  • Responsiveness and ownership of communities with respect to the
                      project's proposal was essential to maintaining institutional ties,
                      despite the temporary shutdown of the actions;
                  • Hiring a 'social communicator' was a major factor in solidifying the
                      relationship with and mobilization of the local community;
                  • Without the help of the project, owners would have been unable to
                      adapt their properties to environmental legislation;
                  • Underground dams: importance of hydrogeological studies to meet
                      water quantity and quality standards.
               Protected Area Zoning:
                  • Fundamental need for legal and technical preparation by the
                      government before conducting consultations, in order to ensure
                      discussions are well-grounded;
                  • Need for a periodic training program of management councils;
                  • Formality of the events (use of a moderating panel; unrealistic coffee-
                      breaks in terms of culture, etc.) inhibited participation by some
                      segments of society: formats that are more accessible and appropriate
                      to the culture of the different audiences must be adopted to ensure
                      effective participation;
                  • Provision of coffee break by a company prevented engagement /
                      partnership with the municipality: the municipalities' involvement
                      happens mainly through allocation of spaces and supplying of food;
                  • Failure by consultancy services to consider local instruments (Master
                      Plan) greatly undermined the consultancy process, generating
                      conflict;
                  • Develop the ability to negotiate;
               Environmental Licensing:
                  • Internalization of the environmental licensing and regularization
                      process stopped at the PSP; it did not spread through to the SEMARH;
                  • Importance of maintaining copies of all licensing procedures filed
                      with the SEMARH;
                  • Importance of understanding the bodies that make up the system:
                      SEMARH, IGARN and IDEMA.

                 committee                                executed none.

Frustrations   • Partnership with DNOCS did not        Monsenhor Expedito Water Pipeline

   1.2.2   Lessons Learned from the Development of the Components of the Potiguar Semi-
           arid Program

10. Regarding the results of Component 1 - Water Resources Management - the lessons learned
    may be summarized as follows:

   •   Need for political coordination to ensure the importance and priority of the water theme
       for the development of Rio Grande do Norte is appropriately recognized, and consequently
       to ensure that the appropriate management of water resources is seen as essential;
   •   Need to prioritize the conduction of planning studies with local consultants and businesses,
       in order to expand the technical capacity of the state in the field of water management;
   •   Importance of investing in the preparation of well-designed TORs to increase
       understanding by service bidders of the needs and demands, and of conducting technical
       visits in advance to the areas in which work will be developed;
   •   Importance of institutional capacity building for watershed management and sustainable
       mobilization processes.

11. Regarding the results obtained in Component 2 - Protection and Conservation of Natural
    Resources, the following lessons learned have been noteworthy:

   •   The continuity of actions is essential to maintaining engagements and relationships of trust
       with the communities, and the responsiveness and ownership showed by the communities
       regarding the project's proposal is an essential step to upholding links even in the case of
       interruptions (as has happened in the past);
   •   Interruptions in the works - which tarnished project's credibility with the communities -
       could have been reduced or avoided through more accurate control and supervision of
       measurements and technical inspections;
   •   The services of a social communicator are of great importance to the mobilization of
       communities and to solidify relationships with them;
   •   Preparation regarding technical and legal issues is essential for the Government to conduct
       consultations with society and discuss issues emerging from the meetings;
   •   It is essential to conduct regular and systematic capacity building programs for council and
       committee members to ensure the proper functioning of these entities;
   •   When organizing and conducting events with communities and their representatives, one
       must avoid structuring them based on formalities or habits that cause strangeness and
       inhibit the expression of the participants. It is necessary to respect the culture and meeting
       practices used in those people's realities, including with regard to snacks and meals,
       avoiding strange foods (as can often occur in the so-called "coffee breaks”);




                                                71
   •   The valuation of the knowledge and tools that have been developed by the communities
       and municipalities around their own realities must be explicitly considered and used by the
       consultants and contractors hired to carry out the work;
   •   Engineers and technicians engaged in the program must learn the ability to negotiate, and
       use it at every meeting and discussion opportunity with stakeholders and those affected by
       the program;
   •   Water and environmental management should always be seen and understood as composed
       of various institutional actors, and the role of each of them and their relationships must be
       understood;

12. With regard to the results of Component 3 - Water Infrastructure, Water Management and
    Increased Water Availability, the summarized lessons learned are outlined below for the two
    groups in which it was discussed, namely: the Cruzeta Pilot and Water Supply Expansion. For
    the latter, the Works of the Monsenhor Expedito Water Pipeline, the Deployment and
    Management of simplified SAAs, Loss Reduction and Dam Recovery were discussed.

Cruzeta Pilot:

   •   In interventions such as the Cruzeta Pilot, it is necessary to ensure a participatory vision of
       all stakeholders when defining the actions to be conducted, and they must integrate
       infrastructure, technical assistance and institutional arrangement strengthening actions;
   •   In the design and development of the project, those responsible for it should seek to
       incorporate proposals that are adequate to local conditions, compatible with existing
       capabilities and which have the means to ensure their operation and sustainability;
   •   It is necessary to pay close attention to ensuring sustainable management of the
       implemented systems, and the necessary support for it after the program ends. In the case
       of the Cruzeta pilot, frustrations with the lack of explicit written commitment by the
       DNOCS and uncertainty about the involvement of TA institutions of the state cause
       concern for the continuity and the future of what has been achieved.

Water Supply Expansion

   •   The results obtained by the program with the Monsenhor Expedito Water Pipeline Works
       and the hydrogeological studies on the potential and risks in the management of the aquifer
       (associated with the expropriation of areas for preservation) need to be made sustainable
       through proper management of the whole, including specific management for the pipeline
       capable of ensuring the proper use of water and the prevention of deviations;
   •   The implementation and management of simplified SAAs is a major challenge, and relies
       on the definition of a state policy for rural sanitation and sustainable management
       mechanisms. For the state sanitation companies, that management has been a burden and a
       shift from their own functions of operating what are already structurally deficient services,
       one which requires community arrangements outside of their scope of work;
   •   Loss reduction depends primarily on the implementation of a loss management system
       associated with measuring and monitoring actions. In the case of the PSP, the actions taken




                                                72
       have aimed only at creating the conditions for measurement and control, but have not
       advanced in the field of structuring loss management itself, which should be done;
   •   The recovery of dams is the main frustration of the PSP in terms of the goals and targets
       originally planned and effectively carried out. The project has been unable to even draft all
       the dam recovery projects forecast for the program; of those for which a project was
       prepared, none was actually carried out. Political decisions and the hiring of unskilled
       companies form the basis of these frustrations;

13. Finally, as to the results of Component 4 - Program Management, the following summarized
    lessons learned have been recorded:

   •   One of the noteworthy and key outcomes of Component 4 is the evolution of the staff’s
       capacity, especially in the fields of procurement and finance;
   •   The availability of a monitoring and evaluation system since the beginning of the project
       is an essential prerequisite for quality management and the timely monitoring of
       contractors. The delay in obtaining this tool in the PSP constitutes one of the problems for
       program management;
   •   We reinforce here, as a recurring note with other items evaluated, the importance of social
       communication actions and their role in reducing social impacts during the interventions
       and works stage. These actions must be emphasized from the beginning and throughout the
       program period;
   •   Assembling a trained, low-turnover management team was seen as a lesson for future
       programs. In the case of the PSP, turnover in the management team (as well as teams in
       the co-implementer teams) due to frequent political changes constitutes an ongoing
       challenge, requiring frequent training and loss of knowledge throughout the program.
       Additionally, an important point emphasized was the importance of strengthening and
       engaging Government-owned structures and partner organizations in driving the program,
       which leads to greater ownership by the state of the program's very design and related
       instruments.

   1.3 Management of the Potiguar Semi-arid Program

14. Regarding the management of the Potiguar Semi-arid Program, participants analyzed the
    relationship experience of the program's management structure with the State Government,
    Society, Suppliers and the Financier (IBRD). The workshop outcomes are transcribed below,
    in the following order of presentation, ending with a summary of lessons learned.

   1.3.2   Summary of Lessons Learned from the Management of the Potiguar Semi-arid
           Program

15. The lessons learned from the Management of the Potiguar Semi-arid Program can be
    summarized as follows:

   •   Changes of government and teams directly affect the commitment and rate of
       implementation of a program, requiring it to be 're-agreed' with the new players at each of
       the changes;
   •   Dissemination of the program is critical to its understanding and internalization in
       government structures and society, thus representing an important tool for its sustainability;
   •   In programs such as the PSP, involving various Government Secretariats and entities as
       co-implementers, these entities must feel contemplated by the program's resources and
       exercise some power over them, as a way to encourage participation;
   •   Programs such as the PSP, which involves several co-implementers, have higher levels of
       complexity in the management and coordination activities between the entities. That
       requires greater investment in building a shared vision by all of the project design and




                                                75
    shared learning throughout its implementation, which, in turn, requires time and motivation
    of the teams involved;
•   The experience of the PSP is that society responds positively when called upon to
    participate effectively, and that this participation should be encouraged as one of the
    management mechanisms of the program;
•   Social participation and engagement by various entities naturally brings out conflicts in the
    design and development of programs such as the PSP, which affects various stakeholders.
    That requires that its managers and co-implementers develop skills to cope and deal with
    conflicts as a normal part of their activities;
•   Environmental education for driving projects of the nature of the PSP is a requirement to
    be met by the state and municipalities involved;
•   Project management has to constantly deal with suppliers, defending and enforcing
    contracts, but must also be attentive to the interests of suppliers, building, to the extent
    possible, a partnership. The credibility of the Government as a contracting party is a
    prerequisite to attracting good companies to bids. In the case of the PSP, the state's
    reputation as a bad payer hindered the procurement process, keeping good companies out
    of tenders or even causing contractors to relegate their PSP contracts to a less important
    position;
•   Monitoring and control are important tools for ensuring good management of contracts.
    Project and priority changes are a challenge for the management of supplier contracts and
    relationships;
•   Mastery by the PMU of the financier's rules is a challenge and a requirement for a
    productive relationship with it. For the Potiguar Semi-arid Program, it is understood that
    the financier’s availability and ability to easily meet, guide and solve the problems
    encountered were instrumental throughout the process. Teams must receive training in
    project technologies, in following the financier's rules, and on developing a positive
    attitude in the Government's teams to meet the requirements. Meeting deadlines and having
    good projects are both fundamental aspects of this;
•   Long gaps between program design and implementation and extended implementation
    times, whatever the factors that caused them may be, reduce a program's efficiency and
    effectiveness, creating reticence in participants.
