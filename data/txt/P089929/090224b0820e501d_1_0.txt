                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The higher level objective of the project is to promote economic, social, and environmentally sustainable development through the implementation of an integrated water
                         resources management system. Mostly by focusing on institutional strengthening and rehabilitation of key bulk water infrastructure, the proposed project will seek to
                         consolidate this system, which the state has often overlooked in the past in favor of larger infrastructure investments. The specific project development objective is to
                         implement an integrated water resources management system that will support more environmentally sustainable use of water resources while also increasing access of
                         poor families to reliable potable water and decreasing operational and maintenance costs of water allocation and distribution systems.
