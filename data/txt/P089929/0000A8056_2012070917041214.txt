                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective is to promote economic, social and environmentally sustainable development through the implementation of an integrated water
                         resources management system.

                         Additionally, the project will support the preparation of a water sector strategy and long-term investment program that will pursue an adequate supply and an efficient
                         use of water resources, key elements to support the State's overall sustainable development and reduce the vulnerability of the rural poor to cyclical droughts.
                         Regarding essential infrastructure, the project will focus mostly on water supply in poor rural areas, including rehabilitation and expansion of both drinking water supply
                         networks and pilot interventions to improve irrigation schemes.

                          The results of the project's interventions will be measured by the achievements made in the contributions made to three key areas: (i) the development of an improved
                         legal framework and strengthened institutional setup for efficient WRM by the state; (ii) the development and satisfactory implementation of planning, information and
                         operation instruments for WRM; and (iii) the promotion of an optimized water resources supply through the rational use of natural resources and the expansion and
                         improvement of the coverage of the water supply systems.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Implementation is progressing well but slower than expected. The new Administration and Project team are committed to the Project and have made all efforts to improve the pace.
                         Most of the bidding processes have been carried out and contracts are under execution. The State Government has requested an extension of closing date until March 31, 2014 to
                         allow for the completion of all project activities. The Bank is analyzing the request.
