7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The higher level objective of the project is to promote economic, social, and environmentally sustainable
development through the implementation of an integrated water resources management system. Mostly by
focusing on institutional strengthening and rehabilitation of key bulk water infrastructure, the proposed
project will seek to consolidate this system, which the state has often overlooked in the past in favor of
larger infrastructure investments. The specific project development objective is to implement an integrated
water resources management system that will support more environmentally sustainable use of water
resources while also increasing access of poor families to reliable potable water and decreasing operational
and maintenance costs of water allocation and distribution systems.
