This\n            restructuring paper makes the following changes to the\n            project: a) extension of 14 months for closing date, from\n            November 30, 2012 to March 31, 2014; b) reallocation of loan\n            proceeds among its categories; and c) adjustment of project\n            targets and indicators to ensure that these are measurable\n            within the timeframe for completion and in line with the\n            priority activities being supported by the project. The main\n            reasons for these changes are: 1) delays in start up and\n            implementation of activities; 2) changes in the state\n            government administration resulting in major changes in the\n            implementing agency teams; 3) exchange rate losses; 4)\n            increase in project costs due to the gap between preparation\n            and implementation and to the heating of the Brazilian\n            market caused by investment programs launched by the Federal\n            government; and 5) need for better alignment of activities\n            prioritized within the scope of the project to the amount of\n            available funding."}, "docdt": "2012-08-03T00:00:00Z"}
