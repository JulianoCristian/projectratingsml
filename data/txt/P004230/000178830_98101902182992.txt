INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR UICONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECaO1NDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
MALAYSIA FOR A SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to Malaysia for the equivalent of US$15.5 million to finance part of the cost
of a second education project. The loan would have a term of 25 years, in-
cluding 5 years of grace, with interest at 1¼ percent per annum.
PART I - INTRODUCTION
2.        The Bank has made seventeen loans to Malaysia for projects in
education, agriculture, forestry, industrial finance, power, water supply,
telecommunications, ports and railways. The execution of these projects has
been satisfactory, although the Closing Date for Loan 434-MA (Muda Irrigation)
had to be postponed by 18 months to June 30, 1973 to allow for additional works
which are expected to improve the effectiveness of the project. In addition,
the Closing Dates of Loan 500-MA (Kemubu Irrigation) and Loan 561-MA (Kuala
Lumpur Water Supply) may have to be postponed because of unavoidable delays
in construction.
3.        As of February 29, 1972 the loans to Malaysia held by the Bank, of
which one was not yet effective, amounted to US$279.3 million. In addition,
the Bank made a loan in 1965 to the Public Utilities Board of Singapore (Loan
405-MA) guaranteed by Malaysia to finance the Johore River water project; the
amount due to the Bank is US$5.7 million. A summary of Bank loans and IFO
investments is at Annex I.
4.        The loan now proposed would be the second for education. The first
education loan (599-MA) made in May 1969 is assisting mainly in the expansion
of technical, vocational and agricultural education and, in East Malaysia, of
teacher training. In connection with this loan the Government undertook to
prepare a long-term educational development plan which would aim at gradually
aligning the education system with the social and economic needs of the country,
in particular at reducing the imbalance between general and technical and
vocational education and between urban and rural areas.
5.        The educational development plan has now been formulated and it has
been possible to prepare a second and broader project for Bank financing. It
would help alleviate the present situation in which unemployment coexists with
serious shortages of many types of skilled manpower. These shortages are
slowing down the preparation and execution of public development programs and
private employers also have difficulty in recruiting certain categories of
professional technicians and skilled workers.
6.        In addition to further lending for education, the lending program
will emphasize assistance to agriculture for opening-up and settlement of new
land, as well as for strengthening the efforts towards diversification and
increasing productivity in agriculture. The loans which I hope to bring before
you in the next year or so are expected to be for projects in land settlement,



-2-
agricultural credit, water supply, road transport and family planning.   In the
context of its lending program the Bank will continue to assist project prepara-
tion to the extent possible. It will initiate pre-investment studies, advise
on their preparation and in certain cases finance them and act as Executing
Agency for various UNDP-financed studies. The UNDP Malaysia Country Program
1972-76 has relied extensively on preparatory work carried out by the Bank re-
garding individual sectors and the program as approved will contribute directly
to the preparation of a number of projects expected to be financed by the Bank.
The Bank will continue to provide through its lending program assistance in
institution building and in improving management and advisory services on
technical and organizational matters as well as on financial planning. Since
Malaysia's public investment program consists to a large extent of small projects
with a small direct import content, which makes them unattractive for financing
by other external aid sources, the Bank will continue to finance a portion of
local costs in appropriate cases.
PART II - THE ECONaMY
7.        An economic mission visited Malaysia in November 1971.  Its report
(EAP-31a) will be circulated shortly. The principal conclusions are discussed
bel-tw. Country data are at Annex II.
8.        During the last decade, in spite of adverse political events - such
as the separation of Singapore from the Federation of Malaysia in 1965, the
confrontation with Indonesia until 1966, the communal riots in 1969 and the
subsequent suspension of parliamentary government - and a deterioration of
the terms of trade, mainly as a result of the steady fall in the price of
rubber, the Malaysian economy continued on a strong and steady course with
real GNP growing at about 6.2 percent per annum. Dramatic productivity improve-
ment in natural rubber production through massive replanting in the early sixtieas
was followed by increased exports of timber and palm oil, bringing down the share
of rubber in total export earnings from 48 percent in 1961 to 33 percent in 1971
while maintaining an annual 5.2 percent growth rate of export earnings throughout
the decade. The price of tin, the second largest export earner, has remained
strong.
9.        Malaysia's economic growth has been oriented towards exports of
primary commodities. Manufacturing had a relatively late start, because the
payments position was strong and it was therefore possible to have an open
economy. Moderate encouragement of import substitution in a context of liberal
investment policies caused industry to grow at about 11 percent a year during
tha decade, nearly twice the rate of GNP, but it still reached-only 13 percent
of West Malaysia's GDP by 1970.
10.       Political calm has continued for nearly three years since the dis-
turbances of May 1969.  However, the debate continues on the disparity between
the economic position of Malays and non-Malays. The tacit compact of the past,
which has prevailed since independence from Great Britain in 1957, and which
gave political dominance to the Malays and economic dominance to the Chinese,
is increasingly being questioned as the basis of national unity. The search
for economic and social policies designed to reduce the economic differences



-3-
between the two races is the principal theme of the Second Malaysia Plan for
1971-75 (5MP). The SMP centers on the New Economic Policy which aims at
eradicating poverty and restructuring society, so that the present identifi-
cation of race with particular forms of economic activity will eventually be
eliminated, although it does not set out the specific measures to be taken.
The SMP does not place redistribution of wealth and income above economic
growth; instead it sees continued rapid economic expansion as being necessary
to support these changes.
11.       During the Second Malaysia Plan period ONP is expected to grow at
6.8 percent a year. This is reasonable and in line with the annual growth
rates actually achieved during the recent past. The leading growth sectors are
agriculture and manufacturing, with expected annual growth rates of 8.3 percent
and 12.5 percent respectively, while the service sectors are expected to expand
at a slower rate than GDP. The export growth target of 4.6 percent a year
assumes a 6 percent annual increase in rubber earnings, 5 percent in timber, a
decline in tin, and rapid growth in other exports. The Plan proposes a consider-
able increase in public' development expenditures and assumes continued strong
private sector expansion.
12.       The effects which the New Economic Policy will have on the private
sector cannot be forecast until specific proposals have been worked out. In
the past the Goverrment's policies have encouraged free enterprise, and after
the reestablishment of confidence following the 1969 disturbances the Government
took new measures to stimulate private investment. Private investment in 1970
increased spectacularly from 8.3 percent to 11.7 percent of GNP, and some
further expansion took place in 1971.
13.       The public investment target during the Plan period implies a 5.7
percent annual increase from the 1970 level, which is less than the projected
growth of GNP but would constitute a considerable improvement on the performance
of the First Malaysia Plan (1966-70). To offset the continued decline of
private investment in agricultural estates, the largest portion, 26 percent, of
public development expenditure in the SMP is earmarked for agricultural and
rural development, followed by 22 percent for transport and communications and
15 percent for social services including education; the allocation for education
alone amounts to 7.4 percent.
14.       If the public investment targets are to be achieved the Government
will have to make a determined effort to expand its capacity to prepare and
implement investment projects; manpower shortages in government departments
and agencies were a major reason why the targets of the First Plan were not
fully achieved. The steps taken thus far by the Government have not signifi-
cantly improved the situation and have been partially offset by the creation
of new agencies. However, the staffing situation should improve gradually
given the new stress within the educational system on technical training.
15.       The SMP aims at an annual increase in employment of 3.2 percent, equal
to the increase of the labor force, compared to an annual rate of 2.6 percent
achieved during 1966-70. Unemployment which in 1970 was officially estimated
to be 7.3 percent of the labor force would thus remain virtually unchanged. It



- 4 -
is concentrated in West Malaysia, and is particularly high among new entrants
to the labor force: as much as 20 percent of the population in the 15-24'age
group is unemployed and a growing number of them have completed general secondary
education. However, many of the unemployed come from rural areas and their
education makes it difficult for them to be absorbed in the fast growing urban
industries. Alongside the labor surplus Malaysia thus faces a serious shortage
of skills partly caused by the inappropriateness of the educational system.
16.       Money is not now a serious obstacle to maintaining a satisfactory rate
of real growth.  However, public savings are low and this could become a problem
if the Government succeeded in improving its capacity to carry out projects.
The Government has, therefore, introduced additional taxes, the most important
of which is the 5 percent general sales tax introduced in the 1972 budget.
17.       Export earnings will grow at about 4.2 percent a year in the 1971-75
period,compared with a 5.6 percent rate achieved in the preceding 5 years.   This
is mainly because the secular decline in the price of rubber is likely to con-
tinue, after a temporary recovery from present low levels, and also because the
past rapid expansion of timber exports is likely to slow downt  Continued growth
is expected in the export of palm oil and perhaps petroleum. If the Government
succeeds in raising the investment level significantlyJ, imports will probably
grow at about 5.4 percent a year, causing the present surplus on goods and
services account to turn into a small deficit in the mid-seventies.
18.       After taking transfers and unrecorded items into account and assuming
the inflow of private foreign capital will grow in line with private investment,
external capital requirements during the SMP period-i,n the form of gross official
borrowing are projected at about US$100 million a year compared with little over
half that amount in 1966-70. These requirements would be covered by both pro-
ject and market loans. In the past, the Bank has provided 40 percent of total
project loans to Malaysia. Bilateral aid, mainly from the United Kingdom and
other Commonwealth countries, accounted for another 45 percent and ADB for the
remaining 15 percent. Over the next five years, Japan is expected to be the
largest bilateral donor; a second credit line of Yen 36 billiopn, more than
double the amount of the first credit line, was signed in early 1972.. ADB is
expected to continue expanding its lending. Bank lending is planned to increase
in line with total borrowing.
19.,      The projected levels of capital inflow are well within Malaysia's
debt-carrying capacity. Debt service obligations are at present less than
3 percent of exports and will probably remain below 5 percent during the seven-
ties. External reserves in mid-1971 were almost US$1 billion equivalent, more
than twice the total official debt outstanding and equivalent to 8 months'
imports.
PART III - THE SECTOR AND THE PROJECT
20.       Malaysia's education system is well developed in m,any re pects, with
about 90 percent of the relevant age group enrolled in primary schools, 50 per-
cent in lower secondary and 20 percent in upper secondary. School bu,ildings
and teacher qualifications are generally good in ,urban areas and academic



- 5 -
standards are relatively high in secondary education, but little use is being
made of modern instructional methods. Educational planning, although improving,
requires further strengthening and cooperation among the agencies involved in
education is not sufficiently effective. As a consequence, the education and
training system has only recently begun to reflect the social and economic
changes Malaysia is undergoing, and to adjust to manpower requirements. Educa-
tional opportunities in rural areas are more limited than in towns. General
education was stressed at the expense of vocational and technical education.
Curriculum development is conducted in an uncoordinated fashion and in-service
courses for teachers are too short to be effective. The use of Malay, Chinese,
English and Tamil, as instructional media in primary and secondary education,
with English now being replaced at the primary level by Bahasa Malaysia, the
developing national language, is a complicating factor.
21.       Total expenditures for education were estimated at about 5.4 percent
of GNP in 1970, which is high compared with other countries in Asia. Financial
responsibility rests primarily with the Federal Government which finances capital
and recurrent expenditure of all "assisted schools", both public and private.l/
22.       The major goals of Malaysia's long-term educational strategy set forth
in the SMP are to promote national unity, to meet manpower requirements and to
provide general education with an adequate content of science and technology.
The Government intends to consolidate the education system, at present divided
into various segments by language and race, and to equalize the educational
opportunities in urban and rural areas. It will gradually introduce Bahasa
Malaysia as the main language of instruction, achieve universal lower secondary
education and establish special secondary schools for rural areas. Vocational,
technical and university training will be expanded and improved. For training
technicians and skilled workers, this requires more school places and improved
cooperation by all the agencies involved, effective liaison with employers and
a more practical orientation of courses. For the education and training of
high level manpower, expansion and better distribution of responsibilities among
the universities and improved control of fellowships for study abroad is required.
Specifically, higher education institutions should train larger numbers for
managerial and technical occupations as well as for science teaching in secondary
schools. Curricula and teaching methods will be modernized and made more relevant
to the Malaysian environment. New teaching methods will be introduced, including
improved visual presentation of science, mathematics and other subjects.
23.       At the primary and lower secondary level where enrollments have already
reached 90 percent and 50 percent respectively, overall enrollment growth is
planned at 3.5 percent per year compared with 5 percent per year in 1965-70;
this would lead to universal basic education of 9 years by about 1990. In
general secondaiy education at the upper level the rapid growth of almost 18
percent per year in 1965-70 will be reduced to about 7 percent per year. The
1/ More than 90 percent of enrollment in West Malaysia and Sabah is in
"assisted schools"; in Sarawak 50 percent of the secondary students are
in "non-assisted schools".



-6-
output of general secondary graduates would still exceed foreseeable needs
throughout the seventies but a lower rate of expansion is not considered
feasible in view of the great increase in lower secondary enrollment from
1965 onwards. In secondary technical and vocational education, and in
technical training, a 100 percent increase in enrollment is planned over the
period of the SMW. The higher education system which consisted of one univer-
sity is being expanded to include 4 universities and is being rationalized so
that, as far as possible, each university will specialize in a different field
and the size of any one university will not exceed 8,000 students; total'univer-
sity enrollment is expected to increase from 8,500 in 1970 to 20,000 in 1980
and it is planned that about 60 percent of the 1975 entrants will'be in science,
engineering and medicine.
24.       The_proLect to be financed by the proposed loan was prepared with the
assistance of UNESCO. It would assist in implementing parts of this strategy
by providing facilitie's for the development of new curricula, instructional
techniques and in-service training'of teachers, for expanding and improving
technical and vocational education and for training science teachers and other
high level manpower. Other important projects are expected to be financed by
bilateral aid (technical teacher training), the Asian Development Bank (agri-
cultural education) and by the Government itself (special secondary schools for
rural areas).
25.       Specifically, the project would provide construction, furniture and
equipment, for (i) an educational development center (EDC), (ii) educational
television (ETV), (iii) one technical and seven vocational schools, and (iv)
the Science Schools of the University of'Penang.
26.'      The EDC would make it possible to draw up curricula in a coordinated
manner with the participation of practicing teacher! to insure the relevance
of the work to classroom conditions. It would include boarding accommodation
for teachers coming from distant schools. In addition it would include a
textbook evaluation unit, a textbook library and an audio-visual aid develop-
ment unit. The latter will insure a close link between curriculum development
and educational television. An outline for a five-year plan of operation,
setting out EDC's tasks and including a staff development plan and details of
technical assistance-requirements and sources of supply has been prepared by
the Ministry of Education. The detailed plan will be completed within six
months of the' signing of the proposed loan.
27.     . Educational television will begin in January 1973. 'When fully
operational It will cover about'500,000 primary and secondary students and
require a total of some 10,000 receivers. Television would be especially
helpful on the new sciences and mathematics courses, where teaching can be
greatly assisted by visual presentation. The project would provide for the
construction and equipment of a new studio for program production, for the
supply of 5,500 TV receivers and for the supply of 25 simple video-tape re-
corders. The receivers would be mainly employed by rural schools and would
include a replacement pool for sets undergoing maintenance. The video-tape
recorders would permit the pre-service and in-service training of teachers in
the use of ETV. Program producers have been trained with British technical



-7-
assistance; Radio/TV Malaysia will provide the tochnical personnel. Teacher
training and specialists services for program production and evaluation are
being provided by British and multilateral agencies. Preparation of a plan
for maintenance and repair of receivers is a condition of disbursement for
this item under the proposed loan.
28.       The construction and equipment of one thi         and four
schools in West Malaysia and three vocational sch-3171ii East Malaysia (see
m     ached) is a continuation of the project financed by the first Bank
loan. A sufficient supply of technical teachers will be assured by the
Technical Teacher'Training College recently established with CanadiLn assist-
ance. The vocational schools would give courses in industrial trades and
commerce. In each schoolthe curriculum would be adapted to regional needs
and, in addition to the regular programs, short in-service training courses
for workers already in employment would be organized in collaboration with
local industry. In order to relate type and quality of training closely to
local needs the Government will include representatives of employers in each
school board.
29.       The University of Penang, established in 1969, is now gradually
moving to its permanent campus on a former military base and the project
would provide for the construction and equipment of the Schools of Natural
Sciences, of Applied Sciences and Pharmaceutical Science; and of communal
academic buildings. In addition it would provide for audio-visual equipment
for the Center for Educational Services and for an architectural master plan.
30.       The University has already a core of highly competent academic and
administrative staff and has adopted a well conceived staff development plan,
including a scheme for overseas training of new staff members toward PhD
degrees and a program for research visits and in-service training abroad for
the existing staff. The implementation of this plan started in 1970 and is
proceeding satisfactorily. By 1980, about 90 percent of the academic staff
will be Malaysian; the University intends to keep a small international
component in its teaching staff.
)a    . The total cost of the-proposed proJect is e           at about US$28.4
million equivalent.   Contingencies are estimated at            percent of the
basic project cost for the   Av  year project implementation period.   The break-
down of costs is given in the Loan and Project Summary at Annex III.    The
proposed loan of US$15..4million equivalent would be made to the Government          \
and would cover about __ percent of total project cost. The Government will
make available the balance of funds required for the project. T-he 4in4istry

of most of the civil works contracts. It is expected that nearly all instruc-
tional equipment would be procured abroad and nearly all furniture locally. On
this basis it is estimated that US$0.9 million equivalent of local expenditure
would be financed under the proposed loan, but this amount would be more or less
according to the actual outcome of the bidding. A margin of preference of 15
percent or the applicable customs duties whichever is the lower would be applied
in the comparison of foreign and local bids for the supply of furniture and
equipment. Disbursements would be made against the foreign exchange costs of
imported furniture and equipment, against ex-factory costs of contracts for
furniture and equipment awarded to local manufacturers and against 3( percent
of the total cost of civil works and professional services representing the
estimated foreign exchange component.
