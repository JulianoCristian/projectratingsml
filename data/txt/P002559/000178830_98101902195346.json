of\n            irrigated agriculture on a net area of about 300,000 feddans\n            on the east bank of the Rahad River using water pumped from\n            the Blue Nile. The project, which would take about five\n            years to develop, would involve construction of all\n            irrigation supply, distribution and drainage works;\n            installation of agricultural processing equipment and\n            storage facilities; and settlement of some 13,700 tenant\n            families (70,000 people) with all the necessary\n            infrastructure. The project would be executed and operated\n            by MOI and a new semi-autonomous government agency, the\n            Rahad Corporation, which would provide agricultural services\n            and advice to its tenants."}, "docdt": "1973-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
