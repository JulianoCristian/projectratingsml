        Project's main goal is to accelerate Bangladesh's\n            integration into the world economy by expanding net export\n            production value through product and market diversification,\n            including increased value added. Important subsidiary goals\n            are to improve the business environment for industry and\n            commerce generally. The projected is divided into three\n            broad components. The first, product and market development\n            support, emphasizes entrepreneur capacity building and\n            promoting markets in export support services. It consists of\n            administration and advisory services as well as funding to\n            operate a matching grant facility and smaller subprojects to\n            strengthen selected public, private, and public/private\n            support service providers not amenable to matching grants.\n            The second component, trade management capacity building,\n            focuses on key aspects of the policy and institutional\n            environment for export and other business. It includes more\n            rapid clearance for exports and their imported inputs,\n            better bonded warehousing and duty drawback schemes, a\n            management information system, the piloting of modern\n            auditing and risk management methods, taxpayer education,\n            and staff training. Another subproject strengthens capacity\n            in the tariff commission for trade data and protection\n            policy analysis and in the commerce ministry for\n            international and regional trade cooperation. A coordination\n            and development unit will undertake analysis of export\n            constraints and institutional change needs."}, "docdt": "1999-05-10T00:00:00Z"}
