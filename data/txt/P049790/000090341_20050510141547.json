The lessons\n            learned indicate that the project implementation period\n            should be defined in accordance with the complexities of\n            project activities. The project demonstrated that conducting\n            main procurement activities in advance facilitates project\n            implementation. It is better to design output-based\n            contracts rather than large lump-sum contracts for the whole\n            project period. Whenever more than one agency is involved in\n            project implementation, it is critical to define\n            coordination arrangements up-front. Despite the positive\n            performance of the PCU, project design should have\n            envisioned the creation of a small Policy Unit within the\n            MOC that could continue conducting analytical studies\n            following project completion. Continuous changes in\n            leadership are bound to generate disruptions in project\n            implementation. A project director with staff dedicated\n            full-time to the project is essential for the successful\n            implementation of difficult components. A close working\n            relationship between consultants and NBR staff from the\n            beginning of project implementation can lead to a successful\n            transfer of know-how, even in complex institutional\n            environments. In future National Board Revenue (NBR)\n            reforms, it will be critical to bring as many stakeholders\n            as possible into the modernization process, especially the\n            private sector, and place greater emphasis on disseminating\n            results to stakeholders."}, "docdt": "2005-04-15T00:00:00Z"}
