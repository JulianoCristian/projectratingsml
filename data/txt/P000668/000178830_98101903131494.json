The major\n            part of the program consists of improvements in local and\n            long distance telephone networks (US$9 million for each). An\n            additional US$1 million is included for telegraph, telex and\n            high frequency radio. The rest of the program is comprised\n            of land and buildings, miscellaneous items, and provision\n            for contingencies. The economic rate of return, as a measure\n            of the economic progress made possible by better\n            communication, is difficult to measure. However it may be\n            argued that the prices which users are willing to pay for\n            telecommunications services give at least a minimum\n            indication of this value. The incremental rate of return on\n            the proposed investment, valuing services at current\n            tariffs, is 15 percent."}, "docdt": "1969-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
