TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS CN A PROPOSED
BANK LOAN TO THE IMPERIAL BOARD CF
TELEC CMIUNICATI OS
1.          I submit the following report and recommendation on a
proposed loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to Us $4.5
million to the Inperial Board of Telecommunications of Ethiopia (IBTE).
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.          The proposed Loan would be the fourth Bank loan for
telecommunication development in Ethiopia. Previous loans were for
US $1.5 million in 1951 (42/ET), US $2.9 million in 1962 (31J./ET) and
US $4.8 million in 1965 (Uh1/ET). Progress under these loans has been
satisfactory. In July 1968, the Bank agreed to a postponement of the
closing date for the third loan (4hl/ET) from Thcember 31, 1968 to
June 30, 1962.  The delays in disbursement were in large part due to
IBTE's deliberately delaying the placing of orders for copper wires
and cables due to the high copper prices in 1967.  The it2     in this
project have now been largely completed and the loan amount is expected
to be fully drawn down by the closing date.
3.          In July 1968, the Imperial Board of Telecommunications of
Ethiopia (IBTE) applied for a Bank Loan to finance a portion of the
foreign exchange requirement of its 1968-72 program for the expansion
of telecommunication facilities. IBTE also asked Sweden for assistance.
With a view to arranging joint financing, representatives of the Kingdom
of Sweden joined in the appraisal mission, which took place in September
1968.  In January 1969, IBTE modified its request for financing, extending
the period for implementation of its previously proposed program through
1973.
4.          Formal negotiations for the proposed Bank loan and Swedish
credit took place in Washington in Narch 1969. The Empire of Ethiopia
(as guarantor of the proposed Bank loan and recirient of the proposed
Swedish credit) was represented by Ato Yavand-lqossen Iangasha, Vice Governor
of the National Bank of Ethiopia.  IBTE was represented by Ato Betru
Admassie, General Manager. The Kingdom of Sweden was represented by
Nlessrs. Bengt Sandberg and Gosta Westring of the Swedish International
Development Authority, and H1r. John Wingstrand of the Swedish Embassy
in Washington.

6.          Aside from the 1968 loan and credit for high-ways, there are
no outstanding problems of delays in disbursements. For the highway project
a second tender was required due to an insufficient numlber of responses
to the first tender. Bids on the second tender were opened in March and
are currently being evaluated.
7.       In my report of April 23, I submitted a proposed loan of US $23.1
million for the Finchaa Hydroelectric Project. It is expected that a
proposed agricultural loan of about US $4 million will be ready for
presentation within a few months. Other operations under consideration
are in the fields of education, water and sewerage, and agriculture.
PART II - DESCRIPTICN CF THE PROPC6ED LCANl
8.         Borrower:                The Imperial hoard of TelecoiTmunications
of Ethiopia (IBTE)
Guarantor:               Empire of Ethiopia
Amount:                  Various currencies equivalent to US
$4.5 million.  (Proposed joint finanning
by the Kingdom of Sweden with a credit
of 23.5 million Swedish Kronor, equivalent
at present parity rates to US $4.5
million).
Purpose:                 To finance part of the foreign exchange
cost of IBTE's 1968-73 Investment
Program for moder-nization and expansion
of telecommunications services in
Ethiopia



Amortization:               20 years including a 4h year
period of grace, through semi-
annual installments beginning
December 15, 1973 and ending
June 15, 1989.
Interest Rate:              6½%
Commitment charge:          3/4 of 1% per annum.
9.           The proposed Swedish credit would be made to the Empire of
Ethiopia at an interest rate of 2%. The credit would be amortized over
25 years including a 10-year period of grace, through semi-annual
installments of 21-;g from December 15, 1979 through June 15, 1989 and of
5% from December 15, 1989 through June 15, 1994. There would be no
commitment charge. The Ehpire of Ethiopia would be required to relend
the proceeds to IBTE on the same terms and conditions.
PART III - THE PROJECT
10.          A report on the proposed project entitled "Appraisal of the
Fourth Telecommunications Project of the Imperial Board of Telecommanications
of Ethiopia" (PU-7a, dated March 25, 1969) is attached.
11.         IBTE, which was established as an autonomous agency in 1952
as a condition of the first telecommunications loan, has maintained a good
record of progress and achievement. Although the management is generally
satisfactory, IBTE has agreed to make some modifications in its intern4l
organization and procedures so as to improve financial coordination and
control. Technical and managerial staff seconded from the Swedish Telephone
and Telegraph Administration have successfully trained Ethiopian counter-
parts who are now running IBTE on their own with the help of only two
expatriates at the management level. The governing body of IBTE is a
Board of Directors appointed by the &nperor, with the Minister of Posts,
Telegraph and Telephone as ex officio chairman. A General Manager, appointed
by the Board, is responsible for management and operations.
12.          The demand for IBTE's services has increased rapidly, and
IBTE has been unable to meet demands. The actual increase in the number
of connected telephones in Ethiopia has averaged 17% per year over the
last six years. The long-distance facilities have not kept up with this
rapid growth and it is not unusual to encounter delays of several hours
in establishing long distance connections. Moreover long-distance service
is subject to frequent interruption and the quality of circuits is in
many cases below minimum standards. The current program provides for a
reasonable growth of local exchange systems and for a significant expansion
and improvement of interurban facilities, thus making for a well-balanced
plan of expansion.



- 5-
13.          The 1968-73 I13B  program amounts to about US $25 million
equivalent, of which the foreign exchange component is estimated at
US $16 million.  The major part of the program consists of improvements
in local and long distance telephone netwJorks (US $9 million for each).
An-radditional US $1 million is included for telegraph, telex and high
frequency radio. The rest of the program is comprised of land and
buildings, miscellaneous items, and provision for contingencies. The
economic rate of return, as a measure of the economic progress made
possible by better communication, is difficult to measure. However it
may be argued that the prices which users are willing to pay for
teleconniunications services give at least a miniizmm indication of this
value. The incremental rate of return on the proposed investment,
valuing services at current tariffs, is 15%.
14.          The proposed financing plan assumes that IBTE will cover
from its o'*m resources about half of the total program cost. Total
external financing would be US $12.9 million, consisting of $9 million
from the proposed Bank loan and Swedish Credit, $2.8 million from
expenditure fron the third Bank loan to IBTE (441/ET) since the beginning
of 1968, and .11.1 million from a supplier's credit. IBTE wiill finance
from internallyc generated funds the total local currency cost of the
program and about 20% of the foreign exchange component represerting
itoms not considered aligible for BWnk finmancing.  All items to be
finThncad under the proposed Bank loan or the proposed Swedish Credit
;tuld be purchased on the basis of international competitive bidding.
For such items tho Bank and Swoden would each finance 50% of tha foreign
exchange cost, except that thc apportionmenrt of financing between
Sweden and the Bank may be altcred by mutual agreement.
15.          IBTE's financial position continues to be favorable.  Total
re-enue showed an annual increase of 17.2% between 1962 and 1967, and
the average rate of return for this period was 12.7% per annum. Based
on conservati-ve forecasts it is estimated that the rate of return will fanl
gradually to 9.2% per annum in 1973. During negotiations IBTE agreed to
adjust rates if necessary to maintain a return of at least 9% per annum.
Debt service coverage and operating ratio are satisfactory. IBTE agreed
that they will not incur long-term debt if their net revenues were less
tharn 1.5 times the debt service requirements,without the Bank's agreement.
IBrE should not experience difficulty in providing its portion of the
funds required for carrying out the project.

PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
16.         The draft Joint Financing Agreement between the Empire of
Ethiopia, the Kingdom of Sweden, the Bak, and IBTE, the draft Loan Agree-
ment between the Bank and IBTE, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the
Empire of Ethiopia and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for
in Article III, Section Viii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text
of a Resolution approving the proposed Loan are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately. In addition a draft Administrative letter
from the Bank and IDA to Sweden is being distributed. This is intended
to be a basic agreement covering all future joi*t financing operaticns
with Sweden.
17.         The format of the agreements is arranged so that all covenants
which are of conmon interest to the Bank and Sweden are contained in the
Joint Financing Agreement.  The Bank Loan Agreement and Guarantee Agreement
and the Swedish Development Credit Agreement contain only the financial
terms and those covenants that are of interest to only one of the lenders,
while incorporating by reference the covenants contained in the Joint
Financing Agreement. In all other respects the contents of the various
agreements conform substantially to the pattern of agreements used for
telecommunications projects, taking account of the existence of the joint
financing by the Bank and Sweden.
18.         Section 4.1l of the draft Joint Financing Agreement prnvidt?s
that prior to declaring or paying dividends IBTE would be required to
insure thD.t there w-uld be sufficient funds rcmaininm" tn assure thr proper
carrying out and operation of the proJect.
PART V - THE ECONOWY
19.         Brief comments on the economy are included in my report of
A-p4.-il 23  on a proposed loan for the Finchaa Hydroelectric Project, to
which is annexed a lIemorandum on Recent Economic Developments in Ethiopia.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
20.         I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.

PART VII - REC O1ITDATI ON
