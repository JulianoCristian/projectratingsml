                         Extension of Closing Date

          ALBANIA -- NATURAL RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
                                     P082375
             Credit No. 4074/ Grant No. TF054926/ Grant No. TF054995

                                   Restructuring Paper

1. The closing date for Albania Natural Resources Development Project [P082375] will
   be extended from November 1, 2010 until June 30, 2011 for Credit No. 4074 and
   from November 1, 2010 until November 1, 2011 for Grant No. TF054995. While the
   Grant No. TF054926 will be extended from November 1, 2010 until May 1, 2011,
   given that there should be at least 6 months between the Closing Date of the Grant
   Agreement and the Donor End Disbursement reflected in the Administration
   Agreement which was amended to extend from November 1, 2010 until November 1,
   2011. In the meantime, the Government of Sweden has agreed to provide additional
   financing to the Project and this will lead to other amendments to the Grant and
   Administration Agreements. The different schedule allows for the use of undisbursed
   and committed credit funds within the current fiscal year and is reflected in the
   borrower's action plan.

2. The Project is rated Satisfactory both on implementation performance and
   achievement of development objectives. Disbursement of Project funds until August
   31, 2010 reached US$ 13,444,193 while another US$ 4,000,000 has already been
   committed, out of the total donor financing of US$ 17,200,000 (IDA, GEF and
   Swedish International Development Agency). Key achievements of the Project
   include: (i) finalization of the transfer of ownership rights in 350 local government
   units; (ii) finalization of the institutional reform proposal for the establishment of a
   forest and pasture extension service; and (iii) improved management of natural
   resources demonstrated by 25% increase in income earned from forest activities in
   communal forest and pasture lands, 50% increase in income earned from forest and
   agriculture activities in micro-catchments and 200,000 tons of erosion reduced.

3. The proposed extension is necessary to (i) help the local governments finalize the
   preparation of forest and pasture management plans and implement the investments to
   improve forest and pasture lands; and (ii) assist the Government to implement the
   institutional forestry reform in central, regional and local level through staff training,
   institutional and legal advice. The Borrower has a written action plan to complete the
   implementation of the Project during the extension.

4. There are no outstanding audit reports.

5. This will be the first extension of the Project.
