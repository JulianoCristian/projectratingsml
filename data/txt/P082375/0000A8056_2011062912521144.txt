                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The project development objective is to establish or maintain sustainable, community-based natural resource management in about 218 communes in upland
                         and mountainous erosion-prone lands. This will lead to enhanced productivity and incomes derived from sustainable resource management, reduced soil
                         degradation, improved water management, conservation of biodiversity, and strengthened public sector management of these resources.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Although the IDA credit will close on June 30, the GEF financed activities will continue until November. The IDA PDO has been fully achieved and all IDA financed activities will have
                         been completed by June 30. The main achievements since the last supervision mission of February 2011 include: (i) Works on communal forest and pasture management (CFPM)
                         have been fully completed in 160 communes and works in the remaining 53 participating communes funded under GEF grant are expected to be completed by end of October 2011;
                         (ii)     Works on micro-catchment management (MCs) have been fully completed in 22 communes and the works in the remaining 8 communes and additional works in 5
                         communes will be completed by end of October 2011; (iii) Under the carbon sequestration (CS) program, 3,870 ha will have been implemented (including afforestation, fencing, and
                         forest improvements) by June 30, 2011. With these works a total of 4,687 ha are under protection (including social fencing consisting in agreements between villagers and communes
                         to protect area within project boundary); (iv)The draft final Project Completion Report was prepared by the borrower and has been discussed in the Workshop on Results of the
                         Project Completion and Lessons Learned, on April 27, 2011 with the participation of all Project stakeholders; (v)         MOEFWA started discussions on the new draft law on forestry
                         and platform of institutional reform in the forestry sector prepared under the leadership of the Director of Forests and Pastures; (vi) M&E team have input all data in the system and
                         made an excellent analysis of the achievement of project development objectives and offered new data taken from several cases studies in various communes to determine annual
                         growth of communal forestry and effectiveness of project financed interventions; and (vii) Training of 120 DFS staff on forest extension in 6 regions and training of Regional
                         Coordinators, DFS staff,CFPUAs, and ten community foresters in carbon monitoring was completed (total of 70 people).
