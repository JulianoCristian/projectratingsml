                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The project development objective is to establish or maintain sustainable, community-based natural resource management in about 218 communes in upland
                         and mount                                ainous erosion-prone lands. This will lead to enhanced productivity and incomes                              derived
                         from sustainable resource management, reduced soil degradation, improved                                   water management, conservation of biodiversity,
                         and strengthened public sector                                 management of these resources.

                         Main achievements since the last supervision mission of April 2010 include: (i) all management plans, meaning 210 Communal Forest and Pasture Management and 30 Micro-
                         catchment Plans have now been prepared and approved; (ii) forestry improvement works are now finalized in 98 communes and works in 142 remaining participating communes are

                         well on their way to being completed in the upcoming implementation season; (iii) micro-catchment works have been fully completed in 8 communes and the remaining works in the
                         remaining 22 communes will be completed by June 2011; (iv) under the carbon sequestration program, works have been completed in 5 communes, while the works in the remaining
                         19 communes will be completed during the spring growing season; (v) Council of Ministers approved Decree No.799 on Waiving of Fees for the Registration of Communal Forest and
                         Pasture Lands into the property registration offices, on 29.9.2010; (vi) Ministry of Finance has agreed that carbon sequestration funds may flow directly to Communes, via the Ministry
                         of Environment, Forestry and Water Administration. The Mission is concerned about the stalled forest service reorganization process still awaiting government's approval and
                         consequently the delay in the establishment of the proposed forest extension service. This delay has resulted in substantial uncommitted funds from the categories of training,
                         consultants and goods, previously planned to support thisreorganization and establishment of Regional Directorates. Because of these delays, the Minister of Finance has requested
                         an extension of the current Closing Date of the Project from November 1, 2010 to November 1, 2011, and Bank and Sida management agreed to accept this request on October 5,
                         2010. The Closing Date of the IDA Credit has been extended until June 30, 2011, while the closing dateof GEF grant is extended until November 1, 2011 and Sida grant unitl May 1,
                         2011. An implementation plan for the use of the uncommitted funds has been agreed with the Government and will be monitored closely by the Bank team. In the meantime Albanian
                         Government has requested the Government of Sweden to provide Additional Financing in order to scale up project's activities and impact, at an amount of about US$ 2 Million.
