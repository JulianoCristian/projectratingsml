                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The project development objective is to establish or maintain sustainable, community-based natural resource management in about 218 communes in upland
                         and mountainous erosion-prone lands. This will lead to enhanced productivity and incomes derived from sustainable resource management, reduced soil
                         degradation, improved water management, conservation of biodiversity, and strengthened public sector management of these resources.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Albanian Minister of Finance has requested the World Bank to process additional funding of USD 2.5 million offered by Sida. The main objective of the Sida funding will be to
                         scale up the current activities financed by the Natural Resources Development Project (NRDP) and help prepare a new operation on environmental services. The joint mission of the
                         Bank, Sida and staff of MOEFWA appraised the activities to be supported under the additional funding. Sida funding under the current Trust Fund (TF) will be rolled into the new TF
                         for the proposed activities.
