F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The project development objective is to establish or maintain sustainable, community-
based natural resource management in about 218 communes in upland and mountainous
erosion-prone lands. This will lead to enhanced productivity and incomes derived from
sustainable resource management, reduced soil degradation, improved water management,
conservation of biodiversity, and strengthened public sector management of these
resources.

1. Project Context, Development and Global Environment Objectives Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Albania is a country of 3.2 million people situated in the Western Balkans. Sixty percent
of the country‘s land area is above 600m elevation with high but variable rainfall (less
than 20 percent occurs in the six-month period from April to September). Sustainable
management of natural resources in such upland areas is key to improving the livelihoods
of the local population, broadening landscape and ecosystems conservation, and ensuring
a more reliable delivery of hydro-electric power, erosion control and flood management
in the lower areas of Albania where the population is rising rapidly.

Forests and pastures account for 56% of land-use in Albania and are largely predominant
in upland areas. The country‘s livestock sector accounts for nearly 50% of the
agricultural GDP and is highly dependent on pastures and forests products. Forests are
also critical for meeting daily needs by people in rural and upland areas, providing nearly
70% of fuel in winters, building material, as well as income from non-timber products
such as medicinal plants. In addition, Albania‘s hilly and mountain landscapes are
endowed with great natural beauty, but improving management of these resources is a
key prerequisite for realizing their tourism value. The socio-economic potential of
pastures and forests is unequivocal in a country where poverty is concentrated heavily in
rural settings, in particular in the country‘s hilly and mountainous areas in the North-East
(70%). Reversing past environmental degradation by carefully managing productivity
improvements of pasture and forest resources in the rural mountainous areas should
contribute to overall poverty reduction and sustainable economic growth.

Sustainable management of Albania‘s natural resources is also important in a global
context of protecting environmental goods. In line with the priorities of the
Mediterranean Action Plan, improved land management in hilly areas is identified as a
key factor in controlling run-off into the Adriatic Sea, enhancing coastal and marine
ecosystems, and improving sea water quality. Sustainable land use and forest
management practices will also help restore unique in-land natural ecosystems. Finally,
reforestation of degraded lands could also increase carbon sequestration and thus
contribute towards global goals of climate change mitigation.

Albania‘s National Strategy for Socio-Economic Development of 2003 was based on two
pillars - improved governance and economic growth and poverty reduction. Governance
has been a particularly salient challenge in forestry where illegal harvesting has reached
rampant proportions. The most effective approach to increasing quality of governance in
the forestry sector has been the transition towards community-based management of
forest and pasture resources through locally established associations. This approach was
first successfully tested in the Bank‘s Albania Forestry Project, which has also revealed
that further institutional strengthening of such bottom-up mechanisms was necessary. The
NSSED also highlighted the severe environmental degradation that the country faced
during the transition years and emphasized that improved natural resource management
was key to enhanced rural development and poverty reduction.



                                            10
Rationale for Bank involvement

The Bank had a solid strategic commitment to support Albania‘s growth, governance,
decentralization and poverty reduction agenda. It had substantial experience in supporting
improvements in decentralized natural resource management both in Albania and other
countries. Previous Bank projects of similar nature produced quick and demonstrable
benefits towards empowering and assisting communities in managing local natural
resources. The project built on and explored synergies with other Bank operations,
including the Albania Forestry Project, the Agricultural Services Project, the Microcredit
Project and the Irrigation/Water Resources Management Project.

Other comparative advantages for Bank involvement were its ability to foster and
influence policy dialogue, ability to achieve strategic consolidation of interested donors,
and its experience in mainstreaming activities which enhance conservation of global
public goods within broader national and regional programs.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The project development objective is to establish or maintain sustainable, community-
based natural resource management in about 218 communes in upland and mountainous
erosion-prone lands. This will lead to enhanced productivity and incomes derived from
sustainable resource management, reduced soil degradation, improved water management,
conservation of biodiversity, and strengthened public sector management of these
resources.

To track the progress toward achieving this development objective, the project used three
key results indicators as summarized below:

   (i)     About 660,000 ha of land (most of the upland erosion-prone commune land in
           Albania) being managed by local communities in accordance with sustainable
           natural resource management plans, supporting the rehabilitation of natural
           resources, habitats and indigenous species;
   (ii)    At least 10% increase in economic benefits at the commune or village level
           derived from sustainable use of natural resources;
   (iii)   Usufruct rights defined, agreed, documented, mapped and demarcated in 218
           communes.

1.3 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The Project global environmental objective is to reverse severe degradation of upland and
mountainous erosion-prone lands, and sediment runoff to the Adriatic Sea, through
rehabilitating and sustainably managing natural resources, including globally significant
biodiversity.

To track the progress toward achieving the GEO, used one key results indicators as
summarized below:



                                            11
     (i)         Increase in carbon sequestration by 160,000 tons of CO2 in the BioCarbon
                 Fund project sites.

1.4 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The PDO was not revised.

The original PDO indicator – Usufruct rights defined, agreed, documented, mapped and
demarcated - was reflected in the system, starting with the ISR Sequence 4 (December 01,
2006) as an intermediate outcome indicator. While the indicator was properly monitored
throughout the life of the project, there was no justification provided for the change.
Furthermore, there is no evidence that the change was properly reflected from a legal
perspective, as the Credit Agreement (Supplemental Letter on Results Framework) was
not amended. For purposes of this ICR this indicator will be considered in the text as an
outcome indicator.

Starting with the ISR Sequence 4 (December 1, 2006), a new PDO indicator was added to
measure the reduction of soil erosion and sediments in watercourses draining to the
Adriatic Sea. Originally the indicator targeted a 20% reduction in the sediment deposited
into the Adriatic Sea, which was estimated at 60 million tons per year. The target value
for the indicator was ill-conceived and proved impossible to measure. Following the mid-
term review, the indicator was revised to be more in tune with the project‘s magnitude
and be measurable and attributable to its activities and outputs. Neither the introduction
of the indicator, nor its revision was properly reflected from a legal perspective, as the
Credit Agreement (Supplemental Letter on Results Framework) was not amended.

Following the mid-term review, and starting with the ISR Sequence 8 (July 31, 2008), a
new intermediate outcome indicator was introduced: Number of communes that have
registered the land that has been transferred - with a target of 218 communes. The
justification for this change is not directly reflected in the aide-memoire and the
respective ISR, but since it coincides with a decision of the Government of Albania to
transfer ownership of communal forests and pasture land to LGUs, it can be concluded
that the Bank team wanted to push the agenda on reinforcing tenure security and
formalization of ownership rights of the LGUs towards finality. The introduction of the
indicator was not properly reflected from a legal perspective, as the Credit Agreement
(Supplemental Letter on Results Framework) was not amended.

1.5 Revised GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The GEO was not revised.

GEO indicator #1 was revised in 2010, following project validation1, from 160,000 tons
of CO2 to 145,768 tons. The validation process was based on an up-dated Project Design

    Validation is the process of independent evaluation of a project activity by a designated operational entity against the requirements
of the CDM for purposes of determining if the project is eligible for registration as a CDM project.
                                                                   12
Document for the ―Assisted Natural Regeneration of Degraded Lands‖ Biocarbon Fund
project which presented more realistic forecasts for sequestration rates in the particular
context of the project, the methodology applied and the works that were carried out or
were still to be carried out. Despite an embedded target in the name of the indicator, the
name was not changed, only the target value. The revision of the target value of the
indicator was not properly reflected from a legal perspective, as the GEF Grant
Agreement was not amended.

1.6 Main Beneficiaries

The primary beneficiaries identified at appraisal were:

(i) Local: the project set out to strengthen local capacity to manage pastures and forests
    in 218 communes in upland and mountainous areas that are highly prone to erosion
    and other manifestations of land degradation; 40,000 rural households would benefit
    from the project‘s activities in the target areas;

(ii) Regional and global commons: reduced sediment run-off into the Adriatic Sea;
     conservation of unique ecosystems; increased carbon sequestration;

(iii) Government of Albania: strengthened institutional and technical capacity in the
   Ministry of Agriculture and Food, the General Directorate for Forests and Pastures;
   District Forestry Services; Regional Agricultural Directorates; and Land
   Administration and Protection Offices.

1.7 Original Components (as approved)

Component A: Improved Management and Governance of Forests and Pastures (US$ 13.19
million)

A.1. Strengthening participatory forest and pasture management in communes that
were supported under the AFP. In the 138 communes already supported under the AFP,
the project was to update existing communal forest and pasture management plans
(prepared under the AFP), including the documentation of different individual and user
group rights over commune forest and pasture lands to better secure users‘ tenure rights.
The project also continued to support implementation of existing forest and pasture
management plans established under the AFP (covering an area of about 450,000 ha).
The essential element of participative planning was performed through outsourcing of the
responsibility to lead and document the planning to local consultants procured through
project. The project also provided support to management plan implementation through
provision of small-scale investments within a fixed budget ceiling of US$ 30,000 per
commune, supported by in-kind community contributions equivalent to at least 20% of
the value of the investments. Implementing the forest and pasture communal
management plans entailed: (i) land stabilization: construction of check dams,




                                            13
maintenance or protection of existing infrastructure, and planting of trees and shrubs in
order to reduce flooding, landslides and sedimentation, (ii) resource rehabilitation:
controlling grazing, and assisting natural regeneration of forests and pastures and (iii)
sustainable resource use: pre-commercial thinning and coppicing, and pasture
development and management.

The BioCarbon Fund has expressed interest in purchasing emission reductions from
Albania, resulting in a proposed ―Assisted Natural Regeneration of Degraded Lands‖
Biocarbon Fund project, which was to be included in the NRDP. Additional project
resources were therefore to be allocated to 30 of the communes that earlier received
support under the AFP - and where areas of severely degraded lands still prevailed - to
make investments needed to sequester carbon through assisted natural regeneration on
about 6,000 ha.

A.2. Introducing participatory forest and pasture management. The project was to
document usufruct rights and prepare participatory communal forest and pasture
management plans in about 80 communes where transfer of usufruct rights had not yet
taken place. The project was to support implementation of the forest and pasture
management plans, covering an area of about 226,000 ha, through provision of small-
scale investments. The investments were to be within a fixed budget ceiling of
US$40,000 per commune, supported by in-kind community contributions equivalent to at
least 20% of their value. Activities were to fall under the same categories as listed under
A.1.

A.3. Strengthening governance for forest and pasture management. The project was to
strengthen governance for forest and pasture management through training of DGFP and
DFS in participatory provision of extension advice; and building the capacity of existing
and new Forest and Pasture User Associations (FPUAs) as well as the growing network
of non-governmental FPUAs, with focus on technical effectiveness, financial and social
sustainability. It was also set to implement priority actions in the National Strategy for
the Development of Forests and Pasture. This entailed: (i) supporting institutional reform
and development within DGFP and DFS through an action plan to implement the strategy,
clarifying roles and responsibilities within DGFP and DFS in the framework of the on-
going institutional and regulatory development, and introducing performance-related
budgeting, (ii) building awareness of the strategy within DGFP and DFS, (iii)
strengthening and improving the legal and regulatory framework for forest and pasture
management, (iv) developing the forests and pastures registers, (v) further developing the
inter-sectoral action plan to address illegal logging, and implementing elements of the
action plan in project areas, and (vi) enhancing forest fire management at local levels.

Component B: Improved Management and Governance of Watershed (US$ 4.00 million)

B.1. Introducing integrated resource management in micro-catchments (MCs). The
project was to pilot integrated resource management in 30 micro-catchments selected in a
participatory and transparent manner (overlapping with the 218 communes targeted by
component A). The MCs were to encompass an approximate area of 190,000 ha, with a
population of about 125,000 people. The project was to prepare 30 MCs plans through a
participatory process and provide small-scale investments and/or technical support for
                                            14
activities identified in the planning process. The range of supported activities involved
investments in rehabilitation of state forests and investments in agricultural developments
selected from a menu of activities. This entailed: (i) rehabilitation of state forests, (ii)
rehabilitation of agricultural land: protection and improvement of poor, degraded bare
agricultural land; fallow reduction; appropriate use of marginal lands and (iii) sustainable
use of agricultural land and livestock production so as to reduce the need to cultivate or
graze on marginal and erosion prone areas: establishment of shelterbelts around fields;
wild tree grafting; demonstration of improved practices; improving rain-fed agriculture
and irrigated agriculture; irrigated fodder crop production; development of vegetable
production. The project set out to support implementation of the MC management plans
up to a budget ceiling of US$ 95,000. Interventions were to be supported by in-kind
community contributions equivalent to at least 20% of their value.

B.2. Strengthening governance for watershed management. The Project set out to train
Regional Agricultural Directorates, Drainage Boards, DFS and commune staff, at district,
regional and national levels in the provision of extension advice in the context of MC
management. The recently established Land Administration and Protection Offices
(LAPs) within the Ministry of Agriculture and Food could have become key to achieving
sustainable watershed management. In areas addressed by the MC planning approach, the
project was to assess the capacity of these offices and enhance linkages between DGFP,
DFS and the LAPs within the context of the micro-catchment planning approach. Last,
the project was to draw on its experience in forest and pasture management, and on its
experience in MC management, in order to inform ongoing legal developments regarding
land administration and tenure.

Component C: Management and Monitoring (US$ 2.21 million)

Implementation was to be undertaken by local communities supported by staff from the
branch offices of the DGFP together with Regional staff from the Ministry of Agriculture
and Food. The project was supposed to support (i) at the central level a small project
management team with overall responsibility for procurement and financial management,
(ii) regional coordinators where component B will be implemented. Services were also to
be contracted to assist with enhanced public awareness of the benefits of sustainable
natural resource management, project monitoring and evaluation, implementation of the
Environmental Management Framework and carbon sequestration verification and
monitoring.

1.8 Revised Components

There were no substantial revisions of the project components.

1.9 Other significant changes

The Development Credit Agreement and the GEF Grant Agreement were amended in
January, 2008 to reflect changes in the country‘s evolving institutional set up and their
impact on institutional and implementation arrangements, to add new capacity building
activities, streamline the procurement process for community participation in the


                                            15
implementation of project activities, as well as reallocate funds towards the preparation
of management plans to reflect higher costs.

A minor restructuring was undertaken during the final year of implementation (October 2,
2010) to extend the closing date of the IDA financing from November 1, 2010 to June 30,
2011, and the GEF financing from November 1, 2010 to November 1, 2011. The
extension was necessary to: (i) help local governments finalize the preparation of forest
and pasture management plans and implement ensuing forest and pasture improvement
investments; and (ii) assist the Government of Albania in implementing the institutional
forestry reform through staff training, institutional and legal advice at central, regional
and local levels.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Project background analysis was generally adequate. Background preparation of the project
was well-contextualized in existing strategies and policies in place in Albania at the time.
It has also benefitted from previous analytical and technical efforts supported under the
AFP, as well as its ICR. In addition, important thematic synergies were also explored
with the Albania Agricultural Services Project, the Albania Microcredit Project and the
Albania Irrigation/Water Resources Management Project. These projects have been
successful in providing quick and demonstrable results by combining participatory
approaches with productivity enhancing measures and incentives. Additionally, Bank
experience in Albania has also showcased positive impacts resulting from empowering
communities to take over the management of available resources. This body of
knowledge and experience has served as the groundwork for the design of Component A.
The carbon sequestration activities of Component A focused on assisted natural
regeneration for which there was a technically robust body of knowledge emerging at the
time of preparation. The design of Component B was largely informed by successful
Bank experience outside Albania and focused on the concept of integrated, micro-
catchment level management of natural resources through the introduction of multi-sector,
community-based approaches to planning, management and use of natural resources.

The design was reflective of lessons learned. The design was reflective of the Bank‘s
extensive project implementation experience in Albania, particularly the experience with
natural resource management and local development projects, and more broadly world-
wide Bank experience in implementing watershed management projects built around
participatory and decentralization processes. Watershed projects have proved successful,
and more importantly sustainable, in combining restoration of land productivity with
demonstrable benefits to communities. Lessons from the AFP highlighted the need to: (i)
clarify land and resource property rights, (ii) build capacity of the FPUAs, (iii) make
special provisions to ensure participation of women, (iv) identify the most appropriate
social unit for natural resources management planning, (v) be inclusive of potentially
disenfranchised categories, (vi) apply transparent criteria for selection of participating
communes, (vii) confirm appropriate levels of support for planning for financial
sustainability, (viii) include all relevant stakeholders in project implementation, and (ix)
use local consultants to assist in participative planning. Broader reviews of Bank natural
                                            16
resource management projects emphasized the need to link rights with responsibilities.
GEF portfolio reviews have highlighted the importance of keeping project design simple,
with clearly identified institutional roles and responsibilities for stakeholders, thus
increasing the odds for greater government ownership and successful implementation
performance.

The rationale for Bank intervention was sound. The World Bank was a logical partner
in the project given its relationship with the GEF and previous project experience in
natural resource management in the country and elsewhere. There were also positive
synergies with other on-going Bank and donor-funded projects. In addition to GEF
resources, IDA financing also served as a vehicle for the mobilization of extensive grant
funding from SIDA.

Project design was generally sound. Project objectives drew on available analysis of the
magnitude of the problem of resource degradation and its social, economic and
environmental effects. Survey and monitoring instruments embedded in the design
provided further support to initial assumptions. With the benefit of hindsight, the
formulation of the PDO seems somewhat ambitious in seeking sustainability of
community-based natural resource management as a key achievement. Sustainability is a
notion that is based on multiple variables, some of which can be hard to control and/or
measure, and is usually gauged in a temporal context that goes beyond a five year project
implementation cycle. The original results framework included indicators that the team
believed defined sustainability in the context of the project interventions, and this ICR
attempts to assess the goal of sustainability in the sensu stricto of the results framework.
However, in a broader sense, assessing the sustainability of community-based natural
resource management in the participating communities is a more daunting task, because
institutional, legal and capacity adjustments need to continue, while the indicators need to
be measured and monitored over a longer-term horizon to provide meaningful
conclusions.

Another design aspect that raises questions relates to the measurement of the GEO. It is
not clear why the initial design provides for sequestration of carbon as a measure of
achieving the project‘s GEO, i.e. reversing severe degradation of upland and
mountainous erosion-prone lands, and sediment runoff to the Adriatic Sea. The GEO and
the indicator are thematically detached, a fact that was subsequently rectified by the
introduction of a more specific indicator that attempted to measure reduction in erosion
that leads to the sedimentation of the Adriatic Sea. Still, this outcome indicator was added
to measure the PDO, not the GEO. More generally, indicators on increased carbon
sequestration should not have been part of the results framework, due to the innate
uncertainty of carbon sequestration assumptions before CDM validation and initial
verification that is characteristic to carbon finance projects in land use, land-use change
and forestry projects.

Otherwise, the final design was reflective of local and global experience/lessons and
presented a solid mix of components and activities (both technically and geographically)
for addressing the challenges at hand. The final design has also been reflective of a solid
analysis of alternatives that were considered but ultimately rejected. The team looked at
direct tree planting by the country‘s state (district) forestry authorities, but opted for
                                            17
community-based planning and management instead. This choice seems to have yielded
positive results and is likely to be a sustainable solution for the country‘s forestry and
pasture resources. Also, an additional component focused on strengthening management
of protected areas was considered but eventually dropped. Analysis indicated that there
was a legitimate need in supporting protected areas, but the level of degradation and
socio-economic context in rural Albania at the time rendered the component unfeasible.
It was deemed that better protection of upland ecosystems was more likely to be achieved
through community-based natural resource management activities where biodiversity
conservation is integrated into land-use management.

The Government commitment was highly variable. At the start, the Government
demonstrated solid commitment to the preparation and implementation of this operation.
Government officials and representatives participated in project preparation. A
contribution of US$2.2 million in counterpart funds was pledged by the Government to
the operations of the project. Further commitment was shown through the creation of the
Project Implementation Oversight Committee and an Evaluation Committee. The PIOC
was chaired by the Minister of MOEFWA and included representatives from the Ministry
of Agriculture, Food and Consumer Protection, Ministry of Interior, National Federation
of Forest and Pasture User Associations and Non-government organizations. Also, a
Project Technical Committee was set up in the MOEFWA to oversee and provide
backstopping on implementation of the technical aspects of the project. Last but not least,
the Government agreed to provide funding from the NRDP for maintaining a fully staffed
and equipped Project Management Unit that was tasked with day-to-day management of
the project, including preparation of work plans, procurement, financial management,
reporting, monitoring and evaluation.

However, commitment to the project during the course of implementation has suffered
from significant unevenness. At one point, the PIOC was inactive for more than two
years, thus failing to provide the much needed strategic guidance to the project. Also, the
PTC proved to be a largely non-functional entity, with the project relying mostly on
informal and ad-hoc meetings and consultations with the members of the PTC. This
variability in commitment can be assessed as a product of shifting political priorities,
reorganization of government entities and perhaps lack of adequate coordination amongst
government bodies. It really wasn‘t caused by doubt over the rationale or relevance of the
project and its activities, but more likely by situational issues that derived from individual
attitudes and behaviors. Commitment and response from the Government has strongly
improved towards the end of the project, allowing it to succeed on many levels as
demonstrated by the positive final results. In the end, variability in commitment should
be seen as a negative implementation factor, but discounted in light of the final success of
the project.

Most risks were adequately identified and rated; mitigation measures were adequate.
The project itself was a vehicle for mitigating the risks that were identified. This worked
particularly well for activities that had a distinctive supporting character, such as
community level interventions. For activities that were of enabling character (policy and
regulatory setting), the project struggled somewhat because mitigation measures were
largely beyond its control. Eventually, some of these risks were mostly addressed or
mitigated as well, while others still persist, ex. the future role and sustainability of
                                             18
FPUAs vs. LGUs in managing communal forests and pastures, or delays with registration
of tenure rights.

2.2 Implementation

Targets for the preparation and implementation of forest and management plans, both in
number of communes and area covered, were met and exceeded, although in a longer
implementation period (closing dates for IDA and GEF financing were extended). Under
Components A and B, forest and pasture management plans were introduced in 251
communes on an area of 775,511 hectares, compared to the PAD indicator target of 218
communes and 660,000 hectares. This includes 221 communes in which forest and
pasture management plans were prepared or updated and 30 communes that were
involved in micro-catchment planning. Commune-level investments in support of the
plans have been implemented in 239 participating communes. Attribution for the success
of these activities can be given to a variety of factors such as the solid technical design at
preparation, the tenacity of the Bank team in creating an enabling implementation
environment, and the successful coordination between all project stakeholders, but
particularly the representatives of the DFSs, the FPUAs and commune authorities
involved in implementation.

The project has also made progress in engendering the necessary investments for its
carbon sequestration commitments. As mentioned above, such types of projects have a
high degree of embedded uncertainty, so the initial targets both in terms of eligible
project area and potential quantity of carbon sequestration were adjusted downwards
following the CDM validation and other subsequent analyses. To date, investments in
forestation, forest improvements and fencing were implemented on an area of
approximately 3,000 hectares (out of 5,427 hectares), with an estimated quantity of
sequestration of 64,000 tons of CO2 delivered from 2004 through 2010, and an additional
estimated quantity of sequestration of approximately 100,000 tons to be delivered by
2018.

The project was very successful in building capacity of FPUAs, their representative
organizations (federations), as well as local power bodies. This has been an extremely
important activity aimed at putting in place the first building blocks for local capacity to
manage precious community resources. An important aspect of the strengthening of the
FPUAs was focused on engendering participatory preparation of management plans, with
a particular focus on the highly relevant and socially complex process of transferring
usufruct and ownership rights to communities. These activities were mostly implemented
through SNV, in good collaboration with all stakeholders.

However, despite its numerous positive outputs and outcomes, the project‘s
implementation has been marred by significant delays and some lack of direction causing
slow and at times minimal progress on some essential activities. These delays were far
more pronounced up to the mid-term review point and were generally caused by the
country‘s political situation and agenda, volatility in the development of the forestry
sector, institutional confusion, and early general lack of quality of implementation on the
part of the implementation entity. For ―hard‖ activities, such as investments and other
associated activities, the impact of these delays has been successfully mitigated through
                                             19
concerted efforts on the part of the Albanian counterparts and the Bank team in the post
mid-term period.

Unfortunately, the enabling environment for activities related to regulatory and
institutional reforms, capacity building, as well as other such activities that would have
enhanced the project‘s development objective was very challenging. Due to institutional
and policy changes in the sector immediately prior to effectiveness, a number of original
activities had to be adjusted to the new realities, or dropped (see Annex 2). The project
has done its best to adjust to this changing environment, and address when possible the
emerging demands from the Albanian authorities. This is particularly true in the case of
the transfer of ownership of communal pastures and forests to LGUs2, which lead to an
adjustment of the activities supported by the project to focus also on registration of land
by the communes, as well as on the supporting institutional set-up for a new environment
in which local authorities need much more hands-on knowledge and support in managing
these assets. The project provided in a timely manner the necessary enabling support for
land registration, but the Government‘s own supporting actions, such as waiving
registration fees, or addressing the incompatibility in the scale of maps between those in
the management plans and those required by the country‘s Immovable Property
Registration Office have lagged behind3, leaving the finality of these activities beyond
the closing of the project.

The forestry extension service is another example where despite the Project‘s best
intentions, the outcomes were still uncertain until very late into implementation. When
the need for a forestry extension service was established, the project supported a
substantive effort for training a cadre of prospective forest extension specialists, but the
fate of the service was not clear until November 1, 2011 (four months after the closing
date of IDA financing, and the last day of the GEF financing), when it was finally
established by the order of the MOEFWA. Another example is that of the new Forest
Law, which is still in a drafting stage.

Despite these concerns there is quite a bit of certainty that these activities will be
completed, and thus enhance sustainability of all the other activities of the project, due to
the irreversible depth reforms of the communal forestry and pasture sectors have
achieved, as well as the continuing support for communal natural resource management
agenda from such donors as SIDA, and perhaps even the Bank itself through a follow-up
operation.

The Project underwent one restructuring – one extension (November, 2010 to June, 2011).
No changes to the PDO or GEO were made. However, certain adjustments to the Project
should have been properly reflected through amendments of the legal agreements and/or
restructuring, as per the new restructuring guidelines in place since 2009.


2
  Ownership rights were transferred to LGUs in June, 2008 through separate Council of Ministers‘ Decrees for each of the
communities. In January, 2009 the Council of Ministers approved Decision 22 that provided the definition of roles & responsibilities
of LGUs for forest administration, including with respect to usufruct rights and the role of FPUAs.

3
 The fee issue has been resolved through a waiver passed by the Council of Ministers of Albania in September, 2010, while the issue
of compatibility of maps persisted till the closing of the project.


                                                                 20
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The original three indicators listed in Section 1.2 presented an adequate framework for
tracking progress towards achieving the PDO, including the proposed sustainability
objective, by focusing the outcome indicators on area of land under management plans,
increase in household incomes, level of re-investment of collected user fees, and more
secure usufruct rights. The original GEO outcome indicator is not measuring the GEO. A
subsequent change in the indicators (see Section 1.4) saw the introduction of an indicator
better suited for measuring the GEO (reduced erosion), but the relegation of an outcome
indicator (usufruct rights) to intermediate outcome indicator was misplaced. The team
should have simply added a new and improved GEO outcome indicator on reduced
erosion, and leave the original three PDO outcome indicators untouched, as these
captured the various dimensions of sustainable community-based natural resource
management in the project area. An additional intermediate outcome indicator (number of
communes that have registered the land that has been transferred) was added at mid-term
review. As discussed earlier, the justification for this indicator is questionable, since it not
only expanded the expectation for what the project would achieve, but it did so without
having project control over key factors of success. The disaggregated indicators given in
the datasheet and Annex 2 provide more detail on the outcome and intermediate outcome
indicators, and outputs.

Design. The responsibility for monitoring and evaluation activities was conferred to the
PMT. It was to be staffed accordingly to ensure timely and qualitative monitoring and
evaluation of the Project‘s activities. The monitoring and evaluation arrangements were
to be based on inputs from a monitoring and evaluation specialist, a data entry specialist,
and regional managers and coordinators, and were to include routine monitoring and
evaluation, combined with baseline, midterm and final impact assessments. Monitoring
and evaluation was set to assess performance against project objectives and indicators at
the central, regional and commune levels. A baseline survey was to be carried out, with
regular updates of information on indicators to be recorded in a database, and at mid-term
and at the end of the project, an impact assessment measuring the social, environmental
and economic benefits of the project components had to be conducted. The PMT‘s
reporting requirements envisaged quarterly reports covering progress on physical
implementation, use of funds, and project impact. Quarterly reports were to be
consolidated into semi-annual progress reports, and submitted to the Bank.

Implementation. As was originally envisaged, monitoring and evaluation activities were
implemented by the PMT. Unfortunately, the initial efforts to set up a system for
monitoring and evaluation were wrought with delays and failures. The development of a
system was eventually outsourced to a consulting company, but even then the
implementation of the task proved extremely tedious and was marred by lengthy delays
and several contract extensions. The resulting system, and especially the designed
software, was over-designed and complex. To a large extent, these problems were caused
again by poor TORs/Technical Specifications, weak contract management and the
inability of the management entities to take swift and determined decisions of substance
in the early stages of the project. The lack of a functioning monitoring and evaluation
system had a negative impact on the ability of the PMT to comply with its reporting
requirements in the first years of implementation. The data collected and presented to the
                                              21
Bank was limited mostly to procurement and financial management, with very little
information on emerging project outputs and progress indicators.

However, despite this early lack of progress on the establishment of the monitoring and
evaluation system, things have improved after the mid-term, allowing the PMT to begin
producing progress reports and impact assessments. The quality, amount and breadth of
data have been recognized by the Bank team as adequate for the progress reporting
requirements and impact assessment needs. Data was generated primarily during the
duration of the project – most notably from communal forest and pasture management
activities under Component 1, and micro-catchment management activities under
Component 2, for all 240 communities where project interventions were carried out.
System functionality allowed for data to be summarized for commune, regional and
national levels.

A distinctive monitoring effort has been put in place to track the progress of the Project‘s
carbon sequestration activities and results under its commitments to the BioCarbon Fund.
Carbon monitoring is a complex and long-term process that must face up to very stringent
requirements of the UNFCC for CDM afforestation/reforestation projects. To ensure that
the quality of carbon monitoring is up to these requirements, the Project had provided
training to 70 professionals representing Regional Coordinators, DFS, FPUAs and
community foresters. The monitoring of carbon related activities will continue in the
future.

Utilization. Data generated by the system enabled measurements of outcome, output and
source indicators and progress towards the achievement of PDO and GEO. Despite
availability of data, the PMT has constantly struggled with updates of the Project‘s results
framework. Data was also utilized for impact assessments, such as the one carried out by
the Korca Regional Coordinator to determine annual growth rates of communal forestry
and effectiveness of project financed interventions. However, the general impression is
that available data has not been utilized as a potent tool for project evaluation and
adjustment in implementation. More details on this are found in the Lessons Learned
section below.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Financial Management. Regular financial management reviews confirmed a moderately
satisfactory financial management system during the project life, compliant with the
financial covenants of the Financing and Grant Agreements. Internal controls, accounting
procedures and financial management reporting were generally satisfactory. Some issues
were raised during the 2009 review of slow disbursing projects that included the NRDP,
such as (i) disbursement monitoring and forecasting; and (ii) compliance with financial
management requirement at commune level. These were subsequently resolved by the
closing of the Project, although the issue of adequate forecasting of disbursements was
still problematic till the end. Annual Project audits were unqualified (clean), with those
recommendations that were occasionally raised, having been addressed. There were
issues of untimely provision of agreed counterpart financing such as the Government‘s
11% co-financing for commune level investments which was affecting settlements with


                                            22
contractors and suppliers that were subsequently resolved towards the end of the project,
thus ultimately not affecting implementation in a significant way.

Procurement. The PMT‘s ability to effect procurement activities in line with World
Bank policies and procedures has been consistently weak despite prior experience and
important capacity building efforts. This was particularly true for contract management.
The situation was fairly difficult in the first two years of implementation when
procurement activities, especially for more complex assignments were virtually stalled.
Following a series of capacity building efforts and support from the Bank team, things
have evened out eventually, allowing for much smoother contracting and implementation
of contracts. However, initial delays led to a build-up of a backlog of procurement
activities and a subsequently mounting workload for the PMT‘s procurement specialist.
The problem was resolved in part by providing staff time of the PMT Office
Administrator to assist the Procurement Specialist and the extension of the project‘s
closing date. Procurement activities were carried out in accordance with the project‘s
Procurement Plan which was revised regularly to reflect changes in contracts for goods
and consulting services during project implementation. Procurement post-reviews found
that procurement processes were of generally moderately satisfactory quality, reliability,
timeliness, and transparency with some corrective actions requested by the Bank.
However, contract administration remained a persistent weakness.

A particular aspect of the project‘s procurement arrangements was the community
participation method. It was included to build capacity of and increase the ownership
over contracts by the LGUs. However, the value of this method proved only marginal due
to the complexity of the contracts. The time spent by the PMT on this exercise over 251
communes has significantly delayed the implementation of the project.

Disbursement. Disbursements are a function of successful implementation. To this end,
the Project struggled early on to keep up with initial disbursement estimates due to a slow
start. Although, certainly, disbursement estimates were overly-optimistic to begin with.
With a surge in performance, by the mid-term point disbursements were tripling year-on-
year, but further measures had to be implemented to ensure maximum possible
disbursements by closing. In addition to purely technical measures undertaken by both
the Albanian counterparts and the Bank team to ensure proper implementation of
activities, the Project was extended and for some under-disbursed categories funds were
reallocated. By the time of the closing of the IDA financing, 99% of IDA funds were
disbursed, 94% of GEF funds were disbursed and 87% of the SIDA trust fund were
disbursed. Nominal disbursement rates have also been affected somewhat by the
depreciation of the USD, particularly for the SIDA Trust Fund where higher dollar
equivalent sums could not be absorbed.

Environmental Assessment. The project was rated as ―category B‖, requiring a partial
EA. The potential impacts arising from the project‘s commune-level activities under
Components 1 and 2 were being addressed through the implementation of an EMF.
Compliance with the provisions of the EMF was subject to environmental performance
audits carried out by independent organizations. There were two such audits carried out
for 2010 and 2011 which revealed satisfactory compliance with the requirements of the

                                            23
EMF. The audits have also provided conclusive evidence on the positive impacts of the
project on the environment.

Social Safeguards. No social safeguards were triggered by the project. OP 4.12
Involuntary Resettlement was not triggered since the project adopted a community-driven
approach where decisions that could have affected access by commune residents to
resources were made at community levels.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The project‘s post-completion phase is likely to continue with the scaling up of some of
the activities of the NRDP, particularly those that are critical for the long-term
sustainability of the country‘s community forestry and pasture sector, such as continuous
building of the capacity of FPUAs, registration of land by communes and the
development of the forestry extension service. Additional new activities will be focused
on commercializing the natural resource assets transferred to communes and exploring
the potential for payment for environmental services to be provided by communes to
private and public entities. SIDA is providing additional trust fund resources amounting
to about US$2.7 million (including the cancelled/carried over balance of undisbursed
SIDA resources under NRDP) to finance this next phase. The current CPS for Albania
provides for a new investment operation in the field of natural resource management. It is
likely that such an operation will aim to support the environmental services agenda in
Albania. If a new Bank project were to materialize, SIDA funding would in effect serve
as bridge financing between two Bank operations, sustaining the excellent positive
momentum achieved towards the end of NRDP. The future activities will rely on the
much improved implementation capacity of the Forestry Department and the PMT
(including procurement, financial management, monitoring and evaluation), as well as
other local and national-level institutions that were enhanced during the NRDP.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The Project‘s objectives, design and implementation remain highly relevant to Albania‘s
development and natural resource management priorities. The third strategic objective of
the CPS for 2011-14 highlights the urgency of reducing vulnerability to climate change
by improving water conservation management and increasing disaster preparedness.
Indeed, the activities purported by the project remain relevant, either directly or indirectly
for this strategic objective, as water conservation management cannot be meaningfully
achieved without integration with sustainable management of forestry and pasture
resources. This is particularly true in Albania‘s mountainous landscape where
deforestation in up-land areas is a major contributing factor to increased sediment run-off
and floods in low-land areas. The regulatory and institutional reforms that were supported
by the project are also highly relevant in the context of this strategic objective. In
recognition of this, the CPS envisages a new investment lending operation in natural
resource management.



                                             24
The country‘s own strategic development priorities outlined in Albania‘s National
Strategy for Development and Integration for 2007-2013 refer, among other, to a clear
vision for protecting natural resources from pollution and degradation through natural
conservation, maintenance of biodiversity, rehabilitation of degraded forests and
continuation of the transfer of forests and pastures to local government units. The fact
that the country is willing to direct IBRD resources towards a new natural resource
management operation is solid evidence of the Government‘s belief in the relevance and
importance of sustainable resource management for social and economic development.

At the global level the project contributed to the fulfillment of the GEF Operational
Program 15 - Sustainable Land Management, with tangential results for Operational
Program 12 (Integrated Ecosystem Management) and Operational Program 3 (Forest
Ecosystems). In addition, the Project has engendered global benefits to be delivered to
the Adriatic Sea under GEF‘s International Waterway focal area.

Also globally, the project represents a compelling case for the advocacy and practical
application of landscape-based approaches for climate change mitigation and adaptation
through its focus on assisted natural regeneration of forestry resources. It provides
eloquent evidence that bottom-up approaches bear high probabilities for the identification
of long-term solutions. This point is emphasized by the successful approval of a CDM
methodology (AR-AM0003 ver. 4) on the afforestation and reforestation of degraded
land through tree planting, assisted natural regeneration and control of animal grazing
that was developed under the project. This methodology is currently applied in projects
around the world in China, Peru and Ethiopia.

Another aspect that make the project‘s results highly relevant on a global scale relate to
unaccounted sequestration of carbon. The calculated carbon sequestration is limited to a
small area covered by the project for assisted natural regeneration. For the project as a
whole the situation most likely would look much more imposing. It is plausible to assume,
the project‘s activities that focused on forestry improvements (increased cover and
density) have contributed to sequestration of carbon amounts that are far larger than the
ones accounted for under the BioCarbon Fund Project.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives and Global Environment Objectives

A review of project outputs against the targets for outcome and intermediate outcome
indicators reveals a generally positive outlook for the achievement of the PDO and GEO.

Outcome Indicators

    As a result of the implementation of the project, the area of land managed by local
   communities in accordance with sustainable natural resource management plans is
   775,511 hectares (115,000 hectares more than target). Forest and pasture management
   plans were prepared for 251 communities (33 more than the target). Associated
   commune-level investments and works were carried out and completed in 239
   communes.



                                           25
    On the increase of economic benefits at the commune level, somewhat below the
   target but largely in line with it, data analysis reveals an 8% increase in average
   annual household income in communities in which forest and pasture management
   were implemented, and a 28% increase in communities with micro-catchment
   activities. However, the data analysis does not provide for an assessment of the
   dynamics of economic welfare in non-project communes (controls), thus leaving
   room for speculation on the attribution of the increased economic benefits to the
   project‘s activities. Also, the project failed on one measurement of this indicator,
   mainly the 70% commune reinvestment of collected fees for forestry and pasture
   management. Levying fees for grazing and fuel-wood was an issue for which local
   leaders had no political will. The project had no enforcement mechanism for
   collection and reinvestment of fees, and relied mostly on soft power to engender these
   processes. Reinvestment of fees should not have served as a measure of increased
   economic benefits attributable to the project.

    As a result of the implementation of the project, usufruct rights were defined,
   agreed, documented, mapped and demarcated in 251 communes against the target of
   218.

    The project implemented soil erosion reduction measures on 31,116 (19,116
   hectares more than target) resulted in an estimated reduction of soil loss of 223,000
   tons (23,000 tons more than target. This indicator was introduced during
   implementation (in 2006) and modified at the mid-term review for better
   measurement of results.

    As a result of the implementation of the project, the estimated amount of CO2
   sequestered in 2004-2010 is 64,000 tons. This is below the target of 145,768 tons that
   was set after the CDM validation of the project. The reasons for smaller quantities of
   sequestrations are (i) uncertainty of ex-ante carbon sequestration calculations; (iii)
   delays in implementation at community levels; and (ii) smaller areas on which project
   activities were implemented due to poor uptake and interest in some participating
   communities. However, despite these limiting factors, the project is estimated to catch
   up with initial sequestration projections by 2018 (range of 140,000 to 160,000 tons).

Intermediate Outcome Indicators

    Afforestation, forest improvements and fencing works were implemented on
   approximately 3,000 hectares, against the PAD-stated target of 6,000 hectares. The
   PAD target was an estimate which was reviewed a number of times, and essentially
   the output should be measured against 5,427 hectares. The reasons are explained
   above.

    The project failed to achieve the target of 218 communes in which transferred
   land has been registered. Currently, only five communes have registered tenure rights
   over forest and pasture land. This indicator was not part of the original results
   framework which focused on usufruct rights, not ownership rights. The project‘s
   definition of sustainable resource management focused on defined, agreed,
   documented, mapped and demarcated usufruct rights. While formal registration of
                                           26
   land would have been an even more desirable outcome, it was an overly ambitious
   target that was largely beyond the control of the project, i.e. through high registration
   fees and diverging map resolution standards between the maps prepared for the
   community management plans and the maps accepted by the IPRO. The project‘s
   success in achieving sustainable natural resource management should not be measure
   against it.

    As a result of the implementation of the project, 30 micro-catchment
   management plans were prepared, approved and put under implementation (in line
   with the target of 30).

3.3 Efficiency

Generally, cost levels vs. expected outputs were well estimated at appraisal. This was the
case across the board for management plans, commune level investments, assisted
afforestation/reforestation, and soil erosion reduction measures. Project results were
achieved, or exceeded, with lower total costs from those estimated at appraisal, and
therefore the project can be considered efficient. The economic analysis, i.e. post-project
calculation of the ERR and the NPV confirm the conclusions on efficiency.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome and Global Environment Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

The PDO and GEO remain highly relevant for local and global natural resource
management and sustainable land management agenda. The PDO was largely achieved
from a quantitative point of view. The exception is the outcome indicator on increased
economic benefits, where there is a smaller than initially expected increase, and where
there was no progress on reinvestment of collected user fees. While important, the
indicator measures only a part of the PDO, and given the level of achieved economic
benefits (8% increase vs. 10%), plus explanations provided earlier on the reasons the
second indicator measure failed, it should attenuate the effect on the rating and not lead to
its downgrade. From a qualitative perspective the sustainability of community-based
natural resource management, judged against the sensu stricto of the initial results
framework was also achieved. On the GEO side, again notwithstanding the problems
with the results framework structure, there is certainly no doubt that the project has
achieved its objective. It has done so by attenuating degradation in upland and
mountainous erosion-prone lands and reduction of sediment run-off into the Adriatic Sea.
But additionally, the project has realized other global benefits by reducing emissions of
CO2 (accounted and unaccounted), maintaining globally significant biodiversity, and not
the least of all providing the analytical and methodological underpinnings for assisted
natural regeneration projects. The combination of the PDO and GEO outcomes justifies
an overall satisfactory rating.




                                             27
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The project certainly had positive impacts on reduction of poverty through increased rural
incomes in target communes: (a) an 8 percent increase in income earned from forest
activities in communal forest and pasture lands; and (b) a 28 percent increase in income
earned from forest and agriculture activities in micro-catchments. Gender aspects were
also an important element of the Project‘s results framework. To this end, the Project
aimed for and achieved a 20% direct participation by women in decision-making
structures for forest and pasture management at village and commune levels, as well as a
20% participation of women in the micro-catchment management planning process.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The project built and strengthened capacity for forest and pasture management at several
levels. First, capacity was strengthened at the level of communes where existing and new
FPUAs were empowered and trained to manage natural resources locally. Such capacity
building efforts focused both on technical matters, but also on awareness and compliance
with a fast-evolving legal and regulatory framework. Second, the capacity of the DGFP
and DFS was strengthened in the provision of forestry extension advice focusing on
forest administration and management, sustainable utilization of forests, forest
development and pasture management. The professionals that were trained will form the
basis for the cadre of the country‘s forestry extension service. Third, training and
capacity building was provided to other relevant entities of the MOEFWA. Fourth,
capacity building activities were provided to representative institutions such as the
National Forest and Pasture Users‘ Association and its regional outlays. Last but not least,
public awareness for matters related to natural resource management was increased
through targeted efforts.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

A very positive and perhaps unintended outcome of the project was the realization that
natural assets represent a good foundation for the provision of environmental services by
owners of these assets to both public and private entities. While the general intent of the
project was to transfer management of these assets to communities, with a view of
increasing the quality of rural livelihoods, the implementation of the project set the stage
for expanding the possibilities of derived incomes to chargeable environmental services.
This agenda of pushing commercialization of natural assets will be further explored in
future government and donor-funded projects.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

A project completion workshop was held on April 27, 2011 with the participation of the
project‘s main stakeholders. Results from the project were presented, which stimulated a
comprehensive discussion on the future challenges and perspectives of communal
forestry and pasture management. The workshop discussed and endorsed the
Government‘s Implementation Completion Report, which contains a detailed summary of
the findings and conclusions on the implementation of the project.
                                           28
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome and Global Environment
Outcome
Rating: Substantial

While project outcomes are likely to be sustainable, there are a number of factors that
could influence its long-term sustainability. One factor is the pace and degree of depth of
institutional reforms that are still required to support the emerging communal forestry
sector. The transfer of forests to the LGUs appeared, at first sight, to have achieved the
objective of community based natural resource management. However, the design of the
project was based on the premise of participatory involvement of the FPUAs for their
members to exercise traditional user rights/tenure rights. The change in ownership from
the state to LGUs clearly involved increased responsibility for the LGUs to control
management of forests and pasture, but it should not necessarily entail a management role
for these resources. Management should stay with the FPUAs which by their nature
capture a crucial element of sustainability – participatory and joint control/management
of natural resource uses. The evolving legal framework for the forestry sector should
clearly establish this role for the FPUAs. Furthermore, in order to secure a degree of
financial sustainability, the FPUAS should be allowed to benefit from future incomes
derived from the investments supported by the NRDP. A primary factor is the extent to
which the FPUAs will be able to function in a post-project environment. These entities
are still fragile, particularly in terms of their ability to generate revenues and access
markets to sustain themselves as meaningful institutions. More attention is required to
transform them—possibly in a federated structure-- into business oriented entities that
can market the assets/resources at their disposable with a revenue generating mind-set.
Certainly, this will require not only a proper legal framework, but also more capacity
building and training. At this time, there are good signs that there will be significant
financial and technical assistance follow-up support to the communal forestry and pasture
sectors, including further capacity building for FPUAs, that would mitigate the risks and
would cement the results of the PDO and GEO.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank identified an area of support that was and remains relevant to the Albanian
environment, rural livelihoods, as well as with the global commons of sustainable land
management and climate change mitigation. Project activities targeted highly priority
areas identified in the country‘s strategic development documents. Outcomes (supported
by the design) struck an appropriate balance among three key areas: (i) preparation and
implementation of management plans; (ii) improving institutional readiness and
compliance with policy reforms in the communal forestry and pasture sectors, and (iii)
support to institutional and policy reforms.




                                            29
However, as discussed earlier, the formulation of the PDO could have been less
ambitious in promising sustainable community-based natural resource management; and
in the choice of the GEO indicator which was a poor match to the proposed activities.


(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Bank maintained a solid and proactive focus on the fulfillment of project objectives.
The task team closely supervised implementation through semi-annual, and at times more
frequent missions, fiduciary reviews, and maintenance of a constructive dialogue between
the project‘s major stakeholders. Issues raised were addressed in a timely manner and
were candidly reported in official documentation. For example, during the MTR the Bank
identified very specifically the substantial problem areas, suggested ways the PMT and
other relevant institutions could resolve them, and followed up with specific measures on
the Bank side to facilitate the necessary changes. While not all initial activities were
completed in full by project closing, the Bank teams‘ enabling actions led to the eventual
general positive outcomes. The task team did a proper job of ensuring that the project‘s
activities were implemented in line with the provisions of the Environmental
Management Framework and reviewing the Annual Environmental Audits, through both
desk work and site visits. Fiduciary reviews were carried out in a timely and effective
manner as per institutional requirements. The team managed well other internal
institutional requirements related to monitoring and reporting. Finally, the task team built
an excellent partnership with SIDA which resulted in a very effective, participatory inter-
donor coordination approach to managing the project‘s activities.

However, one important shortcoming displayed by the team throughout the supervision
stage was the way it dealt with the structure of the results framework. Lack of proper
recorded justification in some cases, and lack of formal amendment of the legal
agreements to reflect changes in outcome and intermediate outcome indicators should
have been avoided.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

World Bank support to the Government of Albania in preparing and implementing the
Project is rated as moderately satisfactory. The Bank team was highly responsive in
addressing implementation issues and in adapting to unpredictable circumstances in a
challenging institutional and policy environment in a very complex sector. However, the
issues highlighted above on the lack of proper processing of amendments to the results
framework render a reflection in the performance assessment by reducing the rating to
moderately satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

At preparation, the GoA strongly supported the Project and its objectives. However, from
the outset of implementation, the dynamic has shifted somewhat as the country has gone
                                            30
through elections and government counterparts have essentially changed from the
Ministry of Agriculture to the MOEFWA. These changes have led to a temporary hiatus
that delayed both key organizational actions for enabling proper implementation, as well
as delays in pursuing critical legal and institutional adjustments in reorganizing the
administration and functioning of the forestry sector that were imperative for the overall
direction and success of the Project. Intra- and inter-agency cooperation among the major
institutional stakeholders was scant. In the post-review stage of implementation, the
Government has upped its handle on critical sector issues, as well as fine-tuned its
decision-making processes and interaction with the project stakeholders. This much more
visible, if not renewed, commitment has allowed the project to succeed to the extent that
it did at closing. Counterpart funding was received with delays, but in the end in
sufficient volumes to allow final settlement on all outstanding commitments for
commune investments.


(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The MOEFWA had the overall responsibility for the Project, but for all intent and
purposes the Project was implemented by the DFP and a dedicated PMT. The PMT was
established and began functioning at the beginning of the project and remain the main
implementation arm throughout. A POIC and PTC were established, although with delays
in functionality. The POIC was not convening regularly, and at times did not serve its
role of providing strategic guidance and political support to the Project. The PTC was
also inactive in providing technical backstopping to the PMT for the implementation of
those activities that required expert technical advice. Serious problems with
implementation arrangements emerged following attempts to mainstream implementation
aspects into the DFP. Country capacity proved weak, and the efficiency of mainstreaming
efforts was initially low as they resulted in poor decision making and lack of coordination
amongst key implementation stakeholders. Nevertheless, the mainstreaming efforts were
worthwhile and were made consciously to the benefit of more long-lasting institutional
effects of the project.

Against this backdrop, the PMT‘s performance was variable throughout the years, but
registered palpable improvements in the later years of implementation. It was fairly
effective in procurement and financial management matters, but it had to overcome
significant challenges in monitoring and evaluation, reporting, contract management,
decision making, internal communication, timely staff recruitment, and other operational
matters. Performance of the Regional Coordinators was solid and effective, and proved
critical to the success of the Project. Overall, however, the technical competency,
dedication, operational creativity and the hard work of the PMT were commendable traits
that yielded multiple positive results.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Overall borrower performance is rated as moderately satisfactory taking into account the
Government‘s commitment to achieving the PDO and GEO, which are aligned with the
country‘s main strategic development documents and the relevant GEF Operational
                                          31
Programs. Despite the partial completion of some institutional and policy reform
activities under Component A, the Project‘s overall outcomes justify this rating.

6. Lessons Learned

Project experience highlighted the following important factors as lessons for post-
completion/follow-up stage:

a) Monitoring and Evaluation systems should be simple and focused: Natural resource
   management projects are most difficult to monitor and, to be effective, any system
   needs to be as simple and easily used by non-IT specialists as possible. In this case a
   company was contracted to develop the M&E software. That consultancy
   overdesigned the system, such that it had too many variables (150), many of which
   had little relevance to project outputs, and it was a web-based system requiring the
   contracting of IT specialists to make even simple adaptations. To be easily managed
   by project staff, such a system and its software would preferably: (i) be developed in
   a less esoteric way, probably building upon an Excel worksheet, so that the user may
   make changes and add new, more relevant, variables as identified; (ii) contain fewer
   and more measurable indicators, with direct relevance to the development objectives;
   (iii) be served by a full-time M&E staff to manage data entry and ensure that project
   participants collect the needed data on a regular basis; (iv) envisage the contracting of
   specialized consultants, who would generate project specific field data, such as soil
   erosion, socio/economic data on participants, environmental impacts and
   forest/pasture growth; and (v) not be web-enabled, as that simply adds another layer
   of complexity that is not justified for the purposes of this kind of monitoring, where
   data collection needs to be standardized and one person needs to manage the system
   to ensure consistency.

b) GIS mapping for management plans is essential: In a project like this, by which the
   management plan is such an important part of project implementation, standardized
   digital mapping is essential in this day and age of Geographic Information Systems
   (GIS). As such, the PMT should have probably engaged from the project start a full
   time GIS specialist to ensure standardized digital mapping of the planned areas. This
   is doubly important in Albania, where the land registration office requires detailed
   maps for the registration process.

c) Environmental Audits should be based on standard practice: The mandated Annual
   Environmental Audit report did have a well defined and clear Terms of Reference.
   Unfortunately, it seems that there is no standard practice, requirement or expertise to
   conduct an Environmental Audit for similar activities. As such, the Audit report was
   viewed more as a platform for a broader environmental discussion, providing a
   general set of recommendations. Apart from a well defined TOR, one of the lessons
   would be to establish a clear message of what the purpose of the Audit is, and to
   provide specific guidance of providing a concise but useful Audit report.

d) Clarity of user rights set-up is a key pre-requisite for sustainability: The issue of user
   rights to be transferred from the Government to users has been subject to repeated
   concerns for lack of progress since the beginning of implementation of NRDP. In
                                             32
   September, 2007 this unresolved issue led to a threat from SIDA to withdraw from
   the project. The response from the Government of Albania was to transfer the
   ownership from the central government to the Local Government Units. Furthermore,
   the Government approved Decision 22 that provided, inter alia, details on the
   administration of usufruct rights and the role of FPUAs. However, in order to make
   further progress on the agenda of decentralized and accountable management of
   natural resources the role and responsibilities of the FPUAs, but also commune and
   the newly created forest extension service, still need further legal clarification in the
   Forest Law which is currently being revised.

Project experience highlighted the following important factors as lessons with general
applicability for similar operations:

a) Adaptation to local conditions is critical: Community participatory processes,
   including communal natural resource management are highly specific activities that
   need to be developed in a localized contextual setting. The specificity of underlying
   factors such as landscape, climate, tradition, wealth, communal social capital,
   absorption capacity are all crucial elements that need to be accounted for when
   embarking on such a massive effort. There should be a realization that exogenous
   approaches to community activities should be based on a reasonable degree of
   flexibility derived from the factors above. A standardized approach to all participating
   communities may therefore be a less preferred option. Furthermore, the application of
   top-down approaches itself is quite questionable in settings with a high degree of
   variance in local readiness for implementation. Perhaps in the future a bigger push
   can be made for projects that support community demand-driven interventions.

b) Local stakeholder involvement remains a key determinant for success: Local
   stakeholder involvement was necessary for receiving feedback on local site
   conditions and other commune-specific issues. Solid awareness raising,
   communication and confidence building measures are required for local buy-in, and
   must be a staple of any community based projects.

c) Realistic expectations are key in promoting a comprehensive approach to communal
   forestry and pasture management that includes institutional building and policy
   reform: The rationale behind a comprehensive approach is very sound. However, the
   sequencing and timing of introducing key elements of a comprehensive framework
   are crucial. If these are off, projects such as the NRDP are in danger of stalling and
   worse, achieving unsustainable results. To this end, sometimes less is more, and
   choosing the path of clearly benchmarked and realistic staging of activities, can
   provide a better platform for achieving results, than an all-out approach. This also
   achieves the necessary simplification of projects that can represent the critical
   difference between efficient management and problematic one. Also, projects in
   countries that lack key pieces of legislation or embark onto reforms that are not
   covered by existing regulation should set realistic objectives for such reforms and/or
   plan accordingly. Projects that span across electoral dates should take this into
   consideration. Also be cognizant of linked project components or sub-components
   and whether the failure of one will jeopardize others. Perhaps instruments of

                                            33
   adaptable programmatic character represent a more adequate alternative to standard
   single loan operations.

d) Matching financing resources with physical targets in a more meaningful way is
   important: Stretching physical targets too much can leave projects vulnerable to a
   reduction in financing per unit of output. This can result in situations when outputs
   are partial, thus a-priori prone to degradation, and outcomes are unsustainable. This
   becomes even more evident if there are no exit strategies in the post-project stage. To
   this end, it is important to ensure that financing provided for commune-level
   interventions is meaningful, even if it means a reduction of the quantitative targets.
   This lesson dove-tails with the lesson on better targeting of communes with higher
   potential for successful implementation. The symbolism and demonstration effects of
   a tighter, successful operation can outweigh those of an operation that tries too much.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

The borrower‘s contribution to the ICR was shared with the World Bank on May 18,
2011 and is reproduced in Annex 7. It provides a summary of Project experience with
important assessments of the relationships and implementing arrangements that both
aided and hindered implementation. Chief among these are the lessons learned and
echoed in the previous section.

(b) Co-financiers

Sweden concurs with the overall assessment made by the Implementation Completion
Report (ICR). One of the main Project achievements is the improved governance of
village woodland and pasture with increased capacity of the communal forestry and
pastures users' associations (CFPUAs). Besides the Swedish co-funding of the Bank to
the project, Sweden has also funded SNV through a different project. SNV has been
instrumental for the increase of the capacity of the users associations. We believe Bank's
support became more efficient due to this complementary funding. Sweden gives high
importance to women‘s participation and economic empowerment and it is recognized
that major efforts has been made through the project to increase the share of women‘s
participation in decision making bodies at local village and commune levels.

Sweden is highly satisfied with the cooperation, communication and dialogue that the
World Bank office in Tirana has provided. A contributing factor for the good cooperation
is that Sweden funded a resource person to join the Bank monitoring and support team,
but       who      was        reporting      to       the       Swedish        Embassy.

The Swedish Administration Agreement with the Bank was extended following
Government's request, but at the time of the Grant closing in 2011, there still remained 13
% of the SIDA TF which were transferred back to Sweden. This corresponds to 9 % of
the Swedish annual country frame for Albania. The Embassy has noted that the Albanian
project management didn‘t in time manage to use the currency fluctuations of USD and
SEK, resulting in under-spending of grant funds whereas IDA and GEF funds were

SNV, Netherlands Development Organization in Albania

SNV was responsible for the implementation of capacity-building measures to improve
the governance of forest and pasture resources in 251 local government units
(communes). This covers supporting the establishment and strengthening of Forest
Pasture User Associations (FPUAs), which represent community level interests, and
building institutional linkages for longer term sustainability. Financial contribution:
US$1,570,600 [NRDP contract US$525,000 (33%) with addition of US$186,880 (for the
additional communes requested by the Government), SNV US$1,045,000 (67%)].
SNV‘s mission is provision of technical assistance with the aim of alleviating poverty
and improving governance in developing countries. SNV Albania‘s main aim is to assist
Albania to further develop and implement its decentralization process and to support
good local governance that facilitates sustainable poverty alleviation and supports
Albania‘s effort to enter into the European Union.
The following provides an overview of key lessons and issues that affect the functioning
and operation and therefore sustainability of the forest and pasture user associations:

 - SNV, WB and Sida have a good experience of cooperation for supporting
   development of communal forestry in Albania since the beginning of the process. But
   under NRDP, it was the first time that FPUAs received such a broad training and
   capacity building program. Within the previous Albania Forestry Project, FPUAs
   were created as instruments for implementing project activities. Therefore it was
   necessary to start with awareness sessions for users at village level to build their
   understanding of the role of communities and associations not just for NRDP
   implementation, but for all the process of natural resources management and rural
   economic development as a part of it. This cooperation and co-funding combining
   both implementation approaches ―top down‖ and ―bottom up‖ above all had a
   positive impact on the strengthening the decentralized management of natural
   resources through active participation of local communities.

 - Use of local trainers and local capacity builders made possible the delivery of about
   4500 trainings to about 62.000 participants at all levels as well as increased the
   knowledge and skills of Regional Federations and their membership the FPUAs; In
   addition to providing 10-year management plans, the processes contribute to
   awareness building, knowledge transfer and empowerment of local communities to
   manage land-use in their local environments
 - Strengthening the sustainability of FPUAs needs improvement in their non-profit
   status and in the fees/taxes system for them to receive a share in revenues. Further
   strengthening of professional and financial sustainability of federations services will
   assist in the further provision of services and support to FPUAs and individual users.
 - Strengthening tenure security over forests and pastures through better documentation
   and registration of properties/user rights remains a critical issue for the security of the
   process and people and future financial support schemes. Using built up models and
   good examples in regions creates a foundation for continuing transfer/decentralization
   process and user/properties rights at village and family level;

                                             35
 - A financing scheme for the forest sector in Albania is required similar to the incentive
   and subsidy schemes operated in agriculture. Such financing schemes should be based
   on an application/challenge fund basis not ‗one size fits all‘. This would need to target
   LGUs and FPUAs given the lack of land title with traditional forest users. The impact
   of CFPM in supporting local livelihood could be wider if CFPM is included in rural
   development strategies, initiatives and funding mechanisms. Initial steps in micro-
   catchment management, carbon sequestration have been positive at the local level.
   Opportunities from renewable energy, environment services initiatives could further
   increase livelihoods prospects of rural dwellers;
 - The forest and pasture resources in Albania are still under rehabilitation and farmers
   need to be able to receive advice and support. This can be through government (an
   extension service) or through non-state actors such as the Federations who have
   started this process under NRDP;
 - Roles and responsibilities of FPUAs, Communes and DFS, still have to be clearly
   defined by legal framework, and communicated widely in order to establish fully
   decentralized and accountable management.
 - Developing institutional reform and legal framework according to the new reality of
   the sector. Implementation of the Council of Ministers decision No.22 of January
   2008, requires further building capacities of LGUs for CFP management; there is
   urgent need for management and extension support to the new forest owners to ensure
   capacity, knowledge and skills are available in line with Government Policy on
   Communal Forest and Pasture areas.
- The changes in ownership and management objectives of these transferred forests and
  pasture compared to the State forests requires a whole new set of knowledge and
  procedures. Initial steps have been taken with stakeholder within this capacity
  development program, but further steps and investment is required.

WATERSHEDS

          B.1. Introducing integrated resource management in micro-catchments (MC)
B.1.1. Preparing MC resource management          The Project supported the preparation of 30
plans                                            micro-catchment resource management plans
                                                 that cover an area of 161,478 hectares (of
                                                 which 67,000 hectares of agricultural land).
B.1.2. Implementing MC management plans          The Project supported the implementation of

                    B.2. Strengthening governance for watershed management
B.2.1 Training of regional agricultural          The Project supported provision of training to
directorates, drainage boards, DFS staff and     45 staff members or agricultural directorates
commune staff in extension advice                and drainage boards on topics related to
                                                 integrated resource management.
                                                 Additionally, some 62,000 commune members
                                                 were trained in watershed management
                                                 planning approaches.
B.2.2 Strengthening relationships with Land      Activity was dropped as appraised because
Administration and Protection offices (LAPs)     land offices in 30 communes were part of the

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

The Project‘s economic analysis at appraisal was based on the calculation of an ERR. This annex
reviews the Economic Rate of Return (ERR) against implementation results.

a) ERR at Appraisal

The economic benefits associated with the improvement o f natural resource management within
the 218 communes (including the 30 communes where MC plans were to be implemented) fell
into two main categories: (i) benefits in the upper watersheds from reduced soil erosion, reversal
of degradation of pasture land and increased productivity from sustainable forest, pasture and
agricultural land management; and (ii) benefits in the lower watersheds from reduced flooding
and sedimentation of water courses and thus less damage to infrastructure and agricultural crops.
The overall ERR for the project, including both upstream and downstream benefits was a robust
21.2%.

Quantitative Benefits

Components A1 and A2 were supposed to result in economic benefits generated from increased
production of fodder, NTFPs (e.g. medicinal plants and herbs) and in the longer term the
harvesting of thinnings predominantly to meet rural fuel-wood demand. These direct benefits
were supposed to result from the implementation of communal forest and pasture management
plans covering an average 2000ha of forest and pasture land per commune, with direct
interventions on 120ha. In addition, Component A1 included the carbon sequestration activities,
that were foreseen to generate an income from the sale of Kyoto Protocol compliant carbon
credits (US$ 14/ha) for 12 years, while also generating increased production of fodder, fuel-wood
and timber.

Rehabilitation of the forest and pasture communal lands, in components A1, A2 and B1 was
forecasted to result in positive downstream benefits through the stabilization of upland areas,
reducing the amount of damage to lowland infrastructure and agricultural areas. At the time of
appraisal, the Government of Albania was spending US$ 6-7 million per year on repairing flood
damaged agricultural land, rural housing and infrastructure. The project activities would result in
a reduction in the annual damage costs by an estimated 25-30%.

Component B (implementation of holistic micro-catchment plans), would result in significant
economic benefits for 30 communes through the direct timber, fuelwood, NTFP benefits, and
increased yields from agricultural production. This would result in increased income-generation
from the sale of agricultural and forest products, increased production of subsistence products and
improved food security.

Qualitative Benefits

The project was forecasted to have significant qualitative benefits: biodiversity protection and
enhancement, regeneration and recovery of natural vegetation, stabilization of land resulting in
less soil erosion and sedimentation of water courses, a reduced risk of landslides, forest
rehabilitation, and improved quality of agricultural soil. The project would also increase the
standing capital value of the forest over time which would become increasingly significant if the
transfer of land ownership becomes feasible in the longer term.



                                                43
b) ERR at Completion

Project results were achieved, and exceeded in some cases. As expected, Components A1 and A2
generated direct economic benefits through increased production of fodder, fuel-wood and other
non-timber forest products (e.g. medicinal plants and herbs). The number of communes included
(251 as compared with 218), the area covered (2,600 ha per commune) and the number of
beneficiary households were larger than projected at appraisal. The annual yields of fodder and
fuel-wood are in line with appraisal estimates, and the timber growth rates in the sample plots
exceed those assumed at appraisal by about 15%. The benefits from Component A1 also include
projected income from the sale of Kyoto Protocol compliant carbon credits (US$ 4.4 per CO2
ton) on account of carbon sequestration activities undertaken on about 2800 ha. These projections
are much more robust than the ones used at appraisal because they are based on data from the
validation and initial verification of the carbon finance activities. While the project area for
carbon finance activities has in fact turned out to be smaller, the projected sequestration and
income streams until 2018 are still expected to engender significant economic benefits to the
participating communities.

The improved management of communal forest and pasture lands under Sub-Components A1, A2
and B1 very likely helped reduce the incidence and severity of downstream flooding and, hence,
of damage to lowland infrastructure and agricultural areas. A realistic estimate of the magnitude
of flood damage repair costs thereby avoided is, however, not possible, and no quantification of
these downstream benefits is included here.

Sub-Component A3, in concert with activities under Sub-Components A1, A2 and B1generated is
estimated to have generated considerable benefits through the reduced incidence of forest fires in
a significantly larger area than anticipated at appraisal.

As expected, the project generated significant benefits under Component B through increased
sustainable harvesting of farm products, fodder, fuel-wood, other non-timber forest products and,
in the longer run, of timber.

Since many benefits, and especially those from increased timber harvesting, take time to accrue,
the economic analysis assessed the quantifiable incremental project benefits over the 45-year
period from 2005 to 2049. The discount rate applied is 12%. The analysis shows an overall ERR
for the project of 20.6%. While this is slightly lower than the appraisal estimate of 21.2%, the
latter included an estimate for flood damage repair costs avoided which was highly speculative
and has not been included here. The NPV is US$9.2 million.

The analysis of final costs, outputs and outcomes (economic benefits) confirms that the project
was implemented efficiently.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

Beneficiary surveys conducted as part of the Project‘s socio-economic assessment study confirm
a high degree of interest of the part of rural communities to participate proactively in the Project‘s
activities. The interest is even higher in the remote mountainous communities. The survey‘s
quantitative assessment show that about 85% of the respondents were knowledgeable of the
Project activities and that more than 2/3 of villagers participated in Project activities. One of the
most important things worth mentioning is that about 60% of respondents who participated in the
Project activities claim that their ideas and proposals were taken into account and later
implemented through the Project. The main reason for high participation and appreciation of the
Project is the generally poor conditions in these remote rural areas and the fact that participation
in the Project was completely voluntary. Probably the greatest social impact of the Project has
been the initiation of village structures (formal and informal) to support the process of
decentralization of forest and pasture management from central level to local level institutions.
This is mostly through the formation of Forest and Pasture Commune User Associations.

Additionally, economic and social impacts were reported to have been realized by the Project.
The surveys show that 92% of the families in the sample show improved incomes. This is backed
up by state statistics, which show trends of substantial decrease in the number of families living
under the poverty line. The Project beneficiaries benefitted economically either directly or
indirectly. Direct benefits came through engagements to implement Project related activities
either in the preparation of plans or in the implementation of works envisaged as part of the
management plans. Indirect benefits involve improved pastures that increase productivity, as
well as improved forest, which will provide forest products; another source of increased
household incomes. The social assessment attempted to measure the Project‘s directly attributable
impact on the increase of the beneficiaries ‗revenues. The estimated Project impact on increased
revenues is about 10%, achieved through both direct and indirect benefits. Moreover, in addition
to those quantifiable benefits, there will also be long term benefits from forest protection.

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

A final project stakeholder workshop was held on April 27, 2011. The discussions in the
workshop centered on the Project‘s results at completion and the lessons learned. In addition, the
workshop participants commented on a Borrower ICR draft, allowing them to inform its final
drafting.

The audience included MOEFWA and PMT staff, as well as representatives of the communes and
users associations, of the academia from the Forest Faculty. Representatives of the World Bank
office Tirana, SIDA and SNV were present as well.

Summary of the workshop

The following were the main conclusions and comments of the participants regarding the project,
the draft Borrower ICR and the lessons for future collaboration:

    1. The draft Borrower ICR provides an in-depth, critical assessment of the project, which
       was received well by the participants.
    2. Lessons of the ICR are relevant to the project design, but need to strengthen: a) how
       worthy was the streamlining of the project management approach, and b) how the failure
       of the monitoring and evaluation affected assessment of the intended improvement of
       management at the local level.
    3. Frankness of the speakers was well-received and participants were critical of some
       aspects that affect the achievement of the project, while recognizing difficulties faced
       during the project implementation, and rapid changes not anticipated at appraisal.
    4. The project was relevant to the priorities and policies of the government and of the
       targeted areas and population living in these areas and the project had a positive impact
       on the targeted areas, in terms of soil erosion reduction, improving economic conditions
       of poor families, creating the basis for sustainable management of the natural resources
       by communes, users associations and communities.
    5. The sustainability of the project impacts is discussed in two aspects, a) financial and b)
       proper functioning of the institutional structures. Both are not yet there and therefore will
       need to be reviewed and put at the center of the future project.
    6. The role of the main actors, and in particular commune authorities, users associations and
       communities, has been contributive to the project outputs, but can they operate after the
       project completion independently to manage properly the natural resources and maintain
       the results achieve under the project? The answer is, further legal, institutional, and
       operational actions are needed to achieve that.
    7. The approach taken in the appraisal that cover a big number of communes and a vast area
       of forests and pastures under the project was challenged by the alternative approach of
       downsizing of the project by focusing on the smaller number of communes to achieving a
       greater impact.
    8. The demand driven approach should be addressed in the next operation by applying
       rigorous criteria in order to select communes that have fulfilled the required conditions
       and are seriously committed to take up all required obligations that the investment
       projects will pose on them.
    9. Although the progress made, institutional reform measures have not been completed yet,
       and therefore, strengthening the implementation of the institutional reform measures is a
       must for the success of the future project.



                                                48
10. It was emphasized that streamlining of the project management was important to building
    capacity within the MOEFWA, but lessons have to be drown and use them for the
    preparation of the follow on project.
11. Scientific research, new technologies and innovation to cope with the effects of climate
    changes on these natural resources, and therefore improving management of the
    resources, has to be recognized and considered as part of the future project.
12. The registration of the forests and pastures by the commune authorities is a key turning
    point to make them real owners of the transferred assets. The process and procedures are
    clear, also most of the documents are available in the offices of DFS, but lack of
    cooperation and of the political will are the main barriers that are hampering the
    completion of this important process. Can the MOEFWA be instrumental and facilitate
    this process? There were pros and cons to this suggestion.
13. The issue that the ownership of F&P should go to their traditional owners (dated before
    World War II), was emphasized as a very sensitive issue related to the sustainable
    management of these economic assets. The history of Albania offers two types of
    ownership, commune authorities and individual farmers, and the suggestion given was
    that regions of Albania should follow their traditions.
14. Monitoring and evaluation system did not provided the expected information on how the
    management of forests and pastures were improved and how the earnings increased
    mitigated the rural poverty in the targeted project areas. This poor performance has to
    change substantially in the future project.
15. The Bank did play a helpful role during the project implementation, which was valued by
    the Government. It did critically assess the implementation process, coordinated with the
    government on proposed actions/proposals which were operationally and technically
    sound, and towards achievements of the PDO.
16. SIDA‘s role was praised as very important to the project results
17. Future Bank involvement in the forest and pasture sector should continue to be strategic
    and programmatic in nature, with SIDA being a part of the overall program support rather
    than stand-alone operation.
18. The role of Dutch Government through SNV in providing the necessary training
    contributed to the capacity building of indented structures.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

This Annex includes: (a) a summary of the Borrower‘s ICR, endorsed by the Project
Implementation Oversight Committee; and (b) Government of Albania comments on the
draft ICR.

    I.   Project Evaluation:
         1.1     Achievement of project objectives

The realization of the key project development indicators (which measure the level of
achievements of the project development objective) at this stage of the project implementation
inform that all four indicators are expected to be fulfilled by November 2011.

A key achievement was the official transfer of the ownership rights of forests and pastures to
about 330 communes.

         1.2     Implementation of activities by component

         Component A: Improved Management and Governance of Forests and Pastures

One of the objectives of this component was strengthening the participatory forest and pasture
management in the preparation and approval of the communal forests and pastures management
plans (CFPMPs) that have encompassed: a) 115 communes inherited from the AFP, and b) 125
new communes added in this project as well, including 73 new communes under the project and
52 additional ones added during the project implementation.

This component has exceeded its objective to introduce communal and participatory forest and
pasture management plans in 240 communes involving 744,434 ha, compared to the PAD
objective of 218 communes involving 600,000 hectares.

Implementation of the activities under the approved management plans is nearing their full
completion. Small scale investments under Component A on communal forest and pasture
management (CFPM) are now completed in 147 communes and the remaining 68 participating
communes are executing their investment projects to be completed until November 2011. These
investments were directed towards: a) land stabilization; b) resource rehabilitation, and c)
sustainable resource use.

Another key activity of this Component that is nearing its objective is carbon emission
reductions to be purchased by the BioCarbon Fund of the World Bank4. About 24 communes
that received support under the AFP have benefited from investments funded under the NRDP
aiming to sequester carbon through assisted natural regeneration in about 6,000 ha. The
estimated amount of CO2 sequestered stands at 143,000 tons, against 145,768 tons, which was
the revised target in the MTR. Under the carbon sequestration (CS) program the small project
investments have been completed in 13 communes, while investments in the remaining 11
communes are expected to be completed before the entire project is completed.



4
  The BioCarbon Fund has expressed interest in purchasing emission reductions from Albania, resulting
from a proposed ―Assisted Natural Regeneration of Degraded Lands‖ Biocarbon Fund project, which is
included in the NRDP.

                                                  50
The mechanism and the institutional arrangements to make this payment happening are still
pending. The proposed flow of funds to the communes from the MOEFWA has not materialized
yet, although MOF has agreed in principle that CS funds may flow directly to the Local
Government Units, via the MOEFWA.

Another achievement under this Component was strengthening the governance for forest and
pasture management through: a) building the capacity of existing and new Communal Forest and
Pasture User Associations (CFPUAs), b) training of General Directorate of Forests and Pastures
(DGFP) and District Forest Service (DFS) in participatory provision of extension advice, and c)
implementing priority actions in the National Strategy for the Development of Forests and
Pasture sector.

a)      Building the capacity of existing and new Communal Forest and Pasture User
Associations (CFPUAs) - the project put the CFPUAs in the driving seat as a key player in the
preparation and implementation of the FPMPs and MC plans. Although these associations have
little experience, created under the previous project (AFP) they have played an instrumental role
in the preparation of the management plans and their implementation with the participation of the
community. The project contributed to strengthening of the CFPUAs by means of various training
programs that have increased more their knowledge and responsibilities.

It should be noted that CFPUAs had the task to facilitate the preparation of the management plans,
and implement them according to the agreement with commune authorities. Therefore their
primary concern was on implementing the approved management plans through various small
capital investments projects, which generated temporary employment. Their role in managing
communal forests and pastures leading to income generation, on behalf of new owners and real
users is a big challenge ahead. This requires that both owners and users see the need for managing
these assets by the user associations, and also the later should show capacity and commitment to
play this role, which would need to be formalized through a contractual arrangement with the
commune authorities.

During project implementation, CFPUAs have faced an unforeseen legal and institutional
problem. By performing business transactions for the implementation of the management plans,
in line with the Partnership agreements signed with all communes, by law CFPUAs have to pay
income tax and social insurance for people employed by them, regardless of whether they have
contracts and make earnings throughout the year. This was a serious constraint for them to
perform regularly because of the present legal status of associations as not for profit organization.
The national Federation of CFPUAs was assuming to play an instrumental role and take up
required actions towards a resolution of this problem, but this did not materialized. The CFPUAs
legally can perform business functions under e service contract with commune authorities, in line
with the intended role of the associations for managing the communal forests and pastures (CM
Decision of January 2008, article 285 ). This could solve the financial problem only if they have
regular annual contracts, which means payment of income tax and social insurance wouldn‘t be
much of a problem for them. However, the procurement law poses another legal barrier for them
to get contracts from commune authorities, as it requires from the user associations to comply
with the competitive bidding process for contracts valued higher than 4,000 euro/annually.



5
  CM Decision No.22, date 9 January, 2011, article 23: ―The forest users associations or the licensed entity
shall be selected by the corresponding local government unit in compliance with the law on public
procurement. The service contract shall include timber collection, forest secondary outputs and medicinal
herbs collection, ...‖

                                                    51
Knowing that associations are at their early stage of development private companies can compete
successfully user associations in offering the same services. Therefore, this issue will require a
particular attention, when preparing the follow-on project.

Here there are some contradictions that lie between the government decision and the existing
forest law, with regard to the business activities of the user associations, which is foreseen to be
addressed in the new Forest law.

It should be pointed out here that the future role of the CFPUAs should be seen also in the context
of the potential privatization of the communal forests and pastures land to individual families
according to traditional boundaries. During the project implementation it was observed that either
families or villages were taking back the forests land based on their traditional boundaries. In the
face of this situation the commune authorities have agreed to give these assets to either of them
on possession, without any formal procedures or legal arrangements. This is not a full-fledged
privatization, but it gives them the right only to use as such, without changing their destination, to
the benefit of the communities and of the commune. It could be expected that this pattern of
management of forest land will dominate in the future, which could affect the role of the said
associations in the future.

b) Training of Directorate of Forests and Pastures (DFP) and District Forest Service (DFS)
in participatory provision of extension advice - The SNV has provided training for 20
professional forest extension staff of the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Water
Administration, staff from selected District Forest Services and a representative from the Faculty
of Forestry on basic extension services, so as they will be able to provide extension service and
train others as well. Additionally, other 43 DFS staff from Lezha and Korca areas was trained by
the core trainers. It is expected that, by the project completion in November 2011, about 120
regional and district staff are trained, and 240 local government unit personnel will complete the
training program in the coming months.

The training program was based on the new principle of collaborative management of Communal
Forest instead of Conventional Forest Management where direct control is exercised by forest
officials. That said, strengthening the coordination and collaboration with the Agency of
Environment and Forests, as well as with the Faculty of Forestry and partnership with the
National Association of Forest and Pasture Users, and with the Extension Service of the Ministry
of Agriculture, is paramount to the success of the collaborative management principle.

However, it should be noted that the project and the Needs Assessment Report targeted a larger
group of professionals to be trained. 6 Training of the larger group of professionals should
continue for building the needed capacities, and therefore this activity should be reviewed in the
framework of the training program in the follow-on project.

Equally important is the recommendation given by the participants for formation of a separate
extension structure in charge of extension service provision to Communes and communities. The
first step has been taken, by creating the extension service unit for public forests and communal



6
  The Needs Assessment Report recommended 160 staff of the Ministry to undertake extension skills training (100
field staff and 60 Regional Extension Specialists) as well as 150 forestry staff of the Communes to address knowledge
gaps in the Local Government Units.




                                                        52
forests, within the forest and pastures directorate of the MOEFWA. Other expected steps,
envisaged by this directorate, are to extend this service at regional level, and further down to the
commune. Forest technicians would provide forest extension service to the communes and Forest
and Pasture Users Associations, by being stationed in Communes.

One of the key conclusions of the training program was that the financing for the protection and
management of communal forest and pasture areas transferred to local government linked to
necessary advisory services has to be provided by the State.

c) Implementing priority actions in the National Strategy for the Development of Forests
and Pasture sector - One of the key ingredients to sustain the management of communal forests
and pastures by the associations of the communities was the institutional reform through the
implementation of some key actions of the said strategy. The government was committed
politically to engage in the implementation of the strategy, which resulted in the decentralization
of the management of forests and pastures to the communes through transferring the ownership
rights in 2008. This was a big legal step in response to the request of the communes to become
owners of these valuable economic assets. Another action, aiming the separation of the
management functions of State forests from the control and advisory functions for all forests
including the State forests, was the establishment of the Department of Forest Control and
Inspection within the Directorate of Environmental Control at the MoEFWA. However, other key
actions intended under the project such as: a) provision of forest and pasture extension service
down to the qark and commune levels, b) creation of inspection and control service as a separate
service to control State and Communal and Private forests, carried out by the forest police, and c)
separate state forest management service from control service, were not implemented during the
project life span. This has created a situation, where the stakeholders operating at local level
(DFS, Regional Coordinators, commune authorities, and commune associations) were left
without defined new roles, rules and competencies in how to managing the communal forests and
pastures. The new Forest and Pasture Law will address the above required institutional changes
and define the responsibilities of the regional directorates, district offices, communes, private on
the management of forests and pastures.

During the project implementation, the MOEFWA (forest directorate) collaborated with the
Ministry of Interior (Agency of inventory and transferring of immovable property-AITIP) for the
process of transferring the forests and pastures to commune authorities. NRDP has supported the
AITIP with computers and training for the process facilitation.

         Component B: Improved Management and Governance of Watersheds
The objectives of this component were introducing integrated resource management in micro-
catchment (MCs) areas, and strengthening governance for watershed management. The PAD
target to prepare and approve MC plans for 30 communes has been achieved. In addition, small-
scale investments for the implementation of the planned activities under Component B have been
fully completed in 14 communes and will be completed for the remaining 16 communes by June
2011. These investments were directed towards: a) rehabilitation of communal forests; b)
rehabilitation of agricultural land; and c) sustainable use of agricultural land and livestock
production so as to reduce the need to cultivate or graze on marginal and erosion prone areas.

Strengthening governance for watershed management - Additionally, under the SNV training
contract, some 62,000 commune members (i.e., leaders and participants) have been trained in the
Management Planning approaches. This activity was placed in a high priority after the
government decision to transfer forests and pastures under the ownership of the commune
authorities. Building management capacities for sustainability of the local government units


                                                53
became a new major aim of the project, but the remaining time of the implementation did not
allow for following on this aim as needed.

The activities envisaged under the PAD, aiming to make the Land Administration and Protection
Office (LAP) of the MOAFCP e key player to achieving sustainable watershed management such
as to: (a) assess the capacity and the role of LAPs in relation to project areas, specifically with
respect to documentation of user rights and preparation of management plans, (b) develop a
synopsis of the different institutional arrangements for land, natural resources and environmental
management; (c) assess the relationship between the Immovable Property Registration System,
forests and pastures registers, and LAPs offices, (d) build awareness among staff of the regional
and communal level LAPs of the MC planning approach; and (e) identify duties of regional and
communal level LAPs, establishing links with the regional and district forest services, did not
materialize. The only cooperation with agricultural/land offices was the involvement of their
specialists in the preparation of the MC plans.

        Component C: Management and Monitoring

Public awareness strategy - A Public Awareness Program and Action Plan was prepared under
the project in compliance with forestry sector strategy to disseminate the best practice of the land
management in upland prone to erosion. The PA program has been uploaded in the website of the
project, but to be fully complete two actions are expected to take place until project completion,
around November 2011.

Monitoring and evaluation system - A computerized monitoring and evaluation system was
developed under the project. The indicators and target values for results monitoring were aligned
with Project design. Four types of baseline indicators were intended to have been established at
the early stage of the project implementation, which included: a) the beneficiaries‘ satisfaction
(baseline survey) 7 ; b) data to monitor economic impact of the project; c) data to monitor
biophysical changes in forest cover (by using the National Forest Inventory); and d) data to
monitor other project indicators. This activity did not go well as expected, and the M&E program
suffered serious delays in establishing the system, and conducting the planed surveys.

Having said that, monitoring and evaluation system of the PMT failed to provide the required
information on the expected improvement of the management of forests and pastures, and how
the earnings increased mitigated the rural poverty in the targeted project areas.
The data entry in the system was delayed until late 2010, due to the delays of training and
inability to remedy on time the technical problems with the software. The expectation is that by
November 2011, when the project will be completed, all data entry will be finalized and updated.

Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development - A major social impact of the
project was that farmers had their voice in the preparation of the CFPMPs and MC plans through
their community associations. Equally important was their participation in the implementation of
these plans. Some 2,213 villages in the participating 239 communes have participated in the
Project and, more than 9,000 villagers (of which 25% were women) have benefited from CFPM,
MC and CS employment opportunities.

 The survey would serve the purpose for monitoring the villagers‘ perception of the project and not for
monitoring all the actual achievements in implementing project activities

                                                    54
The project offered temporary employment through labor intensive small scale investment
projects. As a result the earnings of the farmers, who participated in the execution of these
projects, increased. In average, annual household income increased around 10% in under
Component A Improved Management and Governance of Forests and Pastures, and around 56%
under Component B Improved Management and Governance of Watersheds the project.
Furthermore, the regeneration of forests, and creation of new farmer based fruit tress plantations
are reducing the risk of erosion, and creating potential for income generations in the mid-term.

    II.    Evaluation of the Bank and Borrower Performance

      a) Evaluation of the Bank

Project-financed investments were highly relevant for the sector in Albania and have leveraged
resources from other donors such as SIDA. Bank team made notable efforts and was highly
committed to a successful outcome of this project working jointly with government counterparts
to find alternative ways to improve project implementation. The Bank Country Unit supported
intensive project supervision, particularly given the very complex profile nature of the operation
and its sector wide importance. The Bank team worked in close collaboration with SIDA, which
role was very important to the success of the project implementation.

      b)   Evaluation of the government performance

(i) Central and local government

The Government worked closely with the Bank team during preparation of the Project and
demonstrated its engagement in the sector reforms through transferring the ownership rights of
Forests and pastures to all 330 communes, and exempting communes by paying registration fee
of the forests and pastures to the Immovable Property Registration Office. It established the
required bodies comprising representatives from the line Ministries and local governments with
responsibility for supervising the project implementation such as, a) the Project Implementation
Oversight Committee (POIC)8, and b) the Project Technical Committee (PTC), located within
MOEFWA.

However, the government did not do enough to support timely implementation of all aspects of
the sector reform, and therefore to resolve some of the regulatory and governance issues on a
policy level that hindered implementation progress (extensive service, regional coordinators,
division of control from management functions). These reforms were delayed probably due to the
resistance of the bureaucracy towards change, and not enough political will.

The POIC convened not regularly and meetings were not always well attended. Its performance
was characterized by various shortcomings such as delayed in starting their functioning, and slow
response times to the institutional change reform requirements. As to the PTC, it was inactive in
its role, which hampered the technical capacity of the PMT during the project implementation.
Forest department did not manage to coordinate activities, get feedback and exchange
information with other departments in the Ministry itself, let alone agriculture.




8
 POIC was chaired by the Minister of the MOEFWA, and includes representatives from the MOAFCP,
MOI, National Federation of Forest and Pasture User Associations and Non-governmental associations

                                                 55
At local level, the role of the Regional coordinators (consultants) and of the DFS Local Focal
Points in the project management has not been the same in all targeted areas. Changes of the
regional coordinators, delays in filling their vacant positions and changes of the status from
consultants to DFS staff have hampered the timely implementation of project activities.

The involvement of communes during implementation was quite encouraging, given that the
process of transferring the ownership rights of F&P to communes took some time to take place.
Communes‘ performance was rewarding.

(ii) Project Management Team

PMT was established and up and running since the beginning of the project implementation. It
was staffed with qualified professionals and gave its utmost to achieve project objectives in a
changing situation. The PMT has demonstrated a high degree of dedication and commitment and
instrumented realistic solutions to overcome the increased complex workload due to the rapid
transfer of the ownership rights of forests and pastures to the commune authorities by the
government. However, changes of the PMT staff and of the regional coordinators and delays in
filling the vacant positions affected its performance and deliverables. Under these circumstances,
the implementing agency performance has fluctuated over the recent years.

Evaluation of other partners’ performance

Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) has provided a valuable
contribution to the project implementation. The agency was involved regularly as an active donor
in various challenging times and has been consistently part of the joint dialogue with the
government main actors.

Dutch government has supported the capacity building of the local structures through training
programs by co-financing some contracts via SNV. SNV has played an important role in building
capacities through training programs, and drawing lessons that should be taken into account for
the capacity building at the local level in the future project.

III.    Lessons learned

(a)      The overall development objective - The project development objective to establish or
maintain sustainable natural resource management in upland and mountainous erosion-prone
lands appeared to be ambitious, and therefore its fully achievement under the NRDP should be
challenged. First, the intention to achieve this big objective in a territory of about 50% of the
forests and pastures of the country that belong to around 75% of the communes in about 5 year
period appeared to be not realistic. Second, this objective was based on the reforming of the
sector, which was assumed to start at the same time with the project implementation, and in fact it
was materialized with the transfer of the ownership rights of the forests and pastures when the
project was half way through. The experience in the country has shown that sector reforming
process takes more time than the life span of a project. Third, this change in ownership brought
immediately on the table as a major aim of the project building management capacities and
governance for sustainable utilization of these natural resources at the local level. The remaining
time of the project implementation was very limited to allow for actions to be taken towards this
new aim.      Fourth, the government transferred to the communes, forests that were badly
degraded, and therefore the expected benefits were seen from the communes and farmers as far-
away.



                                                56
However, the project did create a solid ground for the sustainability of the natural resources
management, which could have been a more realistic objective, because: a) ownership rights of
forests and pastures are transferred by the government to the communes, b) communities and
their associations are equipped with management plans, as important tools for the proper
management of the natural resources, c) communities and their associations have received
training, which contributed to start building some capacities; and d) communities and their
associations are put rightly at the center of the implementation as the most interested and suitable
actors to achieve and sustain natural resource management in upland and mountainous erosion-
prone lands.

(b)     Project design – The components of the project and their respective activities were
rightly defined to address the key country‘s sector issues and that would lead towards the
sustainable management and utilization of the natural resources.

As to the institutional arrangements, the successful implementation of the project relied also in
the assumed effectiveness and capacities of each key actor responsible in a very complex and
large institutional structure (31 FDS, and about 240 commune‘s authorities and their respective
associations at the local level). This assumption proved to be over optimistic under the
circumstances, because their performance and deliverables were affected by: a) the changes of the
people in charge of the project coordination and delays in their replacements, b) delays in the
implementation of the institutional reform. The transfer of the forests and pastures to communes
was not associated with expected institutional changes (extensive service, transfer of the
specialists from the DFS to the regions to serve communes, defining new roles and
responsibilities), c) lack of engagement of the POIC and PTC, and d) uneven capacity level
amongst DFS, commune‘s authorities, and communities‘ associations.

The project implementation has been ―mainstreamed‖ to the MOEFWA. The degree of
―mainstreaming‖ was not fully. The Project Director was full time Director of the Forest and
Pasture Directorate, and part time engaged in the NRDP. While the staff of PMT was hired as full
time employee of the PMT, which was responsible only for the project implementation Besides
the Project Director, the rest of the PMT staff was not a civil servant. The experience of this
model showed a number of advantages, such as: a) stronger ownership in the MOEFWA, b) the
Forest and Pasture Directorate staff and PMT staff increased their capacities in handling this
project by facing key challenges, and c) created an asset which could take over a new project and
handling it in a more efficient manner. However, one of big disadvantages that were noticed
during the project implementation was the time constraints on the part of the Project Director.
The later had its primary responsibilities within the government, rather than implementing the
NRDP. This left him little time to follow up with project activities. This time constraint, coupled
with the workload and complexity of the World Bank funded project, have made him less
efficient than expected. Unlike the previous situation, after October 2010, the Project Manager is
designated by the Minister as full time working on NRDP. The strengthening of the leadership of
the PMT, created the possibility for the Director of Forests and Pastures, to be able to follow on
key tasks of this project within the reasonable time available for him.

Under this model of ―mainstreaming‖ the two key functions of the PMT, procurement and
financial management faced serious capacity constraints in the face of hundreds of small
procurement processes (up to 1,000 small contracts) and contract management, and payments.
Reviewing of the procurement plans of the 240 communes and managing hundreds of contracts
was very time consuming, and beyond the capacity of the limited staff of the PMT.

(c)     Sustainability of the project outcome - There is a substantial risk that development
objectives achieved under the project may not be maintained in a short term. We refer to a period

                                                57
of 5-10 years or 10-15 years, where the transferred forest would start generating the required
revenues to sustain the management of natural resources dependable on the conditions of each
commune9. The first risk relates to the participating communes that would be unable to generate
sufficient revenues to finance activities under the management plans over a short period, unless
the government steps in with financing of the extensive services for the communes, and other
needed services. It should be noted however, that communes have the authority to apply fees on
fuel wood, grazing, medicinal plants, which potentially constitute a source of revenue to finance
the management of F&P. Although these sources may not be sufficient at this stage, communes
should plan ahead what and how much revenues could be generated by the transferred assets in
the coming years. The second risk, relates to the fact that physical investments made through the
project and the associated improvements attained would not be sustained due to inadequate
resources for proper operations and maintenance of forests and pastures, The third risk relates to
lack of the required capacity to manage the new economic assets by the new owners, and lack of
proper governance of the institutions. Completion of the transfer of forests and pastures to
communes requires strong political and financial support by central government and local
government ownership and commitment, and adherence to the principles of good governance as a
basis for maintaining the achieved results. The transfer of the ownership rights of forests and
pastures to the commune authorities was a big movement towards the sustainable management of
these resources, but this action standing alone did not yield much of the expected improvements.
Therefore, the sequencing of the reform with key institutional measures is very critical in the
future. The fourth, equally important is to attain the financial sustainability of the management of
forests and pastures, which under this project appeared to be a premature objective. By some
estimate, the commercial harvesting of such degraded communal forests will start in a not less
than a 10 year period. Not less important are other risks such as: a) delays in registration of
forest and pasture lands by communes; and b) lack of arrangements between the new owners and
traditional users.

(d)      Targeted areas – The project targeted about 75% of all communes or around 750,000 ha,
with small funding sources. Having said that, the funding sources under the project were spread
thinly amongst communes for small investment projects, and effects on the ground were marginal.
On the other hand, the cost of human resource for the supervision was relatively high. A number
of local consultants were hired to assist the project implementation. Targeting of 75% of the
communes of the country was explained by the need to create e good basis for these communes
for proper management of the natural resources, and also, to create good models that could be
replicated in the future. A big question here is that, should the follow-on project continue to
scaling up and include the remaining of the communes, or include the abandoned lands in the
existing commune? This depends on the objectives that will be set for the new project, but if this
approach would persist it would be unmanageable for the new project to handle a bigger number
of the communes and limited resources available would overstretch even more.

(e)      Demand driven vs. top down approach - The NRDP applied a top down approach, i.e.
the names of 218 communes that would be supported by the Project, were designated since the
appraisal of the project. However, the willingness of the selected communes to participate in the
project was a strong indication of the participatory character of the selection process. Another
indication of the support to the project objectives was the lobbying of communes and CFPUAs to


9
 Perhaps 5-10 years would be more realistic for more advanced communes like Ulza, Kala e Dodes and
other communes.




                                                 58
have forests and pastures under the commune ownership. All the ground work and lobbying
pushed through the final decision that was taken by the Prime Minister. Final COM decision only
formalized what was agreed since 1996 with most of the communes

The new project should make a step forward and apply the demand driven approach, i.e. selection
of the communes based on their willingness and commitment towards the project requirements
and objectives. The experience of other projects, tells us that this approach has been quite
beneficial to build up ownership at the local level and create the foundation for the recipient to
participate actively in the project. A key question here is whether the criteria for the competitive
selection of communes should be relaxed to open the floor for many communes, or be more
demanding, so as the communes that have capacities and showed progress are more likely to win.

(f)     The cost sharing scheme of the small investment projects – This approach proved to
be effective, as it raised the responsibilities of the locals and their responsiveness to the plans‘
implementation. This positive experience should be used for the next project, like in-kind
community contributions, the commune‘s contribution in cash to the cost of the investments
should be considered in the future.

(g)      Central vs. local project management – The responsibilities in the project supervision
were shared amongst four institutional levels: 1) supervisory committees, 2) project management
team, 3) regional coordinators and DFS, and 4) commune authorities and community associations.
The institutions at the central level were responsible for setting guidelines, rules, policies, and
assist for capacity building through training programs, and pushing for the institutional reform,
while at the local level, institutions were responsible for execution of the activities planned in the
management plans. This power sharing resulted to be acceptable and workable. With the
decentralization of the management of communal forests and pastures the role of the local
stakeholders should get more weight in the follow-on project.

(h)      Project monitoring indicators – Changes of the outcome indicators and results
indicators at the MTR stage of the project implementation was a right decision as it improved the
measurement of the project achievements against the development objectives. The changed
indicators became more realistic as well. This will help to better define the project indicators in
the follow-on project.

MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FORESTRY AND WATER ADMINISTRATION

To:    Mrs. Kseniya Lvovsky
       Country Manager
       World Bank Office in Albania

Re: About the Report on the Implementation and Outcomes of (IDA – 40740 TF – 54995
TF – 54926(
Dear Mrs. Kseniya,

The report provides a detailed and concise description of the outcomes of the Natural
Resources Development Project, which is very important in terms of the development of
communal forestry and poverty eradication. These outcomes were achieved thanks to the
World Bank team of experts, who monitored the project. This project is an integral part
of the agenda of the strategic commitment to support the growth of Albania, its
governance, decentralization and poverty alleviation.

Project development goal: - we hereby ascertain that building or sustainable use and
management of community based natural resources has been satisfactorily fulfilled.
This has led to the land degradation reduction, waters enhanced management,
biodiversity protection and strengthening of public management sector of these resources.

The global environmental goal re: prevention of extreme land degradation of high and
mountainous areas, which are exposed to land erosion, and to the prevention of sediments
flow towards Adriatic Sea by means of the rehabilitation and sustainable management of
natural resources, including global biodiversity, was ensured in a satisfactory manner.
Therefore,
     1. The local communities have managed a forestry and pastures inventory of
         775,511 hectares, or 117% of the plan, in compliance with the natural resources
         management plans.
     2. The economic benefit at commune and village level due to the use of the natural
         resources management plans constitutes 10% of the household incomes,
         estimated to be equivalent to about 2,800 USD (8% increase of household
         incomes in the communities where the forest and pasture management plans
         were applied and 28% increase in the communities where the micro-basin plans
         were applied). The instruments to collect taxes concerning reinvestments in the
         forestry sector were not established, but erosion was reduced to approximately
         223,000 tons or 115% of the projected quantity.
     3. The estimated amount of sequestered CO2 from 2004 through 2010 was about
         69,759,000 tons or about 45% of the revised plan. Investment concerning carbon
         sequestration was carried out in 5427 hectares or in about 46% of the revised
         plan.
     4. The process of forests registration was the weakest point of the project, because
         this item was accomplished only 2% of the planning.

                                           63
     5. The number of communes, which have benefitted management plans in the
        frame of transfer, is 251 or 115% of the plan.

Component A, which had to do with the improvement of communal forests and pastures
management, was accomplished through the enhancement of the communal forests
participatory management by means of (1) stabilizing the degraded terrains through
building mountain levees and reforestation; (2) rehabilitation of resources by means of
controlling grazing, (3) utilization of natural resources through pre-commercial and
silvicultural cutting.
Other important aspects of this component included forest management based on small
size investments, training of forestry extension service structures and the communal ones
in addition to awareness increase for those stakeholders interested in forests.

Carbon sequestration and enforcement of clean development mechanisms was a
innovation for Albania towards strengthening of the payment instruments for services in
the ecosystem.
Component B – Microbasins management and governance enhancement was also an
innovation, which was focused on economic benefits by means of preservation and
improvement, therefore including 125,000 persons in this process.
IRC has been prepared in compliance with the periodical analysis and ICR, but also
based on the analyses, which have been regularly carried out.
A number of lessons, as hereunder describe, come out of the report and these lessons will
make the project more successful in the future:

   1. Implementation of a less complicated and more focused monitoring and
      evaluation system is crucial, while environmental auditing should be based on
      standard practices;
   2. Application of GIS system re: planning and drafting of maps is an important
      element, which should be developed also in the frame of registration;
   3. Clarification of the rights of use is a key element in terms of ensuring project
      sustainability, which should be a crucial goal for the future;
   4. Replication of the project to about 50% of the communes or, to 75% of the
      territory establishes precedents for a low effectiveness of investments, but also an
      extensive distribution of incomes to poor people.
   5. Involvement of local stakeholders is defined as a decisive key element of
      achieving success.

I consider the report as very positive and its is report, which describes in real and
accurate terms the most positive aspects, as well as, the weaknesses that were observed
and these will help the respective staff to draft a valid project proposal for the
development of Albanian forestry.
