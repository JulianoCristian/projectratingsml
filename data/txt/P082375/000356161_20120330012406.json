for the Natural Resources\n            Development Project for Albania were as follows: outcomes\n            were satisfactory; Global Environment Objective (GEO)\n            outcome were satisfactory; risk to development outcome was\n            substantial; risk to GEO outcome was substantial; Bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory and borrower\n            performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned includes: natural resource management projects are\n            most difficult to monitor and, to be effective; any system\n            needs to be as simple and easily used by non-Information\n            Systems (IT) specialists as possible. In a project like\n            this, by which the management plan is such an important part\n            of project implementation, standardized digital mapping is\n            essential in this day and age of Geographic Information\n            Systems (GIS). The mandated annual environmental audit\n            report did have well defined and clear terms of reference.\n            Local stakeholder involvement was necessary for receiving\n            feedback on local site conditions and other commune-specific issues."}, "docdt": "2012-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
