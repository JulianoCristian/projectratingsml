Forests cover\n            more than 50 percent of Albania\u2019s surface area. Following\n            roughly two decades of transition, illegal logging, and\n            overgrazing of forests and pasture lands, Albanians living\n            in rural areas started to become conscious of the damaging\n            effects these practices were having on the environment.\n            Participatory planning and management of forest and pasture\n            lands was piloted in 30 communes during the implementation\n            of the Albanian Forestry Project financed by the World Bank\n            in 1996. Given its positive outcome and wide community\n            support, the approach was extended under the National\n            Resource Development Project in more than 200 communes. This\n            experience led to the decision of the government of Albania\n            in June 2008 to formalize forest land rights transfers to\n            345 communes, resources which are used by almost one million\n            people. The project had addressed the issues of soil\n            degradation and improved watersheds. More sustainable,\n            community-based natural resource management in Albania will\n            lead to enhanced productivity, incomes, and, overall,\n            improvements in land and water resources for the public\n            sector. The investments have helped to support increases in\n            income earned from forest and agricultural activities in\n            communal areas and a significant reduction in erosion, and\n            Albania is one of the first countries to sequester carbon on\n            eroded lands through the BioCarbon Fund."}, "docdt": "2010-06-14T08:40:04Z"}
