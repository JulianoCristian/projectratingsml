1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      Irrigated agriculture is the backbone of Pakistan’s economy: Eighty percent of arable
lands and 90% of agricultural output (22% of GDP) are entirely dependent on irrigation. The
Indus Basin Irrigation System (IBIS) is the largest integrated irrigation network in the world,
consisting of Indus River and its tributaries, three major storage reservoirs, 19 barrages, 12 inter-
river link canals, 43 irrigation canal commands, and over 110,000 WCs, delivering water to
farms. Water is diverted from the rivers by barrages or head-works into the main canals,
secondary canals, and Watercourses (WCs). Each farm receives the full flow of the WC by turn
for duration depending on the farm size. Practically the entire system is unlined, resulting in
seepage and operational losses. The losses are particularly high from WCs. In saline groundwater
areas these losses are generally irretrievable. Annually, the irrigation system draws an average of
104 Million Acre Feet (MAF)/128.4 Billion Cubic Meters (BCM) of surface water,
supplemented by 50 MAF (62 BCM) of pumped groundwater, much of which is by way of
recovery of losses due to seepage in fresh groundwater zone.
2.      Poverty is pervasive and deep in rural Sindh and reforms to improve public service
delivery and stimulate rural growth were found to be fundamental for reducing poverty. Rural
households, including the landless, derive 56% of their income from agriculture, directly or
indirectly. A typical poor household in rural Sindh has few assets and small land holdings, thus
depends largely on income earned, as agricultural wage worker. The concentration of the poor is
the highest among categories of households where the head is an unpaid family worker,
sharecropper, or owner-cultivator owning less than 2 hectares of land. Rural Sindh is highly
dependent on public services with little role played by the private sector. Reforms to improve
public service delivery and stimulate rural growth, that raise agricultural and nonagricultural
wages are therefore fundamental for reducing poverty in rural Sindh.
3.      Major irrigation and drainage issues faced by Sindh were attributed to underlying
institutional weaknesses. The major institutional issues were found to be the near exclusive
control of the irrigation & drainage system by the public sector, characterized by the usual
inefficiencies of centralized bureaucracies, lack of corporate skills, poor client (farmer) focus and
accountability. According to the PAD, institutional weaknesses are manifested in the form of:
(i) low WC conveyance efficiency (35-40% from the canal head to crop root zone); (ii) water
distribution inequities; (iii) wasteful on-farm water use; (iv)waterlogging and salinity; and
(v) poor O&M and low cost recovery.
4.      Other factors that are reported to have ramifications on the operation of the irrigated
agriculture include: (i) lack of access to credit; (ii) skewed land ownership and unfavorable land
tenure arrangements; (iii) low social capital; and (iv) disadvantaged status of women.




                                                 1
1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

5.     The Sindh On-Farm Water Management (SOFWM) project’s PDO was “to enable
farmers to better manage irrigation water and increase agricultural productivity.”
6.        The five key outcome/impact indicators identified in the PAD (p.2) are:
     i.   Improved O&M and water distribution in distributary canals managed by FOs – i.e.
          improved reliability, and equity of irrigation water distribution;
  ii.     Improved water conveyance efficiency in improved WCs;
 iii.     Increased cropping intensity;
 iv.      Increased crop yields; and
  v.      Reduced use of pesticides.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

7.        No revision was made to the PDO.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

8.      The project beneficiaries (estimated over 1.2 million people from 178,000 households)
were all segments of the farming community, particularly the poor. The Project
Implementation Framework included prioritization criteria to help target poor farmers and
promote participation and inclusion of women and tenants in project-supported investment
activities. Rural laborers were additional beneficiaries of increased opportunities for rural
employment, the project was expected to generate.
9.       In addition, a number of institutions were targeted as beneficiaries. The project
planned to provide training and capacity building to FOs and WCAs that was expected to
include: financial management (book keeping and accounting), crop assessment and collection of
abiana (water charges), business planning, O&M, water measurement and management,
productivity enhancement, communication and dispute resolution, etc. The Director General of
Agricultural Engineering and Water Management (DGAEWM), the Director General of
Agriculture Extension (DGAE), the Sindh Irrigation and Power Department (SIPD); Sindh
Irrigation and Drainage Authority (SIDA) and the associated Area Water Board (AWBs) were
also targeted as beneficiaries of the capacity improvement support.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

10.       The project had four components.
11.    Component 1: Social Mobilization and Capacity Building (US$4.45 million or 7.3% of
Bank financing): The aim of this component was to develop sustainable FOs that can effectively
operate and maintain the irrigation and drainage system. Under this component, the activities


                                                 2
planned to be supported as part of carrying out a social mobilization and support program are: (i)
establish new WCAs and FOs; (ii) educate and inform WCAs and FOs about the benefits of
physical improvements and productivity enhancement activities planned under the Project; (iii)
build the capacity of WCAs and FOs to access resources for and carryout such improvements,
and to participate in such activities; and (iv) build the capacity of DGAEWM, DGAE, SIDA and
AWBs to assist WCAs and FOs in their endeavors. This component contributes directly to
building farmers’ capacity to manage their irrigation systems, improve farm productivity, and
develop self-sustaining WCAs and FOs.
12.     Component 2 - High Payoff Improvement of Irrigation Facilities (US$49.8 million or
81.5% of Bank financing): This component was aimed at addressing the infrastructure
weaknesses observed in the irrigation and drainage system. The component had three major
subcomponents: (i) WCs Improvement - US$37.69 million; (ii) Distributary and Minor Canals
Improvement - US$8.47 million; and (iii) Branch Canals Improvement - US$3.46 million. This
was the main component of the project, accounting for 81.5% of total cost. By reducing water
loses, this component was expected to improve efficiency, reliability, and equity of irrigation
water.
13.     Component 3: Productivity Enhancement program (US$2 million or 3.3% of Bank
financing): The aim of this component was to provide a full range of improved water
management and irrigation agronomic practices through demonstration centers and pilots.
Activities to be financed included land leveling, improved water management, integrated pest
management and promotion of integrated soil nutrient management practices and establishment
of an information kiosk.
14.     Component 4: M&E system and establishment of a spatial GIS database (US$1.62
million or 2.6% of Bank financing). The aim was to establish an M&E system that would
provide continuous feedback to the implementing agencies on project performance and enable
them to assess its physical, agricultural, social, financial/fiscal, environmental and economic
impacts, so that corrective actions could be undertaken in a timely manner. This component was
not included as a component in the DCA.
15.    Component 5: Project Management Support (US$3.27 million or 5.3% of Bank
Financing). This component was planned to finance the administrative, technical and financial
management support provided by the office of DGAEWM, SIDA, the Project Coordination Unit
(PCU), the internal audit teams, and the consultants assisting with implementation. These
consultants were expected to provide support for, inter alia, project launch, supervision (quality
assurance), mid-term review, development of a project management information system,
productivity enhancement, and training & capacity building program for project staff, FOs, and
WCAs.

1.6 Revised Components

16.    The Project components were not revised. However, as part of Additional Financing
(AF) in 2009 and Level II restructuring in 2012, changes were made to the scope of some project
components. These changes, as described below, were basically aimed to scale-up the gains
made by the project and thus the results target.

1.7 Other significant changes

17.     An important change in implementation arrangements, made one year after project
startup in April 2006, entailed aligning the project’s WC sub-component with the National
Program for Improvement of WCs (NPIW). It was meant to prevent competition for staff and
other resources, and to simplify coordination by implementing one program. This first change
also entailed extension of the closing date by one year to December 31, 2009.
18.    An Additional Finance for US$50 million equivalent was approved by the Bank in
June 2009 (with the Financing Agreement dated September 15, 2009). The AF was expected to
focus primarily on WC improvement. The WC improvement component accounted for 96.8% of
the AF proceeds (or US$48.4 million). Productivity enhancement activities received US$0.9
million and project management was allocated US$0.7 million from the AF proceeds. The AF
was rationalized on the basis of the development impact the project showed; the large unmet
demand for WC improvement; enhanced Government commitment; and the ease of scaling-up
the successful experiences realized under the project. In addition, more than 90% of the credit
proceed was disbursed by the time the request for an AF was made. The additional financing was
envisaged to contribute to improve 3,000 WCs and about 30,000 ha was expected to be levelled
using “laser guided” Precision Land Leveling (PLL). The AF also extended the closing date to
July 31, 2012.
19.      The Level II Restructuring Paper (RP) dated July 25, 2012 made the following
changes: (i) reduced both the scope and the amount of financing from AF proceeds; (ii) added a
new activity, the provision of water storage tanks to farmers at the tail end of WCs;
(iii) reallocated AF credit proceeds among disbursement categories; (iv) extended the closing
date by 18 months, from July 31, 2012 to January 31, 2014; and (v) revised the AF performance
monitoring indicators in the context of the changed scope of the AF activities and the extended
closing date. The cancelation resulted from the delay in implementing the AF activities caused
by factors that were characterized by the Restructuring Paper as “clearly external to the operation
and outside the borrower’s or the implementing agency’s control.” The main factor was the
occurrence of “floods of historically unusual magnitude during 2010 and 2011” that impeded
project implementation. It was also justified by the need to compensate for the delay that resulted
from “a court dispute in selection of project implementation support consultants (ISC). Project




                                                4
implementation was stalled for a total of 14 months, including the period of recruitment of
consultants, at the onset of Credit effectiveness.” 1

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

20.      The project was aligned both with the Bank’s and the Government’s strategy. In fact
the project was specifically identified in the CAS (discussed by the Board on June 24, 2002). The
Government of Sindh interim strategy had three inter-related elements: (i) fostering an
institutional, policy and operational framework conducive to efficient and self-sustaining O&M
of the irrigation system; (ii) supporting WCAs in implementing high payoff infrastructure
improvements needed for improved water management, particularly at the WC level; and
(iii) enhancing agricultural productivity and incomes by introducing improved technology,
agronomic practices, and knowledge systems.
21.     The project was well anchored on lessons learned from the Bank’s past involvement in
irrigation and drainage projects. Key lessons incorporated included the need for: (i) farmers’
participation for long-term sustainability of irrigation system; (ii) investment in making irrigation
infrastructure functional to enable FOs and WCAs to perform well; (iii) support to productivity
enhancement measures to increase the benefits of improved water management; and (iv) making
simpler arrangements that permit an implementing agency to discharge its responsibilities. The
design also reviewed 20 years of project experiences in Pakistan, including an economic
evaluation of on-farm and canal rehabilitation investments. Project ICRs, OED audits, and
impact evaluation reports also informed project design and concept development. For the Bank,
it was a natural continuation of its support to Pakistan’s irrigation subsector.
22.    The design included the creation of a forum for stakeholders’ participation. During
preparation, extensive consultations with NGOs, civil society organizations, men and women
sharecroppers, Government officials and other stakeholders and intended beneficiaries were
carried out. The consultations and stakeholders participation included field investigations,
discussions with focus groups and key informants, household surveys, and village profiles. These
provided the basis on which the Environment Management Plan (EMP) was prepared.
23.     The design was selective and opted to not introduce complex new technologies. The
project did not set out to address all problems facing the irrigation subsector in Sindh. During
appraisal for instance, the skewed nature of the landholdings was found to have made many large
holdings unproductive because a considerable portion of land is left fallow. This is particularly
the case with absentee landlords. While this compromises the overall aim of enhancing
agricultural production, the project rightly avoided this problem which has remained intractable
since the country’s independence. The limited geographic scope of the project also served to

    Restructuring Paper. July 25, 2012. p. 5.

                                                 5
make implementation manageable. The project design relied on appropriate technologies that
could be easily transferred to farmers with the right training. Where new technologies were
introduced, they were accompanied by training, demonstration of improved water management
and agronomic practices, and the establishment of information kiosks.
24.     The design of the project was therefore comprehensive and anchored on sectoral,
technical, and operational experiences and reflected emerging consensus on irrigation
management. The Project design was able to identify relevant risks and their appropriate
mitigation measures. Transfer of management of irrigation scheme to users was the emerging
best practice in improving irrigation system performance. Targeted support to poor farmers and
women was also part of the design.
25.    There was no formal review of Quality at Entry by the Bank. The project had no
outstanding issues or special conditions for effectiveness when it was approved indicating its
readiness for implementation.
26.     Implementation arrangement in the project design. The design opted for making a
simplified arrangement that permits an implementing agency to discharge its responsibilities
without cumbersome bureaucracy. Two agencies from the Sindh Department of Agriculture
(SDOA), DGAEWM and DGAE, as well as SIDA, were the main implementing agencies.
DGAEWM was the lead agency, wherein the PCU was located. The other three organizations,
AWBs, FOs and WCA were essentially beneficiary institutions with some implementation
responsibility. Project implementation arrangements included support by Project Implementation
Assistance Consultants (PIAC) to complement the role of DGAEWM. The Project design made
an effort to avoid past cumbersome implementation arrangements that required time consuming
coordination elements. However, this simplification may have underestimated the need for
coordination at the field level. In hindsight, better coordination at the field level, such as minimal
joint planning or systematic cross checking of activities, could have contributed to improved
quality of FOs.

2.2 Implementation

27.     The heavy rainfalls and floods of historically unusual magnitude that occurred in
Sindh during 2010 and 2011 had major impact in the project area. The slowly receding flood
waters further impeded implementation progress by another six months as many parts of the
project area were inundated. Sindh’s flat topography, location in the Indus River delta, and direct
proximity to the Arabian Sea slowed its drainage by the river, while the province’s limited and
poorly managed drainage infrastructure was unable to help resolve the issue. In addition to the
flooding, 14 months were lost following the AF as a result of a dispute over the selection of
project implementation support consultants (PISC). Altogether, some 20 months were essentially
lost owing to causes beyond the control of the implementing agency and the project stakeholders.
28.    Overall, all of the main activities of the project were completed in spite of the 20 month
delay but with some reduction in scope mainly to the revised target during AF. Overall, SIDA


                                                  6
was slow in executing social mobilization, registration and development of the FOs, and
improvement works of branch/distributaries/minor canals were also slow.
29.      The Mid-Term Review (MTR) although conducted late (June 2007) was instrumental
in making corrections and focus the project on activities that were progressing satisfactorily.
The MTR resulted in: (i) increased emphasis on the need to address inadequate coordination
between SIDA and PIAC; (ii) recommended the provision of more training to FOs; and
(iii) identified the need to resolve the low performance of PIAC. These recommendations
resulted in improving implementation pace and performance. However, because the PIAC were
mandated to support SIDA, and it had little leeway in enforcing measures that would induce
PIAC to improve their performance, this particular issue remained a coordination deficiency.
SIDA’s implementation process was further hampered by frequent changes in its leadership as it
had eight different MDs during this project implementation period. There was also cost overrun
of civil works (due to delays in works on canal systems that led to cost escalation) that was the
factor behind the recommendation made by the MTR to focus on distributaries/minor canals and
for reduced coverage of branch canals.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

30.     M&E design: The Department of Agriculture was assigned with responsibility for
establishing and operating the M&E system designed to provide continuous feedback to the
implementing agencies on project performance, assessing physical, agricultural, social, financial,
fiscal, environmental, and economic impacts. The detailed design of the M&E system was
deferred to three months after the project start. Baseline surveys were planned once the sub-
projects for distributary and minor canal rehabilitation and WC improvement were selected.
Each implementing agency was required to contribute to the M&E system. Impact evaluation
studies were planned and expected to focus on: (a) water use efficiency and equity of
distribution; (b) crop yields and intensity; (c) farm income and employment; and (d) performance
of FOs/WCAs.
31.       M&E implementation: As planned, a baseline survey was undertaken and an MIS
database was prepared. The evaluation processes followed three research methods: sample
survey, case study, and experimental design to cover socio-economic aspects, hydrological
dimensions and institutional reform process and capacity building of FOs/WCAs. A time series
survey was used to compare performance over time. Case studies of FOs and WCAs helped in
developing an understanding of the impacts the project was having, and the findings were used to
distill lessons learned in organization support. They were carried out on representative sample
populations and provided a great deal of information on sociological, agricultural, engineering,
and environmental dynamics. Quarterly reports accounted for 65% of all reports which the M&E
team produced. Overall, 49 reports were produced, including 32 quarterly reports, 4 case studies
on FOs and WCAs, an MTR, a Project Impact Assessment Report (PIAR) and a Project
Completion Report (PCR). The M&E system was improved during the course of implementation
and proved to be quite dynamic. For example, Bank supervision missions carried out during


                                                7
implementation recommended closer monitoring of involvement by women and small farmers,
and these recommendations were incorporated. The missions also recommended that the number
of distributaries and minor canals being studied be increased, as well as the number of
observations about delivery performance ratio (DPR). The increase in data collection of DPR
(three in each cropping season) provided a good picture about the equity of water distribution.
32.     M&E utilization: Regular reporting by the M&E team on the implementation progress
and elaboration of issues faced by the project have been useful project management tools for the
Government and the Bank to take action and reorient the project. Difficulties and delays that the
project faced in implementation were promptly identified and reported, and were instrumental in
inducing management to take remedial measures. In addition to the restructuring, a number of
remedial measures were undertaken, including: (i) identification of the need to compensate for
the environmental impact of the project that resulted in planting more trees; (ii) devising
programs in favor of women farmers; and (iii) improvement in drawing the attention of project
management to the slow moving capacity building process of FOs. This triggered a renewed
emphasis on improving their training program, including the introduction of refresher courses. At
the end of project implementation, the results of the M&E system were instrumental in assessing
the outcome.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

33.     The project triggered three safeguards: Environmental (OP4.01) Pest Management
(4.09) and Projects under International Waters (OP7.50) safeguards.
34.     Environment Safeguards: The Government of Sindh carried out an Integrated Social and
Environmental Assessment (ISEA) to assess the impact of the project. The ISEA outlined
mitigation measures and institutional and capacity building initiatives to address potentially
negative environmental impacts. An environmental focal person was nominated within SIDA to
ensure compliance with the ISEA. The project monitoring, supervision, compliance, and
reporting on the environmental parameters identified in the ISEA improved considerably as
monitoring of civil works intensified. The parameters being monitored included the number of
trees cut and replaced with new saplings, the number of clothing bays disturbed, silt disposal
adequacy, and the provision of adequate diversion channels. Compliance on these parameters
was tied to the release of financial disbursements and this led to increased compliance. A
compensatory tree plantation target was eventually exceeded and more than two trees were
planted for each tree cut. The replacement each cut tree by two trees planted have been
inadequate for survival rates of below 50%, however a list of species with high potential survival
rates was compiled and compensatory tree plantation was expanded to clusters to achieve
survival rate of 70%. Compliance on environmental monitoring parameters identified in the
ISEA is satisfactory.
35.     Pest Management: Compliance with IPM was monitored by the environmental focal
person within SIDA, who also monitored the implementation of ISEA. IPM was one of the
project activities, and farmers were trained on IPM through farmer field schools (FFS). The

                                                8
project conducted studies related to pesticide residues, and found that most of the soil samples
taken from areas where IPM was practiced were free of such residues. On the contrary, where
IPM was not introduced, a significant amount of pesticide residues were found in soils and crops.
The results of Pesticide Residue Studies were incorporated in a training plan developed as part of
IPM implementation and the target 2 of trainings was exceeded. 3
36.    International waters: While OP7.5 was triggered, however, according to the PAD (p.31),
“no external notification to other riparian was required.”
37.     Financial Management (FM): The project financial management system was
implemented in line with the agreed design, but it functioned slowly, largely due to low level
FM capacity including shortage of staff. SIDA planned to lead certain FM activities, but
experienced a number of issues, including the position of GM (Finance) remaining vacant for a
protracted period of time.
38.     Two Designated Accounts were operational – one under DGAEWM and the other by
SIDA. Improvements were made towards the end of the project in terms of timely delivery of
financial reports. Audited financial statements were submitted in adherence with the stipulated
timeline. The output based disbursement mechanism adopted for the AF Phase partially worked
well, because of an escalation of costs that required adjustments in unit rates to account for
losses and gains.
39.     Disbursement: Disbursements started slowly, reflecting the pace of project
implementation. By the end of the project, close to US$25 million was canceled from the two
credits. Table 2 summarizes disbursement from the two Credits.

40.     Among the factors that contributed to less than full utilization of the IDA Credits were
the following: (i) the loss in project implementation momentum following the 2010 floods and
2011 cyclone that practically brought to halt the infrastructure works; (ii) changes in farmers’
focus towards rehabilitation work of the infrastructure that sustained damage following the
natural phenomena; (iii) delays in resolving the issue of hiring of consultants for implementation
support of the AF; and (iv) the agreement to prepare a follow-up operation.

41.    Procurement: Procurement and contract management was generally slow with regard to
works on distributaries and minor/branch canals that were primarily SIDA’s responsibilities.
There were delays in payment mainly due to lack of strong input from the PIAC, which among
other things were expected to measure and certify the works done by all the contractors,
including the FOs. However, this was resolved after the restructuring, following which
procurement of works and other services preceded smoothly.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

42.     The project improved the capacity of FO and WCA, enabling them to take over the
responsibilities for O&M, the collection of water charges, and other roles. Infrastructure works
were done to standard and have demonstrated resilience following the 2010 and 2011 floods.
Famers were trained in improved productivity and water use and have seen the benefit in terms
of enhanced income. With increasing demand for agricultural produce, farmers are set on an
upward trajectory towards further enhancing water productivity. The increase in income
observed during the project and projected for the future clearly shows that there is a strong
incentive for farmers to continue with the gains made. Conversely, factors that could derail the
progressive incremental gains made are practically negligible barring any tribal conflict or
instability. This on-farm project covered only 20 percent of the total area and there is a
consensus that this coverage needs to be expanded. 4
43.      The Government has no incentive to change course. In fact, the Government has a
number of strong incentives to remain on course, including the transfer of O&M responsibility to
users, improved collection of water charges, timely identification of problems and increased tax
revenue (as a result of increased production and value of land). The government has requested a
follow-up Sindh Irrigated Agriculture Productivity Enhancement Program Phase-I Project
(SIAPEP), which would be processed on fast track basis to ensure continuity with SOFWMP,
minimizing time gaps between the two projects. The continuity would facilitate the effective
utilization of well-trained human resources under SOFWMP, the scaling up of infrastructure to
expand geographic coverage, and further enhancement of on-farm technical support.
44.    The follow-up project will focus on productivity enhancement activities in an expanded
project area (within and beyond AWBs) but exclusively confined to the WC command areas
only. The project also will scale-up activities that were found to be effective under the SOFWMP,
including precision land leveling, bed-planting and furrow irrigation, balanced use of fertilizers,
and IPM, and expansion of High Efficiency Irrigation System. It will also apply best practices
developed in Punjab and elsewhere in Pakistan.
45.   The institutional arrangements put in place are operating satisfactorily and the
Government has continued to earmark budgetary resources. The SOFWMP was not the first

Bank project in water sector of Pakistan. The current CPS 5 (2015-2019) in reviewing the
completed CPS (2010-2014) stated that: “On-going operations during the CPS period continued
the long-standing WB focus on upgrading and improving irrigation infrastructure in the Indus
basin and supporting water management institutions in Punjab, Sindh and Balochistan.” While a
series of Bank projects have contributed to the irrigation management capacity that is now in
place, there is an ongoing need to improve the efficiency of irrigation water use and to raise
agricultural productivity. Changing conditions require constant upgrades in technology,
modernization of infrastructure, and consolidation of the gains which have already been achieved
in strengthening institutions.

3. Assessment of Outcomes 6

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

46.      The relevance of the project development objective is high. The PDO clearly reflected
the circumstances prevailing during project preparation and the current situation in Sindh’s
irrigation sub-sector. The preparation of the project was a reflection of the Government of
Sindh’s policies and strategies in promoting food security and competitiveness of agricultural
production. 7 Improving on-farm water management and other activities to raise agricultural
productivity will remain instrumental in promoting economic growth and reducing poverty. As
population pressure on water and land continue to mount, improving the efficiency with which
Pakistan’s existing resources are used will continue to be a critical priority.
47.     Recognizing that agriculture contributes about 80 percent of export earnings directly and
indirectly, the new CPS made the observation that agriculture still suffers from low water
productivity. Therefore, one of the major expected outcome of the new CPS is increased
productivity in farms in selected (that included Sindh) irrigation schemes. The key outcome to be
monitored, as given in the CPS is to raise yields of major crops (wheat, cotton, rice) in selected
areas by 20 percent.
48.      The new CPS recognized that climate change threatens water, food and energy security
in Pakistan. Activities to address climate change adaptation and mitigation include water
conservation and management by modernizing irrigation networks and installing high efficiency
irrigation systems. These activities reflect the Government’s new National Climate Change

  This main section of the ICR presents a consolidated outcome of the project. Annex two provides a two-stage
presentation to cover the project period before and after the AF. .

  Government of Sindh’s strategy in the water and agriculture sectors supports systemic infrastructure rehabilitation
and modernization, improved service delivery in a socially and environmentally sustainable manner to support the
long-term goal of food security and sustainable economic growth. It continues to support efforts to improve the
tertiary level water distribution systems wherein water losses are the highest.

Policy that outlines mitigation and adaptation measures. The Government’s clear recognition of
the impacts of climate change has increased the relevance of the project and its DO.
49.     The Sindh Agriculture project slotted for FY15 is therefore testament to the relevance
of the PDO of the SOFWM project to current prevailing situation and reflects the Government’s
aim to accelerate agricultural growth and productivity.
Relevance in Design and Implementation
50.      The relevance of design and implementation is rated as Substantial. By design, the
activities to be implemented were prioritized and sequenced. Following the Government’s
strategy, the project opted for decentralization and transfers of irrigation and drainage system
management. In addition, making other new institutions become operational was a priority
activity of the SOFWMP. Institutional reform coupled with infrastructure works and on-farm
support remains the preferred choice of the Government strategy to improve productivity, water
efficiency, and sustainability. The approach is also the best practice in water management for
agriculture. The water scarcity projected to result from climate change makes this design highly
relevant to current and future conditions. Population increase and urbanization are adding an
additional justification to the relevance of the project design. Project design elements that aimed
at improving SOFWM through farmers’ participatory processes have been and remain a very
sound approach to irrigation schemes management.
51.     Activities relating to institutional reforms which were making slow progress were
identified during implementation and addressed. Most of these were carried out by SIDA. The
SOFWMP response entailed sharpening the focus on farmers’ participatory processes at the WC
level. The original target of 3,000 improved WCs under AF Phase was adjusted downward to
1,400 to allow for factors which were clearly beyond the control of the project or Government.
The AF focused more on promoting participatory processes and aimed to facilitate the provision
of productivity enhancement services to the WCAs and farmers by the public and private sector
service providers (see Appendix of Annex 2). Also in the context of supporting Government of
Sindh’s reform program in the irrigation sector, institutional reform was found to be appropriate
as it was aimed at achieving the long awaited transfer of management responsibility of at least
two of the three water distribution systems (AWBs and FOs). Notwithstanding the above, it is
recognized that the reform agenda at the upper tiers of the canal water distribution system should
addresses equity and ownership issues and relieve the public sector from carrying out costly
operations which farmers were better placed to carry out. In addition, it was recognized that the
outcomes of water distribution equity have a key role in supporting the Government policy of
food security.
52.    Implementation stressed the role of active participants rather than passive beneficiaries
to imbue the project with ownership on the part of the different parties engaged. The FO were
made responsible for O&M of irrigation and drainage system, while AWBs were responsible for
O&M of the main canal up to the head of the distributary canals, etc. These arrangements
assigned ownership of the project among different players that supported project implementation.
Given the wide range of activities to implement and the decentralized nature of the project, it

                                                12
was imperative for the project to be supported by PIAC that provided support for, inter alia,
training & capacity building in productivity enhancement programs for project staff, FOs and
WCAs.
53.     During implementation, the Bank received complaints and allegations of corruption
from a farmer and another person outside the project area. The complaints were investigated
by the Government of Sindh. Both complaints together with the report from the government of
Sindh were forwarded to the INT. INT suggested that a Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM)
should be established under the project, as a preliminary measure for handling and clarifying
issues raised in the complaints. The Bank team together with the implementing agency worked
and established the GRM which proved to be effective, and this arrangement would be carried
over to the next project.
54.      The AF did its own diagnosis of project implementation and identified areas that
required adjustment. As part of this, the team developed an 18-month work plan. The AF was
notable for prioritizing the project activities on completing committed activities under the project
during implementation. Given that improvement of WCs accounted for 97% of total AF costs,
and recognizing that the infrastructure was significantly affected by the flood events, this
prioritization was warranted. Focusing on improving WCs was seen as the best way to ensure
that the project development objectives would be achieved. Further, as part of the AF, the
implementing agency introduced positive changes in the way the project is managed by
reshuffling responsibilities and designating individual goals and responsibilities at all levels. It
also increased the number of Field Teams from 40 to 50 teams. The teams were responsible for
community mobilization and survey, and design works under the WC improvement component.
Moreover, the monitoring of project performance received the attention of higher tiers in
Government, including bimonthly meetings chaired by the Secretary of Agriculture. The
meetings were instituted to monitor project progress and to address problems in a timely manner.
55.    While overall the design and implementation relevance is substantial, design also had
some minor limitations that delayed project implementation. The inclusion of SIDA as one
implementing agency may have been weakness given the frequent change in the DG.
Simplification of implementation seems to have compromised cooperation at the local level that
was later found to be hurdle in project implementation. Not institutionalizing the involvement of
higher officials was a design weakness that was addressed later. The implementation of
Distributaries and Minors Improvement sub-component has been slow because of weak capacity
on the part of the implementing agency (SIDA). Given the layers of stakeholders this project
engaged, institutionalizing grievance address mechanisms should have been included in the
design of the project or establishing a high level steering committee should have been undertaken.
Overall relevance
56.   With a relevance of objectives rated as high and a relevance of design and
implementation rated as substantial, the overall relevance is rated Substantial.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives 8

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
57.     The project has achieved its objectives with only minor shortcomings and as such
should have been rated as Satisfactory. However, given that it took almost ten years to
implement the project, the ICR team has opted on rating the achievement as MS. The rating is
therefore tamed to account for the extended implementation period.
58. The PDO, to enable farmers to better manage irrigation water and increase agricultural
productivity, basically contains two elements: better management of water by farmers, and
increased agricultural productivity.
59.   Improve Water Management contains two elements: improved irrigation water
management by farmers and improve water reliability.
60.      Improved irrigation water management by farmers. To achieve this result the Project
delivered training, improved infrastructure, and provided equipment. The achievement of this
objective was set to be measured through gains in the efficiency, reliability, and equity of
irrigation water distribution. The DPR is the actual discharge divided by authorized discharge of
tail and head WCs was chosen as a ratio to measure progress. By project closing the actual DPR
was 0.81 slightly above the original target of 0.8. Another measurement of how much water
management had improved was ‘increased WC conveyance efficiency’. The target was to
increase this efficiency by 20% by end of the project. The project managed to achieve a 24%
achievement in efficiency, which is a 20% additional gain above the target level.
61.     Water reliability, measured by the number of irrigation turns that are missed by
farmers, improved by 53 percent (5% lower than the target), while water distribution equity,
measured by the proportion of farmers located at the tail of the WC getting up to 80% or more of
their due share was achieved. These achievements are significant even though slightly lower than
the targets envisaged at appraisal of the project. The WC conveyance efficiency through piped
outlet from water storage tanks in earthen channels in the rainfed areas increased by 25 percent.
The PIAR done on the AF Phase reported a 24 percent increase in WC conveyance efficiency on
an overall basis in the improved WCs in three AWBs.
62.    b) Increase in agricultural productivity. The second aspect, increasing agricultural
productivity, had the following key indicators: 9
(i) Cropping intensity in canal irrigated area to increase by 10 percent over the baseline; and

  This ICR relied on the M&E system of the project, the Project Impact Assessment Report and the Project
Completion Report for data in analyzing project outcome. This was supported by the first-hand observation and
consultation carried by the Bank’s supervision team.
9
  Baseline for the increased cropping intensity of major crops was reset at the AF phase; the baseline cropping
intensity of 119% and end of the project target at 131% while achievement is at 137%.

                                                        14
(ii) Yields of major crops to increase by 7.5 percent for wheat, 8.5 percent for cotton, and 23
percent for sugarcane over the baseline.
63.     Cropping intensity: The project had a significant impact on the productivity of irrigated
agriculture. Overall, cropping intensity surpassed the targeted 10 percent (See Table 3 below).
This is a major achievement, and can be fully attributed to the project because there were no
other irrigation-based development activities of significance in the command area that
contributed to the attainment of these results.
64.     Yields of major crops. Table 2 summarizes the achievements in productivity for three
major crops. The overall gain in productivity is closer to the target of 10% at the project level.
The wheat surpassed the target by 29% and cotton by 27%, whereas sugarcane productivity was
lower by 43% from that of the target. These gains in productivity were achieved after accounting
for the loss sustained during the 2010 and 2011 floods.

66.    Increased farm incomes: The end of the project income of small famers with project
(WP) is 58% higher than without project (WOP), medium farmers have 51% higher income and
large farmers have 25% higher income. The priority assigned to improving the capacity to
manage irrigation schemes among smaller and medium size farmers therefore clearly paid
dividends. Among other things, this result also indicates improved water availability to small
farmers after the improvement of WC conveyance efficiency. The improvement in cropping

                                                            15
intensity and productivity resulted in increased income for the beneficiary farmers, other farmers
in the area also benefited from the demonstration and spill-over effects of the project. (Annex 3
includes the benefit to farmers outside the project target area.)
67.     Another important project outcome in the context of productivity enhancement is the
successful introduction of IPM. Farmers who participated in this program are now able to
identify harmful and beneficial insects, and they calibrate and apply pesticides as and when
needed. Farmers who apply IPM principles were found to reduce the number of pesticide
applications by about half. In the areas covered by IPM, the reduction in pesticide use varied
from 70% in cotton producing areas to 22% in rice producing areas, giving an overall average of
53 percent for all crops. A comparative analysis between crop yields of non-IPM trained farmers
and IPM trained farmers shows that, even though the yields of the non-IPM trained farmers may
be greater, the net returns are almost at par once the cost of pesticide is factored in.
68.      The project introduced new technologies that have a bearing on water use, agricultural
input, and production efficiency. Consider the “laser guided” Precision Land Levelling (PLL)
technology introduced by the project. Studies indicate that 20 to 25 percent 10 of water applied to
unlevelled lands is wasted. Fertilizer efficiency and crop yield also suffer due to uneven
irrigation in different parts of the same field. It is now widely accepted that land levelling, and
laser guided precision land levelling in particular, eliminates these losses and results in
substantial water savings and increases in productivity. In addition to saving water, PLL reduces
the time farmers spend on irrigation, facilitates uniform seed germination, and increases fertilizer
use efficiency. Further, agricultural production costs also saw a significant reduction (thereby
contributing to increases in net income) attributable to water productivity and improved farming
practice. (Annex 3 shows that these gains were evident both in the targeted and non-targeted
farms).
69.      Additional Impacts: The project had a number of additional benefits to the communities
and the region as a whole. At a general level, due to increased production of food crops both in
the project and in areas outside the project (due to spill-over impact of productivity enhancing
activities demonstrations), food security was improved. Additional production is believed to
have contributed to improvements in nutrition – including the observed increase in livestock and
milk production. The project impact also includes improvement in environment management by
the farmers as exemplified by their preference for IPM and increased tree plantations, among
other factors. The project also created job opportunities for farm labor; reduced drainage
requirement; reduced soil salinity; and reduced negative impact of waterlogging on buildings and
roads.
70. As the above analysis demonstrates, there is strong causal relationship between what is
achieved and the project. This operation was the main intervention in Sindh to support irrigation
farmers. Achievements are directly attributable to the project. These impacts extend outward to
benefit farmers who were not involved with the project. Improvement in farming practices, use

of improved techniques and efficient utilization of agricultural inputs are all lessons that can be
easily replicated by farmers elsewhere. Although these spillover effects were not systematically
measured, production and productivity increases on the part of non-participating irrigated farms
provide useful proxy indicators that point to significant benefits outside the project itself.
71.     Notwithstanding the positive outcomes, a few shortcomings are worth mentioning. The
slow paced implementation of the upper-tier institutional reform (FO formation, management
transfer, capacity building of FOs and channel rehabilitation works) activities did not auger well
for WC improvement and productivity enhancement. The lack of synchronization between these
activities prevented important synergies from developing – synergies that potentially could have
led to more efficient delivery of integrated secondary-tertiary level irrigation channels
distribution systems.

3.3 Efficiency

Rating: Satisfactory
72.     The ex-post evaluation done as part of this ICR estimated an ERR of 25% which is
higher than 21% estimated in the PAD. The PAD also justified this projected return on
economic evaluations of on-farm and canal rehabilitation investments in Pakistan that had been
undertaken over a 20 year period in the context of project appraisals, ICRs, OED audits, and
impact evaluation reports, with ERR estimates ranging from 20 to 35%. At completion, the
project’s estimated NPV, discounted at 12 percent annual interest rate, is PKR92 million or
(US$ 0.91 million). The ICR identified two main reasons, which jointly contributed for the
higher ERR at project closing compared to the appraisal estimate: (i) following the food price
crisis in 2008, prices of agricultural products shot-up significantly; and (ii) higher cropping
intensity – the PAD estimated an increase in cropping intensity of 10% but the project achieved a
15% increase cropping intensity. Also, the improvement of a greater number of WCs (higher
than the target) was the major force that made possible the increase in production. The ex post
ERR result is robust as it is not sensitive to a reasonable increase in costs or decrease in benefits.
Details are provided in Annex 3.
73.     The project has also brought efficiency in water use by introducing new technology
and improving infrastructure. The improvement in WCs, for example, resulted in a 26 percent
increase on average in the amount of water delivered to farms. This increase in water availability
very likely contributed to bringing additional land under cultivation judging by the
corresponding increase in agricultural production. The increase in water availability was
achieved through improved efficiency. The Results Framework indicates that water conveyance
efficiency was increased by 24%.
74.     Project efficiency therefore might very well have been rated as high, were it not for the
period of time it required the project to produce its ultimate outcomes. Taking into account the
flooding and other implementation issues that contributed to the extended implementation period,
efficiency is rated as Satisfactory.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
75.    Overall the project outcome is rated as Moderately Satisfactory. The fact that it took
almost ten-years to complete the project factored heavily into assigning the project a rating lower
than satisfactory. The primary factor which contributed for this rating is the fact that financial
resources were not utilized fully, as 43% of the AF was cancelled. Further, out of the total
estimated project cost (including the AF), only 78% was utilized and therefore affected the
overall assessment of the project outcome, as viewed by the ICR team. The AF was also
instrumental in compensating the project for the high rise of cost of works in the project area.
Considering the project’s major outcomes as outlined above, and coupled with achievement of
modernizing the irrigation system, the overall outcome is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

     (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

76.      The project had important poverty impacts. The increase in water availability for the
farmers located at the tail of the WCs has made an important contribution to poverty reduction.
The PIAR 11 identified the impact of the project on poverty reduction on the population at large
and concluded that project results in this regard were positive. Poverty in the project area is
estimated to have declined by more than 16%. In addition to the gains made in crop yields, milk
yields improved and off-farm employment increased. These results led to higher annual incomes
than would have taken place in a without project scenario. Higher milk production is largely
attributable to increased fodder production. The project is believed to have contributed to
improved nutrition outcomes among beneficiary farming households.
77.     The project targeted women beneficiaries and an indicator was included in the list of
output indicators to monitor the participation of women. At completion, the project had
identified 2,240 women farmers, and 920 have become members of WCAs in 19 groupings.
Some twenty women farmers have become members of FOs, and ten of these are members of the
management committees. These women have been provided with the necessary training to
enable them to engage in improved farming practices. In one district, 30 women are part of an
FFS and are actively participating in IPM. Although these numbers may not be very high,
they represent an improvement over the past and constitute a meaningful gain for rural Sindh
where women are highly disadvantaged. The project is also believed to have contributed to
reducing hardship to women through the different works, such as washing bays for women.
Figures of the beneficiary farmers disaggregated by gender were not available. However, a
comparable irrigation investment project in Andhra Pradesh increased the demand for labor,

11
   A sample of 280 WCs (20% of population) was selected for the impact assessment surveys. Sample of 6 farmers
is selected at each of the WC representing 2 farmers each at head, middle and tail reaches. Number of farmers was
1680 and semi-structured interview approach was used for the survey.

                                                       18
particularly for women. According to IEG (2010) the increase in the demand for labor led to an
increase on average wages of 5 percent for men and 10 percent for women because of the high
demand for female labor involving weeding and harvesting paddies. 12 This phenomenon has
been observed in the OFWM project area as well.
78.      The project had significant social development impact emanating from its core
activities. These included: (i) the inclusion of small and tail-end farmers and their participation in
the WCAs and FOs, which enabled them to benefit from the project; (ii) the inclusion of women
beneficiaries through their participation in the WCAs and FOs; (iii) the gains in agricultural
productivity including jobs created had an impact on poverty; and (iv) the enhanced status of
sharecroppers that was made possible through their participation in WCAs and by ensuring that
their labor is recognized and paid for. To ensure targeting, the project gave priority to those WCs
where larger proportions of local farmers operate small farms. The strengthening of FOs and
enhanced participation of sharecroppers, women, and the poor through direct field teams support;
mobilizing farmers and encouraging their formation into WCAs; and assisting beneficiaries with
registration were all methods through which the project supported social development. Since the
project operated at local level, its contribution to social development was significant that will
contribute to the sustainability of the project outcome.
     (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

79.     This project resulted in a major impact in terms of institutional development
(understood to include the change in the rules of the game). The main change the project ushered
in is the formation of FO and their institutionalization. A total of 93 FOs were formed 13 and a
total of 6,374 WCAs were functioning as constituents of the FOs. This changed the rule of the
game in the management of irrigation schemes. The newly formed FOs distributed water among
users, collected water charges, maintained income and expenditure accounts and carried out the
routine O&M and repairs of the distributary/minor canals. While these institutions may need to
strengthen further, it was the assessment of the Government that most of the FOs and WCAs are
capable of carrying out their business and fulfilling their responsibilities (see Annex 5).
80.      The formation, mobilization and training of FOs and WCAs should be considered as
an important contribution to institution building. Institutional capacity has been created within
these organizations that enable them to run their business, as mandated by the reform program, in
the context of a transparent and democratic setup. The FOs in particular have been strengthened
in all facets of good management, of which the key areas are: training in organizational
management, financial management, water management, assessment and collection of water
charges, effective communication and conflict resolution, water management and channel O&M.
These training inputs enabled the FOs to manage their business, undertake the O&M of the
irrigation system and carry out rehabilitation works of distributaries/minor canals under

community based contract (CBC). 14 Annex 1 provides details on the extent of training provided
under this project.
81.      The implementing agencies also benefitted from capacity building. In particular, the
capacity of the Department of Agriculture to deal with large development programs is
enhanced. 15 DGAEWM enhanced its capacity to organize; develop the WCAs; and assist/guide
them to effectively carry out WC improvement. This enhanced capacity contributed to
institutional strengthening that will benefit the next project. Similarly, the institutional capacity
of DGAE was also strengthened through staff training because incremental funds for carrying
out extension activities were provided by the project. 16 A noteworthy institutional impact is the
introduction of IPM that will be useful in future projects. Also, the four information kiosks that
were established by the project were well received by farmers at large and in fact farmers
demanded more kiosks. These kiosks provided an opportunity to farmers to have access to
information related to agricultural crops, irrigation water and commodity prices. A website
(sofwmp.org.pk) was developed to which sufficient information was up-loaded, which inter alia
included information on water levels and rotation schedules of canals; water charge assessment
and collection by FOs; weather information (uploaded daily); crop information pamphlets;
agricultural machinery; and agricultural commodity prices (updated daily).
82.     Finally, by introducing new technology and improved irrigation management, the
project has contributed in creating an improved human capacity at all levels. This improved
capacity will be instrumental in supporting the different entities involved in the administration,
management and decision related to irrigation sub-sector.
83.     In summary, the project had a substantial institutional development impact.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Substantial
85.     The risks facing the outcome of this project are judged to be substantial. Although the
risk associated with project works and activities is modest, the substantial rating is recognition to
the frequent flooding facing the region. Since 2010, essentially Sindh has suffered annually from
flooding including this year which cripples the ability of the farmers to rehabilitate watercourse

both in terms of time required for rehabilitation and ability to finance reconstruction of damages
and rehabilitation/modernization of watercourses.
86.      Aside from the flooding risk which has been exogenous to the project, the risk
associated with project activities is modest. This has been proven in a number of other similar
types of irrigation projects that combine strengthening water users’ organization, modernizing
and rehabilitating irrigation infrastructure, providing on-farm support, and decentralizing
irrigation system management. Such types of projects have proven to be resilient to risks.
87.     The conceptual underpinning for this project is found in the idea that if farmers are
trained and a project demonstrated that their productivity and income can be improved; they
will be willing to pay charges. These charges will be utilized for O&M that in the past was an
issue because of the lack of reliable funding. FOs will also be willing to assume the management
of irrigation system and are better situated to collect these charges. Although a detailed study is
not made on the level of charges under this project, available evidence indicate that few has
increased the collection of charges while others has maintained the level existing before the
project. One major obstacle to increasing collection of water charges during the project has been
the shift in the focus of farmers during the aftermath of 2010 and 2011 floods. Farmers allocated
their resources to the immediate priority of financing and maintenance of their irrigation canals.
88.     The extent of improvements in farmers’ income and the gains in productivity has
clearly demonstrated that the economic benefits are significant. This outcome also holds for
other irrigation projects, suggesting the robustness of the result. 17 From economic perspective,
the incentives to continue the activities that were introduced by the project are strong, and the
likelihood of beneficiaries abandoning those activities is low. In terms of technical works, the
system has shown its resilience during the flooding that occurred during 2010 and 2011. The fact
that FOs are now responsible for O&M and rehabilitation works will be an important instrument
in identifying any technical problems immediately and to address them at an appropriate level.
89.      In terms of environment, the impact of this project is solid and sustainable. For
example, the use of IPM practice introduced through this project was found to be cost effective
giving farmers the incentive to continue with the activities started. The project improved the
survival rate of planted trees from 53 percent for DGAEWM and 37 percent for SIDA planted
trees to 87 percent during the final days of the project. This improvement was made possible
among other things through awareness creation and involvement of schools and collaboration of
other partners. There is strong ownership of the achievements.
90.     The federal and provincial Governments have demonstrated their ownership of the
project throughout the process. Going forward, as noted above, the Government has requested
for the Bank’s support for a follow-on project, which is expected to scale-up the gains made
under this project among other things. In particular, the improvement of water management is a
central theme for both Governments (Federal and Provincial) as reflected in the budget for 2014-

15. The Federal Government has allocated PKR43.4 billion (approximately more than 43.5
million USD) for water sector development. In terms of policy, the federal and provincial
Governments have made water and agriculture sectors as a central part of the future investment
strategy. 18 Further, there is no incentive for them to change the modernization path they have
embarked on. Extensive participation of beneficiaries, mainly at grassroots level, will also
contribute to ensure that tasks initiated through this project (and reforms institutionalized) will
remain in force. However, reforms may not proceed at speed at which one ideally expects but
there is every reason to believe that the Government will remain true to its reform agenda.
91.     On specific level, Sindh Irrigation and Power Department (SIPD) staff inherited by the
AWBs may have a conflict of interest with FOs and the latter may be frustrated or lose interest
in working with SIPD staff. This risk is still present and it has been reported by farmers that
staff of SIPD were not keen at facilitating the smooth take-over of the irrigation facilities by the
FOs and AWBs. But the risk should be considered relatively negligible, because the staff may
succeed in delaying the process, but have no legal basis to change the reform agenda that are
decided by the Government. In fact, some AWBs and FOs as well as SIDA staff are exploring
the possibility of recruiting engineering staff from the open market including the retired staff of
Sindh Irrigation and Power Department (SIPD), thereby avoiding the risk of delays in
strengthening the operations of the FOs and AWBs.
92.     On balance, the risks facing the outcomes of the project are rated as substantial. This
rating is based on the recognition of the frequent flooding; however, in the past, the
infrastructures works have proved their resilience and FOs have on the part have responded
quickly in fixing any damages sustained by their schemes. The risk is modest in terms of project
outcomes as they relate. Any residual risks will be dealt by the follow-on operation.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory
93.     This project was a continuation of a series of Bank interventions in Pakistani
irrigation. As a continuation of past interventions, this project reflected lessons learned from
past experience. The diagnosis work and the technical solutions identified were clearly
appropriate to the bottlenecks facing the irrigation subsector. The project was also designed to
implement the outcome of the reforms initiated by the government – such as decentralization of
the management of irrigation systems to FO. The initial cost estimates were also found to be
appropriate in spite of a major underestimation of project management support cost. Design also

reflected the prevailing consensus in irrigation water management targeted at improving water
efficiency and productivity. The right combination of institutional and infrastructure support
were included in the project. Extensive consultation was undertaken to ensure ownership of the
project at all levels. A set of guidelines were prepared to implement the mitigation measures
identified in the ISEA. In fact the guideline included additional conditions of approval imposed
by the Sindh Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA). The fact the project geographic area
coverage was limited has enabled the project to be manageable during implementation.
94.     Project components reflected the support needed to implement the reforms and to
achieve project development objective. Overall, the design of the project aligned very well the
different components and activities of the project with the PDO. Focusing on capacity
development of the FOs was a prerequisite for achieving the overall goal of improving
management of the irrigation sector. The elements of the M&E system were appropriate for
supporting effective management and technical decisions during project implementation. The
fact that no major changes were made to the original project design during the AF restructuring
(except the need to scale-up WC improvement and productivity enhancement components) is a
testimony to the fact that the project design got it right.
95.     However, the design did have some limitations. The design assessed the limitations of
the implementing agencies particularly that of SIDA, and rightly identified the need for technical
assistance to boost their implementation capacity. However, the project design still
overestimated the existing institutional capacity during appraisal. Although the design identified
the necessary technical support and training required to enhance the capacity of the FOs at a
level required to manage irrigation schemes, the design underestimated the efforts and the time
needed to accomplish this task. The design also included some ambitious targets, such as the
23% increase in sugarcane productivity, which is deemed a tall order to achieve in a short
duration project cycle.
On balance the project quality at entry is rated Satisfactory.
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
96.     The Bank team conducted a total of 21 supervision mission (including the final ICR
mission). Mission teams were clearly focused on the outcome of the project and the achievement
of the PDO. Action taken, such as the rationale given for the AF (“scaling-up of WC
improvement and agricultural productivity enhancing activities to increase the impact of the
SOFWMP to scale-up project impact”) indicate that the Bank team was fully focused on project
impact. Project ratings were candid. For the most of its implementation period, the Bank team
rated the project as Moderately Satisfactory and in one case the team rated Implementation
Progress as Unsatisfactory.
 97.   Missions frequently traveled to the project area to assess progress first-hand and
converse directly with beneficiaries and project staff. Supervision of the project has been
proactive in supporting the implementing agencies to resolve issues as they crop up. The

                                                 23
supervision missions were mostly composed of technical experts relevant for project supervision
and were made to be responsive to emerging needs of the project. Examples of this are
partnering with the NWIP, extension of closing dates to ensure the completion of some project
works, agreeing to greater use of CBC in the rehabilitation of distributaries/minor canals, and in
particular preparing and later restructuring of the AF Phase. The Bank team made extensive use
of the M&E system during its assessment of the project.
98.     Both farmers and project implementation staff gave high mark for the support of the
Bank’s mission team provided in filling emerging knowledge gaps. Bank teams were proactive
in identifying activities that should be scaled-up and those that need more focus and adjustments.
The Bank team was instrumental in improving project performance to satisfactory level. The
project had relatively stable team – there were a total of three TTLs to this project.
99.     However, Bank supervision minor shortcomings. The Bank task-team could have done a
better job in consolidating the Result Framework (RF) following the AF. The informal revision
of the number of canal works done during MTR was not formalizes. Further, supervision
missions could have been more forceful to ensure the stability of the leadership of SIDA and in
catalyzing the performance of the PIAC.
100.   On balance the performance of the Bank supervision is rated Moderately Satisfactory.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
101. The Bank preparation team accomplished a remarkable job and the design of the
project was found to be relevant throughout project implementation and was not revised.
However, Bank supervision demonstrated some limitations. On balance, considering the
satisfactory rating given to Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry and the moderately
satisfactory rating for supervision, the ICR Team rates the Bank’s Overall Performance as
Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
102. The Project enjoyed full Government ownership and strong support by federal,
provincial, and district Governments. At the federal level, the Government allocated US$70.7
million for agricultural investment during the start of the project (FY2004-05). Government of
Sindh and district governments also deployed more regular staff than in past that clearly
demonstrated the commitments by different level governments. In addition, the government,
especially the Government of Sindh, undertook important reforms and started some activities
that this project further scaled-up (See PAD page 19, para D.4.1 on reforms undertaken and
activities initiated before the project).



                                                 24
103. The project enjoyed strong ownership and support both by the GOP and GoSindh
during project preparation and the entire implementation period, demonstrating their
commitment to OFWM programs and the reform. The reforms initiated by the Provincial
Government were the basis for this project and the counterpart did not waiver from its reform
agenda. The Government provided and created an enabling environment for active participation
of beneficiaries. Like the Bank team, the Government used extensively the M&E system. The
government commitment to the PDO is clearly demonstrated through its request for AF that was
aimed to scale-up project impact. When the Bank team requested for higher level government
involvement in monitoring and overseeing project implementation, the Government responded
quickly to such request and formed a high-level body to oversee and monitor project progress.
104. The Government is now financing the transition arrangements using its own budgetary
resources. Given the impact this project had and as a reflection of the Government’s
commitment to further expand the coverage of the activities undertaken under this project, it has
requested a follow-up project. The Government policy has clearly outlined that irrigation is one
of the main subsectors that will be instrumental in climate change adaptation and mitigation
measures. Thus, Government commitment has grown stronger.
105. However, the project could have benefited from stronger resolve in reducing the fast
turnover of SIDA’s MDs, as this would have further improved project progress. This was an
action under the control of the Government but failed to ensure stability. The Government should
have resolved the reluctance of Irrigation Districts’ staff in facilitating the transfer of irrigation
management to FOs. As part of this, the Government should have made it its business that the
reform agenda is clearly understood at all levels. Although these limitations did not affect project
implementation substantially the performance of the government is rated Satisfactory.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
106. The components implemented by DGAEWM and DGAE were satisfactory, while that
of SIDA is rated Moderately Satisfactory. The DGAEWM and DGAE played a key role and
were instrumental in successful outcome of the project. Unfortunately SIDA lacked necessary
continuity in its leadership, forcing stoppage or slow progress of work, as some contracts could
not be awarded and regular payments were delayed. These limiting factors were discouraging to
SIDA although it is good to see that its implementation performance improved towards the end
of the project period.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory:
107.     The Government showed its leadership, ownership and commitment throughout out
project preparation and implementation. Limited capacity and lack of effective coordination
resulted in delays in implementing some activities by the implementing agencies. Given the
satisfactory ratings of the Government and the Moderately Satisfactory rating of the
implementing agencies, the Overall Borrower Performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

                                                 25
6. Lessons Learned

108. This project clearly demonstrated that with appropriate support small and medium size
farmers could turn out to be more productive. Small and medium size farmers made the highest
gain in productivity and income. The gain made in productivity is not explained by initial low
productivity.
109. In a situation where local organizations are composed of different interest groups
(sharecroppers, medium farmers, etc.) arrangement for grievances addressing mechanisms
should be built into institutional design where beneficiaries can register their grievances and get
timely and effective remedial measures. This redress mechanism has to be implemented by the
respective departments but effective monitoring by the third party is essential.
110. Trainings still remain vital for efficient use of water, soil, crop management, alternate
use of saved water etc. The awareness campaign generated huge initial interest. It was learned
that extensive social mobilization and awareness campaigns alone were not sufficient to change
farmers’ behavior and practices. It was observed that there is tendency of farmers to irrigate
crops with more water with the belief that more water results in higher productivity. To optimize
the use of water, farmers will benefit from trainings.
111. It is important to continuously gauge the capacity and awareness of local organizations
and to allow them to assume a bigger role. The role of WCAs has to be enhanced beyond WC
improvement. Specific to this project, WCAs were given output based contracts and they
performed well in managing quality of lining of WCs. Also, the water users have demonstrated
community actions, relying on centuries old traditions, in managing Warabandi schedules
through a consensual process, and now they are at ease with the decisions of their FOs/AWBs.
The SWMO19 2002 needs to be expanded to provide WCAs responsibility in promoting water
productivity.
112. It is important to ensure that there is clarity by staff at all levels on changes made to
policy and guidelines. Most of the field staff feels that WCAs are to be organized for WC
improvement only. The lack of clarity regarding the new role of WCA might be the reason that
the SOFWMP staff are still using the guidelines prepared in 1990s having little relevance with
the SWMO 2002.
113. In order to prevent free-riders who benefit from but do not pay for water charges, it is
important to improve FOs capacity to enforce rules and institute incentive mechanisms. WCAs
are always ready to contribute in up-front cash for WC improvement. However, farmers need to
be ensured that there will be reliable water delivery, that clear guidelines exist, and that the rule
will be implemented uniformly. There is still a lack of capacity in implementing the rules and in
enforcing the recovery of water charges. An incentive system developed and implemented by the
Sindh Revenue Department provides an important instructive lesson that should be considered
for replication in other parts.

114. Drip-irrigation is the preferred and cost effective method for irrigating farms outside
the Indus basin. The construction of Water Storage Tanks (WST) is a costly intervention. Its
cost is double of the cost of WC improvement. The benefits of WC improvement are available
on average to 11 farmers in the WC command (including joint family farming units); whereas in
most cases an individual benefits from WST as it is constructed on a given farm. There is a need
to design low-cost drip irrigation for farmers in areas outside the Indus basin and it can be
directly coupled with tube-wells to provide a cost-effective and appropriate package of
intervention instead of WST.
115. New technology provision has to select farmers that have the capacity and the means to
demonstrate and directly benefit other farmers. Laser land leveling units were provided to
individual farmers; therefore the intervention is limited to those farmers, unless the beneficiary
farmer is also operating a tractor rental service. As a lesson for the future projects, such units
should be provided to tractor rental operators so that they provide services to other farmers.
116. Improving water productivity requires an integrated approach that includes support to
farmers in getting the right complementary inputs. Water productivity is dependent on reducing
the use of water and increasing productivity. The non-water inputs (quality seed, balanced
fertilizers, etc.) are essential for improving water productivity. Specific to this project, farmers
feel that they are getting such services from the private sector. However, there is no mechanism
to verify the quality and appropriateness of supplies farmers are receiving.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

The information in this Annex regarding outputs by components is provided in two phases of the
project. First phase deals with the Main Phase of the Project (MP) and the second phase deals
with the additional financing project (AFP) so that the information can be compared and
evaluated. This style of presentation was also needed because the activities financed under the
two phases were different. The AFP covers only the SOFWM component. As a whole the
SOFWM-AFP made headway in terms of successful implementation of all the interventions.

Component 1 - Social Mobilization and Capacity Building

A.1.   Main Phase of the Project
Social Mobilization
This component was the key to the establishment of FOs who would take responsibility from the
AWBs for managing water distribution to all the WCs under respective distributaries or minor
canals. The project provided resources for social mobilization for establishing new FOs and for
building capacity. The Sindh Water Management Ordinance (SMWO) 2002 assigns crucial
functions in managing irrigation at the distributary level to FOs. It empowers them to receive
water from AWBs, distribute it to WCs and collect Abiana (Water Fee) from farmers. A formal
Irrigation and Drainage Management Transfer Agreement (IDMTA) is signed between the
AWBs and the FOs that defines the roles and obligations of both parties and procedures for
participation in system’s O&M. FOs are legal entities and defined as corporate bodies that are
formally registered. In order to ensure a broad-based farmers’ representation within the FOs,
among other things, they must satisfy:
   •   At least two-third of the command area in the jurisdiction of FOs must be covered by
       WCAs.
   •   The General Body of FOs must have members from at least 21 WCAs or Drainage
       Beneficiary Groups (DBGs).
   •   Of the total of 6 members of the FOs’ Board of Management, at least 3 members shall be
       representatives of WCAs or DBGs from the tail reaches of the distributary or minor, or
       shall be small farmers with holding less than 16 acres.

The social mobilization process consists of three phases: a) formation and registration phase; b)
registration to IDMT phase; and c) post-IDMT phase. The first phase having five steps was
carried out by the social organizers to form the FOs. These were: a) preparatory and orientation
visits; b) awareness campaigns; c) socio-economic and technical baseline study; d) formation and
registration of WCAs; and e) formation and registration of FOs. The project formed 93, out of
the target of 100 FOs; and 86 of this were registered with SIDA. Out of these, only 74 have been
able to sign the Irrigation and Drainage Management Transfer Agreements (IDMTA) with
AWBs.

Training and Capacity Building
Within SIDA, a Social Development Cell (SDC) was established to develop capacity through a
continuous process of institutional assessment and evaluation; as well as through the provision
of: a) trainings; b) direct support in the preparation of business plans; and c) assistance in
coordination, networking and linkage among various players. A series of basic specialized and
refresher training courses in various disciplines were organized for FOs members. Training
disciplines included: organizational and financial management, Abiana assessment and collection,
effective communication and conflict resolution, irrigation and drainage management, cannel
O&M and project awareness promotion. Specialized trainings in the disciplines of: finance,
management, leadership, team building, project cycle, investment proposal development, M&E,
gender development, business plan preparation, etc., were imparted to the staff of SIDA and the
FOs. Refresher courses were organized for farmers after the suggestions made by the Bank’s
Mid-Term Review (Table 1).

The project produced 7 modules with required training materials on the topics indicated above.
In addition to the above trainings, 7 exposure visits for FOs were organized against the target of
50. Out of a target of organizing 50 FO assemblies at sub-division level, only 19 were carried out.
In addition, 21 farmers’ awareness workshops were organized against a target of 36. Many of
these reduced inputs were the effect of the slow implementation in the formation of FOs and the
priority given to the rehabilitation of distributary minor and canals. SIDA has also organized
three stakeholders’ workshops with the participation of farmers, local authorities and members of
civil society. Various workshops on participatory irrigation management issues were held for
WCAs and FOs in the areas of AWBs. The forum of FO assemblies provided an opportunity of
coordination between FOs and AWBs.
The registered FOs, who entered into IDMT agreements with AWBs, progressively took over
irrigation management from the AWBs. They distributed water among users, collected Abiana,
maintained income and expenditure accounts, and carried out the routine O&M and repairs of the
distributary/minor canals. Initially, FOs carried out these activities with the support of AWB
staff.
In general, creating and building the capacity of institutions require some time, and continued
support is necessary until the FOs become mature enough to operate effectively. However, while
an expectation of a generalized high performance is a bit premature, most of the FOs and WCAs
are capable of carrying out their businesses. Around 90% of FOs have Abiana and general



                                                 30
register maintained. Assistance was provided by the SIDA staff to open bank accounts for the
FOs.
The progressive improvement of FOs was confirmed by the impact evaluation study. A sample
study of 12 FOs and 14 WCAs showed that none of these were assessed as failures, but most of
them were semi-successful, implying that some activities, such as Abiana collection were
inadequate. Nevertheless, they are able to press on with their work, although they would need
political and technical backing to reach the high level of effectiveness desired under the reform.
An analysis carried out by SIDA on 356 FOs (including those established by NWIP 20 and by the
project), indicated a promising level of broad participation of farmers. The SIDA analysis
showed that 40% of the FOs Chairmen were located at the tail of the WC and 30% at the middle,
leaving only about 30% at the head. The same study also indicated that 46% of the Chairmen had
a land holding below 50 acres, and 65% had an education level that is intermediate and below.
Another interesting finding in favour of broad participation is the re-elections of FOs, where the
percentage of FOs Chairmen at the head and middle is decreasing in favour of those located at
the tail. This is a major success of the project, and it means that the mitigating factors introduced
have worked well, and the feared domination of the FOs by wealthy and influential individuals
appears to have been obviated in most of the FOs.
An important capacity in FOs’ ability to contract for the rehabilitation of distributaries/minor
canals was also created under the project. Following the training and the technical guidance
provided by PIAC and AWBs staff, in laying out earthwork and quality control, the FOs carried
out works under the CBC in competition with the private sector. Of the 87 rehabilitated canals,
50 were carried out under CBC and 37 under National Competitive Bidding (NCB; Table 7).
Project management has reported that the quality of work carried out under CBC was superior to
that under NCB.

A.2.      Additional Financing Phase

In the AFP, this component was aimed for the establishment of WCAs within the context of the
FO and thus it was supposed to be registered with SIDA, especially after repealing the SIDA Act
1997 and SWUA Ordinance of 1982. This was also aimed to support the functioning of the FOs
through establishment of effective WCAs. The project provided resources for social mobilization
for establishing WCAs and for building capacity. Both the FO and WCAs are inter-dependent
because WCA’s affectivity will ensure sustainability of the FO.
The target of formation of WCAs was exceeded as SOFWM formed 2029, out of the target of
1400. Majority of the WCAs were registered with the Community Development Department
(CDD). The Mission during the field visit also confirmed this deviation in a sample of 11 WCAs
while conducting the group dialogues, where only three WCAs were registered with SIDA and
rest with the CDD. After the repealing of the Local Government Ordinance, the SOFWM started
registering the WCAs with SIDA, as there is no choice left.

Training and Capacity Building
The achievements of the capacity building component of the AFP exceed the target by training
10145 farmers against 7000 (Table 2). For the field days, the achievement was slightly below the
target. The impact evaluation mission while conducting dialogues with the WCAs found that
they still require further capacity building to perform effectively.

The project established four information Kiosks for providing information and knowledge
related to best practices to farmers, inputs availability and disposal of produce using one window
platform. In addition to this, under the sub-component of awareness and dissemination, most of
the targets were fully achieved except radio programmes and provincial seminars (Table 3).

         WSTs

B1.      Main Phase of the Project
Improvement of WCs
WC improvement and water storage tanks were designed and constructed as per national
standards. DGAEWM supported by district staff organized in 50 field teams (6 District and 32
field teams during first year) were made responsible for this sub-component through WCAs on
"Output Based" system. The Output Based Agreements were signed between the DGAEWM and

                                                           32
the WCA, who were registered with the FOs or Local Government Regulatory Authority, where
FOs didn’t exist.
The staff of DGAEWM was responsible for carrying out survey and design work, cost estimation
of WCs and providing technical assistance and supervision to WCA during construction; while
WCAs were responsible for procurement of materials and for construction works. Once the
WCAs completed part of the earthwork, they were provided with funds to procure materials.
Subsequent payments were made to WCAs upon completion of milestones specified in the
Agreement. For WC improvement, the project financed 90% of the cost of material, while
WCAs met skilled and unskilled labour costs and contributed 10% of the materials costs. This
resulted in total farmers’ contribution of 30%. An initial deposit of Rs 20,000 in saline area and
PKR10,000 in fresh groundwater area WCs was also required to be deposited by the WCAs.
The progress on WC improvement was slow during the earlier period of the project, but it
accelerated after its mainstreaming with the NWIP. The project achievement has exceeded its
targets, improving 4,355 against the target of 4,000 WCs. After streamlining of project with the
NPIW, the original idea of improving some 60% of the WC inside the AWBs has been reversed,
as the majority of the WCs improved by the project are found in the areas outside AWBs (Table
4).

The quality of work on the improvement of WCs was of reasonable standards. Overall, the
average conveyance efficiency of sampled unlined WCs in irrigated areas was 66.9% during
baseline in 2005-06, which increased to 82.8% in irrigated area (Table 5).

The implementation performance of the WC sub-component was highly satisfactory, and was
completed ahead of schedule. The key factors for the success of this sub-component were: high

level of political commitment and strong government ownership; effective implementation
mechanism including effective field team; simple flow of funds and well understood
measurement and payment arrangements; and direct involvement of the beneficiaries in the
planning and implementation of the WCs.
Construction of Water Storage Tanks
The project included construction of 200 water tanks, later revised to 300, in Barani areas. About
200 water storage tanks, each with a capacity of storing 6,400 ft3 and serving 5 to 10 farms, were
envisaged to be constructed to store about 8 to 12 hours of output of the tubewell. The stored
water is then supplied together with direct discharge from tubewells to obtain sufficient
discharge in the WC to attain a reasonable efficiency. During subsequent visits of the Bank’s
Missions, this target was raised to 300. The tanks are constructed by WCAs organized as in the
WC improvement sub-component, but are restricted to non-irrigated areas. A total of 326 tanks
were constructed against a target of 300 tanks. A greater proportion of this activity was carried
out in the latter years of the project after completing the targets of WC improvement (Table 6).

The water storage tanks are constructed in Barani areas and the quality of work was excellent.
The efficiency of the WCs in these water tanks has increased from 52.5 to 78.2%. During the
Mid-Term review, DGAEWM proposed the construction of additional 100 water tanks, but this
did not materialize due to lack of readily available designs and feasibility studies.
Improvements of Distributaries and Minor Canals
The project provided for the improvement of 100 distributaries/minor canals. This constitutes
about 1/3 of the total number of distributaries in the 3 AWBs. The improvement work was
targeted as low-cost, not exceeding PKR800/ha of command area. Schemes with higher unit cost
were to be undertaken only if the ERR exceeded 12%, and was subject to clearance by IDA.
Typically, improvement works included restoration of: outlets, weak sections of banks and berms,
de-silting, repair of regulator gates, cross regulators and diversion structures, protection works,
upstream and downstream of structures and channel sides, cattle crossings and gates, installation
of gauges and control structures for flow measurement at the distributary head and outlet.


                                                 34
AWBs were responsible for information dissemination, demand promotion, screening and
ranking of FOs application for distributary improvement. AWBs staff, with the assistance of
PIAC, were responsible for facilitating identification, design and quality control of distributary
improvement works by FOs. Criteria and methodology for selection and screening investments
under the project were developed as part of the Integrated Social and Environmental Assessment
(ISEA), and were based on similar considerations as for WCs improvement. FOs were
responsible for distributary canal improvement works. The works were identified and proposed
by FOs on the basis of joint walk through surveys along with AWB staff and PIAC. AWB staff
and PIAC assisted the FOs in the planning of works. Most channels were silted up and delivered
inequitable supplies to outlets along their length. The tampered and broken control structures
were remodeled.
For procurement of civil works, World Bank guidelines were followed. NCB procedures were
followed for civil works, because works were relatively small, and were not able to attract
International Competitive Bidders (ICB). The eligibility criteria for distributary improvement
involved that:
     •     FO is registered with the regulatory authority;
     •     FO’s performance is satisfactory as indicated by Abiana collection, performance in
           O&M and availability of business plan; and
     •     There is a clear need for improvement, e.g. loss of freeboard, absence of berms,
           degradation of channel, section and inspection pass and reduction of discharges at the
           tail, as well as damaged gates, structures and outlets.

If an FO failed to qualify under any of the eligibility criteria, it was asked to rectify the shortfalls
within a given date and then re-apply. Around 87% of the contracts were completed and for
remaining progress ranged between 50-80%. PIAC and AWB staff provided guidance to the FOs
in laying out earthwork and generally training in quality control, where the works are being
procured through CBCs. There were only two distributaries, which had a negligible progress
(between 0 to 19%). The overall progress has been satisfactory (Table 7).

The initial progress of this component was slow but picked up during the last year of project
implementation. In early stages the main impediments to rapid progress were mainly:
a) management issues at SIDA; b) ineffective coordination between various agencies and


                                                  35
consultants; c) inadequate facilitation/guidance provided to FOs; d) delays in paying the FOs and
contractors; and e) unrealistically small completion period for CBCs. Technical competency of
the PIAC was also a question mark. Shortcomings in quality control functions of the PIAC and
staff of AWBs were also observed by Bank missions. Supervision of works was scarce and less
frequent due to shortage of properly experienced staff with PIAC. Lack of adequate staffing in
AWBs that are acquired for supervisory assistance of FOs was a major issue. The AWBs had
less than sanctioned staff because they were not filled by IPD. This was one of the causes for the
delays in the implementation of this sub-component.
The contractual completion periods for each of the CBCs and NCBs were six months and nine
months, respectively. Most of the CBCs were delayed beyond the contracted period, with the
result that payments were withheld by SIDA. At project completion, there were still some
payments outstanding against completed contracts, leading to FOs’ cash flow problems.
From the outset, this sub-component was beset with implementation constraints due to
managerial, procedural and capacity related issues, which was compounded by the high turnover
of the Managing Directors of SIDA. The progress picked up during the last year of
implementation with the appointment of a Project Coordinator within SIDA.
Improvements of Branch Canals
Like the distributaries, branch canals were also in a deteriorated state. Many were operating with
inadequate free boards, eroded berms, inspection roads with in-adequate widths, deteriorated
outside embankments, severely reduced capacity due to sedimentation, and many damaged
hydraulic structures. Improvements were imperative to deliver water equitably amongst
distributary canals.
The project provided for the improvement of 6 branch canals, two each within the AWBs, after
the original target of 25 canals was revised. In general, the cost of the works would not exceed
Rs 400/ha of command area. Schemes with higher unit cost required prior IDA approval with the
condition that ERR exceeded 12%. Improvement works were similar to those envisaged for
distributary canals; with additional works related to water regulation. These included
motorization of regulator gates, installation of gauges and control structures for flow
measurement and installation of telecommunication/telemetry system for monitoring and
managing flows in branch canals. AWBs assisted by PIAC, were responsible for survey, design,
procurement and contract management.
Rehabilitation of 6 branch canals was carried out. All the 6 contracts for branch canals were
signed in 2006, except one contract, in Ghotki CAWB which was signed in 2007 (Table 8).

Initially a total of 18 Branch Canals, 6 in each of the three AWBs were planned for rehabilitation.
Although all the 18 Branch Canals were identified, tender documents for only 12 were prepared.
Out of these, the contracts for procuring the works for 6 schemes, two in each of the three AWBs,
had been awarded. There were significant cost overruns in the rehabilitation works, and this has
led to financial constraints, thus the works on only these 6 were executed.
Bank Missions identified the need to pay more attention to quality control both by the staff of
PIAC and concerned AWBs. PIAC staff was advised to follow the standard operating procedure
for supervising the construction work and perform mandatory checks (20% on quantity and
quality checks in the case of interim certificates and 100% check on completion). Some
Directors of AWBs had informed the Bank missions about the difficulty in meeting frequent
supervisory assistance to FOs for shortage of staff (appointed by IPD). This manpower issue did
have some impact on the shortfall of the target. Overall, the strategy adopted by the Bank and
GoSind for assigning limited works up to US$ 100,000 for CBC and higher for NCB appeared
reasonable and effective, taking into account the technical and experience limitations of FOs in
undertaking large scale works.
Environmental Issues
GoSindh had carried out an ISEA to assess the impacts of project activities on natural habitats,
land and soil, access of women and landless communities to water, and increased pesticide use
on public health, and suggested mitigation measures. The environmental aspects of the Project
were designed to support the implementation of mitigation measures identified in the ISEA. A
set of guidelines was prepared by the project which also addressed the additional conditions of
approval imposed by Sindh Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA). The task of
environmental monitoring was assigned to the M&E consultants under the project. The
assignment consisted of four stage reporting process, and ensured that the environmental issues
were addressed adequately.



                                                   37
Generally, the environmental precautions followed under the project were successful. The task of
tree plantation, to compensate against tree cuttings, was achieved successfully. The target of
planting 74,037 trees was raised to 84,037, with the planting of 10,000 more trees by the
DGAEWM during the monsoon season 2009. Some 52,840 were planted in WC areas, against a
planting of about 31,200 in the distributary/minor canals. Survival rate of trees is believed to
have been about 53% for DGAEWM and 37% for SIDA planted trees, which reduces the impact
intended by the project.
There is a need to develop a mass awareness program to sensitize the rural population on
environmental issues. Current levels of awareness are very low. The training sessions initiated
under the project need to be continued and made a regular component of extension activities in
the AWB canal commands. Some FOs expressed reservations about adequacy of design of the
washing bays and cattle baths and felt need for improvements. Currently, the designs
standardized by Federal Government for past projects are being followed, which may require
some modifications/adjustments according to the particular needs of farmers and water users of
the area. The project implementation activities did not result in any displacement of residences or
business.

Improvement of WCs
The procedures as outlined in paras 13 and 14 of the Main Phase of the project were followed in
the SOFWM-AFP. The progress on WC improvement was satisfactory as target of 1400 WCs
was exceeded through the construction of 1421 WCs (Table 9).

The Mission during the field visits confirmed that quality of construction of WC improvement
especially the lined section was of reasonable standards. Rather some of the WCAs have
achieved higher standards of quality including the earthen banks and side dressing. However, the
quality of earthen sections was less than that of desired quality, because of not following the
standard procedures: a) earthen channel was not demolished and most of the trees and bushes
were not removed; b) the layout and alignment was not in line with the engineering design
especially due to social problems or ineffective WCAs; and c) inadequate compaction of earthen
channel section. The AFP impact study conducted by the G3 Consultants indicated that the
overall WC conveyance efficiency was 78% against the baseline of 67.33% (Table 4). The
increase in WC conveyance efficiency is 16% at the project level, against a target of 20%. The
reasons of not achieving the target of increasing WC conveyance efficiency of 20% are:


                                                38
       •    An overall baseline was adopted while evaluating the improvements in WC conveyance
            efficiency;
       •    The target of 20% increase in WC conveyance efficiency is difficult to achieve in most of
            the WCs having over 70% un-lined section. What was needed was to clearly state in the
            PAD that for each of the WCs to be lined, there have to be measurements made for the
            estimation of baseline WC conveyance efficiency. Thus, before and after improvement
            scenarios will provide more realistic assessment of improvements in the WC conveyance
            efficiency.
       •    Cut-throat flumes are used to measure discharge in the unlined sections and most of the
            flow regimes, after installing these flumes or even before, due to very little gradient,
            become sub-merged, and cut-throat flumes do not provide accurate results. The best
            option is the broad-crested weirs which are especially designed for the flat gradient
            situations prevailing in Sindh. Rather, such broad-crested weirs can be constructed in the
            channel so that WCA is aware of the conveyance losses even in post-improvement
            scenario. This will improve the capacity of WCAs in managing conveyance losses.
       •    The WC conveyance efficiency values for the lined channel are reasonable as current
            meter was used for the measurement of flows and losses.

Overall, the water conveyance efficiency is reasonable and it can be improved by following the
procedures laid down for the earthen improvements. The major increase in water conveyance
efficiency will come through improvements in earthen sections of the WC rather than the lined
channel (Table 10).

The end of project WC conveyance efficiency as reported by the PICR is 83% against the
baseline of 67%, indicating an increase of 24% but no details are provided in the PICR for the
three AWBs.
For the assessment of the impacts of water savings through WC improvement, the cropping
intensity was computed for the three AWBs and for the project. The overall increase in cropping
intensity at the project level is 15%, which is 50% higher than the target cropping intensity of

intensity

The findings of the Mission are:
    •    The cropping intensity as per impact study is 143.6, 138.9 and 133.5% at the head,
         middle and tail reaches of the WC, respectively. However, during the Mission dialogues
         with the WCA’s farmers at the tail-reaches indicated that their cropping intensity is
         around 100% or even less and at the head many farmers got 200% cropping intensity.
         The Mission is of the opinion that cropping intensity data can only be verified if same
         WC is used for the baseline and for the impact study.
    •    Few farmers who were getting 200% cropping intensity even before the improvement can
         increase it further as their land is limited until they add a third crop. The farmers will be
         looking forward for this option in the future. Mostly the small farmers are having higher
         cropping intensity with self-cultivation.
    •    Same baseline for cropping intensity for all the WCs is not the best option to be used for
         the estimation of savings in water. Therefore concept of benchmark farmers as adopted in
         the early projects (i.e. before and after scenarios) has to be adopted in future projects.

Construction of Water Storage Tanks
The AFP included the construction of 130 water tanks initially for Barani areas. Against the
target of 130 water storage tanks, 130 water storage tanks each with a capacity of storing water
of 6,400 ft3 for the Barani areas or 6400 m3 for the tail-end of the WC command in the AWBs.
The rest of the conditions are same.
The findings of the mission are:
         •   The water storage tanks in the WC commands of AWBs are constructed for storage
             volume of 6400 m3 and at a cost of around PKR2.5 million.
         •   The water storage tank is constructed in the lands of one farmer so in reality it is
             owned by one farmer and thus sharing of stored water depends on the preferences of
             the owner.


                                                  40
        •   The stored water will be around 6000 m3 and will be sufficient to irrigate 4-6 ha (10
            to 15 acres) for one irrigation.
        •   The stored water can be used through pumping of water. The SOFWM staff indicated
            that it is shared by number of farmers but how the water share of different farmers is
            stored and how it is distributed are the questions to be addressed? However, family
            members can get benefit as land within the family is sometime divided on paper but
            managed jointly.
        •   In general, the benefit goes to one household, and the cost is too high for benefiting
            10 to 15 acres, for an irrigation using the stored water. The cost of construction of
            PKR2.5 million is equivalent to improve two medium size WCs, where the benefit
            goes to many.
        •   The community indicated that the stored water in the tank is largely needed for
            domestic and stock water purposes during the period of annual canal closure of 30
            days. In areas where groundwater is usable for domestic and stock water purposes the
            feasibility and cost-effectiveness of these tanks is difficult to justify.
        •   The quality of construction of water storage tanks is highly satisfactory.

Environmental Issues
The SOFWM had carried out ISEA to assess the impacts of AFP activities on natural habitats,
land, soil, access of women and landless communities to water, and increased pesticide use on
public health, and suggested mitigation measures.
The Mission is of the opinion that the environmental precautions followed under the project were
satisfactory. Task of tree plantation, to compensate against tree cuttings, was achieved
satisfactorily. Target of planting 710 trees during the monsoon season of 2009 was achieved
(Table 12), but the survival rate was 38% at the project level (Table 13), which is extremely low.
Survival rate of trees is believed to have been around 90% for irrigated areas. Therefore, targeted
values were not accomplished. The other environmental non-compliance indicators were
identified and fully mitigated for washing bays, excavated silts and diversion channels. Due to
the low survival rate of trees planted by the WCA (Table 13), the revised strategy of planting
trees in protected areas was developed and implemented. The average survival rate was 87%,
which is quite reasonable (Table 14).

Component 3: Productivity Enhancement

C.1.     Main Phase of the Project
Land Leveling: Around 100,000 acres of land were planned to be leveled using 150 laser-
levelers to be supplied to FOs, at 50% subsidy. Unfortunately, only two laser levelers were
supplied, and the area leveled was only 1,700 acres. This activity, which was reserved to FOs
only, was later neglected when these beneficiaries did not come forward with the funds required
to take advantage of the highly cost-effective offer.
Demonstration Centers: As part of agricultural productivity enhancement, the project
established 89 demonstration centers within the AWBs, against a target of 100 centers. These
centers were engaged in the dissemination of a full range of improved water management and
irrigation agronomic practices to farmers, as well as in the training of FOs/WCAs in improved
irrigation management, including the volumetric delivery of water, assessment of water charges,
soil amendments for reclamation of saline and sodic soils. The centers, which were selected with
the active participation of FOs, were operated by the field staff of the Department of Agriculture,
both DGAEWM and DGAE, with the assistance of PIAC. After two years of operation, they
were handed over to the FOs for continuation on their own; hence their sustainability will depend
on the capacity and willingness of the FOs to pursue them.
Each center, covering an area of 5 acres, was located near villages for easy access and visibility,
and was established with the active involvement of FOs. The staff of DGAEWM was responsible
for the demonstration of improved irrigation and on-farm water management practices; while

                                                        42
DGAE’s staff undertook the responsibility for demonstrating improved agronomic practices.
These teams were supported by PIAC who had to train staff and farmers associated with these
centers in sustainable agricultural practices and on farm management. The centers have played a
positive role in raising farmers’ awareness and know-how in efficient use of irrigation water and
improved agricultural practices (Table 15).

Integrated Pest management - IPM: An IPM program was introduced by the project under the
auspices of DGAE. The actual implementation was carried out by field staff trained under the
project, under the supervision of the Director of Plant Protection, with the support of agricultural
extension and information service, which helped for awareness-raising within the communities.
The IPM program succeeded in establishing 55 Farmers’ Field Schools (FFSs), trained 154
facilitators and 10,120 male and female farmers. Training in FFS approach of IPM concentrated
in six crops, okra, cotton, chilies, onion, rice and mango (Table 16).

According to the project impact study, farmers who participated in the program were able to
identify harmful and beneficial insects, as well as to calibrate and apply pesticides when needed.
FFS approach of IPM farmers reduced the number of pesticides use by up to 53%. However,
some cotton growers did not use pesticide applications at all. They used bio-pesticides (Neem,
Akk and Garlic etc.). They were proficient and their confidence level was excellent. The study
further described that farmers trained in IPM methods were apt at identifying and solving
problems themselves. In one district (Umerkot) one FFS of 30 female participants were

                                                    43
facilitated by a female facilitator/in-charge of the school. These farmers were found to be
particularly conversant with the IPM method and willing to follow the recommendations.
During interviews of Non-FFS farmers, it was observed that they lacked knowledge of IPM
practices particularly pests, bio-control agents, light traps and bio-pesticides, therefore applied
pesticides indiscriminately on their crops. The study further revealed that of the areas covered by
the IPM program, a maximum reduction of pesticides use of about 70% was observed in cotton
(at Sanghar district), and a minimum reduction of 22% in rice (Badin district); with an overall
mean reduction of 53% on different crops. Although in many cases, the yields of non-IPM
trained farmers were normally above those obtained by IPM trained farmers, the net returns were
not any better once the costs of the pesticides are factored in.
Project has conducted studies related to pesticide residues through an academic institution, and
showed that soil samples taken from where IPM was operating were free of pesticides, except for
very few samples; while those taken from other areas had significant quantities of residues.
Positive result of the IPM program has created a strong awareness within the farming community.
A pilot scale operation was carried out under the project to promote the use of organic composts
and crop residues in concert with WCAs and FOs. Twenty five demonstration plots were laid out,
and the project encouraged farmers to initiate micro level enterprises by WCAs/FOs for
composting and earth worm culture to enhance soil fertility. To this end, Training in organic
compost making was given to 25 Agricultural Officers who spearheaded the program, and
worked with facilitators and field staff who were also given some training by the project. The
results of the demonstration were encouraging and showed some improvement in the organic
matter content in most of the treated plots. It is too early to see the effect of this pilot operation,
but some farmers appear to have adopted compost making techniques demonstrated under the
project.
Side by side to these programs, the project had undertaken the dissemination of messages in
good agricultural practices in the rural community. Three Kiosks in each of the AWBs were
established from which farmers could get information materials – leaflets and posters; and the
media (press, radio, television and video shows using cinema vans). Field awareness workshops
were also part of the information dissemination drive. Unfortunately, the impact evaluation of
the information dissemination program has not been carried out.

C.2.   Additional Financing Phase of the Project

Laser Land Levelling
In contrast to the failure of this intervention in the Main Phase of the Project, this intervention
was successfully introduced in the AFP. In this component, four hundred Laser land levelling
units were distributed to the farmers on equal cost sharing basis. A target of 30,000 ha was set
for levelling of land in the project area. Achievements of all the interventions were exceeded the
targets (Table 17). However, the impacts of Laser land levelling in improving application



                                                 44
efficiency, savings in water, increased productivity and reduction in salinity could not be
assessed. The findings of the Mission are:
    •   Laser land levelling units were distributed to farmers, therefore these units will largely
        stay with the farmers and purpose of provision of equipment will not be fully
        accomplished. These units have to be provided to the tractor rentals so that they can
        initiate services to the farmers. These local tractor rentals will ultimately become the
        local service providers.
    •   The salinity is common in the project area due to high water table and unlevelled lands.
        The Laser land levelling units would help to reduce the salt build-up in the fields.
    •   The verifiable indicators for the impact of Laser land levelling may be developed in the
        future projects including savings in water due to enhanced water application efficiency,
        reduction in duration of irrigation, reduced soil salinity and enhanced productivity.
    •   The major factors affecting productivity of crops are salinity, waterlogging and lack of
        precision farming. In future projects, the service providers can be provided machinery for
        precision planting on Laser levelled fields so that optimal plant population can be
        achieved, which is one of the major factor in enhancing productivity.

Off-season Vegetables in Shade Houses
The targets of shade houses were fully met and farmers started utilizing the shade houses for
production of off-season and high value vegetables (Table 17).
Productivity
The productivity targets set for wheat and cotton were achieved fully (Table 18). However, the
target set for sugarcane could not be achieved as average productivity in the project area was
13.1% against a target of 23%. The findings of the Mission are:
    •    Theoretically speaking the potential increase in cropping intensity is almost double of the
         savings in water lost through conveyance in WC. The increase in productivity is


                                                   45
        dependent on the water and non-water inputs. Therefore, the targets set for productivity
        enhancement should not be more than 10% for different crops for the first two years and
        then it can be increased once the farmers are conversant with the best practices.
    •   The enhancement in productivity will take longer time than the increase in cropping
        intensity because cropping intensity is mainly a function of water and land.

IPM – Integrated Pest Management
IPM program was introduced by the project under the auspices of the Sindh Agricultural
Extension. The actual implementation was carried out by field staff trained under the project,
under the supervision of the Director, Plant Protection, with the support of agricultural extension
and information service through creating awareness within the communities. The IPM program
succeeded in establishing 123 FFSs by Agriculture Extension in 6 districts and for 6 crops,
trained 115 facilitators and 3075 male and female farmers in six districts and for six crops.
Trainings were provided to 4650 farmers by the FFSs and target was fully achieved. Twenty-
three trainings were conducted for facilitators by the CABI Bio-sciences for six crops and at six
locations (Table 19).
In addition, 300 farmers were trained in the safe use of pesticides, 150 samples were collected
for testing of pesticide residues. Reference courses (150) were also organized for the facilitators
by the CABI Bio-sciences (Table 19).
The performance of IPM in terms of location and crops is presented in Table 20. The FFSs were
established in Mirpur Khas, Umerkot, Sanghar, Ghotki, Tando Mohammad Khan, and Badin.
Trainings under FFS were concentrated in six crops (Table 20). The targets assigned for each of
the intervention was fully achieved in number of events. However, data is limited indicating the
impact of IPM in reduced use of pesticides without reducing the crop productivity.

Monitoring and Evaluation

The M&E sub-component in the Main Phase of the Project was implemented by the consultants,
and their assignment included the monitoring of project implementation and the assessment of its
impact on physical, environment, engineering, agricultural, sociological, financial and economic
parameters. As envisaged by the project, the M&E was designed to provide for continuous
learning and adjustment of project approach. The M&E consultants prepared the work plan,
which was approved early on, and started their field studies and collection of secondary data
immediately. They also carried out baseline survey and prepared MIS database. Given the
numerous, variables to be monitored, the M&E sub-component required a comprehensive
methodology. Therefore, it was decided to have three research methods: sample survey, case
study, and experimental design. This was believed to provide a complete coverage of socio-
economic dynamics, hydrological dimensions, institutional reform, and capacity building of FOs
and WCAs. With a comprehensive system in place, the M&E system was able to provide timely
and continuous feed back to the project implementing agencies on project performance.
The case study method was used for the in-depth study of FOs and WCAs, and has helped in
giving comprehensive understanding of their development overtime. Case studies were carried

                                                       47
out on sample populations established in various areas, and these studies have provided a wealth
of information concerning these organizations. The M&E sub-component produced quarterly
reports which were very useful management tools. Overall, 49 reports were produced by the
M&E consultants, including 32 quarterly reports on different topic, 4 case studies on FOs and
WCAs, a mid-term review, a project impact assessment study and a completion report, just to
cite the main documents.
The impact assessment study produced by the M&E consultants is a comprehensive document
which deals with all the fields covered by the project, viz., water conveyance and distribution
equity, agricultural productivity, developmental issues of FOs and WCAs, poverty alleviation,
gender development and the environment. The study which compared its findings with the
baseline survey has come up with conclusive results about the significant impact made by the
project in terms advancing the reform, improving water management and enhancing agricultural
productivity. The monitoring and evaluation exercise was intensive, and the findings were
reported periodically until the completion of the project.
Much of the difficulties and delays in implementation faced by the project were promptly
reported by the M&E unit, and was instrumental in inducing management to take remedial
actions, such as in the area of environmental protection, by planting more trees, or in gender
matters by devising programs in favor of women farmers. M&E reports were also helpful in
drawing the attention of project management to the slow capacity building process of FOs,
triggering a renewed emphasis on improving their training program.
It is unfortunate that the project’s M&E work could not be continued with the termination of the
assignment of the consultants, and that it was not passed on to either SIDA or the Department of
Agriculture. It could have been a useful instrument of management to GoSindh and other entities
had some aspects of the M&E was retained within the relevant agencies.
For the AFP the G3 Consultants are responsible for supervision of the Project but the M&E
Component was not contracted to them. The DGAEWM was responsible for the M&E
Component. They have established M&E Unit for the routine M&E of the project. However, G3
was responsible for impact monitoring of various technical and social components of the project
and they have conducted a study of Impact monitoring and evaluation and their results are used
in preparing the Annex 2.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

A. Project Benefits Assumptions in the PAD

Context at Appraisal: The economic analysis carried out at appraisal focused on quantifiable
benefits derived from increased cropping intensity and crop yields. The benefits would arise
from project’s improvement in the availability, reliability and equity of water deliveries, and the
adoption of better on-farm water management and agronomic practices by farmers. It was
envisaged that the total area to be covered by the project would be about 760,000. However, the
direct quantifiable benefits were calculated for the area covered by the WCs only, equivalent to
an area of 526,600 ha. Although not included in the economic rate of return calculation, a
number of indirect benefits were identified in the PAD, viz., reduced drainage requirements;
reduced soil salinity risks; reduced incidence of stagnant pools of water and decrease in diseases;
reduced negative impact of water logging on buildings and roads; and the creation of additional
employment.
The Assumptions of PAD were based on evaluations of past WC improvement projects (e.g.
Third On-Farm Water Management Project; OFWM-III) which showed that WC improvement
resulted in a 26 percent increase on average on the amount of water delivered to farms. This led
to marked increase in cropping intensity and yields, as well as some shift towards higher value
crops. In Sindh, cropping intensities increased by 8 percent compared to control areas. There
were significant increases in the various crop yields. 22 Since these past projects included
primarily WC improvement with no investment in the distributaries and productivity
enhancement measures, the above benefits can be attributed to WC improvement only. The ICR
of the OFWM-III emphasized on improved management with farmer’s participation that reduces
O&M, but mainly increases equity of water distribution.

B. Main Assumptions for Project Benefits

Area Considered for Project Benefits. In addition to the rehabilitation of WCs, the project has
rehabilitated about 90 distributaries/minor canals and 6 branch canals. However, given the
difficulty in judging the exact area falling within these rehabilitated canals, the computation of
benefits, made at the completion of the main SOFWM Project in April 2010 (called Main Project,
or MP) as well as in April 2014 at the completion of SOFWP-MP’s Additional Financing (AF)
phase, has been confined to WC improvement only. To give more rigor to the analysis, as was
done when original PAD was prepared, a conservative estimate of the area benefiting from the
project shows that 6,076 WCs were improved benefiting about 1,037,442 ha of culturally
commanded land.



22
  For example, 9 percent-13 percent increase in yield of paddy; 4 percent-11 percent for wheat; 5 percent-12 percent
for seed cotton; 14 percent-28 percent for sugarcane; 8 percent for fodder and 4 percent for orchards.

                                                        50
The project has improved 4,355 WCs in the irrigated areas and 300 in the rainfed or barani areas,
benefiting about 605,600 ha of land during the MP phase and 1,421 WCs within the three AWBs
with 431,807 ha of area commanded by irrigation, some 510,842 ha more than what has been
estimated at appraisal. The comparative figures of the MP and AF-phases, and the total for the
SOFWMP are presented in Table 1.

Cropping Intensities and Yields: At the completion of MP, a project impact assessment study
was carried out for the project’s M&E Unit in 2010. The cropping intensity in the project area, as
indicated in this study, increased by 17.7 percent, considerably higher than the 10 percent
predicted at appraisal. It resulted into significant increases in crop yields, as shown on the Table
below. The M&E unit had also carried out a baseline survey at the beginning of the project, and
the increase in the cropping intensities and crop yields, for the without and with the project
(WOP and WP) situations were compared with this information. Although the project impact
assessment study has shown the achievement of high yields, for project analysis purposes, the
ICR mission of 2010 adopted a path that assumed slightly lower yields than the findings of the
limited sample-based study. The yields of the most important crops used in MP’s economic
analysis were estimated as shown in Table 2.

During the implementation of the AF phase of the project, G3 Consultants carried out, among
other responsibilities, a project impact assessment study at the end of the AF phase. They
determined water delivery efficiency and other parameters, such as crop intensities and yields, of
a larger sample; 280 WC from the three AWBs for the WP situation but used the earlier results
of the M&E unit for the baseline crop yields. This SOFWMP-AF Phase impact assessment study
has also shown higher crop intensities and crop yields. The ICR mission of 2014 used crop
production data of the Sindh Agriculture Statistics of the 8 districts that fall within the command
areas of the three AWBs, to compute average crop intensities and yields for the WOP situation,
and compared both WOP and WP situations with the baseline figures reported at the appraisal
stage of the project (PAD, p. 72). The yields of the most important crops used in AF’s economic
analysis were estimated as shown in Table 3.
Agricultural Production: Based on the above assumptions, the project’s incremental crop
production is as shown in Table 4.
Prices: The financial and economic prices used in the project analysis are based on constant
prices of March 2010 and January 2014 for the MP and AF phases of the project. Farm budgets
and incomes are based on prevailing market prices. Economic prices of non-traded commodities
have been converted to economic prices using a standard conversion factor of 0.9, and 0.92
respectively. However, the economic prices of traded commodities are based on export and
import parity prices as shown in Tables 1 and 2 for the March 2010 and January 2014 price
regimes respectively.
Costs: All project costs have been included in the analysis. Economic project costs, net of taxes
and duties, have been calculated by applying the standard conversion factor. Costs incurred
during the investment period have been re-instated in constant 2010 and 2014 prices using the
average annual consumer price index (CPI) 23 of 11.4 for Pakistan.
Farm incomes: The financial and economic analysis is based on farm budgets, one hectare (ha)
or acre, for each crop. Gross revenues and production costs were computed by using the
commodity prices at the farmgate or at the nearest market point of sale or purchase, and gross
margins (benefits) were determined as differentials between gross revenues and production costs.
There were insufficient details of cropping pattern and of each category of farm size, i.e. small,
medium and large farms at the time of March 2010 (for the MP’s analysis) to enable meaningful
analysis. However, as the farm size data of the 2010 Pakistan Agriculture Census (Sindh volume)
was publically available later on, farmers’ net income has been calculated using the farm
categories of the FWOP and FWP in the 8 districts that fall into the three AWBs included in the
project.
The set of two tables below, indicate that farms with small landholding size, at appraisal of the
project, were perceived to be more efficient in obtaining incremental farm income in the FWP

   The yield of cotton at Project completion represents mostly Bt cotton (the average yield of upland (35%) and Bt cotton (65%), Percent increase in cotton yield
is compared with baseline cotton yield of 2,544kg/ha reported in the PIAR, as it cannot be compared the baseline cotton yield (2001-02, reported in PAD)
because there was no Bt cotton at that time and the yield was based on upland and indigenous cotton only.

However, at the project completion, a similar analysis indicate that incremental income of farms
with small landholding size in the FWP situation over the FWOP situation farms has more than
doubled, than that at appraisal stage of the project. It may be noted that the medium size farms
are slightly behind the small farms in obtaining incremental farm income in the FWP situation
over the FWOP situation by 6 percentage points; but surprisingly the large size farms have not
been as much efficient than the small or medium size farms, as they are 27 to 33 percentage
points behind the medium/small farms as far as difference between the FWOP and FWP situation
is concerned. Based on the detailed perusal of farm budgets, it is noticeable that in the later
project implementation years, almost all farms are increasingly adopting hybrid rice and Bt
cotton varieties in their cropping patterns; the yields of these crops 50-70 percent more on an
average with little difference in production cost such as that of hybrid rice but certainly much
less cost in the case of Bt cotton. The data in the table below compares the average farm incomes
under the Additional Financing phase of the project.

FWOP is Future without Project; FWP is Future with Project; CI is Cropping intensity.
 Note: The baseline (2001) prices has been updated with actual prices of December 2013 and January 2014 for a meaningful
comparison of the baseline indicated in the PAD vis-à-vis the 2014 situations of FWOP and FWP..

Internal Rate of Return




                                                             57
Based on the assumptions given above, internal rates of return (IRRs), both economic and
financial have been calculated for the project over 20 years. This has yielded an ERR of 25.3
percent, with a net present value (NPV at 12 percent discount rate) of PKR91.5 million
(Table 3.10) on an integrated basis for the MP and AF phases of the project. The ERR is higher
than the PAD estimate of 21 percent. The main reason for the difference is the increased number
of WCs improved (6,076) under the project, compared to the PAD estimate (4,000), which
enabled an additional irrigated area of about 510,842 ha. Although less meaningful, a financial
rate of return has also been carried out for the project as a whole for the purposes of comparison
with the PAD, which is 25.4 percent, also higher than the PAD estimate of about 19 percent.
Tables 3.11 and 3.12 give ERRs and FRRs for the MP and AF phases of the project separately.
Sensitivity Analysis and Switching values
The project’s ERR is not sensitive to reasonable increase in costs or reduction in benefits.
Switching values have been calculated to ascertain the effects of increase in costs and decrease in
benefits. The analysis shows that a simultaneous increase of 10 percent in costs and a 20 percent
decrease in benefits will reduce the ERR by 14 points from 25.3 percent to 11.3 percent, which is
slightly below the opportunity cost of capital. Costs must increase by 18 percent and benefits
drop by 10 percent to have an ERR of 12.0 percent or the break-even point. Summary of
sensitivity analysis is given below:

Sensitivity Analysis                                                         ERR

10 percent Increase in costs                                                 14.5 percent
20 percent Increase in costs                                                 13.2 percent
20 percent decrease in benefits                                              12.6 percent
 10 percent Increase in costs and 20 percent decrease in benefits            11.3 percent
20 percent Increase in costs and 20 percent decrease in benefits             10.1 percent
Beak even point:
Cost over-run by 18 percent; benefits reduction by 10 percent                12.0 percent

3. Implementation and Management Arrangements
Project Co-ordination Unit (PCU): The Agriculture Department established a PCU headed by
Secretary Agriculture Department as Project Coordinator (PC) and assisted by a Deputy Project
Coordinator (DPC) and support staff. The main role of the Project Coordinator (PC) during the
project preparation and approval phase was to facilitate for timely implementation of critical
actions and maintain close liaison with the Bank.
Project Coordination Committee (PCC): A Project Coordination Committee (PCC), headed by
the PC (Secretary Agriculture) was responsible for coordination among various agencies and
facilitating project implementation. The PCC had representatives of SIDA, AWBs and FOs as its
members. The DGAEWM acted as the Member/Secretary of the committee.
Project Steering Committee (PSC): A Project Steering Committee (PSC) headed by the
Additional Chief Secretary Development (ACS) Planning and Development Department,
Government of Sindh and comprising, Secretary Agriculture, Secretary Finance, Secretary
Irrigation and Power Department, Managing Director SIDA, Director General AEWM, and
representative of the Federal Water Management Cell as members. The PSC was mandated for
following policy decisions:
   •   Review on an annual basis Physical and Financial Progress Reports, Evaluate Outcomes,
       Ensures consistency of Project Implementation with the Implementation Frame Work,
       provide policy guidelines and advise implementing agencies on issues affecting
       implementation.



                                                72
    •   Ensure provision of adequate budgetary allocation for timely implementation and
        completion of the project.
    •   Resolves issues not settled by the PCC.
    •   Ensure adequacy and continuity of project management staff and
    •   Ensures that project complies with legal financial convents.

Farmers Participation as FOs and WCAs:
Project Monitoring and Evaluation Arrangement. Monitoring and Evaluation of this project
was designed in a way to provide continuous learning and adjustment of project approach and
involved (a) Participatory monitoring based on self-defined indicators by FOs and WCAs, (b)
Monitoring data on inputs, outputs and impacts/outcomes by DG(AE&WM) through M&E
consultants, and (c) IDA supervision.
The DG (AE&WM) assisted by M&E consultants in updating the M&E database. For
monitoring physical and financial progress, analyze key performance indicators and collate
quarterly progress reports for submission to the PSC and IDA. The M&E system provided
continuous feed back to the implementing agencies on the project’s performance. Each
implementing agency contributed to the M&E system.
Project Management Support through PIA Consultants: The Project provided technical
assistance through Project Implementation Assistance (PIA) consultants for project launch,
supervision, reviews, procurement, development of project management information system,
training, monitoring and preparation of regional/strategic Socio-Economic and Environmental
Impact Assessment of the Project.
4. Project Output/Results
The main findings of M&E related to different output of key indicators are mentioned as under:
(a) Social Mobilization and Capacity Building
•   Under this project 4,355 WCAs were established throughout Sindh province whereas 93 FOs
    have been formed by the Agriculture Department through the Social Mobilization staff in
    three notified Area Water Boards i.e. Nara Canal, Left Bank and Ghotki Feeder Canal.
•   The WCAs are constituent bodies of FOs. They were established during the process of FO
    formation.
•   A total of 85 FOs under SOFWMP were registered with RA-SIDA and total number 839
    BoM members of 158 newly formed FOs (85 formed under SOFWMP and 73 under NDP re
    programming scheme) were trained up to December 2009.
•   841 staff members of Social Mobilization Group (SMG), Water Management Officers
    (WMO SM), Financial Management Group (FMG), PIAC and AWBs and 1,288 farmer
    members from 309 FOs of three AWBs were provided specialized trainings.
•   550 refresher training events were organized under which 9,988 farmer members of FOs 03
    AWBs i.e., NCAWB, LBCAWB and GFCAWB were trained up to December 2009.


                                                73
•   Considering gender aspect of the project 2259 women farmers identified in the command
    area of FO managed Minors/Distributaries at 3 Area Water Boards (AWBs) among them,
    921 women farmers have taken membership in WCAs of different FOs and 19 women
    groups formed with a total of 266 members.

(b) Improvement of Irrigation Facilities
    •   4355 WCs improved under SOFWM against the target of 4,000 WCs.
    •   346 water storage tanks have been completed against revised target of 300.
    •   87 distributaries/minor canals against the target of 100 were rehabilitated through SIDA
        which are being managed by FOs.
    •   Improved 06 branch canals against original target of 25 branch canals supplying water to
        distributaries managed by FOs. This project’s target was revised up to 6 branch canals as
        agreed by World Bank.
    •   Conveyance efficiency improved on improved WCs by about 23.74 percent (82.77
        percent vs. 66.89 percent) against project target of 20 percent during the project period.
    •   The number of missed turns reduced from 7.79 to 3.67 (53 percent) against the target 70
        percent reduction in missed turns.
    •   Conveyance efficiency increased 70 to 90 percent.
    •   Cropping intensity emerged as (133.08 percent) during the final year 2008-09, which is
        improved by 15 percent as compared to baseline situation (115.54 percent).
    •   Tail-enders received due share of water of 80 percent against baseline of 60 percent.
    •   In terms of crop yield, wheat, rice, sugarcane and cotton were significantly improved


(c) Productivity Enhancement
•   It was planned to level 100,000 acres of land in the areas of operation of SOFWM through
    150 laser-guided equipments, whereas only 1700 acres were leveled through the purchase of
    only 2 laser levelers by FOs.
•   89 demonstration centers were established against target of 100 through the agriculture staff
    deployed under Director General AE&WM.
•   250 field staff and 9,000 farmers were trained in Integrated Pest Management (IPM) through
    establishment of Farmer Field School (FFS), analysis of 210 pesticide residual (PR) samples
    were made, established 280 FFSs and also 3 studies were conducted to see the issues and
    impacts of IPM.
•   25 Agriculture Officers were trained and 25 demonstration plots were established under
    Integrated Plant and Soil Nutrient Management (IPSNM) sub-component.
•   The DGAE made possible in publishing of monthly magazines, distribution of agriculture
    related literature/booklets, and information dissemination and demand promotion through
    electronic and print media.


                                                74
•   03 Information Kiosks were established in each AWBs for information dissemination to the
    stakeholders and established website providing useful information to the Farmers in the field
    of agriculture, irrigation and marketing.

Poverty Reduction: Increased crop, orchard and milk yields, livestock sale and enhanced
income from off-farm sources resulted in higher annual per capita as well as daily per capita
incomes since baseline. This caused a reduction in rural poverty (proportion of population living
below poverty line) in the project jurisdiction. Apart from exogenous factors, project components
also contributed in poverty reduction. There was a reduction of 16.26 percent in sample
population living below poverty line (27.73 percent vs. 43.99 percent) since baseline situation.
The results of analysis of socio-economic sample surveys indicate an inverse correlation between
farm size and cropping intensities, crop yields of major and minor crops, per hectare gross/net
crop incomes as well as efficient usage of agricultural inputs, as a result of optimum
management of land, labor and capital resources. This implied that focusing on (small) farm size
below 5.06 hectare could be instrumental for rural poverty reduction and subsequent
development. It means that focus of policy planning is to be on developing pro-poor strategy on
basic structural changes, as there is no short-cut to effective land reforms in the province. The
main conclusion of M&E sample surveys that physical and agricultural targets of SOFWM
project are well within the desired goals.
Impact Evaluation of FOs/WCAs: According to performance evaluation during the period of
study, none of the FO/WCA case studies were able to achieve the status of either “successful”
(“A” category), or “failure” (“D” category). All 12 FOs retained positions of “B”, or “semi
successful” and “C”, or “least successful” up to the final period of study. It implied that all FOs
demonstrated stability in their performance overtime. In case of WCA performance level
majority of (14) WCAs attained the status of “B”, or “semi successful” category. While,
remaining one WCA was placed in “C” or “least successful” category during the period under
study. The main findings are given below in tabular form.
Abiana Collection: Out of 12 FOs understudy, 11 FOs had received “abiana” assessment for the
year 2007-08. On an overall basis 11 FOs were able to collect about 51 percent of assessed
“abiana”. It was pertinent to note that FO of Wangi minor did not collect any amount of “abiana”,
since its formation. Six FOs (Bagi, Bhurgari, Chatto, Mehroo and Silore) collected less than 50
percent of the assessed amount during the period. Only three FOs (Rawtani, Sheikhani and
Defense) minors collected more than 50 percent of the assessed amount, while FO of Defense
minor demonstrated the highest performance by collecting 82.4 percent. On the other hand, FO
Wangi could not succeed to collect any amount of “abiana” during whole study span.
It is matter of concern that six of the 12 case study FOs did not deposited any assessed amount of
“abiana” to AWBs and only two FOs (Rawtani and Sheikhani) were able to deposit prescribed
(60 percent) share to AWBs during the study period.
Institutional Capacity Building: An ineffective after-care arrangement left FOs/WCAs in
vacuum, which resulted into “stand alone” situation without having systematic feedback, vertical

                                                75
and horizontal linkages between and within FOs/WCAs. Regular backup support to FOs/WCAs
is a “must” particularly in the areas of O&M of the system, resolution of the disputes relating to
“abiana” assessment/collection, showing downward trend financial management and tackling
administrative problems.
Physical Impact: From empirical findings, it is evident that structural improvement and quality
of rehabilitation work have positive correlation with improved DPR values resulting into higher
water distribution equity for tail end WCs in FO case study as well as in randomly selected FO-
managed MDs.
Of 12 FO case study MDs structural improvement (construction of outlets, installation of gauges
and rehabilitation of gates) and rehabilitation work (earthwork, construction of IP/NIP, berms
and side slopes) have been completed on eleven (Mir, Bagi, Bhurgari, Rawtani, Sangi, Silore,
Chattoo-Ex Mehroo, Shekhani, Wangi, Chatto and Defense) MDs, while work remained
suspended at Mehroo minor due to dispute among the local communities. Tempered outlets and
absence of calibrated gauges were found at Mehroo and Chatto minors. Discussing physical
conditions of randomly selected FO managed MDs, earth work and structural improvement was
completed on nine (Mahi, Bakro, Baiji, Mureed, Toori, Juriasar, Matli, Panjtana and Belaro)
minors/distributaries.
As for as quality of earth work is concerned, required standards (quality of borrowed earth,
workmanship and compaction) were relatively improved during rehabilitation of IP/NIP, berms
and side slopes on recently selected FO case study MDs as compared to earlier selected MDs
during the period under review.
The physical status particularly lining and rehabilitation of WCs and minor/distributaries attained
somewhat momentum with the passage of time. The lining percentage of WCs was close to the
prescribed length (30 percent of the total WC length).
Environmental Impact
   •   The incidence of tree cutting at selected minor/distributary/branch canals came to a
       complete halt since April 2008. The Agriculture Department and SIDA took concrete
       efforts for compensatory tree plantation as a mitigation measure (2 trees for each one
       cutting trees) as agreed by the Bank. Initially about 74,000 trees plantation were made
       (consisting 42,841 by DGAEWM and rest by SIDA up to monsoon season 2009) to make
       the environment friendly and also comply the environmental guidelines of Bank.
   •   The SIDA has planted the compensatory trees 21,000 up to monsoon season 2009.
   •   In this way, tree plantation target was achieved by 88.32 percent, distributed into 100.72
       percent on WCs and 67.31 percent on minor/distributary/branch canals. Keeping in view
       the low survival rate, the Agriculture Department replanted another 10,000 trees to
       enhance the survival rate. This appears to be more than satisfactory achievement level for
       a given project. This plantation control soil erosion and water seepage at irrigation
       channel.


                                                76
    •   The dressing of IP and NIP, Side slopes, berms and width of the channel shall not be
        deteriorated By following Standard specifications for borrowed earth.
    •   Proper disposal of excavated soil from irrigation channel safe the discharge capacity of
        the channel.
    •   With the construction of Cloth washing and animal wallowing bays, the dressing of IP
        and NIP, Side slopes, berms and width of the channel shall not be deteriorated.
    •   Farmers’ practice about IPM remained an open question at WC level which ultimately
        deteriorates the soil and health of the people.

Conclusions
The main conclusion of M&E sample surveys and case studies have indicated that physical and
agricultural target of SOFWM project are well within the desired objectives. Presently,
FOs/WCAs have emerged as ongoing functional identities meeting most of the “necessary
condition” of institutional reform.
The project impact has been quite positive, conveyance and application efficiencies increased
resulting in making additional water supplies available to farmers. Crop yields increased and
additional land came under cultivation. Time and labor to irrigate, reduced considerably and
maintenance became easier. Substantial increase in farm income has also been experienced.
The project has generally been successful in coping with its aims at conserving Irrigation losses
in WC as well as at the farm level and promoting efficient Irrigation in canal irrigated and barani
area thereby increasing agricultural production.

•   Extensive social mobilization and awareness campaigns were not sufficient.
•   Farmer trainings require in on farm initiatives i.e., efficient use irrigation water, soil, water
    and crop management, alternate use of saved water etc.
•   Joint adventure interventions made project more complex

General
Water is essential for sustenance of life in all forms and fresh water being a finite resource is
progressively becoming scarce due to persistent increase in its competing demands. It is
important to ensure water security for the people through a national water policy laying down the
outlines of an integrated water management strategy that aims at maximizing the sustainable
economic, social and environmental returns on the water resource development, allocation
among its competing demands, its use by consumers and safe disposal of post‐use effluents.
Sindh province located hydraulically at the tail end of Indus Basin Irrigation System sustains
colossal water losses and is the worst sufferer in getting right share of water at right time.
Irrigated agriculture in Sindh is facing major problems with reference to low conveyance,
application and water use efficiencies, inequity, inadequacy, non‐reliability in water distribution
system and climatic change. Presently, the overall irrigation efficiency is 55‐60 percent which in
no case is acceptable and affordable particularly for the country/province whose economy is
largely dependent on irrigated‐agriculture.
    1. The intensive demographic pressure has forced to intensify agriculture both in irrigated
       and rain fed areas in horizontal (intensity) and vertical (yield) directions and has
       necessitated the optimum and economic use of water in crop production processes.
       Efficient irrigation for increasing cropping intensity and maximum crop yield therefore
       requires a sustainable and viable strategy to cope up these problems.
    2. To embark upon these problems, Government of Pakistan and Government of Sindh with
       the assistance of international agencies have launched several projects in irrigated
       agriculture sector from mid-seventies focusing on water management to avert water
       conveyance and water application losses at secondary and tertiary level and get maximum
       water/crop productivity.
    3. On successful completion of projects of similar scope and objectives and getting positive
       development impact in terms of increased and equitable water supply, enhanced crop
       yield, cropping intensity and improved farm income, large demand for WCs
       improvement and Government’s commitment to conserve water and getting good

          response from the stakeholders, the Government of Pakistan has launched Sindh On Farm
          Water Management‐ Additional Financing (SOFWM ‐AF) Project in Sindh with effect
          from July, 2009 and completed in January, 2014.
     4.   The project was financed by International Development Association (IDA) a subsidiary
          of the World Bank with an overall amount of US $ 45.940 million including IDA share as
          US $34.748 million, GOS share of US $ 0.414 million and farmers’ share of US $ 10.778
          million. Stakeholders of the project are Government of Sindh and WC Associations
          (WCAs) and farmers/beneficiaries.
     5.   The SOFWM ‐ AF Phase area was located within the hydraulic boundaries of three Area
          Water Boards (AWBs) Viz. Ghotki Feeder Canal, Nara Canal and Left Bank Canals
          established in Sindh under Sindh Irrigation and Drainage Authority (SIDA) and covers
          eight districts of Sindh Viz. Ghotki, Sukkur, Khairpur, Sanghar, Mirpur Khas, Umer Kot,
          Tando Mohammad Khan and Badin.
     6.   SOFWM‐AF Phase was implemented by multiple implementing partners including
          Directorate General Agricultural Engineering and Water Management (DGAE&WM) &
          Directorate of Water Management (DWM), Department of Agriculture, Government of
          Sindh as lead partner, Directorate General and Directorate of Agriculture Extension,
          Department of Agriculture Government of Sindh and the Project Supervisory &
          Monitoring Consultants (PS&MCs).
     7.   This document is a Project Implementation Completion Report written by the Project
          Supervisory & Monitoring Consultants (PS&MCs) for Sindh On-Farm Water
          Management ‐ Additional Financing (SOFWM‐AF) Project.

2.        Project Objectives
     8. The overall development project objective was to help reduce rural poverty and increase
        farm incomes through improved agriculture productivity technology. This objective was
        achieved by:
     • Improving water management, including the reliability, efficiency and equity of irrigation
        water distribution.
     • Supplementing agricultural productivity enhancement measures to complement and
        enhance the benefits of improved water management practices.

3.        Project Components
     9.   The project included following complementary components.
     •    Improvement of WCs & Construction of Water Storage Tanks
     •    Productivity Enhancement

    10. The performance of the project was rated on monitoring and evaluation of
        findings/results of some output and outcome indicators as explained in subsequent
        paragraphs.

4.1.   Output Key Indicators
    11. The main findings/results pertaining to output indicators           of   different
        interventions/activities of the project are portrayed as under:




                                           80
4.2.    Outcome Key Indicators
The main outcome indicators of different
interventions/activities of the project are
portrayed as under:
    •   Overall       WC       conveyance
        efficiency increased by 24 percent
        against the target of 20 percent
        covering whole of the WC – lined
        and earthen sections.
    •   Annual       cropping     intensity
        increased by 15 percent against
        the target of 10 percent.




                                              81
•   Yield of wheat crop increased by 9.7 percent, cotton by 10.8 percent and sugarcane 13.1
    percent against the targets as 7.5 percent, 8.5 percent and 23 percent, respectively.




                                          82
5.       Environmental Impact
     •   1,421 WCs improved under SOFWM‐AF were environmentally monitored.
     •   2,875 environmental non‐compliances were observed on 1,259 WCs during their
         improvement and all were mitigated before completion of improvement of WCs and
         issuance of FCR. No any environmental non‐compliance was observed on remaining 162
         WCs during their improvement. Four environmental parameters such as improper
         disposal of excavated earth/silt, provision of temporary diversion channels, trees cut‐
         down during WC improvement, and destruction of washing bays
     •   In environmental non‐compliances, improper disposal of excavated earth/silt was at
         Rank‐1, whereas provision of temporary diversion channels, trees cut‐down and
         destruction of washing bays were at Rank‐2, 3 & 4 respectively.
     •   392 trees were cut down on 118 WCs during their improvement activity.
     •   As per project policy of planting of two trees against one tree cut, 784 compensatory trees
         were to be planted, whereas 1818 trees were planted which include 714 trees planted by
         WCAs and 1104 trees planted by Directorate of Water Management.
     •   Out of 714 trees planted by WCAs, 275 trees were surviving with survival rate as 39
         percent, whereas 957 trees were surviving against the 1104 trees planted by Directorate
         of Water Management with survival ratio as 87 percent. Thus, on overall 1232 trees were
         surviving against 1818 with survival rate as 68 percent.

6.       Lessons Learned


     •   The         strategy        of
         implementing           project
         interventions by involving
         the concerned stakeholders’
         i.e.   the     farmers    and
         members of WCAs has
         proved     successful     and
         resulted in adoption of
         participatory        approach
         which has created an example of bottom‐up approach adopted for this project.
     •   All project activities/interventions viz. improvement of WCs, construction of WSTs,
         PLL, IPM and trainings may be carried out on WCs to be improved simultaneously in
         form of a composite package so as to get optimal results in terms of enhancing cropping
         intensity and crop yield.
     •   Deployment of Field Teams of a district at different locations with time bound targets
         played a vital role in implementing the project activities in an effective and efficient
         manner.
     •   Frequent surprise visits of Project Director supported by visits of Director General and
         Additional Director General have shown a significant impact on physical progress of the
         project.
     •   Timely release of funds required for project activities and proper motivation and training
         of WCAs has positive impact in achieving project objectives.



                                                84
•   Members of WCAs divert their attention in terms of maintaining their WCs with passage
    of time. Hence, it is imperative to devise a sustainable mechanism for keeping theses
    WCAs active by handling the operational and maintenance activities.
•   The variation in cost of construction material with span of time was significantly
    witnessed. The cost of construction materials was quite high than the schedule of rates
    allowed by the Government to WCAs for project interventions. This is matter of deep
    concern and needs attention to rationalize them in the interest of projects to be launched
    in future.
•   The Quality Control mechanism for materials with special reference to PCPS developed
    by the department for this project found useful and productive. Hence, its continuation
    will be in the interest of future similar projects.
•   Maintenance of WCs and WSTs in terms of silt clearance must be ensured periodically so
    as to keep the water carrying capacity of WC and storage capacity of WST intact.
•   Farming community is happy from PLL intervention; hence this intervention needs to be
    extended.
•   It was observed that there is tendency of farmers to irrigate crops with more water with
    an intention that more the water more the yield which is not true. Hence, to optimize the
    use of available water resources farmers may be trained in judicious use of water.
•   WSTs have benefited the farming community in terms of growing nurseries thereby
    increasing growing season, growing vegetables thereby increasing income, augmenting
    water supplies during critical periods of crop growth thereby averting significant impact
    on crop yield due to water stress.
•   WSTs water use may be avoided during normal supply in the system to minimize
    operational costs. Preferably, it may be used in conjunction with marginal quality ground
    water so as to augment water supplies and meet crop water requirements and enhance
    cropping intensity.
•   Tunnel farming has rarely been practiced in Sindh province in public sector. This was
    first ever effort to install 30 tunnel units under AF Phase. After their installation, farmers
    have grown off‐season crops and nurseries which generated substantial monetary for the
    farmers.
•   Capacity building of farmers and facilitators through Farmers Field Schools (FFS) and
    involvement of experienced expertise has provided opportunity of learning through their
    physical involvement which will be good for future.
•   The field trainings to facilitators and farmers in Integrated Cultivation Management
    (ICM) including IPM, irrigation scheduling should be imparted through FFSs. The
    experience showed that Grievance Redressal Mechanism (GRM) is a good instrument for
    redemption of possible conflicts or unforeseen problems to be confronted: among water
    shareholders of WCs and with other neighboring farming communities of the area.
•   The awareness campaign through Magazines, Booklets, Radio Program, Seminars etc.
    delivered a lot which may be continued for future programs or projects;

                                             85
     •   The experts regarding Crop Production & Protection may be engaged for broad‐based
         On‐Field Site‐effective guidance to farming community during cropping seasons;
     •   It has been witnessed that survival rate of trees is less in case of trees planted by WCAs
         on WCs boundaries due to their poor aftercare and animal grazing, whereas survival rate
         of trees planted by Department in clusters is extremely good. Hence, it will be a
         productive exercise to plant compensatory trees in clusters at some public places with 3:1
         ratio within the domain of WCs where trees have been cut down during their
         improvement.
     •   The monitoring & evaluation of the project remained beneficial for effective
         implementation and timely achievement of Project Outputs & Outcomes. This needs to
         be improved for its more effectiveness regarding smooth, speedy, result oriented and
         effective implementation of the projects in future.
     •   The Donor (World Bank) played very vital role not only by funding of the project but
         also by providing consistent guidance, vigilance and transparent steps to
         implement/execute the project intervention in effective and efficient manner and achieve
         the project targets within stipulated time.

7.       Conclusions
     •   From the physical progress achieved for different interventions/activities of the project
         against assigned targets and monitoring & evaluation through sample surveys conducted,
         following conclusions are inferred.
     •   The project has been successfully implemented and was well managed.
     •   The targets of the project interventions/activities have been fully achieved in stipulated
         time.
     •   Water conveyance and water application losses have been prevented to a significant
         extent through project interventions like improvement of WCs and precision land
         leveling.
     •   Cropping intensity and crop yields have been increased remarkably due to project
         interventions resulting in economic uplift of farming community of the project area.
     •   The project activities did not create any significant negative environmental impact and
         whatever non-compliances were noticed during the monitoring process, were mitigated.
