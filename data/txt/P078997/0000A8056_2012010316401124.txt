                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project implementation has suffered from serious implementation delays primarily due to inability of recruiting supervision consultants, whose main task is to monitor and verify civil
                         works to be completed by Water Course Associations (WCAs) under community-based contracts. The delays in recruitment of supervision consultants were caused by legal disputes
                         between Agriculture Department and one of the consulting firms. As a result of extensive efforts of GoSindh, the issue was finally resolved and the supervision consultants came on
                         board on April 1, 2011, which paved the way for accelerated implementation. However, unprecedented flooding following heavy rains in August-October, 2011 jeopardized
                         implementation of project activities, and reversed some of project progresses made till then. During the last four months, the execution of civil works for watercourse improvement
                         component has not been undertaken due to recent flood and the actual civil work is heavily affected however activities under productivity enhancement component are progressing
                         well. Due to major delays occurred at earlier stage of implementation, the project still faces a significant challenge of meeting the key project targets.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Given the continued importance of the Project for improved irrigated agriculture productivity and enhancement of irrigation reforms in Sindh, and the fact the key delay reasons were
                         lying mostly outside the control of the Project (court suspension of consultancy recruitment, and unprecedented flooding and associated damages), the Mission and the Implementing
                         Agency (IA) concluded that a two- year project extension maybe needed to complete the activities under the project. The mission also cautioned that agreement on project extension
                         requires a level of decision making beyond the task team and the sector unit. It was agreed that a request for the extension must accompany solid/full justification and will be sent to
                         the Bank through EAD. The project team recommends that Bank management consider this extension.
