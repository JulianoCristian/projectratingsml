                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project implementation in improvement of watercourse component has been slower than progress in the preceding 6 months due to a concern that arose in the quality of the pre-cast
                         concrete for lining of watercourse. Utilization of the lining was abandoned by the project until inspection, and it has caused delay in achieving the targets in July-September and
                         September-December quarters. After inspection, it was clear that the quality of the material is satisfactory, so implementation has resumed. However, it is expected that the backlog
                         would be cleared within the upcoming quarter. The project is also in the process of establishing a Grievance Redressal Mechanism which will be available for project stakeholders to
                         register any issue or complaints they may have from implementation of the project. Implementation in all other components and activities is on track.
