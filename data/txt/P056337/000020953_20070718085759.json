  moderate, Bank performance was satisfactory, and borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. The lessons learned included:\n            A) The target group should be broadened in order to\n            encompass those affected by the spill over effects of the\n            restructuring; B) Active labor market measures are more\n            effective when complemented by investments in regional\n            development. These measures have greater impact when\n            accompanied by more holistic support for local social and\n            economic development; C) Holistic regional development\n            requires mobilization of diverse institutional settings.\n            Partnerships with other agencies that can provide services\n            and resources to the mining regions support the achievement\n            of results more effectively and efficiently; D) Mobilizing\n            and involving local government authorities and communities\n            in the mine closure process achieve better results; E)\n            Establishing clear guidelines and a framework for mine\n            closure supports consistency and quality of mine closure;\n            and F) Strengthening the capacity of institutions to\n            environmentally monitor the operational plans should be part\n            of the activities."}, "docdt": "2007-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
