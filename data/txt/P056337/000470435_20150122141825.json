Four-hundred-fifty people\n            used to work at the Godeni mine set in the scenic hills of\n            Campulung in southern Romania. Cows graze there now and the\n            air is filled with the buzz of honey bees. The Romanian\n            government has closed 520 of 650 mines operating in 1997 and\n            physically erased or converted 120 of those sites. The\n            crumbling of Romania\u0092s once huge mining sector posed an\n            enormous challenge in the late 1990s as the number of mining\n            employees nationwide was halved. In 1999 the government\n            turned to the World Bank for assistance in creating\n            alternative jobs for ex-miners. After a slow start, their\n            joint efforts to transform the mining communities are\n            starting to pay off."}, "docdt": "2005-08-16T00:00:00Z"}
