Project objectives\n            were largely met within the projected timetable. Most state\n            and municipalities performed very well, and participation by\n            nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) exceeded expectations.\n            However two major problems not resolved during\n            implementation were, first, evaluation was not satisfactory,\n            making it impossible to quantify the impact of project\n            interventions on high-risk behaviors and populations; and\n            second, procurement activities subcontracted to third\n            parties were inadequately supervised. Lessons learned\n            included: The program's early efforts to build a\n            constituency for the project among states, municipalities,\n            and NGOs proved valuable in assuring a rapid project start\n            up and timely project execution. NGO involvement was\n            critical to reaching a number of high-risk populations. More\n            attention is needed for evaluating staffing requirements and\n            for effectively designing and implementing survey\n            instruments. Greater attention to cost-effectiveness\n            analysis of specific interventions would permit a better\n            understanding of their relative priority in the overall AIDS\n            and STD control program. Project management and the Bank\n            need to more intensively supervise procurement activities\n            contracted to third parties. Finally, the program could take\n            better advantage of opportunities to integrate the various\n            activities in prevention, surveillance, diagnosis,\n            treatment, training, and evaluation."}, "docdt": "1998-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
