This has\n            undermined Brazil's ability to evaluate the impact of\n            its prevention efforts on behaviors and on the epidemiology\n            of the disease. Inadequate data on the size and coverage of\n            target populations for the prevention and treatment\n            programs, respectively, especially at the state and local\n            levels, undermine the efficiency and effectiveness of\n            HIV/AIDS interventions. Early, rigorous and sustained\n            prevention efforts are likely to keep the pool of I&V\n            and AIDS patients small relative to the counterfactual, and\n            thus to reduce the burden on a country's health system\n            and make treatment and care more feasible and affordable.\n            NGOs have a critical role to play in the fight against\n            HIV/AIDS. Even when financing a relatively modest share of\n            the overall costs of a well-established program, Bank\n            support to HIV/AIDS efforts can make significant\n            contributions to program expansion and capacity building\n            when it is strategically allocated. Bank support can bring\n            legitimacy and leverage to controversial activities and to\n            stigmatized segments of society. A research program that is\n            ad hoc and uncoordinated in its conception likely to\n            generate a large volume of information and data that will be\n            difficult to is interpret and use for measuring and\n            improving program performance and impact. Project design and\n            conditionality can be strategic in initiating and supporting\n            institutional innovations which are capable of expanding and\n            using more fully program implementation capacity."}, "docdt": "2004-04-27T00:00:00Z"}
