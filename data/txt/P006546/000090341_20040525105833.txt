About     this Report
       The Operations       Evaluation      Department     assesses the programs          and activities of the World Bank for two
 purposes:    first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank's self-evaluation             process and to verify that the Bank's work is
producing     the expected      results, and second, to help develop            improved    directions,   policies, and procedures          through
the dissemination       of lessons drawn from experience.            As part of this work, OED annually            assesses      about 25 percent of
the Bank's lending        operations.     In selecting   operations   for assessment,       preference     is given to those that are
innovative,     large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming                studies or country evaluations;          those for which
 Executive    Directors or Bank management              have requested       assessments;      and those that are likely to generate
important     lessons. The projects, topics, and analytical           approaches       selected for assessment          support     larger evaluation
studies
       A Project    Performance        Assessment       Report (PPAR)       is based on a review of the implementation                 Completion
Report     (a self-evaluation      by the responsible       Bank department)        and fieldwork     conducted       by OED. To prepare
PPARs,      OED staff examine          project files and other documents,           interview   operational     staff, and in most cases visit
the borrowing       country   for onsite discussions        with project staff and beneficiaries.         The PPAR thereby            seeks to
validate    and augment       the information       provided    in the ICR, as well as examine          issues of special        interest to broader
OED studies.
       Each PPAR is subject to a peer review process and OED management                              approval.     Once cleared        internally,  the
PPAR is reviewed          by the responsible        Bank department       and amended        as necessary.       The completed         PPAR is then
sent to the borrower        for review; the borrowers'         comments       are attached    to the document         that is sent to the Bank's
Board of Executive         Directors.    After an assessment         report has been sent to the Board,            it is disclosed     to the public.


About     the OED Rating         System
       The time-tested       evaluation      methods    used by OED are suited to the broad range of the World Bank's work.
The methods        offer both rigor and a necessary            level of flexibility  to adapt to lending      instrument,      project design,     or
sectoral    approach.     OED evaluators         all apply the same basic method to arrive at their project                 ratings.    Following    is
the definition    and rating scale used for each evaluation               criterion   (more information       is available     on the OED website:
http://worldbank.org/oed/eta-mainpage.               html).

 1999, and closed on June 30,2003, six months after the original closing date. The loans
were disbursed at 100 percent and 98 percent, respectively.

         The findings of this assessmentare based on an Operations Evaluation
Department (OED) mission to Brazil, which took place in April/May         2003. This mission
met in Brasilia with authorities and staff of the National HIV/AIDS      Program and with
key actors of the Federal District of Brasilia. It also visited five additional states
(Pemambuco, Rio de Janeiro, Santa Catarina, Rio Grande do Sul and Sao Paulo),
interviewing a wide range of actors (encompassing public sector and civil society actors
and beneficiaries) and visiting selected facilities, research/academic institutions and
community-based projects. Key documentary sources consulted include project
appraisal documents on AIDS I and II and a completion report on AIDS I. (A completion
report on AIDS II has not been issued at the writing of this review.) Supervision and
evaluation reports, routine correspondence and other technical reports contained in the
project' files were also consulted. This assessmentalso drew on documentation produced
in Brazil (government and nongovernmental sectors alike), and on available Brazilian and
international research on STDs and HIV/AIDS        in Brazil.

        This PPAR is one of six conducted on the "first generation" of the Bank's
HIV/AIDS      projects as part of an ongoing OED evaluation of the Development
Effectiveness of World Bank Assistance for Fighting the AIDS Epidemic. It was
prepared in conjunction with a more extensive case study on the World Bank's support to
Brazil in the fight against HIV/AIDS     over the past lo-15 years, which encompassed
policy advice and technical and financial support to Brazil's HIV/AIDS       efforts.

        The OED mission gratefully acknowledges all those who made time for
interviews and provided documents and information, including managers and staff of the
Ministry of Health/National Program for STD and AIDS Control, and multiple actors and
stakeholders of State and municipal programs for STD and AIDS Control in the Federal
District of Brasilia, and in the States of Pemambuco, Rio de Janeiro, Santa Catarina, Rio
Grande do Sul, and S%oPaulo. The mission is equally grateful to members of Brazil's
research/academic community, representatives of nongovernmental and civil society
organizations; staff of partner institutions and World Bank staff. This report draws
heavily on the technical reports and inputs of mission members, Varun Gauri, Economist,
Development Research Group, World Bank, and Chris Beyrer, Consultant

Epidemiologist.   The team is grateful to Francisco Inacio Bastos, Deputy Coordinator,
Fiocruz AIDS Programme, Rio de Janeiro, for the extensive literature search and other
technical inputs to this evaluation.

       Following standard OED procedures, copies of the draft PPAR were sent to the
relevant government officials and agencies for their review and comments. A number of
observations were made, which have been incorporated into the PPAR. Government's
comments are presented in full in Annex G.

Summary

         Shortly after the first AIDS caseswere diagnosed in Brazil in 1982 both civil
society and state and federal governments took action to contain the growth of the HIV
epidemic. By the time World Bank support for the fight against HIV/AIDS       was solicited
in 1992, Brazil already had a well-established National AIDS Program and National
AIDS Commission, and almost a decadeof experience in the design and implementation
of innovative prevention and human rights promotion activities carried out by a
multiplicity of governmental and non-governmental actors. By that time as well, Brazil
had already initiated treatment and care provision. In responseto Brazil's request the
World Bank, through two projects, has provided technical and financial assistanceover
the past decade to support: (a) prevention; (b) diagnosis, treatment, and care; (c)
surveillance, research, monitoring and evaluation; and (d) institutional development

        The overall objectives of AIDS I (IBRD loan of US$160 million equivalent) and
AIDS II (IBRD loan of US$165 million equivalent), approved in 1993 and 1998,
respectively, were to reduce the incidence and transmission of HIV and STD infection
and to strengthen program capacity in the areasof prevention, treatment, and
management. These loans are now fully disbursed (at 100 percent and 98 percent,
respectively) and a third loan of US$lOO million equivalent was approved in June 2003.

        While Brazil has implemented many innovative and theoretically cost-effective
interventions, evidence of the actual cost-effectiveness and impact of its program efforts
is lacking. In the absenceof adequatesystems for HIV and behavioral surveillance and
for program monitoring and evaluation, confirmation is difficult of the achievements of
Brazil's HIV/AIDS    program, as well as of the World Bank's contribution thereto.
Available data and information, combined with the culled views and perspectives of the
myriad actors and beneficiaries of the Bank-financed projects, do point to successful
outcomes of the Bank's support, as well as to some shortfalls.

        The loans have supported improvements and further expansion of state-of-the-art
prevention activities, maintaining a focus on high-risk groups (men who have sex with
men, injection drug users [IDUs] and commercial sex workers), expanding efforts to
include at-risk populations (especially female sexual partners of IDUs and bisexual men,
and persons with multiple sex partners), and attempting to maintain low prevalence rates
among women, youth, rural populations and the poor. Sustained and innovative
prevention interventions were extended to all regions in Brazil and may have contributed
to the slowing or containment of the epidemic, reflected in a low prevalence rate of 0.65
percent among adults 15-49 years of age for year 2000 and a continued concentration of
the epidemic among high-risk populations.

        Limited data indicate that during the life of theseprojects awarenessof the
disease and of how to prevent its transmission has increased and healthier behaviors are
being adopted by general populations, especially younger populations, and high risk
groups. The Bank-financed prevention efforts have probably averted increased infection
and sickness and kept the pool of HIV/AIDS     patients under treatment and care lower than

                                               X




would have been the case in the absenceof prevention, rendering the treatment and care
efforts (described below) both more affordable and more feasible.

         AIDS I and II supported the expansion to all 27 statesand the quality
enhancement of diagnosis, treatment and care services for persons with HIV, AIDS and
STDs through: (a) the establishment and support of a network of 237 counseling and
testing centers; (b) the development of an extensive network of specialized health
services for HIV/AIDS    patients, with much of the care shifted from expensive
hospitalization to cheaper alternatives for inpatient and outpatient services; (c) the
strengthening of Brazil's laboratory system for critical monitoring and follow-up of
patients; (d) the development of software to manage and control the distribution and use
of antiretroviral drugs (ARVs); and (e) training of tens of thousands of health care
providers and other technical staff. While AIDS II did not finance the costs of ARVs,
both AIDS I and II did support critical investments in treatment and care capacity,
without which ARVs could not have been effectively delivered to patients.

         In 2003 about 140,000 AIDS patients were reported to be under active treatment
in Brazil's program, and an additional 196,000 HIV-positive asyrnptomatic caseswere
being monitored but not yet on treatment. Evidence suggeststhat AIDS morbidity,
mortality, opportunistic infection rates and hospitalizations have sharply declined since
1997, the year following Brazil's decision to extend its policy of universal accessto
health care to highly active antiretroviral therapy. Low drug resistance in Brazil
(estimated at 6 percent) is an indicator of the quality of the treatment program. A
continued concern, however, is that the majority of the estimated 600,000 Brazilians
living with HIV in 2000 do not know that they are infected with the virus. Utilization of
counseling and testing services is still modest. Furthermore, it is assumed that most of
those with confirmed HIV would seek treatment and care that is available free of charge.

        Institutional Development. Both through innovative design and well-conceived
conditionality, AIDS I and II contributed significantly to capacity development at the
state and municipal levels. The projects nurtured and supported the strengthening and
establishment of STD/AIDS coordination units in all 27 statesand in 150 municipalities
and initiated a process of financial transfers to states and municipalities on the basis of
targets and objectives contained in annual action plans prepared at the local level and
negotiated and co-signed with the federal level. This process is now being consolidated
and institutionalized.

        Bank assistancealso stimulated and nurtured public-private partnerships by
making financing available for contracts with NGOs and the private sector to carry out
critical components of prevention and care efforts, thus expanding considerably Program
capacity and coverage, especially in reaching marginalized and hard-to-reach groups.
This arrangement is being decentralized increasingly to statesand municipalities.

        Shortfalls of AIDS I and II. The projects were unsuccessful in setting up adequate
surveillance systems for HIV and STDs and in strengthening program evaluation.          There
is no systematic monitoring of infection rates and behaviors of high risk groups or of
high-risk sexual behavior among the general population. STDs are still considerably

                                              xi


underreported and limited to clients of public STD services. Both projects supported ad
hoc research on HIV infection and behavior of different populations in different
geographical regions. However, the lack of a methodological framework for the design
and conduct of these studies has obstructed the systematic tracking of trends over time.
At the close of AIDS II the program was still without a viable system for monitoring and
evaluating program performance and impact, despite the strong emphasis placed on M&E
in each of the project designs, but important steps are now underway to strengthen and
decentralize M&E capacity. The projects were also unsuccessful in assessingthe cost-
effectiveness of program interventions.

         AIDS I and AIDS II had satisfactory outcomes overall. The institutional
development impact of each project is rated substantial; and the sustainability of each
project is likely. Both Bank and Borrower performance were satisfactory.

Lessons and Challenges

    The gaps in data and trends on HIV infection rates and on behaviors among high-risk
    and general populations, attributable to inadequacies in the surveillance of these
    groups, make it difficult to track or model the evolution of the epidemic and
    behaviors over time and thus to evaluate and enhancethe effectiveness or impact of
    program interventions.
    Early, rigorous and sustained prevention efforts are likely to keep the pool of HIV
    and AIDS patients small relative to the counterfactual, and thus to reduce the burden
    on a country's health system, making treatment and care more feasible and
    affordable. The Bank supported Brazil to this effect, but Brazil's early responseon
    the prevention front, well before Bank intervention, was most critical.
    Even when financing a relatively modest shareof the overall costs of a well-
    established program, Bank support to HIV/AIDS      efforts can make significant
    contributions to program expansion and to capacity building when it is strategically
    allocated.
    A researchprogram that is ad hoc and uncoordinated in its conception is likely to
    generate a large volume of information and data that will be difficult to interpret for
    measuring and improving program performance and impact.         The publicly funded
    research agenda should be strategic both in the choice and prioritization of topics and
    in the standardization of methodology that would accommodate the analysis of data
    across studies and of trends over time.
    Project design and conditionality can be strategic and pivotal in initiating and
    supporting institutional innovations, which are capable of expanding and using more
    fully program implementation capacity including that of NGOs, decentralized levels
    of the program, and other development sectors.

 1. Background                  and Context

 11         Shortly after the first AIDS caseswere diagnosed in Brazil in 1982 both civil
 society and state and federal governments took action to contain the growth of the HIV
 epidemic. By the time World Bank support for the fight against HIV/AIDS                                      was solicited
 in 1992, Brazil already had a well-established National AIDS Program and National
AIDS Commission, and almost a decade of experience in the design and implementation
 of innovative prevention and human rights promotion activities carried out by a
multiplicity      of governmental and non-governmental actors. By that time as well, Brazil
had already initiated treatment and care provision. In response to Brazil's request the
 World Bank, through two projects, has provided technical and financial assistanceover
the past decade to support: (a) prevention; (b) diagnosis, treatment and care; (c)
 surveillance, research, monitoring and evaluation; and (d) institutional development.
Financing provided under AIDS I amounted to about one-third of total public
expenditures on HIV/AIDS/STDs                     in Brazil during the project period, net of expenditures
on drugs; and that provided under AIDS II amounted to about 10 percent of total
expenditure on HIV/AIDS                during the life of the project, net of drugs (Ministry of Health,
August 2002).Z

 12        Economic and Political Context. Following a period of economic stagnation and
high inflation during the 1980s and early 1990s and the impeachment in 1992 of
President Collor, President Cardoso, during his two terms in office (1995-l 998 and
 1999.2002), brought about considerable improvements in the economy and impressive
gains in social indicators by the year 2000.3 However impressive, these gains mask
considerable inequities across regions and acrossincome quintiles" (Gwatkin and others
2000). Newly elected President Lula da Silva is committed to fiscal discipline and
targets agreedwith the International Monetary Fund in September 2002 and aims to: (a)
consolidate hard-won stabilization gains; (b) reduce poverty and acute inequities; and (c)
improve social indicators.

 13        Since the early 1990s the World Bank's Country Assistance Strategies (CAS)
have been overtly oriented around the central objective of poverty alleviation. The
diminishing importance of Bank disbursements as a percentage of total debt flows to
Brazil (from 16.5 in the 1980s to 6.4 in the 1990s) has led CASs to be more selective and
more focused on the roots of poverty and on Brazil's poorest regions (Northeast). In this

1. Except as noted, this section is based on information    contained  in OED's Brazil   Country Assistance Evaluation
(2003).

2. Data on public expenditure    for HIV/AIDS    is not broken down by program      component,   making   it impossible  to
assess the share of Bank's financing   by component.

3. Under-five   mortality rates decreased from 58 per thousand in 1990 to 39 in 2000 and infant mortality        rates from 47.8
to 3 1.7 per thousand live births over the same period, attributable   in great part to impressive immunization     rates (99
percent in 1999).   Maternal  mortality  at the end of the 1990s in Brazil is estimated at 160 per 100,000 live births, down
from 260 in 1995.

4. For example,   Demographic    and Health Survey estimates for the period     1986-96  indicate that infant mortality   rates
for the lowest income quintile   (83.2) are almost triple the level estimated for the highest income quintile    (28.6).

context health and education have been accorded high priority, along with the provision
of other basic services and assetsto the poor. Box 1 summarizes the priorities and
challenges of Brazil's health sector and the orientation of Bank support.

Box 1. Issues and Challenges                  of Health       System Development                in Brazil

The    new    Constitution       of 1988 established         health   as a universal      right   and   a duty    of the State.      It also
created     the framework        for   a gradual    decentralization        of health     services.    In 1990     the unified      public
health     sys tern  (SUS)    was created.       Under     this new     system,   the social      security   health    system     was
opened      up to all citizens      and    service  provision      is consolidated       into   a single   system     and decentralized
from     the  federal    to state and municipal          governments.         This   system     also provides       for a shared
responsibility      for public     health    matters    among      all levels  of government,         including      disease    control    and
prevention.         Reform      and refinement        of this system      are ongoing.        OED's      evaluation     of Brazil's
Country       Assistance     Strategy    (2003)    notes    the need     for irnprovement         in the following       areas:
decentralization        and   regionalization      of health      care; allocative     efficiency,    cost containment           and
financial     sustainability;    reducing     inequities     in health    status  and in service       access and reaching           poor,
marginalized        populations;      continued     expansion       of basic    health    care through       the Family       Health
Program;      human       resources    development         and management;           and the regulation         of private     health
sector.     The   Bank's     technical    and   financial     assistance    to Brazil's    health   sector     seeks to support
consolidation        of the SUS,      especially   with    regard    to securing      cost-effectiveness,        affordability      and
sustainability.



14           HIV/AIDS          Epidemic in Brazil. J 67 The following is a brief summary. A fuller
description and some data on the HIV/AIDS                               epidemic are presented in Annex C. With
the first AIDS casesdiagnosed in 1982, the HIV/AIDS                                        epidemic in Brazil is now
entering its third decade. HIV/AIDS                          in Brazil was first characterized by early (1980-85)
and rapid spread of HIV-l                   among urban homosexual and bisexual men (MSM), and soon
followed by substantial spreadin urban injecting drug users (IDU).                                            The second decade
of HIV/AIDS,            roughly 1992-2002, was marked by increasing spreadof HIV among high-
risk heterosexuals, including commercial sex workers (CSW), sexually-transmitted
disease (STD) clinic attendees,and the wives and sex partners of male IDUs and
bisexuals. The gender ratio in AIDS casereports has fallen from 25: 1 male to female in
the earliest years of the epidemic to 1.7:1 in 2003.

15            AIDS mortality peaked at 12/100,000 in 1995, before the advent of highly active
antiretroviral therapy (HAART),                      and has been declining ever since, reaching 6.3/100,000
by 2000. As of 2000 there were an estimated 600,000 Brazilians living with HIV
infection, compared with PAHO's estimate of 750,000 in 19928. As of March 2002,

5. Unless otherwise      indicated,  data cited in this section are drawn from MoH/NASCP                statistics.

6. Because AIDS case reporting         in Brazil has been mandatory        since 1986 and routine HIV surveillance            is recent and
still being strengthened,     data on AIDS are much more plentiful           and reliable.   However,    data on AIDS need to be
interpreted   with caution.    Current AIDS cases reflect risky behaviors         and infections     that happened     some 10 years
previously.

7. Definitions    of epidemiological    terms used in this section:       HIV incidence     is the rate at which new HIV infections        are
acquired over a given period of time in a population.           AIDS     incidence   is the rate of new AIDS diagnoses          over a given
period   of time in a population.     HIV prevalence      is the proportion   of persons with HIV infection         in a given population    at
a specific moment in time. AIDS prevalence             is the proportion   of persons with full-blown        AIDS in a population      at a
given time.

8. As part of the preparation      of AIDS III, the Bank estimated that about 800,000 Brazilians              were infected in 2002.      The
government     is currently   preparing  an estimate for 2003.

                                                              3



237,588 AIDS casesand 110,65 1 deaths from AIDS had been reported since the
 beginning of the epidemic. Drawing on HIV surveillance data on pregnant women, the
 population prevalence of HIV among reproductive age adults has been estimated at 0.65
percent, (Szwarcwald (CL) 2002) well below the 2 percent rate of reproductive age
adults, which UNAIDS has suggested for describing generalized epidemics .

 16         Brazil's HIV epidemic thus remains concentrated, still largely limited to
individuals and groups engaging in high-risk behaviors for HIV, including MSM, IDU,
CSW, heterosexuals with multiple partners and female partners of IDU and bisexual men.
Studies on the HIV prevalence of the highest risk groups reveal prevalence levels of 36.3
percent among IDUs, 10.8 percent among MSM and 6.5 percent among CSW (see
Annex C, Table 2) for recent years in various samples, most of them non-nationa19.
Trend data on HIV prevalence over time are not available for MSM and CSW. Analysis
of trends among IDUs indicate a decline in HIV prevalence in selected urban areas.`*

 17         The majority of reported AIDS caseswere causedby heterosexual transmission,
still limited to high risk groups (partners of IDUs and bisexual men, CSW and people
with multiple partners). Transmission through intravenous drug use rose from an
estimated 18.5 percent of total reported AIDS casesin the 1980s to a high of 24.8 percent
in 1992 and subsequently declined in the ensuing years to 11.4 percent in 2000.
Transmission by transfusion has decreasedas a share of reported AIDS cases from 5.3
percent in the 1980s to 0.2 percent in 2000, while peri-natal transmission rose from 1.8
percent in the 1980s to 2.5 percent in 2000.

18         Incidence of AIDS in Brazil, as measured by year of diagnosis, increased from
8:2/100,000 in 1991 to a high of 18.2/100,000 in 1998 with a decline to 12.0 recorded in
2002, but patterns across regions vary. Again, trends in AIDS casesreflect levels and
patterns of transmission that occurred some 10 years before.

19.        Brazil's Response. Brazil's responseto the epidemic has been based on a three-
pronged strategy: early and sustained prevention, the promotion and protection of human
rights, and universal accessto treatment and care. In the early 1980s both civil society
and government initiated action to contain the growth of the HIV epidemic. The first
State AIDS program was established in Sao Paul0 in 1983 and two years later the number
of established State programs increased to 11 of Brazil's 27 states. By 1986 an AIDS
program was established under the Division of Sanitary Dermatology in the Ministry of
Health and notification of AIDS casesbecame compulsory nationwide. The National
AIDS Commission was established in 1988 under the leadership of the Ministry of
Health and included representatives of Ministries of Labor, Justice, Education, the Order
of Lawyers, the Federal Counsel of Medicine and other civil society organizations. By
that year serological testing was required for all blood banks and Congress passeda law
granting persons living with AIDS the rights guaranteedto workers with incapacitating or

representativity  of study samples.

terminal illnesses. In 1989 the National AIDS Division, responsible for the National
AIDSSTD           Control Program (NASCP), was established within Ministry of Health. Also
during the 198)Osnational, state and municipal governments and civil society (both for-
profit and not- for-profit sectors) designed and launched campaigns to inform the general
public, carried out targeted interventions aimed at changing the behavior of high-risk
groups (MSM and IDUs), and undertook advocacy and human rights activities.

 1.10     In 1991 MoH began the acquisition and free distribution of antiretroviral drugs
(AZT monotherapy) to AIDS patients. In 1996, with the development of the first AIDS
therapies with real benefits in survival and quality of life, Brazil's policy of universal
accessto health care was extended to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)!
According to MoH statistics, in 2000, of the 600,000 people with HIV, some 93,500 were
on antiretroviral therapy (ARV) and an additional 130,900 HIV-positive                                   asymptomatic
caseswith CD4 count above 200 were being monitored but were not on treatment. In
2003 about 140,000 patients were on ART with an additional 196,000 monitored but not
yet on treatment. (NASCP Statistics). AIDS morbidity, mortality, opportunistic infection
rates and hospitalizations have sharply declined since 1997. A continued concern,
however, is that the majority of the estimated 600,000 Brazilians living with HIV                                     do not
know their status, have not had HIV testing, and a significant proportion are likely to be
continuing behaviors that could maintain HIV spread.


2. Objectives and Design

AIDS I

21        The two overall objectives of the First AIDS and STD Control Project (AIDS I)
were to reduce the incidence and transmission of HIV and STDs and to strengthen public
and private institutions responsible for STD and HIV/AIDS                               control. Its specific
objectives were to put in place a set of institutions and activities that would: (a) define a
minimal program for HIV and STD prevention and identify what interventions work best;
(b) develop and adequately equip a technically competent cadre of health professionals to
diagnose, treat and deliver social services to HIV/AIDS                          patients; (c) establish effective
surveillance for HIV/AIDS               and its corollary illnesses (e.g., STDs and tuberculosis); and
(d) sustain project investments by the states and municipalities.

22        AIDS I was composed of four components: (a) prevention, including information,
education and communication (IEC) programs aimed at the general population and at
high-risk groups, expansion of capacity in diagnosis, counseling, testing and early
intervention and condom procurement and distribution;                             (b) services for HIV and STD
patients, including improvements in early diagnosis and treatment of STDs and
integration of prevention and medical services with counseling both to improve and
reduce the cost of care; (c) institutional development, including training of service

Il.  HAART    is defined as triple agent therapy, with or without  a protease inhibitor  (PI). All patients in Brazil are now
started on triple agent therapy.  However,   there are a small number (less than 10,000 overall)   who were started on two
drug regimens    and had not been moved to three drug regimens by mid-year        2003.  The OED case study on Brazil
HIV/AIDS,     currently under preparation,  includes a description of the antiretroviral drug programs and regimens in
Brazil.

providers, upgrading of laboratory services and technical assistance; and (d) surveillance,
research and evaluation, including epidemiological surveillance, program evaluation and
special studies on epidemiology, costs and economics of the disease.

23        Implementatiorz Arrangements.                 The National AIDS and STD Control Program
(NASCP), under the Secretariat for Health Policy in the Ministry of Health (MOH), was
responsible for project management and coordination. The head of the NASCP was
designated as general project manager and was to be supported by an assistantproject
manager and a team of experts recruited to satisfy all the fiduciary exigencies of the
Bank. The project was designed to transfer resources to: (i) the federal level (primarily
NASCP) to strengthen its capacity to design, pilot, lead, guide and support, contract out
and, in some cases,implement a range of national program activities, encompassing
prevention, care and treatment, surveillance, research, monitoring and evaluation; (ii)
states and selected municipalities to support the design and implementation of their
HIV/AIDS        action plans; and (iii) non-governmental organizations and civil society
organizations (NGOsKSOs), through contractual arrangements, for carrying out projects
covering a range of activities, including: prevention, human rights, care and treatment.

24        All 27 states and 43 municipalities2 (the latter selected on the basis of needs and
capacity criteria) were eligible to benefit from project support but could only accesssuch
support on the condition that they would: establish, staff, and co-finance an HIV/AIDS
and STD Control Coordination Unit within the health structure; sign agreementswith
Ministry of Health on the terms and conditions of the transfers (a condition of
effectiveness for the first five states; a condition of disbursement for the remaining
states/municipalities); and prepare consolidated annual operations plans (POA) to be
approved by the Bank (disbursements were contingent on inclusion of activities in POA).

25          Transfers to NGOs were contingent on the satisfaction of two sets of criteria, one
 l


set to determine the adequacy of the NGO itself (structure, legal status, profile,
organization and staffing, sources of financing and local level assessmentof its technical
capacity and performance), the other to evaluate the quality of NGO proposals against
technical, managerial, financial, epidemiological and geographic criteria. Proposals were
reviewed and selected by a national panel. Those proposals that were considered
promising, but in need of technical refinement, would receive technical support to raise
them to a standard to be selected.

26        Both the direct transfer of project resources to statesand selected municipalities
and the award and financing (through a competitive process) of contracts with NGOs for
prevention and treatment/care activities were innovations in Brazil, conceived to
accommodate a multi-sectoral               approach to the fight against HIV/AIDS                and to give
greater responsibility to states and municipalities for the preparation and negotiation of
POA conceived at the local level.




12. At the time of project preparation there were about 5,000 municipalities in Brazil. There are currently about 5,700.

AIDS II

27.     The overal 1objectives of the Second AIDS and STD Contro 1Project (AIDS II)
were to reduce the incidence of HIV and STD infection and to expand accessto and
improve the quality of diagnosis, treatment and care of persons with HIV, AIDS and
STDs.   Building on the first project, the specific objectives of this operation were to: (a)
continue support of the Government's efforts; (b) broaden prevention activities; (c)
strengthen evaluation capacity; (d) work towards program sustainability; and (e) identify
the most cost-effective interventions.

28      AIDS II supported three components: (a) prevention of AIDS and STDs; (b)
diagnosis, treatment and care for persons with HIV, AIDS and STDs; and (c) institutional
strengthening, including epidemiological surveillance and monitoring and evaluation,
among other interventions. The original articulation of components and activities for
AIDS I and II, as drawn from the project documentation, is presented in Annex D for
reference.

29      Design Modifications.     While the general design of AIDS I was maintained for
the second operation, certain modifications were introduced to addresschanges in the
profile of the AIDS epidemic. In addition to continued efforts to support behavior
change in high-risk groups (notably MSM, IDUs, and CSW), additional prevention
interventions were expanded both to include new and broader target groups (e.g., students
and women through reproductive health services) and to reach additional geographical
areasin the country.

2.10    The design of AIDS II also took into account four program issues. First, in
response to concerns about the affordability and sustainability of Government's decision
to finance the full costs of treatment of HIV/AIDS   patients in the context of its overall
policy of universal and free accessto health care, the second operation did not provide for
the financing of ARV drugs, but did include investments to promote alternatives to
hospital care (day hospitals, home care, and other outpatient services) to both improve the
quality and lower the costs of such care. Studies were programmed to assessthe costs
and effectiveness of care and treatment. Second, the project envisaged the support and
monitoring of NASCP efforts to reduce the cost of condoms to the public through tax
reductions and other means. Third, in light of poor monitoring and evaluation
performance under the first operation, AIDS II emphasized the establishment of a viable
monitoring and evaluation system, most notably: (a) the definition of project objectives
and indicators to measure impact; (b) the specification of the type of baseline information
neededto track desired changes; and (c) agreement with the national program on key
evaluation activities and their terms of reference. Fourth, it sought to decentralize
program management and execution by devolving some responsibilities to statesand
municipalities (e.g. the gradual transfer of review, selection and supervision
responsibilities for projects executed by NGOs.

2.11    Relatively minor changes were made to the implementation arrangements for
AIDS II. As a means of encouraging participation of smaller municipalities and of
achieving more efficiency in the transfer, use and accounting of such funds, the

 participation of smaller municipalities was encouragedthrough the formation of
 consortia.


 3. Implementation                          and Costs

 Implementation              Experience

 3.1      AIDS I. The institutional arrangements were respected throughout the project, with
 the three main implementers (federal level, states/municipalities, and NGOs) managing
roughly equal sharesof project resources, according to NASCP reports.

 32.         Project conditions for the transfer of funds to states and municipalities were by
 and large fulfilled and POA were generally implemented in line with expectations,
 although the absorptive capacity of local-level programs was very much a function of
political commitment at these levels. l3 Overall a total of about $115.8 million was
transferred to local Governments under AIDS I during the period 1994-l 998.14Support
to statesvaried with regard to their per capita amounts and with regard to the allocation
per identified caseof AIDS.                    (See Table E-3 in Annex E.)

33.          NGOs undertook a large shareof the prevention work financed under the project,
in line with their acknowledged comparative advantage to reach and work effectively
with high-risk groups. With the support of AIDS I 181 NGOs carried out 444 prevention
projects and 140 treatment and care projects, for a total of some 584 projects or more
than double the appraisal target of 261 (see Table 1 for details)."

34.          The NGO liaison office within NASCP managed the NGO contracting. The
monitoring of these projects was undertaken through the preparation by NGOs
themselves of quarterly reports on implementation progress and through supervision
visits undertaken by national program staff. To further consolidate successin contracting
with NGOs, the mid-term review recommended: more attention to support of NGOs in
their efforts to achieve financial sustainability of their activities, involvement of local
level government in the selection and evaluation of NGO projects, and greater uniformity
and continuity in reporting and monitoring.                         While progress has been made on all of these
fronts during the second half of AIDS I and throughout AIDS II, the challenges of
ensuring the financial sustainability of NGOs and of more rigorous and routine
monitoring and evaluation of NGO activities were consistently raised in OED mission


13. For example, the city of Sao Paulo experienced           major delays in the execution of its program     and ultimately  did not
use its full allocation  under the project, due to major changes in the structure of the health care delivery         system, and
also to low commitment        of the city administration   to AIDS control activities.    A subsequent change in municipality
leadership   towards the end of AIDS I created an enabling         environment   for more intensified    program  effort.  State-level
staff interviewed    reported that the new leadership     engendered    strong political  support for the fight against HIV/AIDS
and culminated     in a well-resourced    program,   including  both local funding    and greater utilization of project funds.

14. World    Bank completion      report data.

15. Even with this doubling       of the original target, there was capacity and demand for more projects.        In the final year of
implementation     over 400 new proposals       were received along with over 130 requests for extensions and supplemental
financing.    While the latter requests were fully accommodated,         only 5 1 of new proposals were approved      due to full
utilization  of NGO allocations      and limited  scope for reallocation   in the project's final year.

Initially the financial cap on NC0 projects was set at US$lOO,OOO,but was subsequently
reduced to about US$55,000 equivalent when few if any NGOs could make use of these
funds.

Planned versus Actual Costs by Component16

36       ArDS I. The total actual cost of the project, US$250 million equivalent, was
equal to that estimated at appraisal. Actual expenditures on prevention were 117 percent
of the full costs estimated at appraisal, while actual expenditures on care and treatment
were 89 percent of appraisal estimates. The cost of the institutional development
component was about the same as appraisal estimates (102 percent). Expenditure on
surveillance, research and evaluation fell far short of appraisal estimates (46 percent).

37            AIDS II.              The total actual cost of AIDS II was US$296.5 equivalent or 99 percent
of appraisal estimates. The actual costs of the prevention and institutional strengthening
components slightly exceeded full cost appraisal estimates (104 percent and 109 percent
respectively), while the actual cost of the diagnosis, treatment and care component fell
short (86 percent). The Bank's loan amount, which was 98 percent disbursed, amounted
to about 10 percent of total expenditure on HIV/AIDS                                                               during the life of the project
(Ministry of Health, August 2002) (See Table D-4 in Annex D for details.).

          Define     a minimal       program       for   HIV     and   STD      prevention       and    identify             High                    Moderately
          what    interventions        work     best                                                                                                 Satisfactory

          Through       training    develop       an   adequately          equipped        and   technically                Substantial              Satisfactory
          competent         cadre    of health     professionals           to diagnose,        treat   and    deliver
          social    services      to HIV/AIDS         patients

          Establish      effective     surveillance        for   HIV/AIDS         and    its corollary     illnesses        High                     Unsatisfactory
          (e.g.,  STDs       and   TB)

          Sustain      project    investments         by the      states    and     municipalities                          Substantial              Satisfactory

0      Importance        is judged     by  the    priority    accorded         to the    objective     in project    design,    based     on both  the   project   description
       and   the  amount        of funds    allocated.        **  Efficacy      is the   extent    to which      the  project's   objectives    were   achieved,     or
       expected      to be    achieved,       taking     into    account      their   relative    importance.


41.           Because of a lack of adequatebaseline and end-of-project epidemiological and
behavioral data, it is not possible to evaluate the outcome of the project against the
general objective of reducing the incidence and transmission of HIV and STDs."                                                                                           The
other project objectives are articulated in terms of outputs, rather than outcomes and thus
can be assessed. The project succeededoverall in achieving the other general objective
to strengthen public and private institutions responsible for STD and HIV/AIDS
control. As is described in more detail below, the project supported the design,
implementation and expansion of programs for prevention and for treatment and care. Of

17. The lack of data on trends in HIV prevalence and in behaviors among the general population                                                    and among high risk
groups is a consequence of the project's                       failure to strengthen adequately                    surveillance    and monitoring        and evaluation,
discussed later on in this section.

particular note is a significant investment in capacity building, including the training of
21,600 health professionals (target of 7,000) through the design and delivery of some 769
training courses (target of 550), and the provision of local and international technical
assistance for program design and implementation (NASCP project reports).

42.      The project was successful in defining and supporting a core program for HIV
and STD prevention,     but fell short of the objective of assessing which interventions
work best with a view to guiding future decisions regarding resource allocation.       AIDS
I has made significant contribution to the establishment and successful implementation of
sustained, innovative, state-of-the-art prevention activities in Brazil, including both
information/awareness raising for the general public and behavioral change interventions
aimed at high-risk groups. Both the State and civil society were particularly productive
in reaching high-risk groups. For example, a combination of innovative public sector and
NGO projects aimed at (a) preventing drug abuse and HIV infection among the general
population and (b) reducing transmission of HIV among IDUs through education and
needle exchange. Other examples of successful partnerships with civil society are found
in project-supported efforts aimed at MSM and CSW, encompassing behavior change
interventions and studies. Adolescents benefited from prevention efforts through
partnerships with the Ministry of Education, the Roquete Pinto Foundation and Brazilian
educational television. A major outcome of project support in terms of partnerships with
the private sector was the creation of the Business Council (Conselho Empresarial), made
up of 24 large businesses and over one million workers, which provides guidance to the
private sector in the design and establishment of workplace interventions.

43       AIDS I invested in the design and delivery of 138 courses in prevention delivered
to 8,673 trainees. The project also supported the design and implementation of seven
national IEC campaigns, (one more than originally planned) to increase awarenessof
HIV/AIDS    and knowledge of how to prevent it.      Other outreach/awarenesscreation
activities supported included the establishment of an AIDS Hotline (contacted by about
1,000 callers per day) and a National Human Rights Network, made up of about 1,400
members with strong advocacy and outreach capacity.

44.      From 1993 through March 1998 the project purchased and distributed 136 million
condoms and supported social marketing activities. The national logistic system for
condom distribution servesto control condom stocks, improve the flow to distributors
and users and maintain a record of who is receiving condoms to project future needs.
Efforts to reduce the import tax on condoms were initiated under AIDS I, and continued
with greater successunder AIDS II. Figure 1 shows the decline in the unit prices of
condoms over the life of the two projects.

45       Despite the lack of baseline data and a viable monitoring and evaluation system,
available evidence does indicate that during the life of this project awarenessof the
disease and of how to prevent its transmission did increase and healthier behaviors were
adopted both by the general public and by high-risk groups. For example, the sale of
domestic and imported condoms rose significantly from 70 million in 1993 to 228 million
in 1997 (NASCP statistics). Program data from 1993 and 1996 show a moderate increase
from 25 percent to 37 percent of males who report that they always use a condom and
from 14 percent to 19 percent of males who report that they almost always use a condom.

                                                            11



In the absenceof more precise information on project and program performance, it is
plausible to assume that project support of awarenessraising and targeted behavior
change interventions and project achievements in improving condom availability did
contribute to enhanced awarenessof the disease and risks of transmission and to the
adoption of healthier behaviors documented in the above-mentioned surveys. While
successful in the establishment and support of innovative and targeted prevention
interventions, the project did not carry out studies and evaluations to assessthe cost-
effectiveness of prevention activities, on which basis future strategic decisions and
resource allocation were to have been decided.

46         The project was successful in strengthening capacity of the health system to
diagnose, treat and deliver social services to HIV/AIDSpatients.                          At the project's outset
HIV testing was very limited and carried out by blood banks with virtually no counseling
services available. With the support of AIDS I a network of 104 counseling and testing
centers (CTAs) was established acrossthe country covering all states except Acre
(Ministry of Health/NASCP August 2002).** The project target was 125 CTAs.

47         Through an ambitious program of training of health providers, accreditation of
existing hospitals and the creation of alternative services AIDS I succeededin
establishing considerable capacity in Brazil to care for persons with HIV/AIDS,                             with
much of the care shifted from expensive hospitalization to cheaper alternatives for
inpatient and outpatient services. Specifically, the project fulfilled the target of
establishing about 190 new treatment facilities for HIV/AIDS                      patients, although the mix
of facilities developed was different than originally planned. Forty-nine day hospitals
were established versus the project target of 100. While no public-financed home care
services were originally planned under the project, 31 were established with project
assistance. Sixty-six specialized outpatient care facilities were established exceeding the
original target of 42 by 57%. Over 40 NGO projects established home-based care
services falling short of the target of 50. In addition, while it was not included among the
original project targets, 340 hospitals were accredited to provide HIV/AIDS                           treatment.

48        A logistical system for the management and control of ARVs was developed
along with policies and guidelines for health care and other services for HIV patients. In
addition, the project financed the design and delivery of 546 training courses in treatment
to 10,985 health care professionals and community outreach workers across the country.
While not specified in the original design, the project also financed anti-retroviral
treatment for HIV+ pregnant women to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV and
trained about 500 health professionals in the care of these patients

49        Project investments in training, equipment and other materials have also
supported the establishment of a network of diagnostic and treatment services for STDs.
The project supported the establishment of 700 STD clinical health services within
already existing public health facilities, more than double the appraisal target (300).
However, planned evaluation and research on effectiveness and cost effectiveness of
different partner notification strategies, utilization and effectiveness of STD services, and


18. World  Bank compl etion report data indicate that an additional 39 CTAs were in the process of being established at
the time of the project' s closing.

feasibility of combining symptomatic and clinical testing in facilities was not carried out.
Table F-l in Annex F provides statistics on STD case reports for the period 1996-2001,
which are likely to be a fraction of the true total.

4.10        At the project's outset laboratories lacked the referral capacity to back up lower
level laboratories and to ensure timely and quality services needed for treatment and care.
Project investments supported the upgrading of the network of laboratory facilities with a
view to improving diagnosis, treatment and research for HIV/AIDS                             and STDs. With
project support 43 public laboratories began implementing viral load testing starting in
1997 and 60 laboratories throughout the country were upgraded to do T CD4+
lymphocyte testing. I9 The upgrading of the laboratory network has also enabled the
monitoring of HIV subtypes and resistance to antiretroviral drugs. As a complement to
support under other IBRD loans (REFORSUS project), AIDS I has helped establish an
effective national blood quality control program, as evidenced in a significant reduction
of the share of reported AIDS casescontracted through blood transfusions from 2.4
percent of all casesin 1992 to 0.2% in 2000 (Ministry of Health Epidemiological
Bulletin, March 2002).

4.11        The project was unsuccessful in its initial attempts to set up HIV surveillance.
Despite early attempts under the project to establish HIV surveillance, the system
originally set up under the project was not viable given that follow-up collection samples
and sample sizes were inadequate resulting in confidence intervals that were too high to
be useful. The system was revamped in 1997 with project assistance and improvements
included: a more careful selection of participating institutions, tighter and more central
management, and more rigorous supervision. With these adjustments AIDS I ultimately
did succeedin establishing 150 sentinel surveillance20sites (target of 80) in maternity
clinics, emergency rooms and STD clinics. The project also financed the delivery of 72
courses in epidemiology to 1,598 health care professionals. At the project's closing in
1997, maternity and emergency room sentinel surveillance sites did manage to generate
data on HIV prevalence in time for the project's final evaluation, notably: a prevalence of
1.8 percent among pregnant women (20-24 years) and 4.1% among emergency room
patients (20-24 years). Sentinel surveillance at STD clinics was considered unreliable.
The design of STD surveillance was also modified during project implementation,
facilitating a more decentralized system of 72 state and municipal institutions (vs. 27
state facilities) selected on the basis of technical and geographical criteria. STD
surveillance capacity established under the project generateddata on the clients seeking
such services. These data are not representative of the population at large, or even of
high-risk groups within the population; and they are under-reported.

4.12       AIDS I invested about US$6 million in 65 studies, of which 27 focused on
prevention, risks and behaviors, 16 on diagnosis, treatment and care, 17 on the
epidemiology and biology of the disease and 5 on other topics (costs, cost-effectiveness,
program management and political economy). However, staff of state and municipal
programs visited outside of Rio and Sao Paul0 interviewed by the OED mission noted the

 need for local-level researchthat would be more operationally relevant and useful than
 national level research and researchfocusing on the Southeast. Only a very small portion
 of research efforts and financing was devoted to the development of model refinements
 or to the study of costs and cost-effectiveness of prevention and treatment, which had
 been emphasized in the project design. Some of the research and studies undertaken with
 project support provided important information and insight on HIV and behavioral trends
 in the absenceof regular surveillance activity by the government. Most notably, AIDS I
 invested in a series of three studies of about 850,000 army recruits that provided critical
 data on HIWSTD prevalence and behavior.

 4.13          Project support for ensuring the sustainability of investments at the state and
 municipality               level was considerable. The project succeededin establishing state and
 municipal HIV/AIDS                            coordinating units, whose activities and recurrent costs were
 cofinanced by local government in line with decentralization policy. It is noteworthy that
 participation in the project required state/municipal financing of the personnel costs of
 coordinating units and cost sharing of selected activities. In addition, political and
popular commitment at the state and municipal levels was very high overall thanks to
NGO activism, the high visibility of the program and a participatory process for the
planning and execution of local activities. An important exception was Sao Paul0 city,
which did not, at that time, enjoy strong commitment of local leadership, and whose
performance under the project suffered due to its inability to effectively absorb project
 funds.

4.14           In the absenceof adequatedata on epidemiological and behavioral trends it is not
possible to evaluate the achievement of the project's general objective to reduce the
incidence of HIV and STD infection.2' However, there are data from various studies that


21. This lack of data is a consequence                        of the project's        failure to strengthen adequately        monitoring   and evaluation
capacity, including           epidemiological            and behavioral           surveillance,    discussed later on in this section.

provide some information on trends in prevalence for different populations over different
time periods. With regard to syphilis, prevalence in army conscripts is reported to have
risen from 0.53 percent in 1996 to 1.8 percent in 2002 (Szwarcwald (CL) 2002), while
prevalence among women who delivered babies in health facilities decreasedfrom 2.8
percent in 1998 to 1.7 percent in 2000 (SUS data). Available information on trends in
HIV prevalence also shows a mixed picture. HIV prevalence is reported to have
decreasedamong military conscripts from 0.2 percent in 1996 to 0.12 percent in the
South, 0.19 percent in the North and Central West, and 0.08 percent in Rio and Sao Paul0
in 1998 (Szwarcwald (CL) 2002). HIV prevalence among pregnant/post-partum women
of 20-24 years is reported to have increased during the period 1998 - 2002 from 0.3
percent to 0.6 percent (NASCP 2003). The proportion of children infected at birth has
declined from 8.6 percent in 2000 to 7.6 percent in 2001 and 3.7 percent in 2002 (MoH
statistics).

4.15     With regard to high-risk groups, while available data do indicate some
encouraging signals and trends, they must be interpreted with caution as studies were not
undertaken in the context of a single methodological framework nor did series of studies
necessarily cover exactly the same target populations, or samples, in the same
geographical areas(see Annex C, Table 2 for details). With these caveats, HIV
prevalence seems to have decreasedin the IDU community from 52 percent in 1999 to
36.3 percent in 2001 (UFMGNASCP).         Infection rates among this group in Rio fell to 8
percent by 2000 (Marins, et al. 2003). Prevalence rates of IDUs in Santos are reported to
have risen from 63 percent in 1992 to 65 percent during the period 1994-96 and
subsequently to have declined to 42 percent in 1999, asboth injection frequency and
sharing of needles decreasedand smoking of crack cocaine increased (Mesquita et al.).
While there are no data available on trends in HIV among CSWs and MSM over time, a
study on prevalence among 3000 CSW indicated a low rate of 6.5 percent in 2001
(UNBRVASCP), and prevalence among the MSM community was estimated at an
average of 10.8 percent (Sao Paulo SP, Projeto Bela Vista) during the period 1994-99.
Overall, it can be noted that some 20 years after the first AIDS caseswere identified in
the country, Brazil's HIV epidemic remains concentrated among a high-risk population,
the prevalence of HIV having been reliably estimated by MoH at 0.65 percent of
reproductive age adults.

4. I6    The project provided major support to expand and improve the quality of
diagnosis, treatment and care ofpersons with HIV, AIDS and STDs. With the support
of AIDS II the number of CTAs in Brazil more than doubled from 104 in 1999 to 237 in
2003, thus exceeding the project target to establish 100 new CTAs. The project also
provided support to the functioning and strengthening of existing CTAs through the
provision of training and materials. As shown in Chart F-2 in Annex F, there are now
CTAs in every state in Brazil. The number of persons who were tested for HIV in CTAs
annually rose from 120,468 in 1997 (basedon data from 1997 of 100 CTAs) to 271,056
in 2001 (based on reports from 115 of 174 CTAs). Despite this progress, there are still
many HIV-positive people who have not been tested.

 4.17          The project also financed the significant expansion of low-cost, alternative, in-
 patient and out-patient treatment and care services. Thirty-five new day hospitals, 20
 therapeutic home-based care services and 103 specialized ambulatory services were
  established and 47 conventional hospitals and 28 day hospitals were accredited. Thanks
 to this support (and that provided under AIDS I) Brazil boasts an extensive network of
 treatment and care facilities, including a total of 385 accredited conventional hospitals, 84
 day hospitals (of which 77 are already accredited), 381 specialized ambulatory services
 and 58 therapeutic home-based care services. AIDS II also provided support and
 strengthening to already existing services/facilities in this network. In addition, a total of
 369 civil society projects were financed to addressthe basic treatment and care needsof
 HIV/AIDS             and STD patients. An array of initiatives were supported including: guest
 houses for the travel needs of patients, support groups, social reinsertion, income
 generation support, household support, psychosocial support, mental health services and
 assistancein assessingand adhering to ART. Some 126 projects financed the
 establishment of support homes for PLWHA.                                   The number of patients under ARV
 treatment increased from 33,830 in May 1997 to 129,276 in May 2003 (Ministry of
 Health/NASCP 2003). The number of HIV-positive pregnant women under injecting
 AZT (Azido-Deoxy Thymidine) treatment increased from 1,472 in 1997 to 5,958 in 2002
 (Ministry of HealthNASCP                            2003).

 4.18          Also supported were activities to strengthen the diagnosis and treatment of STDs
 and activities to reduce mother to child transmission of HIV/AIDS                                    and congenital
 syphilis.           Investments included the training of service providers and the development and
 dissemination of guidelines and protocols. STD case reports have increased since the
 Bank's involvement, with sustained increasesin reporting from 1997-2001 (see Table F-l
 in Annex F). However, the total reports for that five-year period of 239,357 remain a
 very small fraction of the likely total.

 4.19          The project strengthened laboratory capacity in Brazil to improve the quality and
 timeliness of services to evaluate and monitor the viral and immune status of HIV/AIDS
 patients. HIV diagnosis was decentralized through some 70 projects to strengthen
 capacity in municipal and public health laboratories and to monitor drug resistance (of
 HIV patients to ARV, and of strains of gonorrhea to antibiotics). The project also
 supported the National System for Quality Control of Diagnostics in carrying out internal
 and external quality audits of some 521 facilities for HIV diagnosis, 357 for hepatitis
 diagnosis, 381 for CD4 and 264 for viral load testing. AIDS II also supported the work

                                              16



of the Distance Education System for Blood Banks and Public Health Laboratories
(TELELAB),     set up with AIDS I assistance,to facilitate optimal use of this resource.
Studies and other assistanceprovided under the project contributed as well to the
strengthening and expansion of capacity to monitor drug resistance (of HIV patients to
ARV, and of strains of gonorrhea to antibiotics). Project support was also provided in the
form of technical and software assistanceand materials and supplies to strengthen the
drugs and condom logistical management system established under AIDS I. AIDS II
investments facilitated an increase in the number of public health laboratories that
participate in external evaluations of diagnostic quality carried out by the National
System of Quality Assurance for AIDS and STD lab tests, from 45 in 1998 to 123 in
2002 (Ministry of Health/NASCP 2003).

4.20     There is no data on accessof the poor and marginalized populations to diagnostic
services and to ARV treatment, but both public sector and NGO personnel brought to the
attention of OED's assessmentmission the need to provide social assistanceto these
groups to encourage and support them in getting tested and in accessing and adhering to
treatment protocols. Underutilization of these services by poor and marginal groups was
not characterized by those interviewed by the mission as merely a factor of geographical
access,but also an aspect of their marginalized status. The mission also noted a
concerted effort on the part of CTAs visited to intensify their outreach work to promote
and encourage a utilization of these services, especially among vulnerable and
marginalized populations.

4.21    The mission noted indications of high quality of these services during field visits,
including: technical capacity and strong client orientation of service providers, reliable
supply of essential drugs and materials and available and good state of infrastructure and
equipment. Another important indicator of service quality and effectiveness is the rate of
ARV resistance. A recent study has documented Brazil's rate in 2003 at a low 6.6
percent, which is a reflection of rigorous patient management and follow-up and of strict
monitoring and control of the distribution of ARV to patients and monitoring of patient
adherence,which is built into management information systems set up with project
assistance (Brindeiro 2003). Thus far, the possibility of behavior reversals due to
Brazil's successful treatment program has not been monitored.

4.22    Survival after AIDS diagnosis has increased sharply from a mean of 5 months in
1989 to 58 months in 1997 and continues to increase (Marins et al. 2003 and Chequer et
al. 1992 ). Since the advent of HAART, the number of hospital admissions per AIDS
patient declined from 1.7 per year in 1996 to 0.28 per year in 2001 (SUS data). Brazil's
experience with HAART replicates what has been seen in developed country world
settings - once HAART is widely available, AIDS largely becomes an outpatient disease,
and hospitalization rates, particularly for common opportunistic infections, decline
sharply. MoH statistics show that during the period 1996 - 2002 implementation of
Brazil's ARV policy has avoided (or delayed) 58,000 new casesof AIDS and 90,000
deaths due to AIDS.   Hospitalization was reduced by 70%, with some 358,000
admissions avoided (1997-2001) and resource savings amounting to some US$2.2 billion
(hospitals and outpatients) (See Table F-3, Annex F). The number of TB casesin
patients with HIV/AIDS    declined by 71.8 percent during this same period (MoH
Statistics). These outcomes are attributable in part to Brazil's success in reducing the

                                              17



 costs of ART both through the establishment of local production capacity of some of
 these drugs and through rigorous negotiation of price reductions of other drugs with
 international drug companies (See Table F-4, Annex F, which shows average costs of
 ART between 1996 and 2002.). These outcomes can also be attributed in part to AIDS II
 investments in improving and expanding treatment and care services, as well as
 investments in strengthening the network of laboratories.

 4.23    Building on the support of thefirst operation, AIDS II made significant
 contributions   to the continued expansion and successful implementation of innovative,
 state-of-the-art prevention activities in Brazil. From 1998 to 2002, 20 mass media
 campaigns were carried out (3 times the number carried out under AIDS I) covering a
range of topics aimed at general and specific audiences. Under AIDS II a substantial
number of targeted interventions were implemented to prevent transmission among high-
risk groups, as well as vulnerable groups, including truck drivers, prisoners, indigenous
populations, poor and marginalized populations, adolescents and women. During the
period 1999-2003 AIDS II financed 547 projects which covered an estimated 899,386
 CSW, 631 projects reaching some 145,807 IDUs (an estimated 18.2 percent of that
population), and 486 projects covering some 3,074,980 MSM reaching a reported
 coverage of 96 percent of that population. Coverage rates are in need of further
 substantiaton and should be interpreted with caution. These figures include both public
 sector and NGO-executed projects (See Table F-5, Annex F.).        Overall, with project
 support the volume of prevention activities increased considerably, both those targeted at
general populations and those targeted at high-risk groups; and prevention work was
further broadened both geographically and in terms of intensified and new interventions
aimed at other at risk groups, including, among others: rural, poor and indigenous
populations, women, prisoners and street children. OED mission discussions with
national, state and municipality program staff and with NGO representatives, combined
with site visits undertaken by the mission, revealed that prevention programs are
prioritized and carried out with strong commitment and concerted effort. IEC material
was plentiful, appropriately targeted to different target groups, widely disseminated and
easily available to others who seek information.   From the mission's observation in states
and project sites visited, prevention work is well grounded in good and trustful exchange
with target groups, who are often involved in design, implementation and refinement of
interventions. In this respect, program staff and NGOs as well as beneficiaries of
prevention work interviewed stressedthe successof the project in securing respect and
legitimacy for marginalized and stigmatized groups.

4.24     Public sector agencies that undertook prevention activities with project support
include: Ministry of Education, Ministry of Justice (Special Secretariat for Human
Rights), National Anti-Drugs Secretariat, and Ministry of Labor. Human rights
promotion was also undertaken by both public and private sector agencies including
capacity building, publications, direct and indirect support of people living with
HIV/AIDS     (PLWHA) and advocacy work with and through executive, legislative and
judicial branches of government.

4.25       The project procured condoms that were made available to the public through
targeted interventions, social marketing initiatives and distribution through the Ministry
of Health. Male condoms distributed through the MoH more than tripled between 2000
and 2003 from 77 million to 270 million and those sold through the commercial sector
increased from 228.4 million in 1997 to 427.1 million in 2003 (MoH/NASCP                                                       2003).
Table 8 shows that over the implementation periods of AIDS I and II the sale of condoms
rose significantly and the mean price of condoms decreased. These trends are attributable
in part to the efforts under these projects both to increase the supply and promote the use
of condoms and to reduce the costs of condoms in to the Brazilian population through a
number of measures, including reduction of duties and taxes. The project also supported
operational research which documented high acceptability rates of female condoms,
especially among men and women reachedby the public health services through
community education efforts (Berquo et al. 1999). The results of this study served to
fine-tune further project investment in the distribution, provision, targeting and social
marketing of female condoms. Among the target groups are CSW, HIV-positive women,
female drug users and women at risk for violence.

4.26       While a national survey of sexual behavior and perceptions did establish baseline
data for 1998 (CEBRAP 2000), this survey was not repeated at the close of AIDS II,
making it difficult to assessthe impact of these activities on behaviors of these group~.~~
However, it is plausible to assume that sustained prevention activities supported under
AIDS II, building on those supported under AIDS I, contributed to Brazil's successin
keeping its prevalence rate below 1% and in the continued concentration of the epidemic
among high-risk groups. In addition, data generatedthrough studies (encompassing a

22. Government      comments (presented      in Annex G) do note that NASCP             is commissioning     a follow-up      survey to be
conducted   in 2004 to enable the tracking of evolutions           in this regard.

                                                              19



 range of populations, timeframes and methodologies) do provide some indication that
 during the life of this project awarenessof the diseaseand of how to prevent its
 transmission has increased and healthier behaviors arebeing adopted both by the general
population and by high-risk groups. Multiple studies on behaviors supported under the
project have not been sufficiently systematic or uniform in their design and
 implementation.         As such most of them only reveal levels for a particular population in a
particular geographical areaover a specific time period, making it impossible to derive
 trends over time within population groups or to compare levels acrossregions.

4.27      With regard to generalpopulations, a population survey conducted in 2003 shows
 a significant increase in the proportion of persons who spontaneously cite the use of
condoms as a method for protecting themselves, from 50 percent in 1998 to 88.9 percent
in 2003 (CEBRAP 2000 and MSIBOPE                          2003). The proportion of sexually active
military conscripts that reported using a condom in their most recent sexual encounter
was 68% in 2003, a slight increase from 1998 data that indicate proportions of 51.2
percent in the North and Central West, 66.6 percent in the South and 67.7 percent in Rio
and Sao Paulo. In its final report on AIDS II MoH reports that use of condoms among
the general population in all sexual encounters declined between 1998 and 2003 from
63.7 percent to 57.8 percent with casual partners and from 21.Oto 11.4 percent with long-
term partners.23

4.28      A 2001 survey of schools carried out by MoH with support from UNESCO
revealed that: 70 percent of the schools carried out prevention activities with students;
97% of all students had correct information on how AIDS was transmitted; and 90
percent of students with active sex lives changed their behavior regarding STD and AIDS
after intensive exposure to school prevention activities. According to MoH statistics,
between 1986 and 2003 use of condom in first sexual encounter among the general
population increased from 4 percent to 55 percent. A 2003 poll reports that 65.2 percent
of persons aged 14-19 reported using a condom in their first sexual encounter. The
project was also successful in increasing the availability of condoms in the country and in
lowering their costs to the public from US$O.57 per condom in 1997 to US$O.zS in 2001,
due largely to reductions/elimination of duties and taxes (Figure 1).

4.29     Interventions targeted to high-riskgroups are shown to have had some impact, as
derived from studies commissioned under the project. As detailed in Annex C, Table 2
these data must be interpreted with caution given issues of representativity of study
samples (primarily participants). Between 1999 and 2001 condom use among IDUs
increased from 42.1 percent to 62.9 percent and the proportion of IDUs ever tested for
HIV increased from 52 percent to 66.4 percent. In addition, needle sharing among this
group decreasedover this same time period from 70 percent to 59.4 percent
(UFMGNASCP).              A study of 3,000 CSW conducted in 2001 revealed that 73.8 percent
of this group (composed of program participants) used condoms with their clients (vs.
60 percent of CSWs not participating in the program) but only 23.9 percent of them used
condoms with their regular (non-paying) partners. Almost half of CSWs studied (49.2


23. MoH does caution in its report that this trend is questionable as the earlier study (CEBRAP  1999) documented
behaviors of an urban-only population   (which typically  registers higher condom use) and the 2003 population poll
included both urban and rural populations.

                                                   20



percent) have been tested for HIV vs. 36% of those not participating. (UNB/NASCP).
Trends in CSW behavior over time are not available. Use of condoms among MSM in
2001 is reported to be high at 81 percent with regular partners and even higher at 95
percent with casual partners (Projeto Bela Vista). No baseline data are available to
indicate levels of condom use among MSM at the start of AIDS I or AIDS II thus making
it difficult to assesstrends over time. Testing history among MSM is reported to be
significant, with 73% of urban men reporting having been tested in 2001 (Projeto Bela
Vista).

4.30     The project was unsuccessful in strengthening evaluation capacity. As detailed
below, project efforts to develop HIV and behavioral surveillance and to strengthen
monitoring and evaluation did not culminate in the design and implementation of
adequate systems for tracking program performance and impact.

4.3 1    Epidemiological surveillance. The project financed training, technical assistance
and supervision to improve routine surveillance of AIDS and ST1 cases,including the
refinement of case definitions both for AIDS (over and under 13 years of age) and for
congenital syphilis and the upgrading of SINAN, the national AIDS case report database
managed by the National Epidemiological Center. Project support to improve HIV
surveillance included technical support and supervision of the sentinel surveillance sites,
which monitor HIV prevalence in health services (maternity clinics, emergency rooms
and STD clinics). AIDS II also financed the design and application of an instrument and
method, and its incorporation into the SINAN, to guide the surveillance of HIV+ women
and exposed newborns. In addition the project supported training and technical
assistance in epidemiological surveillance aimed at professionals responsible for HIV and
STD surveillance and staff working in CTAs. A number of studies were also financed
under the project to supplement data and information on HIV, STD and Hepatitis B
prevalence, and on behaviors covering different populations.

4.32     AIDS surveillance is well established, but it is HIV surveillance and incidence
that are important in measuring and tracking the evolution of this epidemic and in
measuring project impact. While Brazil's HIV surveillance system was strengthened
under this project, it still falls short of a fully functional system that is able to generate a
continuous stream of reliable and representative data that would permit the monitoring of
the epidemic as it evolves in different areasof the country and among different
population groups. During the three-year period 1997-l 999 sentinel surveillance data
was reported twice a year from the three types of sentinel sites: maternities, emergency
rooms and STD clinics. The numbers of sites reporting has fluctuated with each
reporting period, making the data difficult to interpret and also making it difficult to
determine the number of fully functional sentinel sites. In October 1999 reports were
received from 39 STD clinics, 64 maternities and 46 emergency rooms. HIV testing was
done on randomized patients of these clinics producing statistics per semester on around
7,000 STD patients, 12,000 pregnant women and 8,600 emergency room patients
nationwide. In 2000 Brazil introduced significant changesto its surveillance system
because it was perceived that hospital surveillance sites had become reference centers for
HIV/AIDS     and thus were providing biased estimates. The Brazilian surveillance system
now selects a random sample of 150 hospital maternities which have over 500 deliveries
per year to test women delivering in that hospital for a more representative measurement

                                                               21



of HIV prevalence. A different random sample of hospitals, that may include some of the
same hospitals, is used for each measurement. Only two measurements have been taken
since this change: one in 2000 with data from 128 hospital maternities (15,426 pregnant
women tested) and from 25 STD clinics (4,636 STD patients tested) and one in 2003, for
which data is not yet available. It was subsequently decided by the program to drop the
STD clinic sentinel sites as the quality of the data from these sites was considered too
unreliable. The Brazilians have opted for less frequent surveillance measurements
becauseit is considered too expensive to conduct every year. Only half of project funds
allocated to surveillance under AIDS II were used to this end.

4.33       At the end of AIDS II HIV surveillance is still limited to pregnant women and to
military conscripts (the latter through annual surveys).24Data on pregnant women for the
period 1997 through 1999 are difficult to interpret as the numbers of sites reporting
fluctuated from one measurement exercise to the next. Methodology for monitoring HIV
among pregnant women has changed in 2000 making it difficult to derive trends from the
data stream from 1997-99, and measurement has not been sufficiently frequent since
2000. No routine surveillance of pregnant women was undertaken during 2001 and 2002
and the surveillance data on pregnant women for 2003 was not yet available at the
writing of this report. Table F-5 in Annex F presents the summary report on Brazil's
HIV surveillance efforts from 1997 through 2000. High priority, high-risk groups that
are a primary focus of prevention efforts (MSM, IDUs, CSW) are not systematically
included in routine HIV sentinel surveillance efforts. Special studies on HIV among
these groups undertaken with project support have been carried out to supplement
sentinel system data, but they lack a systematic methodology that would have allowed the
tracking of trends over time or cross-regional analysis. With CDC support the NASCP
initiated in 1998 efforts to strengthen its capacity to estimate the incidence of HIV based
on cross-section studies of prevalence.25

4.34       Despite project support, the issues of STD surveillance, identified under AIDS I
and II, persist: STDs are considerably underreported, data come primarily from clinics
and represent only those who seek services rather than the general population or specific
target groups. The syndromic approach to STD treatment26also undermines the accuracy
of reporting. The uncertain validity of STD reporting in Brazil makes this a weak
indicator for behavioral trends and a highly uncertain proxy for HIV trends.

4.35       Behavior Surveillance. With the exception of annual surveys of military
conscripts, there is no surveillance system in Brazil for routinely collecting data on
behaviors of segments of the general population or of high risk groups. AIDS II did
support the establishment of baseline data for 1998 on sexual knowledge and behavior
(CEBRAP 2000). However, this survey was not repeated at the close of AIDS II so as to

24. These data are now being supplemented       by an information   system established to support routing  reporting  of
epidemiological   and behavioral  data on CTA clients by the network of CTAs.

25. This support involves   the application  of the Serologic  Testing Algorithm   for Recent HIV Seroconversion
(STARHS)     strategy, developed by the CDC, which allows for the determination        of wh,ether people with newly reported
cases of HIV were infected within     the past year.

26. The syndromic    approach to STD patient management bases diagnosis on a group of symptoms and treats for all
diseases that could cause that syndrome.     This approach   is recommended    by WHO in developing     country settings as it
provides  for more accurate diagnosis    without  extensive lab tests and allows treatment with a single visit.

                                                22



document trends in knowledge and behavior. NASCP has indicated to the team that this
survey will be repeated in 2004 both to update data and to provide a baseline for AIDS
III. In the absenceof a viable system for evaluating program performance and impact,
the numerous studies and supervisions carried out by a multiplicity    of actors, covering a
range of methodologies, indicators, geographical areas,populations, implementers and
timeframes. The results of these studies are virtually impossible to consolidate in order
to provide a coherent overview of program performance or impact on behaviors.

4.36    Research. Building on support initiated under the first loan, AIDS II financed
clinical and technological research through a competitive process. Research proposals
were widely solicited from a range of qualified public and private institutions and vetted
and approved by a National Research Committee. Of the 31 approved research
proposals, only two focused on STD prevalence and only 1 was on health economics
simply becausevery few were submitted. Regional breakdown of approved proposals is
as follows: 45 percent for Southeast, 26 percent for South, 13 percent for Northeast, 10
percent for Central-West and 1 percent for North. There is no information available as
of this writing on the full list of research financed under AIDS II, the main results of this
research and whether/how research findings were applied for improved program
performance and effectiveness.

4.37    A4onitoring and Evaluation. For the most part the project financed the activities
envisaged in this subcomponent design, including the supervision of activities of states
and municipalities and of NGOs, the undertaking of myriad specific studies and
evaluations targeted at specific activities, executing agencies and target groups, and
annual reporting on project performance. However, a number of important omissions
obstructed the goal of systematic monitoring and evaluation of project performance and
impact. First, the consolidation of indicators and preparation of a M&E plan were not
carried out until the very end of the project. Second, over and above the lack of baseline
data and data on trends in HIV and behavior noted above, there is still incomplete data (at
national and local levels) on the sizes of target populations for program interventions and
on trends in their effective coverage. Baseline studies were envisaged under the project
but not carried out.

4.38    Preparation of state and municipal HIV/AIDS      action plans (POAs) did encourage
local HIV/AIDS     coordination teams to establish some baseline data and to set annual
targets as a part of their planning process, but these plans were not adequately monitored
or evaluated for a number of reasons,most notably the lack of M&E capacity both in the
NASCP and within state and municipal teams and the input orientation and
administrative nature and treatment of theseplans. After a number of failed attempts a
plan for the design and implementation of an M&E system was initiated at the very end
of AIDS II in the context of preparing AIDS III, with technical and financial support
from the Bank, CDC and other partners. Similarly, the establishment of a M&E unit in
the NASCP, the recruitment of M&E staff to carry out these functions at the national and
state levels, the provision of specialized technical assistanceand the design of basic and
in-service training all were recently initiated with CDC support and in the context of
preparing AIDS III. Up to that point, most staff in decentralized levels of the program
did not have the skills to carry out effective M&E and none had the time.

                                               23



4.39     Interviews with state and municipal coordination personnel and with NGOs
indicated a very strong demand for better monitoring and evaluation that would
accommodate their expresseddesire to know and improve the effectiveness and impact of
their efforts. Supervision reporting by the Bank's team during the last few months of
project implementation also notes the strong emphasis the incoming (in 2003)
government places on demonstrating results, which provides incentive to the central unit
to establish good M&E and to move toward a culture of using data for decision-making.

4.40     The project was successful in improving the sustainability of the program
through devolution of some responsibilities to states and municipalities.       It did so
through the continued training, technical support and supervision of state and municipal
coordination units to improve their capacity and successin designing and implementing
their local-level action plans. Approximately 27,500 multidisciplinary      professionals in
the fields of health and education benefited from HIV/AIDS      training delivered through a
network of universities, professional training centers, NGOs and other educational
institutions. Training encompassed a spectrum of skills building in the design and
delivery of prevention and treatment activities and in program management. Fund-to-
fund transfer mechanisms, described above, both ensure continued financing of state and
municipality HIV/AIDS      programs and build government interest and support through co-
financing arrangements. The process of NGO subproject bidding and selection was also
gradually decentralized to eight states under AIDS II, along with the responsibility to
supervise such projects. Ten percent of the financing transferred through the fund-to-
fund mechanism will be earmarked for NGOs. These actions are likely to be sustainable
as they are coherent with decentralization policy, but will need to be further supported
with capacity building efforts to ensurelocal level successin carrying out newly
decentralized responsibilities. Interviews with state and municipal actors (both private
and public) indicate that their AIDS mitigation efforts have been increasingly integrated
into the government's overall poverty reduction efforts, especially at decentralized levels,
but that concerted efforts are still required to improve interface of activities and priorities
with local social assistanceprograms.

4.41     The project did not achieve the objective to identify the most cost-effective
interventions.   No researchwas undertaken to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of
prevention activities. Some analysis of the costs and outcomes of Brazil's treatment and
care program was undertaken and reveal substantial increases, as have been observed in
developed country settings, in survival after AIDS diagnoses, and decreasesin mortality,
morbidity, hospitalizations, opportunistic infection rates, and marked improvements in
quality of life indicators.


5. Ratings

51.      Outcome. Both AIDS I and AIDS II arejudged to have had satisfactory
outcomes overall, as substantiated in the following paragraphs on their relevance,
efficacy and effectiveness.

52       Relevance. The relevance of both AIDS I and AIDS II is rated substantial.        The
last full CAS of March 6, 2000 supports the Government's poverty alleviation objective

                                              24



and includes health services for the poor as a key targeted intervention to this end. While
not mentioned specifically in earlier CAS exercises, the fight against HIV/AIDS      is given
increased prominence in the most recent (May 20, 2002) CAS update. It is presented as
one of the seven Millennium     Development Goals (MDGs), vigorously embraced by both
the Government of Brazil and the Bank, and consistent with their sharedpoverty
alleviation agenda. As such, targets for the prevention and control of HIV/AIDS,      aswell
as for the other MDGs, are specified in the new CAS approved in December 2003. While
the projects made considerable effort to extend their coverage of prevention and care
services to emerging priority populations and to all regions, efforts to target women
remain modest and the North and Northeast regions received less per capita support
relative to other regions (see Tables F-7 and F-8 in Annex F).

53       Efficacy.  Drawing on the assessmentof project performance by objective
presented in Section 4, the overall efficacy of each of the two projects is rated as
substantial.    They have succeededin improving and further expanding prevention
activities, while maintaining a focus on high-risk groups with state-of-the-art prevention
interventions. Both projects have culminated in the considerable extension of a network
of voluntary counseling and testing services and of treatment and care services (with a
substantial shift to low-cost outpatient services) and in the development of crucial
laboratory infrastructure needed to support the treatment program.

54       Research capacity was both utilized and strengthened with project assistance,but
the research financed did not respond to project objectives to document the cost-
effectiveness and impact of various interventions. While HIV surveillance of pregnant
women improved with the establishment of surveillance sites and related training and
support, data is lacking on HIV trends in high risk groups targeted under the project.
Behavior trends among high risk groups and among the general population are not known
as multiple studies using multiple methodologies, timeframes, and indicators are not
amenable to comparison or documentation of trends. Project emphasis on monitoring
and evaluation failed. Finally, establishment of coordination units at state and
municipality levels, and of a system of transfers of financial support against negotiated
annual plans have made significant headway in building capacity and in obtaining the
sustainability of the program.

55       Efficiency.  The efficiency of AIDS I and AIDS II was substantial.      Project
design supported government provision of public goods (epidemiological and behavioral
surveillance, research, monitoring and evaluation), behavior change interventions
targeted at high-risk and vulnerable groups, and early action where the epidemic is not
widespread to avert an epidemic, consistent with efficiency in both epidemiological and
public economics terms (World Bank 1997). Both projects also supported improved
accessof patients to cost-effective health care through the development of low-cost,
alternative services for inpatients and outpatients, and the full integration of such services
into the SUS. The project might have been more forthcoming in extending coverage of
prevention activities to high risk groups in low-prevalence geographical regions to
reflect the good practice of early intervention to maintain low prevalence. The
institutional arrangements for the projects (and the national program) were efficient
overall as they drew significantly on the comparative advantages of the multiple partners
in the fight against HIV/AIDS.    The complementarity of roles and contributions of the

                                              25



public and non-public sectors, respectively, is very strong. The devolution of program
responsibilities to state and municipal levels is still in process, but taking a direction that
will make for more efficient use of comparative advantagesof the various levels of the
program, in sync with overall decentralization efforts. In this light there is scope for
 scaling back the size of NASCP and strengthening the staffing of local units.

 56      Institutional  Development Impact. Institutional development impact of both
projects is rated substantial.   The projects supported improvements to the technical and
managerial capacity of the NASCP to further enhance its leadership, advocacy and
coordination efforts as well as its continued efforts to develop and implement state-of-the
art interventions for prevention, treatment and care, and to organize extensive capacity
building efforts. The design and conditionality of AIDS I contributed significantly to the
development of state and municipal capacity to prepare, negtotiate and implement local
level operational plans.. AIDS II strengthened, consolidated and extended this capacity.
The successful experience under both projects is being institutionalized through the new
law, drafted by the NASCP and signed by the Minister of Health in December 2002,
establishing a fund-to-fund transfer mechanism for qualifying states and municipalities
that are affected by the epidemic.

57       Overall the projects have made a significant contribution to Brazil's ability to
effectively mobilize and utilize human and financial resourcesto achieve national
objectives for combating STDs and HIV/AIDS.        The financing of technical assistance
and of specialized contractual staff under both projects supplemented NASCP capacity
thus enabling it to mount and coordinate an ambitious program. Both projects stimulated
and nurtured public-private partnerships by making financing available for NASCP
contracts with NGOs and CBOs to carry out critical components of the National Program,
in line with their comparative advantages. This arrangement has been institutionalized
and reinforced through capacity building of NGOs/CBOs in proposal-writing and
contracting provided by NASCP and financed under both projects; and it is being
decentralized increasingly to states and municipalities.    Efforts are ongoing to consolidate
staffing of NASCP and to strengthen the staffing of state and municipality coordination
units commensurate with the increased decentralization of program responsibilities and
with the new mechanism for fund-to-fund transfers for HIV/AIDS.

58       Sustainability. Both AIDS I and AIDS II are likely to be sustainable. Prospects
for financial sustainability of project investments have improved considerably since the
design of AIDS I, due to (a) considerable reductions in the costs of care and treatment
due to (i) the establishment of lower-cost alternative care for inpatients and outpatients
and (ii) efforts on the part of the Government to lower the costs of ARV; and (b) the
significant investment in prevention efforts that may have slowed the rate of infections
and thus of the pool of those requiring care and treatment. These achievements do not,
however, deny the need for continued efforts: to contain costs, to strive for efficiency in
allocation and implementation and to ensure adequatefinancing. Devolution of program
responsibilities to states and municipalities will underpin sustainability, both from an
institutional perspective and from a financial (cost-sharing) perspective. With the
important exception of monitoring and evaluation, technical and economic resilience of
the program is strong and are likely to continue given the strong capacity and leadership
of the program. The program has enjoyed strong Government and popular support for

                                                                26



some 10 years and has thus been supported and its budget protected in the face of
economic shocks and changesin leadership (including Ministers of Health and Head of
State). Strong political constituencies and the Constitutional mandate for universal
accessto ART provide strong assurancesfor the continued sustainability of the treatment
program in particular. Many if not most NGOs working on HIV/AIDS                                      in Brazil have
relied heavily on transfers from the NASCP for funding under the project. There will be
continued need for NGOs' critical contributions to HIV/AIDS                               control and thus for
continued public financing of NGO contracts.

59         Bank Performance.               With regard to the design of both projects Bank
performance was satisfactory.                  The quality at entry of each project was adequate.
Project designs were technically and economically sound and strategic in their focus.
First they were designed to support the Government in ensuring that public good
elements of the program continue to be accorded top priority (targeted prevention
activities, research, surveillance, monitoring and evaluation) and in supporting care and
treatment through studies and investments to contain costs of services and improve their
quality and effectiveness. Second, Bank financing was conceived to stimulate innovation
and reform, particularly: (i) the use of public monies to finance contracts with civil
society to implement HIV/AIDS                    activities and (ii) the establishment of state and
municipal coordination units and the transfer of financing to these entities to implement
work program agreementsprepared by local-level actors. Preparation was undertaken in
a context of strong Government ownership and elicited the inputs and perspectives of
multiple stakeholders. The importance of baseline data and monitoring and evaluation
were emphasized in both designs, but were not sufficiently pursued during
implementation.           More upstream support and guidance might have been given to the
design of an M&E system and plan, and surveys should have been undertaken to
establish epidemiological and behavioral baselines during preparation/launch stagesto
enhance readiness for implementation and to set the stage for the setting and monitoring
of targets.

5.10       The Bank's performance during implementation of AIDS I was mixed, but
unsatisfactory.          Only four full supervision missions were carried out during the four-
year implementation period,z7half of the Bank's norm of two supervisions per year; and
supervision undertaken was not sufficiently rigorous. None of the three weaknessesof
project performance identified in this assessment(inadequate M&E, weak surveillance
system, and lack of cost-effectiveness analysis of activities to inform future strategic and
resource allocation decisions) were adequately addressed. Bank reports and follow-up
communication with Government on the project launch reveal a strong focus on
disbursement and procurement and do not addressthe importance of establishing baseline
data for M&E.          It was only in 1997, a year before the project's closing, that Bank
management first mentioned in a routine follow-up letter to the Government the need to
undertake evaluation activities during the next (remaining) 12 months.                                  The mid-term
review (MTR) was not fully exploited as an opportunity for renewed focus on the

27. While   Bank data on AIDS I reports 9 supervision     missions, a review of project status reports crosschecked  with
documents contained    in project files documents only four full supervision    missions taking place, respectively, on:
6/l 7/94, 6/l 6/95, 9126'96 and 5/21/97.    Remaining   missions were not full supervision   missions.  Rather they were
small, often one-person,   missions in Brazil on other business but mandated to spend a few days on very selective
oversight  of project performance,   in line with their respective specialties (e.g., IEC, procurement).

                                               27



 project's original development objectives and to addressand correct weak performance
 on surveillance, monitoring and evaluation and cost-effectiveness analysis. The MTR
 report recommended that the Government consolidate indicators and prepare an
 evaluation plan (a recommendation also found in earlier supervision reports). Despite
 these shortcomings, supervision missions did provide technical oversight and sound
 advice in maintaining an emphasis on prevention activities, especially for high-risk
 groups, and in refining the content and coverage of prevention and treatment/care
 interventions.

 5. I I  The Bank 3 performance during supervision of AIDS II was also mixed, but
 satisfactory overall. During the four-year, four-month life of the project, seven
 supervision missions were undertaken for an average of one every seven months, in line
with Bank coefficients. Supervisions for the most part were candid, proactive and
 specific in identifying issues and in recommending their resolution. Among other
recommendations (on technical quality and coverage/equity issues), persistent
weaknesses in surveillance and in monitoring and evaluation were raised and specific
direction was provided during every supervision, both in Aide-memoires and in internal
reporting. The MTR placed specific emphasis and provided operational advice on
identifying the most cost-effective prevention interventions, strengthening M&E
capacity, and strengthening epidemiological surveillance. However, baseline data were
never established nor was program coverage documented or monitored. A breakthrough
was made on the push for monitoring and evaluation during the last year of the project,
and is attributable in great part to the leverage of AIDS III preparation. Staffing of
missions included consultant epidemiologists who prepared technical reports advising on
the nature of improvements needed,but there was insufficient technical advice and rigor
in establishing a core program of HIV and behavior surveillance of the general
population and of high-risk groups necessaryfor documenting trends and for tracking
program performance and impact. Despite unsatisfactory performance on monitoring and
evaluation, this element of the.project was rated as satisfactory throughout
implementation, aswas achievement of development objectives. Had management rated
the project components unsatisfactory where warranted, additional effort might have
been leveraged to rectify weak aspectsof project performance.

5.12     Borrower Performatzce. The performance of the Borrower under AIDS I was
satisfactory overall.    During the design of AIDS I, Borrower commitment was very
strong and it assumed its responsibility in undertaking a sound technical preparation and
in ensuring the participation of a range of key stakeholders, encompassing key federal-
level agencies, representatives from states and municipalities and from the NGO
community.     The Borrower's performance during implementation was also satisfactory.
Counterpart obligations were met. Program/project management was well staffed and
very efficient as evidenced by the following: (a) the project was executed within the
original timeframe, (b) financial management was consistently satisfactory; and (c) the
loan was fully disbursed. Contracts with NGOs and transfers to states and municipalities
were managed and implemented in a satisfactory manner, although supervision of these
executing agencies might have been stronger. Most quantitative project implementation
targets were met or exceeded (number and targeting of prevention projects, number of
NGO-executed projects, numbers of new services established/strengthened). The
Borrower's performance fell short of expectations, however, with regard to its failure to

                                               28



evaluate program/project impact, as well as the cost-effectiveness of prevention
interventions.


5.13     Borrower performance under AIDS II was mixed, but satisfactory overall.
Building on the experience of AIDS I, project preparation was technically sound overall
and participatory. However, while many relevant lessons of experience under AIDS I
were incorporated into the design of AIDS II, Borrower analysis was insufficient with
regard to the above-mentioned failures (monitoring and evaluation, cost-effectiveness
analysis, and surveillance) and resolve to addressand correct them. The Borrower's
performance during AIDS II implementation was satisfactory overall. Counterpart
obligations were met. Project management, NGO contracting, and transfers to statesand
municipalities continued to be well executed by the Borrower. Most quantitative project
implementation targets were met or exceededon all three project components.
Unfortunately, the same failures of AIDS I persisted under AIDS II: weak monitoring
and evaluation; weak epidemiological surveillance and no systematic behavioral
surveillance; and virtually no cost-effectiveness analysis for informing priority-setting
and resource allocation. With the strong capacity in Brazil for research and survey work
in a multiplicity  of disciplines (economic, epidemiology and sociology), these failures are
likely attributable to the lower priority accorded these activities by the Borrower relative
to prevention, treatment and care interventions.


6. Findings and Lessons

61      Failure to establish critical baseline data on HIV infection rates and on
behaviors among high-risk and general population groups, and failure to undertake
systematic surveillance to document trends in HIVand         behaviors in both of these
groups make it dif'jcult   to track the evolution of the epidemic over time and to evaluate
the effectiveness and impact of program interventions.       While Brazil has implemented
many innovative and theoretically cost-effective interventions, evidence of the actual
costs, effectiveness and impact of its efforts is lacking. AIDS I and II have had limited
successin strengthening Brazil's surveillance of HIV infection and of behaviors among
priority populations. This has undermined Brazil's ability to evaluate the impact of its
prevention efforts on behaviors and on the epidemiology of the disease. In the absenceof
fully functional systems for routine monitoring of epidemiological and behavioral trends,
Brazil has been forced to rely on indirect tools (ad hoc research and studies, often
covering different populations, timeframes and geographical regions) to gain an
appreciation of program performance and impact.

62      Inadequate data on the size and coverage of target populations for the
prevention and treatment programs, respectively, especially at the state and local levels,
undermine the efficiency and effectiveness of HIV/AIDS         interventions.  The size and
coverage of high-risk groups for prevention are not adequately documented in Brazil
making it difficult to establish viable targets or to estimate the'level of effort and
resourcesneeded for effective intervention. While there are national estimates of the size
of MSM and IDU populations, these are rudimentary at best and not meaningful at state
and local levels. Baseline surveys were planned at the projects' outset, but never carried

                                                     29



    out. By the same token, the effective coverage and accessof the treatment program (as a
    proportion of ARV-eligible      persons) is not known. Baseline surveys, promotion of VCT
    services, improved outreach and integration of HIV/AIDS          interventions with other health
    services are all critical in this regard.

    63       Early, rigorous and sustained prevention efforts are likely to keep the pool of
    I&V and AIDS patients small relative to the counterfactual, and thus to reduce the
    burden on a country's health system and make treatment and care more feasible and
    affordable.   It is plausible from available (albeit limited) data that prevention activities
    undertaken over the past 15 years in Brazil may have contributed to containing HIV
    infection rates and the number of new AIDS cases,thus averting a scenario of more rapid
    spread and the transition to a generalized epidemic. Over and above the avoidance of the
    devastating consequencesof HIV/AIDS           on individuals, families, communities and on the
    country's development prospects overall, the number of HIV infections and AIDS cases
    averted (as reflected in declining incidence) has reduced significantly the costs and
    challenges of providing adequatequality and coverage of treatment and care. Simply put,
    the continued success and affordability of Brazil's treatment and care program depends
    critically on the success of its prevention efforts.

    64       NGOs have a critical role to play in thefight against HIV/AIDS.        In Brazil
    NGOs have proven highly effective in reaching stigmatized and marginalized groups
    making available to them both prevention and care services, for which they have a
    comparative advantage vis-a-vis public services. Their target populations constitute the
    three highest-risk groups that constitute the top priority for the prevention program:
    MSM, IDUs and CSW.          They have also demonstrated their effectiveness in serving as an
    interface between vulnerable groups, such as the poor and women, and the public
    services with a view to improving accessand utilization.       They also continue advocacy
    work.

    65       Even when financing      a relatively modest share of the overall costs of a well-
     l


    establishedprogram, Bank support to HIV/AIDS            efforts can make significant
    contributions to program expansion and capacity building when it is strategically
.   allocated. While financial support provided under AIDS I and AIDS II amounted,
    respectively, to only about 30 percent and 10 percent of national expenditure on STDs
    and HIV/AIDS      during their respective implementation periods, such support was
    channeled to the most cost-effective components, as indicated by evidence amassedon
    international experience evaluated thus far (World Bank 1997). AIDS I and II devoted
    significant financial and technical support to the design and delivery of prevention
    activities, including innovative, state-of-the-art interventions aimed at changing the
    behavior of high-risk groups, aswell asto the expansion and promotion of counseling
    and testing services. Bank support to improvements and expansion of treatment and care
    was selective and strategic, focusing on the establishment of lower-cost alternatives,
    including an increasing shift to outpatient care, and on improving service quality through
    capacity building of service providers and of the laboratory network. These inputs
    combined with Brazil's achievements in significantly lowering the cost of ARVs have
    lowered the cost of care and treatment and improved the quality of these services.

                                                           30



 66       Bank support can bring legitimacy and leverage to controversial activities and
 to stigmatized segments of society. The strategic orientation of Bank's assistance:(a) has
provided leverage in mobilizing additional national resources for HIV/AIDS                           activities at
 all levels of government, especially for controversial prevention interventions such as
 needle exchange programs; and (b) has been instrumental in securing respect and
 legitimacy for marginalized or stigmatized groups who were both implementers and
beneficiaries of Bank support (e.g., commercial sex workers, prisoners, transgender
persons and MSM, IDUs, people living with HIV/AIDS                          and their advocates).

 67      A research program that is ad hoc and uncoordinated in its conception is
likely to generate a large volume of information and data that will be difficult to
interpret and usefor measuring and improving program performance and impact.
While the researchprogram in Brazil has produced considerable information and data, it
has not been possible to derive trends in the epidemic and in behaviors or insights on
other aspects of program performance. Brazil's HIV/AIDS                        program would have
benefited from a master plan for research, conceived to support its strategic objectives,
both (a) in the choice and prioritization of topics for studies and operational research, and
(b) in the standardization of methodology that would have accommodated the analysis of
data across studies and of trends over time.

68       Project design and conditionality              can be strategic in initiating and supporting
institutional     innovations which are capable of expanding and using more fully
program implementation capacity, most notably: (a) use of public monies to further
stimulate and mainstream the contracting of NGOs to work on prevention and
care/treatment, in line with their comparative advantages;(b) the creation of state and
municipality level HIV/AIDS              and STD Coordination Units, the funding of locally
developed work program proposals that would be the subject of formal agreements
(contracts) between respective Coordination Units and the NASCP, and the co-financing
of overhead costs and inputs by local governments; and (c) the funding of multisectoral
responsesfor prevention and human rights promotion with Ministries of Education,
Justice, Interior, among others. These innovations (described in paragraph 2.3-2.6)have
served to solidify and expand partnerships with civil society and with other development
sectors and local government and are being consolidated and institutionalized.


7. Future Directions

71       Over the past five years OED has distilled the experience of the World Bank in
Biazil through a number of reviews that are relevant to the fight against HIV/AIDS.28
Taken together, these reviews point to a number of challenges for poverty alleviation and
health sector development in Brazil over the coming years. They highlight the
importance of: improving M&E to measure performance and impact and thus to improve
effectiveness and outcome; reaching poor marginalized groups and regions (especially
the North and Northeast); and sustaining and further improving public-private

28. These reviews include most notably:  the Country Assistance Evaluation: Brazil of May 15, 2003, The Brazil Health
System: Impact Evaluation  Report of June 30, 1998, Brazil Maternal and Child Health of February 26, 2002, and
NGOs in World   Bank-Supported   Proiects in Brazil: A Background  Paper for OED's Study of NGOs in World Bank-
Supported Projects of July 29, 1999.

                                              31



partnerships. The decade of experience of Bank support to HIV/AIDS         in Brazil resonates
with themes and recommendations raised in the previous OED reports. With the
imminent launch of a third Bank-financed loan for HIV/AIDS       in Brazil, whose design
has incorporated many of the lessons of the past decade,the following suggestions for
further improving the development effectiveness of HIV/AIDS       efforts in Brazil are
offered.

72*     First andforemost, Brazil should take the necessary steps to improve its
capacity and incentives to monitor and evaluate program performance and impact and
to document the cost-effectiveness of program efforts.

*   First, in line with UNAIDS guidelines (UNAIDS 2000 and 2002), Brazil should
    continue refining and expanding its surveillance efforts to enable the routine and
    systematic monitoring and analysis of trends in HIV infection as well as trends in
    behaviors among key populations. Second generation surveillance systems are
    designed to permit the analysis of behaviors both to anticipate and to explain trends in
    HIV infections. Given the current status of the epidemic in Brazil (still concentrated
    among populations with high risk behaviors, with heterosexual transmission being the
    primary and growing mode of transmission), the surveillance of HIV infection and of
    behaviors should focus on high-risk groups with more than 5 percent infection rates
    (MSM, IDU, CSW) and should also monitor trends in the general population, paying
    particular attention to links between thesetwo groups, particularly through bridge
    populations (female partners of IDUs and bisexuals and clients of CSW), and to
    consequent risks of rapid spread of the virus in the general population. HIV and
    behavioral surveillance of high-risk groups should be carried out on a regular basis
    and may be most efficiently executed at the decentralized level with a view to
    facilitating more in-depth assessmentof local-level issues and trends and improved
    responses. AIDS III is supporting Brazil in its efforts to exploit fully the voluminous
    data currently available through ad hoc studies and surveys and through the health
    information system, but this will not eliminate current and future needs for
    systematically collected data on HIV and on behavior of key populations. NASCP's
    plans to carry out a national sexual and risk behavior survey in 2004 to update the
    1998 baseline survey (CEBRAP 2000) is an important step in this regard.

    Second, the time is ripe to design a monitoring and evaluation system and strategy
    that is decentralized and results-based: (a) the recently adopted fund-to-fund transfer
    mechanism for supporting HIV/AIDS      in states and municipalities is based on the
    principle of results-based planning and management; (b) as noted earlier, local level
    public sector staff and NGOs have expresseda strong demand for good and
    meaningful M&E indicators, guidelines and training to enable them to track and
    improve their performance and impact; and (c) the new government is very
    committed to the design and implementation of a results-based approach to
    development programs. Such a system should establish baseline data on the size and
    current program coverage of target populations at the state and local levels to permit
   realistic target setting and effective monitoring and evaluation of program
   performance, as well as to assessthe level of effort and resources needed for a
    successful program. The monitoring and evaluation system should also accommodate
   the need for systematic evaluation of interventions implemented by NGOs against

                                              32


    program targets set at the national, state and local levels. Government comments
    (provided in Annex G) highlight recent achievements and ongoing efforts to redefine
    the M&E strategy for HIV/AIDS       in favor of a more decentralized and results-based
    orientation, and note the continued support of CDC and the World Bank to this end.
    Of particular note are (i) the recent establishment of five sites of excellence in each of
    Brazil's five regions to foster and promote M&E activities at the decentralized level;
    and (ii) the development of postgraduate training in M&E of STD/HIV/AIDS
    designed to foster decentralization and institutionalization of M&E activities.

0   Third, the government should commission studies to document systematically the
    cost-effectiveness of program components and pilot interventions through (a) the
    design and active direction of a researchprogram that emphasizes cost-effectiveness
    and impact analysis; and (b) the solicitation and exploitation of considerable research
    capacity available in Brazil in the disciplines of economics, epidemiology (especially
    HIV incidence research) and sociology. Studies should prioritize the evaluation of
    the cost-effectiveness of current interventions aimed at MSM, IDUs and CSW. Such
    a program should be iterative in the sensethat it should both influence and monitor a
    continued fine-tuning of interventions and approachesthat will enhance cost-
    effectiveness and improve the efficiency of resource allocation. Cost-effectiveness
    analysis will also be useful to other countries looking to build their HIV/AIDS
    programs on the experience of Brazil's long-established and innovative programs.

*   Finally, rigorous monitoring and evaluation of Brazil's treatment program is critical,
    both becauseit will allow Brazil to track and improve the effectiveness and impact of
    its treatment and care program, and becausethe Brazilian experience, well
    documented, will provide guidance and insight to many other countries seeking to
    establish or strengthen national treatment programs. Monitoring and evaluation of the
    treatment program should encompass: behavior and compliance of those under
    treatment and their long-term effects on transmission, drug resistance, effective
    coverage, and equity in accessto services and in adherence.

73.      In the meantime, in order to further consolidate and sustain Brazil's fight
against HIV/AIDS      and to achieve maximum impact, NASCP leadership must
mobilize human andfinancial      resources around the highestpriorities     of the program,
as evidenced by international experience to date. Government support to prevention
should remain strong, ensuring that it is accorded highest priority.   This will remain a
challenge, especially as Brazil's treatment policy is mandated by the constitution and has
a strong public constituency, whereas the many positive externalities of prevention are
typically less appreciated by the public. Prevention efforts must continue to target
behavior change in high-risk populations (MSM, IDUs, CSW) and expand efforts to
better target emerging vulnerable groups (such as women, the poor, rural/interior
populations). In addition, efforts to improve and expand surveillance, diagnosis and
treatment of STDs, including enhancedoutreach and targeting, must be renewed and
intensified as this package of activities constitutes a critical element of an effective
prevention strategy. Sustained efforts are also neededto monitor and contain (if not
reduce) the costs of care and treatment, as well as to ensure adequatefinancing of such
services, all in the face of changing costs and technologies. By their very nature, public
goods provision should be a priority for Government support, most particularly:

                                               33



surveillance, research,monitoring and evaluation, capacity building and institutional
development, and sustained support/development of the laboratory network.

74.      In light of the trends of the epidemic, which indicate a spread to bridge
populations, many of whom include women, poor populations, and rural/interior
populations, equity will become an even more important        objective of the national
HIV/AIDS     program as it attempts to reach these groups. This being said, there is also a
need to continue and intensify targeted behavior change interventions aimed at highest-
risk groups (MSM, IDUs and CSW). Both prevention and care and treatment
interventions were relatively easy to mount when high-risk and affected populations were
concentrated for the most part in and around the South and Southeast Regions and in
urban areas. Both NGOs specialized in reaching high-risk target groups (MSM, IDUs,
CSW) and health services responsible for monitoring and treating those affected by HIV
and AIDS were more readily available and generally capable of providing needed
services. This being said, only coverage of MSM is satisfactory at 96 percent.
Considerable effort needs to be made to increase the coverage of IDUs (roughly
estimated at 18 percent) and of CSW, whose effective coverage by the program is not
known (Ministry of Health/NASCP draft final evaluation). Equity has been an important
principle of the program from the outset and will become an increasingly challenging
goal in the future. The emerging vulnerable groups are considerably harder to reach by
nature of their locations and their status in society; and they do not typically seek out
social support and services, even where they are available.     More effort needs to be made
to improve coverage of HIV/AIDS       interventions especially in the Northeast (seeTables
F-7 and F-8, Annex F). Furthermore, women and the poor should not be addressed,
respectively, ashomogeneous groups given that subgroups within each of these
categories are exposed to a spectrum of risks according to the multiplicity    of situations
and vulnerabilities of these subgroups. Operational researchand concerted efforts to
effectively reach these groups will be a major challenge of the program.

75.      Given the maturity of Brazil's HIV/AIDS     program and its emerging challenges,
consolidation and decentralization of the institutional framework for the figkt against
HIV/AIDS      and STDs should bepursued with a view to strengthening the capacity of
state and municipality    HIV/AIDS   units to assume considerably increased
responsibilities for strategic program management, oversight and implementation, as
well asfor managing partnerships with civil society and local level government.           Such
activity might be underpinned by the undertaking of an assessmentof the overall
institutional and organizational framework for the fight against HIV/AIDS       (at all levels
of the system) in light of decentralization and other reforms and in light of its emerging
priorities. Such an assessmentwould be complemented by state/municipal-level
assessmentsof opportunities for improved public-private partnerships. On the basis of
these assessments,fine-tuning of the organization, mandates and staffing of different
levels of the program, and of mechanisms for partnerships could render program efforts
more efficient and cost-effective. Local level establishment of more operationally
relevant baseline data on program coverage and performance is needed to facilitate both
the setting of targets and the monitoring and evaluation of program performance.
Instruments and processescan be improved to evolve more fully towards performance-
based management. Pedagogical supervision and accountabilities need to be
strengthened considerably.

76      Now, more than ever, efforts should be devoted to the integration of HIV/AIDS
and STD control activities into the SUS, particularly    special programs within the SUS,
such asfamily health and reproductive health. It will be impossible to make significant
headway in reaching the emerging target groups and vulnerable populations (women, the
poor, rural/interior populations) of the program unless basic health services are more
accessible to them and more fully utilized. This is indeed a formidable challenge, which
will require improvements to the quality, coverage, equity and outreach of priority health
programs and services. Improvements to HIV/AIDS         work and to health system
performance, especially primary health care and public health, can and should be
simultaneous and synergistic.

77      NASCP should intens@ efforts to encourage afuller utilization of CTA
  l


services now available in the country. Most people in Brazil who are infected with HIV
are not aware of their seropositive status. An important contribution to prevention efforts
is for people to be aware of their status and to take necessary action both to seek
treatment and care and to prevent the transmission of infection to their partners.

Annex C. HIV/AIDS                               Epide            ic in Brazil.

            With the first AIDS casesdiagnosed in 1982, the HIV/AIDS                                     epidemic in Brazil is now
entering its third decade. HIV/AIDS                        in Brazil was first characterized by early (1980-85) and
rapid spreadof HIV-l                among urban homosexual and bisexual men (MSM), an epidemic similar
in scope, spread and epidemiology to the epidemics in North America and Western Europe. This
outbreak was concentrated in major coastal cities, including Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. It
was soon followed by substantial spread in urban injecting drug users (IDU), again in Sao Paul0
and Rio, but also in the southern States of Rio Grande Do Sul and Santa Catarina. By 1990, IDU
spread accounted for approximately 20 percent of HIV infections in Brazil (World Bank 1993).
Since both MSM and IDU outbreaks involved few women, the early gender ratio of infection
was roughly 25: 1 male to female.

           The second decade of HIV/AIDS,                        roughly 1992-2002, was marked by increasing spread
of HIV among high-risk heterosexuals, including commercial sex workers (CSW), sexually-
transmitted disease (STD) clinic attendees,and the wives and sex partners of male IDUs or
bisexuals. The gender ratio in AIDS casereports has fallen to 1.7:1 male to female in 2003,
suggesting a feminization of the epidemic, as well as declines in infections among men that have
occurred some 10 years ago. During this period AIDS morbidity and mortality rose, as those
infected progressed clinically and developed opportunistic infections, most importantly HIV-
associated tuberculosis. AIDS mortality peaked at 12/100,000 in 1995, before the advent of
highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART),                            and has been declining ever since, reaching
6.3/100,000 by 2000.                 As of 2000 there were an estimated 600,000 Brazilians living with HIV
infection, down from PAHO's estimate of 750,000 in 199229.As of March 2002,237,588 AIDS
cases and 1lo,65 1 deaths from AIDS had been reported since the beginning of the epidemic. In
the absenceof adequateHIV surveillance data, the population prevalence of HIV has been
reliably estimated at 0.65 percent through national probability sampling of pregnant women in
200230,well below the 2 percent rate UNAIDS has suggestedfor describing generalized
epidemics (Szwarcwald (CL) 2002). Brazil's HIV epidemic in 2003 thus remains concentrated,
still largely limited to individuals and groups engaging in high-risk behaviors for HIV, including
MSM, IDU, CSW, heterosexuals with multiple partners and female partners of IDU and bisexual
men. While transmission doubtless continues to occur in persons at risk (and an increasing
proportion of persons at risk are women, especially partners of IDUs and bisexual men), there is
no evidence of acceleration or increasing rates of new HIV infection. Rather HIV infections are
stable or slightly declining, while HIV/AIDS                           survival times are significantly increasing.

           The modes of transmission of the epidemic, the prevalence and behaviors of high-risk
groups, and the prevalence by region of the country have evolved since the early 1980s. From

29. As part of the preparation     of AIDS   III, the Bank estimated that about 800,000 Brazilians       were infected in 2002.   The
government     is currently  preparing  an estimate for 2003.

30. A study by Szwarcwald        (CL) and Carvalho      (2001) included    132 sentinel sites and anonymous    blood collections  from 15,426
pregnant   women.     Overall  0.47% of women (95% CI 0.36, 0.58) were HIV infected.             Using a gender ratio derived   from recent
AIDS    reporting, rates in men of reproductive       age were estimated at 0.84% (95% CI 0.65, 1.04). This gave a combined
population   prevalence    of 0.65% (95% CI 0.5 1,0.80)       for the population   aged 15-49 years nationwide.    This well-done   study is
likely to be the best estimation    available  of the actual HIV infection     rate in Brazil in 2000.  Using wider (68%)    confidence
intervals and census data on the national population          generates total numbers of HIV infections    at 597,000 with a lower limit of
548,000   and an upper bound of 647,000.         It is this study that generated the widely   used figures of 0.65% HIV prevalence     and the
estimate of 600,000    people living with HIV in 2000, and there is little reason to think that these estimates are substantially        lower
or higher than the 68% confidence       intervals.    While the history of HIV/AIDS      suggests complacency    is always a danger, the
characterization   of a still concentrated   epidemic     seems, on the whole, correct.

     1980 to 1990 sexual transmission accounted for 63.8 percent of AIDS cases and this has
     gradually increased to 74.4 percent of AIDS casesin 2000. Within this category, transmission
    through MSM decreasedby more than half from an estimated 47.4 percent of all AIDS cases
    during the 1980s to 20.3 percent in 2000, while the share of casesattributable to heterosexual
    transmission more than tripled from 16.4 percent to 54.1 percent. Heterosexual transmission is
     still limited to high risk groups (partners of IDUs and bisexual men and people with multiple
    partners). Transmission through intravenous drug use rose from an estimated 18.5 percent of
    total casesin the 1980s to a high of 24.8 percent in 1992 and subsequently declined in the
    ensuing years to 11.4 percent in 2000. Transmission by transfusion has decreasedas a share of
    reported AIDS casesfrom 5.3 percent in the 1980s to 0.2 percent in 2000 and perinatal
    transmission rose from 1.8 nercent in the 1980sto 2.5 nercent in 2000 (see Table 1).

                                       Studies on the HIV prevalence of the highest risk groups reveal prevalence levels of 36.3
    percent among IDUs, 10.8 percent among MSM and 6.5 percent among CSW (seeTable 2) for
    recent years in various samples, most of them non-national. As noted in Table 2, these data must
    be interpreted with caution. Trend data on HIV prevalence over time are not available for these
    groups.

                                      Incidence of AIDS in Brazil, as measured by year of diagnosis, increased from
    8.2/100,000 in 1991 to a high of 18.2/100,000 in 1998 with a decline to 12.0 recorded in 2002,
   but patterns across regions vary.                                                                                                 In 2002 the South surpassedthe Southeast as the region with
    the highest incidence; and incidence rates in the North and Northeast, while showing slight
    decline in 2000, are still of concern (See Table 3). Again, trends in AIDS casesreflect levels of
   transmission that occurred some 10 years before.

Source: Ministry         of Health/NASCP         2003, compiled    from the following      studies:
 a/ Federal University          of Minas Gerais and NASCP on 287 IDUs in five cities
 b/ Federal University          of Minas Gerais and NASCP on 869 IDUs in seven cities
 c/ Federal University          of Brasilia and NASCP on 3000 CSW in five cities

 e/ Opinion         poll carried out by IBOPE on 1,200 MSM              in 10 capital cities


Note: All of these data need to be interpreted with caution. The first study on IDUs was of
dubious quality and included only program users. The data on CSW condom use and HIV
testing refer only to the CSWs who participated in the project. Use of condoms with clients by
non-participating CSWs is less than that for participating CSWs (60% vs 74%) as is the
percentage of those ever tested for HIV 36% vs 49%. Data on MSM for 1994-1999 relies on a
very biased sample, given that more was considerable sample attrition.

       COMMENTS            ON THE ASSESSMENT               REPORT        ON THE      AIDS    I AND AIDS      II
                                     PROJECTS,       PREPAIWD          BY IBRD

           The IBRD      Operations    Evaluation   Department     submitted    a draft Project Performance
Assessment      Report on the First and Second AIDS and STD Control                Projects (IBRD     Loans 3659-
BR and 4392.BR)         to the National    STD/AIDS     Control    Program (NASCP),        with the request that
the National    Program     (NP) review the draft and provide         feedback   on the document.

           After a process of shared team work by the NP units, the following               comments     were
produced     and submitted.

           Epidemiological       surveillance:    In accordance     with the UNAIDS       guidelines,  Brazil is
required    to develop    Second Generation      Surveillance    by combining     a set of strategies designed to
ensure "information        useful for action in public health."      These strategies are: universal      and
compulsory      notification   of AIDS (since 1986) and of Seropositive          Pregnant Women        and Exposed
Newborns      (since 2000);    sentinel surveillance    of HIV and risky behaviors        (by means of formation
of sentinel groups and sentinel services); monitoring            of HIV prevalence      in more vulnerable
populations;    and performance       of cross-section   studies in the general population       and among
groups at high risk of infection,       in addition  to cross-linking    of the national   databases (National
Notification    System for Communicable          Diseases, Mortality     Data System and Hospital        Data
System, plus SICLOM          [Control    of pharmaceutical     procurement,    stock and distribution
information     system],   SI-CTA     [Information   Systems - Testing and Counseling          Centers]   and
SISCEL      [Control   of laboratory    tests and examinations     of the AIDS'STD       program]).

           In the case of AIDS I, "150 sentinel surveillance          sites (target:   80) were established    in
maternity    clinics, emergency      rooms [these sites did succeed in generating         data on HIV prevalence
in time for the evaluation       of the AIDS I project]    and STD clinics [not considered        reliable]"
(pp. 13-14, paragraph      4.11) and, in addition,    "research    and studies undertaken      with project
support provided       important   information    and insight on HIV and behavioral         trends" (p. 14,
paragraph    4.12).    In point of fact, the research was not only financed         by the NASCP but actually
formed    its surveillance   system.

          With regard to the AIDS II project,        2001 was the year in which we started setting up the
Testing   and Counseling       Centers Information     System for STD/AIDS         (SI-CTA),    with the aim of
generating    a continuous     flow of reliable   and representative     data for serological   and behavioral
surveillance    of HIV among pregnant         women and some groups at high risk of infection.            In 2003,
during   the time of the Bank mission, there were already data recorded              in this system and it is not
true that "at the close of AIDS II, surveillance        is still limited to pregnant    women and military
conscripts, " that "no routine surveillance        was undertaken      during  2001 and 2002,"     and that "the
data for 2003 is not yet available"         (pp. 22-23, paragraph     4.33).

                                                            61




           The incidence     of AIDS is remaining       stable, at around 25,000 new cases per year, or 15
new cases per 100,000 inhabitants          five years ago. As regards HIV infection,           a study of HIV
prevalence     among pregnant       women,    on a populational     basis, performed     in 2000 in 140 maternity
clinics, indicated     an HIV prevalence      among pregnant       women in Brazil of 0.61% (CI95%            0.48%-
0.73%).    If this finding    is compared    with those of prevalence       studies among pregnant        women
done in sentinel sites from March         1997 to October       1999, the stabilization    of HIV infection     in this
population     is also apparent (March/97       - 1.2%; October/97       - 0.8%; March/98     - 0.5%; October/98       -
0.6%; March/99        - 0.7%; October/99      - 0.8%).    `3 can be noted that some 20 years after thefirst
AIDS cases were identified         in the country, Brazil's HIV epidemic remains           concentrated     among a
high-risk   population,     the prevalence    of HIV having been reliably        estimated   by MoH at 0.65
percent    of reproductive     age adults"   (pp. 15-16, paragraph     4.15).

           With regard to the monitoring        of the sexual behavior      of the population    in general, special
mention    should be made of the performance            of a nation-wide     research study in 1998 designed
precisely to serve as a baseline for surveillance           of the Brazilian   population's   sexual behavior     in
AIDS    II. The repeating      of this study in 2004 will enable an assessment of the trends of the
Brazilian   urban population's      sexual behavior     in the interval between      the two studies, while also
serving as a baseline for AIDS III, which will greatly facilitate             the assessment of the effectiveness
and impact of this project and of the Brazilian           program    in general.

          As regards "a routine      of behavioral    and HIV surveillance"       among groups at high risk of
infection   (MSM,      commercial    sex workers (CSWs) and intravenous            drug users (IDUs)),      studies
were done with CSWs (1 section) and IDUs (2 sections), while a study among STD carriers is in
the final phase of execution        and special studies (assigning priority       to the MSM     population)    are to
be carried out with project support.         However,     it is clear that Brazil  "must give priority     to and
expand its surveillance       efforts to enable routine      and systematic monitoring       and analysis of HIV
infection  trends, and of behavioral       trends among target populations          I' and that "the surveillance    of
HIV infections     and of behaviors     must focus on the high-risk        groups"   (MSM,    IDUs, CSWs),
without   neglecting    the monitoring    of trends among the population          in general, and paying special
attention  to the links between      these two groups, particularly        through   the bridge populations
(female partners of IDUs and bisexuals,           and clients of CSWs).

          AIDS III is supporting       Brazil in its efforts to fully explore the huge volume          of data
currently   available   from studies and research, but it is certain that this will not eliminate           the
present and future need to gather data on HIV and on the behavior                 of the target populations.      We
do not agree, however,        that behavioral   and HIV surveillance       among high-risk     groups should be
done annually,      or that it can be performed     more efficiently     at the state level.

          Finally,   it must be emphasized      regarding     the actual collection    of the information    by the
members     of the World Bank mission, that with the evaluation              being focused as it was on
surveillance,    monitoring    and evaluation     activities,  one might have expected that the team and its
technical   managers     would have been consulted         in the information-gathering      process.

          The National      STD/AIDS     Control   Program      is constantly   seeking to refine its actions and
intervene   effectively    to control the epidemic.       The criticisms expressed by the members           of the
Bank mission will be taken into consideration             and, where pertinent,    will serve to improve      the
quality  of the program;      however,   we cannot refrain from pointing         out that a good part of them
derive from incomplete        analyses or information       obtained   from interlocutors    insufficiently   familiar
with the STD and HIV/AIDS            surveillance   system operated by the Ministry         of Health.

           Monitoring     and Evaluation:        During   the implementation       phase of AIDS I, in the period
between      I994 and 1998, some individual        cross-section     studies of the KAPB (Knowledge,
 Attitudes,   Practices and Behaviors)     type were made which produced             baseline information
 generating    indicators  of behaviors   and testing and counseling         services.   In partnership   with the
 SESLNacional,       for instance, a population-based       study was done covering        industrial-sector
workers     and also young men conscripted        into the Brazilian      army.    These studies made it possible
to assess variables     associated with condom use, risk perception            and sexuality.    In the case of the
conscripts,    the KAPB     study was also correlated      with serological      evaluation,  thereby marking      the
start of second generation      surveillance    in the country.     During   the same period,     an opinion    study
was also carried out by Datafolha         and CGT among urban workers,             in order to evaluate the
national    campaigns    and the knowledge,      attitudes and risk perceptions       of those workers.     These
studies provided      the baseline for the HIV/AIDS        prevention     activities in the workplace.
Regarding      the CSWs and prospectors,       two rapid assessments were conducted             to ascertain the
scope of the situation     and of the vulnerability      contexts of those populations,       focusing   on social
groups, social mobilization,       perceptions   of risk and condom use. These studies used the tools
derived from the ethnographic         method.    The methodology        employed     made intensive     use of in-
depth interviews,      focus groups, document       consultation     and interviews   with key informants.

           In the same period,     a study involving     serology and evaluation      was made with IDUs,
based on harm reduction        centers.   This study used the capture and recapture method             and made it
possible to determine      the scale of the incidence      of HIV among IDUs,         as well as to obtain
behavioral     data in the five sites involved.     In addition,    the research also made it possible to
establish the baseline for the IDU population.           As regards the Testing and Counseling           Centers
(TCCs),    the STD/AIDS       program   also produced,     in the same period,      a qualitative  evaluation    study
of the actions connected       with testing, counseling     and the quality     of the services.   This research
served to guide the restructuring       of the TCCs and promoted          changes in the approach       adopted to
the most vulnerable      groups.

           The implementation      period of AIDS II confirmed          the need to carry out evaluation       actions
and to proceed with the preparation        of the National     Evaluation     Plan, which envisioned
formulation     of indicators  and their linking    with the program       management      process.   The intent of
these initiatives    was to move beyond      the fragmentation       stage and the residual nature attributed        to
the evaluative    processes of the implementation         period of AIDS I. A more integrated           process was
accordingly     set in motion   which combined       the need to produce knowledge          with the generation      of
data to assist the decision making process.           It was in this phase that studies were produced          on
epidemiological      trends and generation     of baselines for different      segments of the population        while
at the same time the use of the evaluative        processes as management           support instruments     was
consolidated.     One of the most important       studies in this period was the household          survey on
sexual behavior      of the Brazilian   population    aged between      16 and 65 years, done by CEBRAP            in
December      1998 in the 169 microregions        of the country.

           The main lines of action pursued in this period included             the studies to evaluate the
National    STD/AIDS      Program's intervention       in populations    with greater inherent     vulnerability,
such as CSWs, IDUs and adolescents,           which were defined in conjunction           with the World Bank in
the AIDS     II loan agreement.     Another   significant   initiative   in this period, within   the scope of
AIDS    II, was the formulation      of a set of indicators   for monitoring      and evaluation   of the
effectiveness    of actions undertaken     within   the framework      of the loan agreement.       Also during this
period,   information    technologies   were devised for facilitating       the monitoring     and evaluation    of
actions to assist and treat persons living with HIV/AIDS,              for example    SISCEL and SIAIDS
[Information     System of AIDS Project],       while recognizing      that these systems present limitations,
with a view to fostering      their full implementation      as evaluation    tools.  Another    step worthy    of

                                                                63



 mention     was the establishment         of the evaluation    program      for external    quality of laboratory
 examinations       for monitoring     the performance       of the public health laboratories          in connection      with
 testing for HIV and viral load.

            From the organizational         standpoint,   the National       STD/AIDS       Program's structure        for the
 implementation        of evaluation     actions was located in the Assessoria de Planejamento                  e AvailiacGo
 (ASPLAV        - Planning    and Evaluation       Advisory    Unit),    which has assumed the primary            function    of
reducing      the degree of segmentation         formerly    prevailing     in these processes.       Notwithstanding        the
 substantial    advances achieved, efforts have been concentrated                 on planning      and the search for a
 sustainable     policy that will ensure continuity         of the program's      actions for dealing with the
epidemic      in Brazil.

            Redefinition      of the Monitoring        and Evaluation         Strategy     for the National     STD/AIDS
Program

            Recognizing      the strategic importance        of the recommendations           made by the various World
Bank missions during the implementation                 of the AIDS I and AIDS           II projects, as of the beginning
of 2003 the National         STD/AIDS       Program    redefined     its strategy for strengthening        the monitoring
and evaluation       (M&E)      of its activities--M&E       were always present in some form in the program's
activities,    albeit not on a very systematized          basis--with     the creation of an Evaluation        Area located
in ASPLAV.          The area team currently        consists of two internal       consultants    and two external
consultants,      plus one evaluation       expert and another expert in epidemiology               and data analysis,
while it is also able to draw on technical           and financial       support from the Global Aids Program               of
the Centers for Disease Control            and Prevention      (CDC-GAP).

            In the past year, the Evaluation         Area developed        the National     Evaluation    Plan (NEP) for
the National      STD/AIDS       Program,      which plan focuses basically         on monitoring       of impact and
results.    The strategic thrust of this plan presumes extreme diversity                   and complexity     of the
Brazilian     program     and sets two fundamental         premises:      (a) the commitment         inherent   in the
institutionalization       and decentralization      of the evaluative      processes, and (b) an integrational
approach      that renders viable evaluation         of the program      based on its real incorporation         into the
country's health system.

           In March      of the present year, the National        Public Health      School (ENSP/FIOCRUZ),                in
partnership     with the National       STD/AIDS       Program and CDC-GAP,              launched    the Postgraduate
Course (Specialization         and Master's      conferring    professional     qualijkation)      in Evaluation      of
Programs      for Controlling      Endemic     Processes, with emphasis on STD/HIV/AIDS.                    This course is
the chief strategy for decentralization           and institutionalization       of M&E      activities.  It aims to train
teams for the STD/HIV/AIDS               programs    of the various levels of government,             but assigning
priority   to the national     level and to the technical       staff of the five sites of excellence        in
evaluation3     l

           Recognition       of the National      STD/AIDS       Program       efforts    in M&E

           The National       STD/AIDS       Program's efforts      in establishing    the process of
institutionalizing       and decentralizing     M&E     activities   are already gaining recognition,          as for



3 1. Five sites of excellence have been strategically  selected that will serve to foster and promote M&E     activities  in each
of Brazil's five regions.   These sites are Manaus, the State of Pernambuco,    the State of S%o Paulo, Curitiba  and Campo
Grande.

                                                               64


instance in a cableJ2 sent by the U.S. Embassy in Brazil, in which,                     under the heading      "Experts
praise, discuss next steps for CDC Aids Monitoring                   and Evaluation      Program,"     it is stated that:

            "Throughout       the course of the meetings       and at its conclusion,        the CDC representatives       in
attendance     expressed their optimism          about the M&E       unit and its training      programs,     which they
agreed showed great potential            and represented     a necessary evolution        in Brazil's HIV/AIDS
Control     Program."

           Then the World Bank itself, following             its last mission,33 declares that:

            "The mission was most satisfied with the progress achieved in establishing                       the
monitoring      and evaluation       system for the program.        The team has been strengthened             and now
there is a unit chief and a statistics expert, and it can draw on support as needed from FIOCRUZ
and the collaboration         of CDC.    These partnerships        have proven very fruitful..        ..The National
Evaluation     Plan has been refined to include, in addition             to evaluation      of results, the construction
of a system for monitoring           the establishment     of the program       and the creation of an evaluation
culture.    With the collaboration        of the CDC the National          Plan personnel      are being trained in M&E
and five centers of excellence           are being established      in two state and three municipal          coordinating
entities. . . . The results of the efforts       of recent months are already being felt.            The NP
management       units are focusing       on results, the Terms of Reference            for studies are including      the
participation    of the M&E        unit, the findings    of the IBOPE survey were used in the design of the
last national    campaign      on testing, the campaigns         are starting to be evaluated,       and the management
units at the national       and state level are requesting        assistance in preparing       monitoring     tools."*

EQUITY


      l    The NP takes steps to reduce inequality             of access to health for the various segments of
           the population      with differing    degrees of vulnerability.          The challenge     of expanding
           populational      coverage to these segments is one of this program's                commitments.

      l    The actions to assist persons living with HIV/AIDS                  and STD carriers promoted           by the
           National    STD/AIDS        Program    are included     in the unified     public health system (SUS) and
           the directives     and standards that regulate the establishment             and implementation         of the
           SUS are observed by means of constant agreements                    between     its three levels of
           management,        which operate under a directive         to promote      equity.
      l    Access to health services and diagnosis and treatment                  inputs for these citizens, while not
           yet uniform      throughout    all of Brazil's vast national       territory,  is guaranteed     by legal rules
           and instruments,       and the NP is continually        supporting     the states with a view to expanding
           this access and the care and assistance network,              and using new technologies           with the aim
           of ensuring not just quick and easy access to care but also improving                     the quality   of the
           care by making       it more effective      in managing    and resolving      problems.

     l     The active and intense participation           of organized      civil society is spurring      the NP to
           continually     seek solutions that are better aligned with the SUS and with the needs of its
           users

     l     Tables E-7 and E-8 of Annex E are not in the report submitted,                     so a better analysis is not
           possible.
