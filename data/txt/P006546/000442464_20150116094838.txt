Stemming the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Brazil                                                                July 1, 2002
                      In 1990, Brazil had one of the world's largest numbers of reported AIDS cases in the world. By 1995,
                      AIDS was the number one cause of death among young women in the State of São Paulo, and second
                      among men. A crisis of such proportions required an approach that would combine both prevention and
                      treatment, and the Brazilian government turned to the international community for help.

                      Now, UNAIDS sees Brazil a success story among nations struggling to contain the AIDS epidemic, and
                      to provide for its victims.

In 1993, the World Bank approved $160 million for the AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD) Control Project in
Brazil. The program focused on prevention efforts, but also covered treatment and testing.  Between 1993 and 1997, the
project helped 175 non-governmental organizations  carry out more than 400 grassroots campaigns educating high-risk
groups such as injecting drug users and sex workers about unsafe or harmful behaviors.  They handed out more than 180
million condoms, raised AIDS awareness among more than 500,000 people, and trained 3,800 teachers and 32,500 students
in promoting AIDS and drug abuse prevention.

According to surveys, condom use among men has surged dramatically, with a tenfold increase reported between 1986 and
1999.

Aided by another $165 million World Bank loan in 1998, the Control Project, now in its second phase, is helping Brazil's
Ministry of Health reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS while making it possible for Brazilians with AIDS to live longer, healthier
lives.  The program has contributed to a 38 percent drop in the number of AIDS-related deaths since 1993.
 
While supporting 145 specialized AIDS care units, 66 hospital-based care units, and 50 home-care teams, the focus of the
Second AIDS and STD Project remains prevention.  It has helped set up a nationwide network of 141 AIDS testing and
counseling centers. Through a partnership with the National Business AIDS Council, 3,000 companies are now providing
AIDS awareness training to 3.5 million workers.
