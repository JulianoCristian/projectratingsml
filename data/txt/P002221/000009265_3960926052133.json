First, it supports new measures\n            to protect and conserve Rwanda's remaining natural\n            forests of the Zaire-Nile divide. Second, it promotes farm\n            forestry as a cost effective means of increasing fuelwood\n            supplies. Third, it will consolidate investments in\n            plantations and pastures made during the first project.\n            Finally, it involves (d) maintenance of fuelwood and pole\n            short rotations developed in the first project; (e) applied\n            forestry and animal nutrition research; and (f) pilot\n            pasture rehabilitation in the Mutara region."}, "docdt": "1987-05-06T00:00:00Z"}
