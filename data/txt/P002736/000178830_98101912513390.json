It would also provide basic telecommunications\n            facilities to rural areas and to Zanzibar. Specifically, the\n            project would finance: (a) construction of about 550 km of\n            overhead line routes; of about 12 VHF or UHF radio links and\n            of 4 microwave links; installation of power supply equipment\n            and of about 850 channels of rural carriers; of about 600\n            additional channels of multiplex equipment in broadband\n            transmission systems; and of a digital telephone exchange in\n            Zanzibar; (b) expansion of the local cable network at about\n            90 urban and rural centers; provision of dropwire and of\n            about 700 teleprinters; (c) importation of cement and other\n            construction materials; (d) provision of an air-conditioning\n            plant, vehicles, training equipment and spare parts; and (e)\n            provision for studies, overseas training and fellowships."}, "docdt": "1981-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
