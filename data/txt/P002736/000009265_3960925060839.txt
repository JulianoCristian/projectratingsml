PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This Project Completion Report (PCR) presents a review of the
Credit 1173-TA of SDR 22.1 million for the First Telecommuications Project
of the Tanzania Posts and Telecommunications Corporation (TPTC) for
telecommunications development. Credit 1173-TA was approved in July 1981
and was closed in June 1987, 18 months behind schedule.
This PCR was prepared by the Industry and Energy Division of the
Africa Technical Department (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III).
The Borrower submitted comments on Parts I and III which are summarized in
Part II of the Report.
Preparation of this PCR was started during the Bank's final super-
vision mission of the project in May 1988, and is based, inter alia, on the
Staff Appraisal Report; the Credit, Guarantee, and Project Agreements;
supervision reports; correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower; and
internal Bank memoranda.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION  UMR
Obiectivess To provide physical facilities within the framwork
of TPTC's 1980-84 investment program ands (a) improve and develop TPTC as
an institution and increase its capacity for training staff; (b) focus on
the services expansion in rural areas and expand the network to presently
unserved or under served areas; and (c) establish a reasonably uncongested
and reliable urban and long distance network to carry traffic smoothly.
Imvlementation Experiences Substantial delays in loan signature
and effectiveness were caused initially by lack of IDA funds and later by
suspension of loan disbursements to Tanzania. The project was
substantially completed in December 198? about two years behind the
original appraisal schedule and 15 months behind the revised schedule.
Delays in civil works for building housing for the radio equipment delayed
completion of the microwave and UHF links. In the case of local cable
networks a substantial part of cables and accessories under the project
were utilized for rehabilitation, operation and maintenance due to lack of
foreign exchange for this purpose. Despite these factors, ?PTC's efforts
in successfully processing procurement and in executing the project
components resulted in the timely implementation of the project.
Results The project's physical targets were achieved as
planned. The financial performance of TPTC over the project period (1980-
1986) was satisfactory with the rate of return covenant being met. The
financial and economic rates of return were calculated at the time of
appraisal to be 172 and 242 respectively. The revised figures are 172 and
502 respectively. Self-generated cash as a percentage of investment was
acceptable through 1985, being greater than 502, but in 1986 it fell to
only 13S. Control of receivables has been poor, never getting close to
performance indicators and in 1986 rising to over 12 months of due
revenues. (By end 1989 receivables were in line with covenant.)
Accounting and financial information is now up to date with draft accounts
being ready within two months of the year end. The tariff study and TPTC's
subsequent action incorporating a trigger mechanism linking international
tariffs to currency devaluation has helped TPTC's financial performance.
Lessons Learneds In the design of the project, Bank did not
foresee the full extent of support needed for operation and maintenance,
but responded positively when TPTC faced severe shortages of foreign
exchange during the project execution by providing increased spares for
maintenance. Key to an effective dialogue on institutional issues was
that, after initial delays, procurement went smoothly allowing supervision
to concentrate on basic institutional issues. Upfront procurement work and
related conditionality were important to this project's success.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PART I
1.        Proiect Identity:
Name       - First Telecommunications Project
Credit No. - 1173-TA
RVP Unit   - Africa Region
Country    - Tanzania
Sector     = Telecommunications
2.        Background
2.01      With the breakup of the East African Community (EAC), including
the East African Posts and Telecommunications Corporation (EAPTC), the
Goverunent of Tanzania established in 1977 the Tanzanian Posts and
Telecommunications Corporation (TPTC), which is an autonomous government-
owned corporation under the Ministry of Communications and Transport. In
addition to handling the postal services of the country, TPTC is
responsible for the establishment, expansion, operation and maintenance of
all local, national and international telecommunications services. The
national development plans give priority to rural development and dispersal
of the development effort. In accordance with national objectives, TPTC
directed its 1980-84 investment program toward improving the poor quality
of existing services and addressing the heavy demand for new telephone
connections to provide access to the telecommunications network. The Bank
Group has been associated with support for telecommunications development
in the EAC of which Tanzania was a part, with three projects since 1967 as
indicated in Table 1, Part III. IDA became associated again with
telecommunications through a sector mission in 1979, followed by a project
identification mission that led to the appraisal of the first
telecoamunications project for TPTC supported by Credit 1173-TA.
3.        Proiect Objectives and Description
3.01      Project Objectives.  In addition to providing physical
facilities within the framework of TPTC's 1980-84 investment program, the
project had a number of broad objectives: (a) improving and developing
TPTC as an institution and increasing its capacity for training staff; (b)
focussing on the services expansion in rural areas and expanding the
network to presently unserved or under served areas. both urban and rural;
and (c) establishing a reasonably uncongested and reliable urban and long



-2-
distance network to carry traffic smoothly. The project was also expected
to facilitate an increase in levels of reliability and functional
efficiency of the present installations.
3.02      Project Description.  The project provided for:
(a) construction of 550 km of overhead line routes about
12 VHF or UHF radio links and four microwave rinks;
installation of power supply equipment and of 850
channels of rural carriers; of abcut 600 additional
channels of multiplex equipment in broadband
transmission systems; and of a digital telephone
exchange in Zanzibar;
(b)  expansion of the local cable network of about 90 urban
and rural centers; provision of drop wire and of about
700 teleprinters;
(c) importation of cement and other construction materials
needed for buildings and system expansion;
(d) provision of air conditioning plant, vehicles,
training equipment and spare parts; aitd
(e) provision for studies, overseas training and
fellowships.
4.        Proiect Design and Organization
4.01      The project was designed within the framevork of TPTC's
investment program for the 1980-84 period. It comprised works to be
undertaken principally during 1981, 1982 and the first half of 1983 that
were considered essential for successful implementation of the program.
The project concept and design were appropriate and timeay in order to
ensure that adequate priorities were given to both rural and urban
telecommunications development. The scope and scale of the project were
appropriate given the objectives. One of the main components of the
program - the installation of automatic telephone switching equipment of
about 54,000 lines - did not take place, however, as the financing for this
equipment from Japan did not materialize due to the general debt situation
of Tanzania. Due to the severe problems faced in 1985-86 with the
availability of foreign exchange, much greater support in the shape of
spares and some cables and accessories had to be provided from the project
to support maintenance of installations. In retrospect, the project design
should have given higher priority to maintenance and rehabilitation and
technical assistance. In the design of the second project, under Credit
1810-TA approved in 1987, greater emphasis was placed on these aspects.
5.        Protect Implementation
5.01      Credit Effectiveness and Proiect Start-up.  Substantial delays
in loan signature and effectiveness were caused initially by lack of IDA
funds and later by suspension of loan disbursements to Tanzania (Table 2,



-3-
Part IIS). These circumstances were not anticipated. Nevertheless initial
procurement actions for preparation of bid documentation. etc., proceeded,
although hesitatingly due to the uncertain situation.
5.02      Implementation Schedule.  Project completion at the time of
appraisal was expected by December 31, 1985. Due to delays in signing the
Credit, the implementation schedule was revised in June 1982, with project
cotpletion set for September 30, 1986. The project was substantially
completed in December 1987 about two years behind the original appraisal
schedule and 15 months behind the revised schedule. Apart from the above,
the delay in civil works for building housing for the radio equipment was
another factor that delayed completion of the microwave and UHF links.
Despite these factors, TPTC's sustained efforts in successfully processing
procurement and in executing the project components resulted in the
implementation of the project within a reasonable time frame.
5.03      Prolect  Costs.  The estimated cost of the project at appraisal
was $47.07 million, with a foreign cost of $27.0 million. The foreign cost
on completion has been estimated at $24.0 million as shown in Table SA in
Part III. The decrease in foreign costs of about liZ was mainly due to the
devaluation of the US dollar with respect to the SDR during the draw down
period. A comparison of original estimates and final actuals for local
costs is not meaningful due to the high inflation during the project
period.  !owk.-r, it is our opinion that there has been no substantial
deviation in local costs of the project in constant terms.
5.04      Disbursements.  The disbursement performance jf Credit 1173-TA
is given in Table 3, Part III. Disbursements were slower than expected at
appraisal due to the delayed effectiveness of the project. A revised
disbursement projection was prepared in 1982. Compared to the revised
schedule, actual disbursements were on track until 1986. but disbursement
of the final US$7 million was slow due to the need to determine final
maintenance and rehabilitation needs and final paymer.ts. The original
closing date of the Credit was December 31, 1985. It was extended once to
June 30, 1986 and finally closed on June 30, 1987. The final disbursement
of the Credit was made in January 20, 1988. Disbursement performance on
this project in comparison with other projects in the same period was
excellent.
5.05      Credit Allocation.  The original and revised allocation and
actual disbursements by categories for Credit 1173-TA are shown in Table
5C, Part III. The original allocation was revised on June 22. 1987 to
reflect changes in increased financing for power equipment, spare parts and
multiplex equipment, and consultancy services, and savings on the Zanzibar
pilot digital exchange.
6.        Proiect Results
6.01      Physical Results.  The project's physical targets of rural and
urban expansion were achieved substantially as planned, as indicated in
Table 4A, Part III. In the case of local cable networks a substantial part
of cables and accessories under the project were utilized for
rehabilitation, operation and maintenance due to lack of foreign exchange



-4-
for this purpose. The expansion of the automatic exchanges did not take
place as planned, as Japanese financing of this equipment did not
materialize, and the cable network expansion was modified accordingly. The
overall increase in facilities as a result of the project is shown in Table
6A in Part III. TPTC's major operational performance on major indicators
is also given in Annex 1. With the completion of the original electronic
exchange in Zanzibar provided under the project, TPTC staff are also
getting hands-on experience with the application ot the new digital
technology to future telephone development needs.
6.02      Financial Performance.  The financial performance of TPTC over
the critical period of project implementation (1980-1986) was broadly
satisfactory, with the rate of return covenant being essentially met. The
rate of return ranged between 8? and 182 over the period with a mean of 122
being in line with the covenant. However, performance was less
satisfactory in respect of fiscal management coefficients, i.e., cash flow
ratios and receivables. Self-generated cash as a percentage of investment
was acceptable through 1985, being greater than 502, b4t in 1986 it fell to
only 13S. Control of receivables has been poor, never getting close to
performance indicators and in 1986 rising to over 12 months of due
revenues. (By end 1989 receivables were in line with covenant.)
6.03      Throughout most of the project period it was never easy to
specifically focus on these two latter problems as any financial or
accounting information was always too late to allow corrective action.
This constraint was tackled in a subsequent project through employment of
financial consultants. Accounting and financial information is now up to
date with draft accounts being ready within two months of the year end.
Regular monthly receivable reports are now prepared and delinquent
customers are clearly identified.
6.04      Another constraint throughout the period particularlv in the
latter two years was the rapid devaluation of the Tanzania shidling. The
tariff study and TPTC's subsequent action covered some of this by
incorporating a devaluation automaticity trigger linking international
tariffs to currency devaluation. It was only recently recognized that some
automaticity also needed to be linked to local tariffs. This is now being
done.
6.05      The financial and economic rates of return were calculated at
the time of appraisal to be 172 and 24? respectively. These rates of
return have been recalculated using actual figures to 198. and projected
figures for 1989 to 2000. The revised financial and economic rates of
return, as indicated in Table 6B. Part III. are 172 and 50? respectively.
The difference between the rates is due to the fact that tariffs still do
not reflect the true economic value of telecommunications services. The
tariff for local calls in 1980 was T Sh 0.65; by 1987 the same tariff was T
Sh 1.80. In constant terms this tariff should have been around T Sh 4.0.
clearly indicating that a large consumer surplus was not being gathered by
TPTC. Getting consistent tariff increases that reflect both ongoing
inflation and an already existing consumer surplus has been extremely
difficult.



6.06      Institutional ImPact.  A major impact of the project was in
focussing attention on the need to link financial performance (especially
given the constant currency devaluations in Tanzania) with tariff levels.
The project addressed the inadequate tariff structure and the lack of
policies to provide a mechanism for reviewing and adjusting tariffs (para.
6.04). An equally important institutional impact of the project was its
focus on human resource development (para. 6.07). However, major skill
gaps and inefficiencies still exist and will need to be addressed in future
proiects.
6.07      Human Resource Development.  The project, by supporting the
telecommunications training institutions in Tanzania and an overseas
fellowship program, contributed to considerable strengthening of the human
resource support of TPTC. The overseas fellowship program provided for a
total of 40 members of TPTC staff to obtain training in the areas of
general management, finance and accounting, in addition to the specialized
technical fields. The annual training volume in national training centers
for the technical and operational staff increased from 6,000 student weeks
in 1979 to about 9,600 by 1987, but is still considered inadequate to meet
expanding needs, estimated at 15,000 student weeks.
7.        Proiect Sustainabilit
7.01      Considering the overall importance of telecommunications to
economic development and the growing demand for telecommunications
services, investments in this sector have to be continuous. Apart from the
Bank support given to the telecommunications sector as part of the East
African Communiry (Table 1, Part III), Credit 1173-TA has provided a modest
growth to the sector and contributed to some institutional improvements
(para. 6.06). The need for further improvement and expansion is evident
and IDA undertook to finance a second telecommunications project in 1987.
A third project is also likely to follow. The TPTC has also got essential
support from a tariff policy that allows it to revise tariffs periodically
within reasonable limits, which should improve its financial viability.
The institutional strengthening of TPTC should also enable it to be more
productive and efficient in its future operations.
8.        Bank Performance
8.01      Overall Bank performance has been satisfactory.  With the
preparation of the sector memorandum in March 1979, the stage was set for
Bank's identification of the project in October 1979, and it was possible
to dispense with preparation and preappraisal missions and proceed to
appraisal in April/May 1980. However, delays occurred thereaf-er in Bank's
processing of this project.
Negotiations             March 1981
Board approval           July 1981
Signing of Agreement     March 1982
Effectiveness of Credit  November 1982



- 6 -
Negotiations did not take place until March 1981, 10 months after appraisal
because of the uncertainty in the status of TPTC's assets pending
settlement after the breakup of the East African Community. The signing of
the Credit Agreement was delayed due to lack of IDA funds, and
effectiveness was delayed due to the general suspension of disbursements to
Tanzania. The Bank made a positive contribution to the physical and
institutional development of the sector and ensured financial viability by
instituting tariff studies and implementing Improved asset revaluation
techniques and tariff levels and structures. In the design of the project,
Bank did not foresee the full extent of support needed for operation and
maintenance, but responded positively when TPTC faced severe shortages of
foreign exchange during the project execution by providing increased spares
for maintenance. The Bank also did not anticipate that the expansion of
automatic exchanges, as provided for under Japanese Aid and in the
investment program, would not materialize. The Bank, however, did support
TPTC's program for the rehabilitation of the local cable network and
optimum expansion that was needed with the available exchange capacities.
In the follow-up second project, rehabilitation and maintenance was given
high priority. Adequate supervision was done by the Bank, and the Bank's
efforts to assist TPTC with procurement, contracting and technical
assistance was sustained and effective. Bank's support for this secto: has
also attracted cofinancing from Italy. Belgium. Japan, and Sweden for the
second telecommunications project.
9.        Borrower Performance
9.01      Table 7, Part III contains a review of the performance of the
Borrower, and TPTC, in complying with the covenants in the Credit and
Project Agreements. Except for delays in submitting audited accounts,
TPTC's performance in meeting covenants has been good. During project
preparation and appraisal, TPTC provided all the support needed. TPTC also
dealt with procurement and execution of the project components in a
professional manner. TPTC has profited from the experience in this project
and has given high priority to rehabilitation and improved maintenance and
productivity in the follow-up second project. Project management was
satisfactory.
10.       Pro1ec. Relationship
10.01     Bank relationship with Government and TPTC in the project has
been good.
11.       Consultina Services
11.01     In Table 6C in Part III is an assessment of the consultant
services that were utilized in the project. The impact study of
telecommunications on economic development was descriptive and lacked
quantification and hence was informative only but useful for demonstration.
The asset revaluation and tariff studies were useful and practical.



. t -
1Z.       Proiect Documentation and Data
12.01     The Credit and Project Agreements vere quite adequate and
appropriate for achieving project objectives in the key organizational and
financial areas. The appraisal report of the project provided a useful
framework for the Bank and TSPC to review project implementation. TPTC
provided regular progress reports on implementation ancl also a draft
Project Completion Report for the project. Under the second project -
Credit 1810-TA - expert assistance has been specifically provided to assist
TPTC in establishing a Management Information System (MIS) to provide data
necessary for senior management to monitor operational and financial
performance.

TPTC provided material for the draft completion report. Therein
TPTC had no specific coments on the design and implementation
of the project. TPTC highlighted the physical achievements of
the project and pointed out that in addition to the additional
revenue there were non-quantifiable economic benefits such as
reduction in final cost and improvements in efficiency in the
use of transport. IDA has not received coments on the drafts
for Parts I and III prepared by Bank staff due to lack of
manpower within TPTC.

1J  Prior to 1977 the telecommunications services in the East African
Community (Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda) were managed by the East Africa
Posts and Telecommunications Corporation (EAPTC). These loans were
extended to EAPTC.
21  Due to problems in the East African Community leading to its breakup
the works to be undertaken on the Third Project were generally delayed.
3/  This is a Second Telecommunications Project to the TPTC following up on

_/  The identification mission in October 1979 was able to gather
sufficient information and data and project preparation was advanced
enough to proceed directly with appraisal in May 1980.
2/  The signature of the credit was delayed awaiting IDA VI commitment
authority.
3/  The effectiveness of the credit was delayed due to non-receipt in
the Bank of the Sudsidiary Loan Agreement and legal opinion, and to
the suspension of all disbursements to Tanzania from June 14, 1982.
4/  The project was substantially completed by December 31, 1987.

for rehabilitation, operation and maintenance at these centers due to
lack of foreign exchange for operation and maintenance. The expansion
of automatic exchange equipment did not take place as planned due to
the nonmaterialization of Japanese Aid and the cable network expansion
was modified to make optimum use accordingly.

6.B. Rate of Return
1.   TPTC's investment program for 1981-1986 includes the IDA financed
project *8 an integral part. The close relationship between project and
non-project investments makes any attempt of costs and benefits arbitrary.
Consequently, the rate of return calculation is made on the entire
investment program. The benefit period extends to 2002 when the equipment
is expected to have completed its useful life. All incremental costs and
benefits have been held at 1981 levels. The resultant stream of financial
costs and benefits is shown belows
Incremental
Incremental          Operating        Capital
Revenues              Costs           Costs
1981            -                                    169
1982             64                   16             136
1983            (24)                  (3)            137
1984             37                   20             122
1985             57                   (7)             88
1986             83                   49             142
1987            210                  138              -
1988-2002       375                  138              -
The internal financial rate of return for the net benefit stream is 172.
2.        This calculation does not account for the SZ sales tax which the
subscribers pay to the Government and is collected by TPTC, nor for
consumer surplus or indirect and external benefits due to the improved
telecommunications system. A portion of the consumer surplus was estimated
by assuming that new consumers are similar to the average current consumer,
and that the existing and new subscribers will be willing to pay for
telecommunications services at the same rate in real terms as they pay
today. The 52 sales tax was added to the resulting economic benefit
stream. A conversion factor of 0.40, based on an examination of what the
appropriate standard conversion factor would be for the project period, was
applied to all local costs and benefits to convert them into economic
border prices. Based on these assumptions, the internal economic rate of
return is over 502. This rate compares vith the appraisal estimate of 402,
the actual increase in the rate of return is due to increased usage.

sector.
2I The asset revaluation study results have been accepted and applied to
the Telecommunications Accounts.
31 The results of the tariff study were presented to the Government
for consideration and approval in October 1987. As a result the TPTC
Board has been given authority to increase tariffs by not more than
102 twice a year. Any further increase has to be approved by the
Kiinister.
