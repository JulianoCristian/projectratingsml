The relevance of\n            the project key lessons stands on the fact that the\n            Hurricane Emergency Project is part of a larger package of\n            emergency assistance to Nicaragua, and will provide insights\n            of general value, country-wise. It is suggested that for\n            cases where the early involvement of the Bank is needed,\n            prior to developing an emergency assistance strategy, the\n            amendment of ongoing operations, and preparation of\n            supplemental ones, should be the fastest vehicles to provide\n            investment support. This is particularly relevant for\n            disaster situations, when once the emergency assistance\n            strategy is formulated, it would be best to process the\n            assistance as separate operations, each one following its\n            own pace. This strategy calls for a quick assessment of the\n            country's macroeconomic situation, including\n            complementary assistance, such as the management assistance\n            provided by the Bank to the Central America Emergency Trust\n            Fund, which was critical in ensuring emergency financing\n            requirements would remain current, within the debt service\n            obligations. While longer-term concerns about disaster\n            management preparedness needs to be addressed, it would not\n            be effective to combine this mitigation with emergency\n            support objectives, but rather address same as components,\n            or as separate stand alone operations."}, "docdt": "2000-12-05T00:00:00Z"}
