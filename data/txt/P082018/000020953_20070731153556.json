The lessons learned included: 1) Russia has\n            asked the Bank to work at the sub-national level to address\n            a diversity of local issues ranging from fiscal\n            sustainability and social protection to the housing and\n            communal services sector. The Kazan work shows that such\n            issues can be very successfully addressed through a\n            combination of a systemic approach with appropriate\n            institutional development; 2) The DPL option selected for\n            Kazan allowed focus on the substance of reforms rather than\n            on the project procurement and implementation issues that\n            tend to consume both borrower and Bank staff in an\n            investment project; 3) The Program was approved as an\n            adjustment operation without a separate technical assistance\n            component. A stand alone Technical Loan was not possible due\n            to existing borrowing limitations of the federal government;\n            4) Local consultants employed by the Bank at the project\n            preparation stage helped tremendously to focus the Program\n            on approaches that had been tested in other regions of\n            Russia. A fully local Bank team can be highly effective in\n            daily supervision dialogue with municipal authorities, yet\n            international experts can be extremely helpful, particularly\n            at the preparation stage; and 5) Joint projects with the\n            Bank and other international financial institutions increase\n            the quality of project preparation and implementation,\n            manifest an international approval of local reforms and thus\n            increase regional and municipal investment ratings."}, "docdt": "2007-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
