F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The Program Development Objectives (PDO), as stated in the Program Document, were
as follows: the proposed KMDL would be the instrument through which the World Bank
would support the Russian Federation's effort to deliver technical and financial support to


                                                ii

the Kazan Government's reform program. The proceeds of the loan wound enable Kazan
to strengthen its financial position and put in place the reforms needed to improve budget
and financial management, the delivery of social services and the condition of the HCS
sector. In terms of the outcomes, the KMDL would result in (i) a strengthened budgeting
and financial management in the city; (ii) better access to social assistance and social
protection services for the poor and (iii) strengthened financial condition for the housing
and communal services sector. In 2003, the City approved a comprehensive "Kazan
Development Strategy Until 2015" that outlined prospects and key areas for the city's
development. These areas included, first, municipal finance reform through improving
financial management, strengthening budget execution control, phasing out of overdue
payables, better public procurement practices and better management of municipal assets;
second, reform of the social protection system through the monetization of in-kind
benefits and better targeting of vulnerable groups; and third, housing and utilities sector
reform through the elimination of budget subsidies to enterprises in district heating, the
privatization of housing maintenance services, and privatization of the water supply
company (Vodokanal).

        1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

        1.1     Context at Appraisal (brief summary of country macroeconomic and structural/sector
        background, rationale for Bank assistance):

        Since the 1998 crisis and by the time of the Program appraisal, Russia's macroeconomic
        fundamentals had been improved considerably. GDP growth during the period from 1999
        through 2003 exceeded 38 percent, the fiscal and current accounts were recording healthy
        surpluses, and poverty rates declined by over 30 percent. In 2003, international agencies
        upgraded Russia's sovereign rating to an investment grade rating. The federal government was
        running an overall budget surplus for the fourth year in a row. GDP growth since the crisis in
        1999 had been pro-poor, due primarily to rapid growth in real wages in almost all branches of the
        economy. The number of people below the poverty level fell from 25 percent in 2002 to 20.4
        percent in 2003.

        In 2002, President Putin placed before his Cabinet the challenge of doubling GDP by 2012 and
        halving poverty by 2007. In keeping with these goals, following his re-election in March 2004,
        the President launched a plan for the comprehensive reform of public sector management and
        other reform initiatives in the areas of banking, housing, tax and interbudgetary relations, and
        social protection.

        A uniting theme of the various initiatives comprising the Government's reform program was the
        clarification of the respective spheres of responsibility and associated financing at the different
        levels of government. Relations between the federal government, the regions, and local
        governments presented one of the greatest challenges for the economic and political
        transformation of Russia. Beginning with the extreme centralization of the Soviet period,
        Russian regions and republics1 became increasingly independent and assertive in the 1980s,
        thereby filling the vacuum left by declining the central power. Economically rich or ethnically
        non-Russian regions often became particularly independent and, in some cases, openly raised
        their concerns to the central government.

        Two legislative acts passed in 2003 had a significant impact on the country's administrative and
        political structure as a Federation. The first, a Law that introduced revisions to the existing
        Federal Law on the General Principles of Organization of Legislative and Executive Organs of
        Power of the Subjects of the Federation, entered into effect on January 1, 2005. The second, a
        Law on the Organization of Local Self-governance, entered into effect on January 1, 2006
        (transitional arrangements had been effective since the Law was promulgated in October 2003).
        These laws introduced a fundamentally new blueprint for the country's administrative structure
        on the local level, with corresponding implications for higher levels of government.

        Overall, the approach to the organization of local governments that is set out in the laws clarifies
        intergovernmental relations but reduces flexibility for local arrangements. The new laws clarify

1The Russian Federation consists of 89 subjects of the Federation. These are variously termed regions, autonomous regions
and republics.


                                                                1

         the structures within the region, and make it somewhat easier for the federal center to propose
         legislation related to local government as a whole. In theory, this should help to rationalize
         expenditure assignments and revenue allocations. In practice, however, it remains to be seen
         whether the application of a similar structure across vastly different regions in terms of size,
         wealth, and ability to deliver services would be implemented effectively. Certainly, the
         imposition of a local government structure from the center reduces the federal nature of the
         system in which regions could determine the system that would work best for them.

         The laws that embodied the recent reforms also specified the responsibilities of each level of the
         government, including the new tiers in local governments. A few items are particularly
         noteworthy. Under the new laws, determination of public wages is the responsibility of each
         level of government, as opposed to being determined by the central government. This allows
         localities some discretion in controlling their wage bill. Subsidies to agriculture are now
         provided at the regional level, whereas subsidies to other non-state-owned enterprises are
         determined and provided by the central government. A very important change, one that is key to
         reducing unfunded mandates, is that regions are now responsible for determining and funding
         many social policies, including child allowances, and support to the disabled, low-income
         families, orphans, and the like.

         The Republic of Tatarstan, one of Russia's 86 subjects of the Russian Federation and one of the
         most autonomous regions, has entered the final stage of a long process of normalization of its
         relationships with the federal center. In 1994, the Republic of Tatarstan and the federal
         government signed a Power-Sharing Treaty that formalized special tax and budgetary conditions
         in Tatarstan relative to other regions. This treaty was renewed for a five-year period in 1999,
         although the special status of Tatarstan was diminished. The treaty is now being phased out
         altogether in keeping with President Putin's policy of standardization of federal-regional
         relations. In 2000, the Russian government established the Federal Targeted Program, "Socio-
         Economic Development of the Republic of Tatarstan to 2006".2 The Program's aim was to assist
         the Republic in its transition to the generally accepted format of relations between the central and
         regional authorities and to partly compensate for losses in revenues associated with the change in
         the federal-regional relations.

         As a part of these changes in the Republic of Tatarstan, the city of Kazan acquired the legal
         status of a municipality in September 2004 and immediately faced several challenges.3 Like all
         other Russian municipalities, Kazan faced a systemic risk of limited control over revenue sources
         and overdependence on intergovernmental transfers. Second, the city was extremely dependent
         on the decisions of federal and Tatarstan authorities with respect to capital expenditures. In 2005,
         Tatarstan and Kazan graduated from the Program and the related transfers ceased to exist.
         Pressing capital needs, such as repair of educational institutions, social protection facilities,
         health care institutions, and social housing could not be met without additional financing.

         Anticipating the coming changes in governance structures and responsibilities, in 2003 Kazan
         had developed a strategy for change. As part of that strategy and in line with its new status
         within the Republic of Tatarstan, the city launched reforms in several key areas, including: (i)

2Federal Targeted Programs in Russia are a planning tool used to identify priorities for the federal budget over a multi-year
period that by design stipulate the identification of other sources of financing, e.g. regional and local budgets and private
investors.

improvements in municipal financial management through better financial planning, treasury
control, gradual phasing out of overdue payables, better public procurement practices, and better
management of municipal assets; (ii) improved targeting of social protection through the
monetization of in-kind benefits and concentration of subsidies on vulnerable groups; and (iii)
improvements in housing and utilities management through the elimination of budget subsidies
to enterprises in district heating and the privatization of housing maintenance services.

To aid this reform effort, the Russian Federation requested a USD125 million Kazan Municipal
Development Loan (KMDL) to enable it to provide support to the municipality's reform effort.
These funds were aimed to enable an efficient financial and economic transition to the city's
status as a full-fledged municipality of the Republic of Tatarstan. The loan was made to the
Russian Federation and then passed on as a grant to Kazan.

1.2    Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved):

The Program Development Objectives (PDO), as stated in the Program Document, were as
follows: the proposed KMDL would be the instrument through which the World Bank would
support the Russian Federation's effort to deliver technical and financial support to the Kazan
Government's reform program. The proceeds of the loan wound enable Kazan to strengthen its
financial position and put in place the reforms needed to improve budget and financial
management, the delivery of social services and the condition of the HCS sector. In terms of the
outcomes, the KMDL would result in (i) a strengthened budgeting and financial management in
the city; (ii) better access to social assistance and social protection services for the poor and (iii)
strengthened financial condition for the housing and communal services sector. In 2003, the City
approved a comprehensive "Kazan Development Strategy Until 2015" that outlined prospects
and key areas for the city's development. These areas included, first, municipal finance reform
through improving financial management, strengthening budget execution control, phasing out of
overdue payables, better public procurement practices and better management of municipal
assets; second, reform of the social protection system through the monetization of in-kind
benefits and better targeting of vulnerable groups; and third, housing and utilities sector reform
through the elimination of budget subsidies to enterprises in district heating, the privatization of
housing maintenance services, and privatization of the water supply company (Vodokanal).

The Agreed Minutes of Technical Discussions between the representatives of the Russian
Federation and the Bank for the Kazan Municipal Development Loan defined the following key
indicators: (i) share of capital expenditures for education, healthcare and social protection in total
budgetary spending; (ii) restructuring of overdue payables of the city budget and budget-financed
organizations; (iii) budget deficit; (iv) budget commitment control system in place; (v)
proportion of off-budget revenues processed through the treasury; (vi) proportion of sole sourced
contracts; (vii) independent audit of city procurements; (viii) city's revenues from assets sales;
(ix) share of social assistance budget disbursed as cash payments; (x) share of social assistance
budget spent for targeted benefits; (xi) percentage of the poor covered by social assistance; (xii)
number of institutions and services provided under municipal contracts; (xiii) financial deficit in
the HCS sector; (xiv) amount of services provided by the city's HCS sector; (xv) financial
performance of the city's Vodokanal; (xvi) quality of Vodokanal provided services.

1.3    Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification:

                                               3

The original Program Development Objective and key indicators defined in the Program
Document have not been revised.

1.4      Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved):

During project preparation, the city faced a wide spectrum of developmental challenges, many of
which were typical for municipalities in Russia in general, and some of which were unique to
Kazan. Like many other Russian cities, Kazan had to address inefficient fiscal management and
underdevelopment of the business environment, a severely dilapidated housing stock and
communal services infrastructure, and weak performance of the social protection system and the
HCS sector.

The choice of policy areas to be supported by the Program proceeded at a time of rapid political
and economic change at the federal and subnational levels, and these changes directly affected
the city and impacted on the external environment of the Program. In particular, with respect to
financing of capital expenditures, the city was always extremely dependent on the decisions of
the Federal and Tatarstan Republic authorities with respect to capital transfers. About 80 percent
of such transfers were special-purpose investments under the federally targeted program (for
construction of new residential housing, a subway system, rehabilitation of cultural monuments).
With this program closing in 2006 and as a result of legislative changes in the sharing of tax
revenues between the federal, regional and municipal levels that reduced the municipality's
share, the city of Kazan faced reduced control over its revenue sources and overdependence on
intergovernmental transfers, which needed to be mitigated. The policy areas supported by the
Program were designed to aid that mitigation. The following policy areas were agreed by the
Borrower and the Bank:

    (i) Strengthening Budget and Financial Management

The aim of this component was to achieve long term fiscal and financial stability of the city of
Kazan, based in part on improved planning and financial flow management.

    (ii) Improving the Social Protection System

This component was aimed at improved targeting of assistance to the poor, and improving the
efficiency of service delivery and transparency in social welfare spending.

    (iii) Strengthening Housing and Communal Services

The aim of the component was to support sustainable development of the HCS sector in Kazan.

1.5      Revised Policy Areas (if applicable):

The Program components were not revised.

1.6      Other significant changes (in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and
schedule, and funding allocations):


                                             4

Under the HCS component, as one of the measures which was aimed to create a more
competitive environment for service provision, the Bank and the Borrower agreed on a second
tranche condition to transfer the management of the city's water and wastewater facility
(Vodokanal) to a competitively selected private operator. However, in mid-2006 after
discussions with the city about assistance they could provide, the EBRD launched preparation of
a project involving technical rehabilitation of Vodokanal facilities and improvement of its
management system. The EBRD project would finance the Vodokanal's priority capital
investments and support corporate development with the aim of enhancing the infrastructure of
the municipal water and wastewater system, improving the quality of Vodokanal provided
services, developing a tariff policy with the participation of the city's authorities and the utility,
and reviewing potential scenarios for eventual Vodocanal privatization. The preparation of the
EBRD project made this second tranche condition redundant and the Bank's Board of Directors
approved a waiver of the condition in December 2006.

There were no other substantial changes in the Program.


2.      Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1     Program Performance (supported by a table derived from a policy matrix):

The Loan was made available in two tranches amounting to US$50 million and US$75 million
respectively. The first tranche was disbursed on August 8, 2005, soon after the Program became
effective (July 1, 2005). The second tranche was released on December 29, 2006 after all the
conditions defined in the Loan Agreement had been met (Table of the Second Tranche
Conditions).

Program implementation catalyzed the reform process in Kazan. It helped Kazan achieve the
main aims of reforms in the fiscal system, social policy, and housing and communal sector.
Experience through early 2007 demonstrates that the city continues to meet its commitments to
pursue the key objectives defined under the program components.

2.2      Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

Among the major factors that impacted on the implementation of the Program, were the
following:

(i) Favorable macroeconomic situation during project implementation. Russia continued to
enjoy high rates of GDP growth through the Program period, primarily driven by a favorable
foreign trade environment and large increases in domestic demand. Inflation continued to fall
and the Federal government budget surpluses continued to grow. Tatarstan Republic and the city
of Kazan shared in this growth, benefiting as an oil producer and from revived manufacturing.
Thus, the macroeconomic situation in Russia during the life of the Program facilitated its
implementation and the attainment of its key objectives.

(ii) Support of the city of Kazan by the Federal Government. The Government of the
Russian Federation pays exceptional attention to the development of this capital city of the
Republic of Tatarstan, one of the oldest and largest economic, historical, research, and cultural
centers in Russia. In August 2005, Kazan observed its millennium anniversary. The RF
Government Commission for Kazan Millennial Celebrations vigorously supported the Project at
all its stages. The program for the millennial celebrations was implemented concurrently with the
Federal Targeted Program of Kazan Socioeconomic Development until 2006 which, as noted
earlier, provided substantial resources to the city from the federal budget. This special attention
paid to the Republic of Tatarstan and Kazan by the central government gave a strong positive
impetus to the Program during its preparation and implementation. At the same time, the city
received more federal transfers than expected at the outset of the Program, primarily for subway
construction, transfers that created problems with attaining Program quantitative performance
indicators related to the percentage of city budget expenditures dedicated to social protection.

(iii) Changes in federal public procurement legislation. A new federal law on public
procurement introduced several mechanisms and instruments that facilitated completion of the
agreed second tranche conditions for improving the municipal procurement system. The city
would have proceeded with the agreed changes in any case, but the federal procurement law
eased acceptance of the measures.

(iv) Quality of project management by the Borrower. At certain stages, the Program
implementation suffered from less than efficient management, in particular at the municipal
level. The replacement of Kazan's Mayor and his team in October 2005 negatively impacted
implementation, causing delays in a number of activities as the new Mayor focused on larger
issues of the leadership transition. As a result, in June 2006 the project IP rating was downgraded
to Moderately Satisfactory. Once the leadership transition was complete and the Mayor better
understood the Program, he streamlined project implementation arrangements and accelerated
                                               8

the Program, allowing an upgrade in the project rating and in general contributing to the
attainment of the Program objectives.

(v) EBRD's involvement in improving infrastructure in the municipal water and
wastewater system in Kazan. As noted in section 1.6, in mid-2006 EBRD launched preparation
of a project involving technical rehabilitation of Vodokanal facilities and improvement of its
management system. The Bank agreed to this shift in management strategy for the city's water
and wastewater assets, recognizing that close EBRD attention to upgrading the public utility with
an eye to later private sector participation offered citizens the most rapid improvements in
service delivery, while maintaining the original goal of more competitive, efficient service.

2.3     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

Monitoring and evaluation included the following elements:

    · At the city level a working group headed by the city vice mayor in charge of economy
        played a critical role in monitoring progress and coordinating the work of different
        Republican and municipal ministries and agencies. This working group was ably assisted
        by the Directorate of Extra-budgetary City Programs. They generated regular progress
        reports for the MOF and Bank.

    · At the Republic level, the President of Tatarstan Republic was regularly briefed about
        Program progress and was involved in certain critical decisions at various stages of the
        Program. The Republic's Prime Minister closely monitored the Program implementation
        and personally joined discussions to determine when corrective action or additional
        resources were needed to meet Program goals.

    · The Federal Ministry of Finance, an implementing agency for the Program, was fully
        involved in the Program implementation and was instrumental at critical stages of the
        Program implementation.

    · At the federal level, as with other Bank supported projects, the Program's progress was
        monitored by the so-called Automated System for Evaluation and Rating Outlook for
        IBRD funded Project Portfolio that is based on the on-line data supplied by implementing
        agencies and the Bank.

    · On several ocassions, Program progress was evalutated at the meetings of the Joint
        Working Group of the Government of Russia and the Bank (JWG) in order to assess
        implementation efficiency. In particular, JWG meetings in September 2005 and 2006
        evaluated the Program and confirmed its satisfactory rating.

At the Program negotiations stage, the Government of Russia volunteered to provide federal
budget funds to finance monitoring, evaluation and rollout of the Program accomplishments.
However, due to certain budgetary process limitations this did not materialize. The RF
Government then requested the Bank to amend the on-going Regional Fiscal TA Project (Loan
4528-RU) to finance such activities. The loan amendment was approved by the Bank, however,
as of this writing these activities have not been yet initiated.


                                              9

       2.4     Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

       While the financial approach of the Program, with loan proceeds provided to Kazan on a grant
       basis, is unlikely to be replicated in other municipalities in Russia, further development and
       dissemination of the Program outcomes in Tatarstan and nation wide remains actual. In terms of
       instruments, a focus on work with subnational entities has become one of the key themes of the
       new Partnership Strategy of the Bank and the Russian Federation approved in December 2006,
       including such new instruments as fee-for-service and lending without sovereign guarantee. At
       the same time, Tatarstan has evolved as one of the key regional partners of the Bank.

       Based on the above and in the context of the evolving local self-governance reform in Russia, the
       reform process in Kazan, the groundwork for which was laid under the Program, will be
       continued. The Russian Government continues to study and apply international experiences in
       reforming local governance, and the Bank stands ready to provide such assistance, including
       direct assistance to the regions and municipalities.

       The Program dealt with a number of longer term priorities of the Bank-Government cooperation,
       including: (i) improving the quality of budget management at the sub-federal level; (ii) attracting
       investments for municipal development; (iii) strengthening the social protection systems; and
       (iv) improving housing and communal services. In the last area, the RF Government has
       developed a joint operation with the Bank on improving services in the housing and communal
       sector. The project envisages that Russian municipalilties will be selected for funding
       competitively based on their progress with HCS reforms and appropriateness of their investment
       programs.

       Work is now under way to further the cooperation between the Bank and the Republic of
       Tatarstan, building on the success in Kazan. The Republic is keenly interested in subsovereign
       lending for infrastructure projects, such as land development for new housing, comprehensive
       repairs of heating and water supply systems, infrastructure for effluent treatment in individual
       towns, capital repairs of the existing housing stock, maintenance/construction of rural/local
       roads, construction of new heat and power plants, capacities for renewable energy sources,
       rehabilitation of existing generating capacities, repairs of distribution networks and electricity
       metering system, and also investments in road safety. Most such interventions draw directly on
       experience under the Kazan project, both in determining the needed supporting municipal
       reforms and those needed in the utilities or other service delivery institutions.

       3.      Assessment of Outcomes4

       3.1     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation (to current country and global
       priorities, and Bank assistance strategy):

       Perhaps unsurprisingly, given that a scant two years have passed since appraisal, project
       objectives and design remain highly relevant to both country and global priorities and to the
       Bank Country Partership Strategy with the Russian Federation. The sections above have
       described Russia's continued efforts to build the financial management, procurement, and similar

 programmatic series.

capacities of lower levels of government. Growing income has not removed the need to provide
efficient social protection institutions or efficient service delivery. It has provided more
resources to expand such efforts without the need for external finance, at least where that finance
comes with a sovereign guarantee. The new Country Partnership Strategy between the Bank and
the Russian Federation focuses on the closer engagement of the Bank with Russia's subsovereign
levels of government, with a preference for reimbursable technical assistance and subsovereign
lending. The experience of the Program remains equally important to meet the challenges of the
on-going reforms of local self-government and the broad area of relations between the federal
center and regional and municipal authorities.

3.2     Achievement of Program Development Objectives (including brief discussion of causal
linkages between policy actions supported by the operation and outcomes):

The Project delivered the following main results:

Component 1: Strengthening Budget and Financial Management. Implementation of this
component is evaluated as satisfactory. The goal of this component was to achieve long-term
fiscal and financial stability of the city based on better planning and management of financial
flows. The component supported the activities aimed to achieve the following: (i) improved
quality of budget execution on the basis of the treasury principles; (ii) better budget planning and
execution; (iii) enhanced municipal finance management; (iv) improved municipal procurement
procedures; and (v) better municipal asset management.

Implementation of these activities was complicated by the fact that when Kazan was created as
municipality, financial, managerial and oversight functions were the responsibility of a mix of
departments within the administration of the Republic of Tatarstan and the city administration.

(i) Improving the quality of budget execution based on treasury principles. Actions have been
taken to consolidate all municipal budget revenues and receipts from sales of municipal assets in
a single account established at the Federal Treasury for Kazan. Pursuant to agreements between
the Tatarstan and the city, and several implementing regulations, the city authorities exercise
oversight over the single account system of the city budget.

The city treasury performs the following functions: registration of the consolidated budget roster;
registration of budget commitment limits; registration of cash limits; dissemination, control and
release of budget commitment limits and cash limits to spending units; control and registration of
cash expenditure requests; registration of budget commitments, including registration
(validation) of contracts; payments management; budget execution accounting and reporting;
general ledger maintenance; and information storage. Also, as part of the treasury system a
mechanism has been created to control the budget commitments, including through mandatory
registration (validation) of all executed contracts with a treasury office.

Implementation of this subcomponent ensured that since 2005, 100 percent of off-budget
revenues of budgetary organizations have been processed through the municipal treasury.

(ii) Improving budget planning and execution. Since 2004, the city has been preparing a three-
year financial plan on a rolling basis as part of medium-term budget planning. The plan is used
as a tool to evaluate various choices of the city's financial and economic development in view of

                                             11

the reform program and with consideration for budget constraints and systemic risks. The main
goals of the financial plans are to develop forecasts of aggregated revenues and expenditures by
key categories and to gradually reduce the budget deficit.

Introduction by the city of the rolling three-year financial plan with adjustments made by the city
finance department on a regular basis, has improved medium-term budgetary planning by using
sophisticated financial (budgetary) analysis tools. In particular, the City is now capable of
making more accurate forecasts of aggregate revenues and expenditures for various items that
enables it to develop sound projections for budgetary spending, specifically, for improvements in
the social protection system, housing and communal services, and municipal asset management.
Development of a borrowing strategy and a capital investment program, undertaken by the City
as part of the financial plan, is another key factor that helped enhance budgetary planning.

Quality improvements in financial planning are confirmed by the findings of a comparative
analysis of actual budget execution parameters between the financial plans for 2005­2007 and
for 2006­2008. In particular, this analysis revealed that deviation of actual indicators from
projections decreased from not less than 17 percent to only 4 percent.

The city has created a basis to move to high-quality long-term financial planning, which would
help it to expand the budgetary planning horizon in keeping with one of the main budgeting
strategy principles outlined by the Russian President in his 2007 Budget Address to the Federal
Assembly of the Russian Federation.

Uniting formerly separate budgets of the city districts into a single consolidated city budget has
also facilitated budget planning and execution.

(iii) Improving municipal finance management. The total amount of overdue payables (of the
city budget and budget organizations) as of January 1, 2004, was 2.4 billion rubles. At the
commencement of the Program some budgetary institutions did not get enough funds from the
city budget to comply with arrears restructuring agreements with government social funds (in
particular, with the Federal Pension Fund). This negatively affected the sustainability of the
city's fiscal position because of the high level of (indirect) financial liabilities of the city
administration. At that time the city took considerable effort to restructure overdue payables of
budgetary institutions to federal social funds under arrears restructuring agreements.

The total amount of overdue payables of budgetary institutions as of the beginning of 2005 was
1.4 billion rubles. To ensure a long-term balanced budget of the municipality and in accordance
with the Program, by the end of 2006 the city fully repaid the arrears of budgetary institutions to
the federal social funds from the Kazan budget. Besides, at the time of loan closing the federal
authorities were in the process of restructuring the accumulated penalties and fines. In total, in
order to repay overdue payables of budgetary institutions, 583.7 million rubles was disbursed in
2005 from the KMDL's first tranche, and in 2006 439.2 million rubles was paid from the city
budget with subsequent compensation to the city from the second loan tranche.

During 2004­2006, city budget expenditures reduced from 19.5 billion to 10.2 billion rubles, or
by 48 percent, with the city budget deficit decreasing from 16.9 percent (2.8 billion rubles) to 3.6
percent (0.36 billion rubles) of the municipality's revenues.


                                              12

In this subcomponent, the policy matrix also provided for an increased share of city budget
expenditures going to social protection and related investment within the city budget. At the start
of the Program, the share of such expenditures was 7.5 percent, while in 2006 this indicator rose
to 15.3 percent of the total city spending.

To increase the transparency of the city's fiscal system, the city administration set up the Kazan
Chamber of Accounts and other municipal financial management and control bodies. The city
also developed and approved a regulatory framework to support operations of these institutions.
In addition, in 2005 the Republic of Tatarstan was selected one of the eight pilot zones for the
creation of an integrated information system of controlling and auditing bodies.

(iv) Improving municipal procurement practices. The procurement practices that were in place
before the Program had serious weaknesses. In particular, a substantial part of goods and services
for municipal needs (except for goods and services of natural monopolies) were not procured
competitively. In 2003, the share of direct contracts amounted to 55 percent of the annual city's
procurement. Second, contracts worth less than 200,000 rubles (about USD7.8 thousand) were
not registered in the Registry of the Kazan Committee for Economy and Industry (coordinator of
municipal procurement).

The city has met all the conditions defined by the policy matrix for this subcomponent. The
share of direct contracting (including contracts for goods and services of natural monopolies and
extensions of contracts earlier awarded competitively) declined in 2006 to 25 percent of the total
municipal procurement (significantly bettering the target of 35 percent). In addition, a list of
companies that can be sole sourced was approved as part of this subcomponent. Since the new
federal procurement law introduced in 2006 substantially limits the use of direct contracting, it
would be safe to assume that in future the city will sustain its reduction in sole sourced
contracting.

The city created a unified registry of municipal contracts combining registries of the city, its
individual procurement agencies and territorial districts and it conducts ex-post reviews of
contracts included in agency procurement registries.

Changes have been made in procurement procedures and bidding documents that clarify bid
evaluation methods and reduce the time gap between the bid submission deadline and bid
opening to 1 hour. Appeal processes enabling bidders to appeal against violations of the
prescribed procurement procedures were introduced first by the city itself and then these were
amended in line with the new public procurement law. All information on municipal
procurement is now made public.

(v) Improving municipal asset management. In 2004 the city, in collaboration with Bank experts
developed and approved a program to increase the efficiency of municipal asset management in
Kazan. The goal of the program was to design a management strategy targeted at increasing the
role of municipal assets in pursuing socioeconomic objectives of the city's development. The
program aimed to optimize the structure of city assets, develop land and real estate markets,
achieve profitable and sustainable operations of municipal enterprises, and, as a result, increase
the city's revenues. In order to address these areas, it was essential for the city to develop and
approve a package of legal and regulatory documents to accelerate the transition to market
relations in asset management, strengthen the legal underpinnings of municipal asset

                                            13

management, regulate the decision making process, and strengthen organizational and
information frameworks. The related KMDL subcomponent was designed in part as a tool for the
implementation of this program.

As part of this program, the city approved and successfully carried out an indicative plan of
privatization of municipal assets in Kazan for 2005. Adoption and implementation of annual
privatization plans became a regular practice of the city administration. Preparation and
implementation of a similar plan for 2006 was one of the conditions for the release of the second
tranche. Implementation of the 2007 privatization plan is currently under way. Through
implementation of these plans, the city has been consistently pursuing corporatization of
municipally owned enterprises, primarily MUEs, and complete or partial divestiture of its shares
in joint stock companies. As a result, the city's revenues from privatization of municipal assets
considerably increased in 2005 and 2006.

During 2004­2006, the Kazan city council and the city administration adopted a set of
interrelated laws and implementing regulations which made competitive bidding the only
possible procedure for transfer or acquisition of municipal assets, both movable and immovable.
In order to eliminate information constraints and improve transparency in municipal asset
management, the city introduced mandatory publication of notices and other information on
forthcoming transactions with municipal assets and on transactions already made.

As early as the project preparation stage, the city administration adopted regulations for
identification of surplus or unutilized assets of municipal unitary enterprises and for their
registration in the municipal asset registry. Unitary enterprises are subject to periodic
inventorying with the purpose of identifying surplus property, unutilized assets, or assets used
for purposes other than intended. Based on the results of such inventory an opinion is issued on
whether the enterprise has any such assets, a brief review is prepared of the current financial
position of the enterprise, and proposals on efficient asset management are developed. Surplus
and unutilized assets of municipal enterprises are subject to registration in the municipal asset
registry. In the course of the Program the technological base of this Registry, created in the early
1990s, was considerably enhanced and expanded.

Over the life of the Program appreciable progress was made in improving the infrastructure of
the land market in Kazan. Since 2006, the city has been conducting scheduled delineation of the
developed parts of the city. Given the large volume of work ahead (more than 21,000 hectares),
the city developed and approved a ten-year land delineation program. The total amount of the
land tax collected in Kazan in 2006 exceeded 1.2 billion rubles which is almost 50 percent more
than the collection level of 2005. Although the bulk of the increase was due to the new higher
land tax rates, it would be fair to assume that the recently delineated areas have also contributed
to the larger collection.

In compliance with the second tranche conditions, the city carried out a set of activities to
improve the efficiency of land use. In particular, it introduced a six-month cap for the renewal of
land plot leases for the design and construction period. Lease rights are suspended for expired
land allocations and for plots that are not utilized. A regulatory framework has been created to
support land use monitoring, inventorying, and requisition of unutilized land plots. During 2005­
2006, the city conducted reviews of all land allocation reports, and based on the findings created
a specialized database.

                                            14

During the Program, activities were planned and carried out to improve property lease practices
with the aim of maximizing profits from this segment of the city's municipal assets. Already at
the project preparation stage, the city stripped budgetary organizations of the right to rent
municipal properties at the minimum rate, and first reduced then later eliminated privileged
categories of lessees. Through two consecutive increases, the city in 2006 brought rent rates for
municipally owned properties to levels not lower than 90 percent of commercial rates. In
general, the city has set a course for divestiture of city owned premises. From the end of 2005,
two independent consulting firms are conducting semiannually a comparative monitoring and
analysis of rent rates established for municipal assets and rates for commercial properties.

Component 2: Improving the social protection system. The implementation results of this
component have been rated as satisfactory. The aims of this component were to provide greater
coverage and better targeting of assistance to socially disadvantaged groups and increase the
efficiency and transparency of public social support expenditures. To achieve these aims, the
component included the following subcomponents: (i) improving targeting of social support; (ii)
increasing the efficiency of social service delivery; and (iii) better transparency of the social
protection system.

Before the Program was launched, the Tatarstan Government and the city administration had
initiated substantial structural reforms in their social policy. In 2002, a program for development
of the social protection system for 2002-2005 was approved by Kazan. As part of this program,
in 2004 the city introduced free school meals for children from needy families, and eliminated
"double-dipping" in the provision of subsidies and in-kind benefits under social assistance
programs.

Building on pre-Program achievements, one substantial outcome of this component is the
increased effectiveness of social assistance programs and a clear division of responsibility for the
delivery of social support programs in the city between different establishments and
organizations, and also the integration of all social protection programs under one municipal
directorate. At the same time, the accountability for the delivery of social protection programs in
Kazan was transferred to the city administration, with the programs being funded by special-
purpose subsidies from the republican and municipal budgets. Also, the city's administrative and
staff capacity in social protection management has been greatly strengthened, local social
protection units are using individual case management practices, an integrated database for all
social assistance programs has been implemented, and a system of comprehensive living-
standards monitoring is successfully functioning.

Improving the targeting of social support. Under this subcomponent, Kazan has implemented a
special cash poverty benefit targeted to needy individuals, provision of assistance to old-age
pensioners, government-paid workers, and poor families.

The targeting principle of social assistance to vulnerable groups of Kazan residents is based on
means testing methods and on the mechanism of "social contracts" with able-bodied recipients of
social assistance. Under this subcomponent, incentives have been created to help unemployed
individuals to re-enter the labor market and procedures have been put in place to provide targeted
cash subsidies for school meals. Also, an inventory was conducted to check targeting in
subsidization of school meals, the costs of kindergartens and summer recreation for children. 70

                                              15

million rubles was allocated in the 2006 city budget for the program of targeted poverty benefits,
and adequate provisions have been made in the 2007 budget for the continued implementation of
this successful program.

Under this component, a pilot program of targeted subsidies for payment of kindergartens
services has been implemented. Children of poor families in 6 kindergartens of Kazan received a
total of 23,963 rubles as a subsidy. The pilot has confirmed the advisability of such targeted
assistance to the poor. Since January 2007 pursuant to the republican government resolution #9
dated January 18, 2007, in excess of 40,000 parents will receive targeted compensation to allow
them to pay for services by pre-school institutions.

This component supported the development of methodologies for living standards monitoring
and evaluation of the impact of social programs. Also, a pilot program to provide targeted
subsidies for the poor and pilots to introduce "social contracting" were successfully carried out.

This component set a base for a follow up Tatarstan-wide analysis of social assistance programs
that is undertaken under Bank-DFID supported programmatic poverty work. Furthermore, the
Republic of Tatarstan has requested the Bank to deliver a reimbursable technical assistance that
includes a regional household budget survey that would permit to introduce monitoring of
poverty and effectiveness of social programs for all municipalities in Tatarstan. This follow up
fee-for-service activity is currently being discussed with the Republican authorities.

Improving efficiency of social service provision. The city approved a legislative framework for
contract awards for provision of social services. It also approved and implemented an action plan
for the transition to municipal contracts and competitive selection of nongovernmental
organizations for provision of services to the disabled, pensioners, and families at risk. In the
2006 city budget, a provision of over 70 million rubles was made for social protection activities
related to the mechanisms of social contracting and competitive selection of service providers.

Improving transparency of the social protection system. In 2005, a complicated system of
subsidies and in-kind benefits provided to various categories of residents and approved at
different levels of government was replaced with cash payments. The City Administration issued
regulations specifying the procedures for provision of social benefits in Kazan, including through
transfers to personal bank accounts, which made the social assistance system much more
transparent.

In 2006 the city received 870 million rubles for provision of cash benefits as a subvention from
the Tatarstan budget. This amount was sufficient to cover all the payments under the
monetization arrangements. As of January 1, 2006 the share of social welfare spending in the
total city expenditures was 7.3 percent. In the city budget for 2006, the share of expenditures for
social purposes had risen to 15.3 percent of the total spending (it is expected that in 2007 real
support levels will be sustained, although the share of actual spending will be about 14 percent, if
the city receives expected investment grants from the republican budget).

Component 3: Improving housing and communal services. The implementation results of
this component have been rated as satisfactory.

The aim of the component was to ensure the sustainable development of the housing and
communal services (HCS) sector in the city. To address this objective, the Program included the
                                              16

following subcomponents: (i) improving the financial position of the HCS sector; (ii) creating a
competitive environment in provision of housing and communal services; and (iii) improving
HCS sector management. All the activities under these subcomponents were implemented in
accord with the objectives of the Kazan HCS sector reform program approved in September
2004.

(i) Improving the financial position of the HCS sector. The city made substantial progress in
improving the financial position of the HCS sector over the Program life.

Budget subsidies to heat producers were eliminated already in the city budget for 2005, with
those funds reallocated for assistance to the needy and to individuals eligible for subsidies. City
budgets for 2006 and 2007 were prepared using a similar approach.

One major source of non-payment to utilities has been budget-financed organizations. To ensure
that they met their obligations, in 2006, a total of 468 million rubles was allocated from the city
budget to budget-financed organizations to cover their HCS costs. In the city budget for 2007,
provisions of about 580 million rubles have been made for the same purpose including some 334
million rubles for heating and hot water supply. In addition, the city has successfully eliminated
debts of budgetary organizations to HCS suppliers and debts of district housing maintenance
departments (RzhU) to housing maintenance organizations.

From 2004, the authority to set the majority of HCS tariffs has been delegated to the city (except
those for electricity and heat supply which remain the prerogative of the Republic of Tatarstan),
with tariff setting based on 100% cost recovery for all heating companies operating in Kazan.
However, because of post-effectiveness amendments to the Federal Law On Basic Principles of
Tariff Regulation in the Housing and Communal Services Sector, which have restricted the right
of municipalities to set tariffs for water and wastewater services and put an annual cap on tariff
growth, the city did not manage to fully attain the Program objective of eliminating the cross
subsidization between different categories of water and wastewater consumers. Nonetheless, the
city made progress during the Program period and has agreed with the Bank to continue their
program of tariff equalization for households and companies, with full implementation by 2008.

(ii) Creating a competitive environment in housing and communal services. In 2004, 52 percent
of the housing stock was serviced by private contractors. To create conditions for competition
growth in housing and communal services, all housing maintenance MUEs have been privatized.
As of the end of 2006, the entire housing stock in Kazan was serviced through competitive
contracting by some 60 private sector companies, and nine private management companies were
operating in the city housing management market.

In 2004, about 80 new homeowners associations (HOA) were created. To support the further
development of market relations and enhance competition in service provision, the city has set
up a mechanism for voluntary creation of homeowners associations. To encourage the creation of
HOAs, the city successfully: (i) developed a package of economic and other incentives (e.g., the
right to lease out common spaces in the building, simplified procedure for HOA creation in
newly built and fully refurbished houses); (ii) created a public coordination council to assist
HOAs; (iii) conducted an awareness campaign in the city mass media explaining the advantages
of HOAs. This resulted in the formation of more than 200 additional HOAs over the Program
period (during years 2004-2006).

                                             17

(iii) Improving HCS sector management. A second tranche condition for this subcomponent was
the transfer of the City's water and wastewater facilities to a competitively selected private
operator for management. As earlier described, at Kazan's invitation, EBRD began work with
the Vodokanal that led to a waiver of this condition by the Bank's Board of Directors.

3.3     Justification of Overall Outcome Rating (combining relevance, achievement of PDOs):

Rating: The overall outcome is rated as satisfactory.

Overall, the Program played a considerable role in helping the city in transition to the generally
accepted format of relations between the central and regional authorities and to partly
compensate for losses in revenues associated with the change in the federal-regional relations
through implementation of key reform goals in the fiscal system, social policy, and housing and
communal sector.

At the beginning of the project the city started to develop rollover medium term financial plans
thus making realistic assessment of its budget revenue, expenditure, and deficit projections. This
medium term vision reinforced the willingness of the city to implement a whole range of public
financial management related reforms. As a result of reforms the city drastically reduced its
overdue accounts payable (from RUB 2.4 billion to RUB727.8 million) and budget deficit (from
9.1 percent of total revenue to 3.6 percent of total revenue). The city managed to restructure
some budget expenditures by eliminating budget subsidies to heat producers and through closer
and privatization of municipal unitary enterprises. In addition the municipal authorities started to
get "more value for money" through decrease in the share of sole source contracts (from 55
percent to 25 percent of all contracts awarded) and through putting expenditures under tough
treasury control.

Moreover, long run vision of the city needs allowed the authorities to use loan proceeds
primarily for capital expenditures into social infrastructure entities- hospitals, schools etc., as the
share of such expenditures in the overall budget was maintained relatively high. So in
anticipation of lower budget revenue and expenditures in the medium term the city invested into
its future now and as a result produced budget savings. Thus the overall financial position was
significantly improved and the whole public finance system in Kazan is much more healthy now
than it was at the beginning of the project.

Experience in early 2007 demonstrates that the city continues to meet its commitments to pursue
key objectives that were defined under the Program components. The continued relevance of the
Program was outlined above.

One of the substantial outcomes of the Program was harmonization of the municipality's legal
framework with the federal legislation. The KMDL supported activities that help the city
enhance its competitiveness and utilize the strategic advantages of the municipality in order to
further improve the investment attractiveness of the city.

3.4     Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts (if any, where not previously covered
or to amplify discussion above):

(a)     Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

N/A

(b)     Institutional Change/Strengthening (particularly with reference to impacts on longer-
term capacity and institutional development):

The Program has fostered an appetite for reform at various levels in Tatarstan as the Republic
faces significant challenges with the anticipated exhaustion of its hydrocarbon resource base.
Tatarstan has also formed a core group of Republican and city officials keen to and capable of
working with the Bank and other international partners on the challenges of socio-economic
development of Tatarstan. Beyond that, the specific efforts directed at upgrading the social
protection department of the city have significantly improved its operations in a fashion that
appears both sustainable and successful in reaching the poor with better targeted assistance.

Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes):

N/A

4.      Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

During the life of the Program, Russia maintained high growth rates, with that growth also
enjoyed in Tatarstan and Kazan. While this clearly eased the reform process, a reduction in
growth rates or even a contraction should not threaten the key Program elements, as those were
aimed at more transparent and efficient delivery of services. That efficiency should be even more
valued in a lower growth environment.

That said implementation of the reforms in social protection, with its shift of financing
responsibility to the regional level benefited from the reduced need for such protection as income
growth continued at a high pace. A macroeconomic reversal could simultaneously increase the
demand on social protection services and reduce the resources available to provide those
services. The city does need to make additional efforts to continue development of the
institutions and policy to cope with such changes.

Under the Program, the city administration carried out important activities to improve the
transparency of local government in the areas of city budget, municipal procurement, municipal

                                             19

asset management, social policy, and housing and communal services. These are not easily
reversible, as many components of that work have become embodied in national law. Beyond
those areas, the Republic of Tatarstan is a participating region in the program of creation of an
integrated information system of auditing bodies, and this further improves the transparency of
the city fiscal system.

Given that Kazan is a newly constituted municipal entity undertaking a comprehensive reform
agenda, there was substantial concern over the city administration's capacity to deliver on its
reform program and the potential loss of commitment to the reform course over the longer term.
However, this concern was not realized, with the biggest test being the replacement of the Kazan
mayor early in the Program. That change caused only minor delay in the implementation of
certain Program elements, but ultimately had no negative impact on the Program. With the
Program in place and implementation proceeding smoothly, the magnitude of on-going reforms
appears to be within the city's capacity. The city has been able to retain talented staff in the
current economic environment and any external downturn would make such employment more
rather than less attractive.

Finally, there was a risk of backlash to the reform program by the city's inhabitants. However,
the city administration made its best efforts to conduct an awareness campaign, receive feedback,
and build consensus of the majority of city residents, ultimately maintaining broad-based
support. That support should help sustain implementation of the reforms introduced under the
Program.

5.      Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance (relating to design, implementation
and outcome issues)

5.1     Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry (i.e., performance through lending phase):

Rating: The quality of the Bank performance during Program preparation is assessed as
satisfactory.

The Program was prepared by the city with assistance from the Bank. Program activities for all
components were developed by the Borrower, with the participation of Institute for Urban
Economics staff and advice from Bank staff. Most notable was the work of the project team in
assisting the city to link goals of the "Kazan Development Strategy Until 2015" with activities of
the Program.

(b) Quality of Supervision (including M&E arrangements):

Rating: Supervision by the Bank is rated as satisfactory.

Supervision included regular field mission to Kazan, frequent meetings with Tatarstan and
Kazan officials in Kazan, and almost daily interactions with Kazan by phone, email and fax. The
Bank's project team was composed primarily of Russian-speaking specialists based in Moscow,
staffing that greatly facilitated timely detection and resolution of implementation bottlenecks.
The fact that Moscow and Kazan are in same time zone also helped to resolve project issues

                                             20

promptly and efficiently. These factors greatly facilitated supervision and helped optimize the
frequency of the Bank's missions and minimize supervision costs, as members of the Bank team
were able, as necessary, to visit Kazan on a short notice. The one shortcoming of this pattern of
interaction was that, absent the benchmark provided by the typical mission routine, formal Bank
documentation such as Aide Memoires or BTOs tended to be replaced by more-difficult-to-track
e-mail and telephone exchanges. Institutional memory would have been better served by more
frequent ISRs.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance:

Rating: The Bank performance overall is rated as satisfactory.

The Bank has provided the city with valued policy and implementation advice at the preparation
stage, followed by a very intensive supervision effort. In its brief implementation period, the
Program received very high level attention from the Bank, as Kazan was visited by a Bank
managing director, a group of executive directors, and several times by the country director.

5.2     Borrower Performance

NOTE: When the government and implementing agency are indistinguishable, provide rating and justification only
for Overall Borrower Performance.

Rating: Overall Borrower performance is evaluated as satisfactory.

(a) Government Performance:

Rating: Government performance is evaluated as satisfactory.

Early in the project concept development, disagreements on the Borrower's side with respect to
the project design and structure of financial flows slowed progress. However, once the
agreement on the design had been achieved, the Program received the "green light" from the
Government as its development objectives and content were fully in line with the Government
policies for subnational development. Members of the Joint Working Group of the Government
of Russia and the World Bank at its 6th meeting in June 2005 noted the high efficiency of
Program preparation.

Throughout the implementation period, the federal authorities diligently monitored Program
activities, maintained regular contact with the Republic government and city administration and
ensured the appropriate conditions for the implementation of the Program at the macro level as
well as in terms of the overall context of the reform of the federal-regional relations, including
intra-budgetary relations. It was unfortunate that the initial intention of the Ministry of Finance
to allocate 85 million rubles from the federal budget to finance monitoring, evaluation and
dissemination of the Program outcomes did not materialize. To remedy this, the MOF has agreed
with the Bank that in 2007-2008, US$1.7 million will be allocated for evaluation of Program
outcomes, and their subsequent replication in other municipalities, from the federal budget
contribution to the on-going Regional Fiscal Technical Assistance Project.

While the audit of the deposit account for the first loan tranche was somewhat delayed due to a
misunderstanding between the MOF and the city about who should be the client for the audit, the
                                             21

results of the audit raised no major fiduciary issues regarding the channeling of funds to the city
through the treasury system.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance:

Rating: The Tatarstan Government and Kazan city administration performance has been
evaluated as satisfactory.

The Program enjoyed full support of the Tatarstan President and was closely monitored by the
prime minister of the Republic with assistance from relevant Republic ministries (finance,
economy, social protection, etc.) that had a regular working level interface with the city
authorities.

At the city level, a working group was created with participation of all relevant city departments
and chaired by the first vice mayor in charge of economy, who was also responsible for Program
implementation. The working group met regularly, monitored progress, discussed and solved
implementation problems, and maintained an open line of communications with the Bank. In
addition, expert and technical support to this work was provided by the city's directorate for off-
budget city development programs.

In order to efficiently address issues arising during project preparation and implementation,
Tatarstan and Kazan officials visited Moscow on many occasions for discussions with the federal
government and the Bank.

The Program went relatively smoothly through the change of the top leadership in the city in
October 2005. The new management team in the city had subscribed to the objectives of the
Program, however it needed some time to review the complex Program and mobilize itself to
resume implementation. This affected the overall progress of the Program and resulted in delays
in a number of areas causing a temporary downgrading to Moderately Satisfactory of the
Program in June 2006. However, following Bank Country Director's discussions with
Tatarstan's president in early June 2006 and a follow-up meeting with the prime minister in
August, there was a turnaround in project implementation. With significant support and
assistance from the Republic, by mid-autumn the city authorities had made significant progress
on all remaining issues.

The mass media campaign undertaken by the city at the beginning of the Program and visible
social investments following tranche releases helped to shape a very positive image of the
Program in Kazan and in the Republic in general. Thus it was not surprising that as a result of the
KMDL, Tatarstan became one of the key regions in Russia keen on extending collaboration with
the Bank through a wide range of new instruments, such as direct lending and reimbursable
technical assistance.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance:

Rating: The overall Borrower performance is rated satisfactory.

The following key factors justify the above positive rating: the Program was fully supported at
the highest political level of the federal, republican and municipal government and the operation

                                              22

benefited from effective interaction between all three layers of executive power. Serious
ownership of the Program and its development objectives facilitated implementation of the key
measures of the Matrix of Agreed Actions. The Program was implemented within the originally
established closing date and the funds were used for the purposes intended, as confirmed by the
audit of the use of the first tranche funds. While the shortfall in M&E financing did not interfere
with accurate evaluation of tranche conditions, it has slowed dissemination. However, measures
are now in place to remedy that shortcoming.

6. Lessons Learned (both operation-specific and of wide general application)

While the financial approach of the KMDL (full federal grant to a municipality) is not replicable
in today's Russia in the absence of very special political circumstances such as those surrounding
the relationship of Tatarstan with federal authorities, nevertheless the lessons of the Program
seem highly relevant for the country and its future cooperation with the Bank.

Russia has asked the Bank to work at the sub-national level to address a diversity of local issues
ranging from fiscal sustainability and social protection to the housing and communal services
sector. The Kazan work shows that such issues can be very successfully addressed through a
combination of a systemic approach with appropriate institutional development.

The DPL option selected for Kazan allowed focus on the substance of reforms rather than on the
project procurement and implementation issues that tend to consume both borrower and Bank
staff in an investment project. Nevertheless, the local authorities were able to demonstrate to the
population upgraded social and communal infrastructure associated with the KMDL reforms.

The Program was approved as an adjustment operation without a separate technical assistance
component. A stand alone TA loan was not possible due to existing borrowing limitations of the
federal government. Should this operation be approved now as a development policy loan, it
would greatly benefit from a separate TA component that would assist the city administration in
implementing the policy objectives of the operation. A combination of Bank and borrower
efforts filled the technical assistance gap, but less systematically than desired. Even in the
absence of a TA component, this regionally focused policy operation groomed local officials
with an appetite for reforms and further cooperation with the Bank.

Local consultants employed by the Bank at the project preparation stage helped tremendously to
focus the Program on approaches that had been tested in other regions of Russia. A fully local
Bank team can be highly effective in daily supervision dialogue with municipal authorities, yet
international experts can be extremely helpful, particularly at the preparation stage.

Joint projects with the Bank and other IFIs increase the quality of project preparation and
implementation, manifest an international approval of local reforms and thus increase regional
and municipal investment ratings.

The Program's Beneficiary ­ the city of Kazan - and its Implementing Agency appraised the
results of the Program implementation as very positive. The Evaluation Report prepared by
Kazan city was delivered to the Bank and submitted to the RF Ministry of Finance for No-
Objection. Kazan Municipal Administration reported that, as a result of the project
implementation, the city improved management of its budget and social spheres and formed clear
and transparent procedures and implementation mechanisms for local self-governance system
that now brought the city of Kazan to the position of one of the leaders of the local self-
governance in Russia.

                                          Project Justification

        In the course of preparation for the celebrations to mark the Millennium of the City of Kazan in
2005, the Government of the Russian Federation by its Resolution #625 dated August 24, 2001,
approved the federal targeted program "Socio-Economic Development of the Republic of Tatarstan until
2006" which included a subcomponent aimed to support socio-economic and spatial development of the
city of Kazan.

        One of the sources of funding for the Program was to come through sovereign guarantees in the
amount of 12 billion rubles to borrow for the activities of the Program. In this connection in 2001-2002
negotiations were held with the staff of the World Bank Resident Mission in Moscow to discuss possible
WB involvement in implementation of the following projects:

        -       "Rehabilitation of Living Environment for Low-Income Population in the City of Kazan"
aimed to implement legal and institutional reforms in urban planning and housing regulation as well as
in housing maintenance. It was intended to implement a series of projects that would result in a
significant improvement of social, residential and urban environment used by low-income population as
well as in cost savings.
        -       "Kazan    Municipal    Development"      project   aimed   to   implement    institutional
transformations necessary to improve the management of budget and finance, improve the quality of
social services, conditions of the housing and communal sector.

        In the course of designing these projects, the city administration proceeded from the need to
address priority objectives of urban development, primarily in the social sector and city governance
sector. The projects were based on a comprehensive analysis of socio-economic situation in Kazan.

                        II. Key Aspects of Socio-Economic Situation in Kazan
                              at the Beginning of the Project Design Stage

1.      As of 2003, the population of Kazan was 1.1 million people. In terms of population, Kazan is
the largest city in Tatarstan and is number seven in Russia. Annualized GRP per capita was 95,000
rubles (data for 2003), - slightly more than USD 3,000 at that time. The structure of the city economy
was inherited from the Soviet times and was dominated by heavy industry, including enterprises of the
military-industrial complex. Kazan is responsible for about 40% of Tatarstan's GRP. The major sectors
of the city economy are: industry (38% of the city's GRP), trade and public catering (27.4%), transport
(8.2%), construction (6.1%). A special challenge for the city is presented by the administrative structure
of the Republic of Tatarstan where Kazan was deprived of the independent municipality status and was
an administrative unit of the Republic of Tatarstan.
2.      In April 2003, the "Kazan Development Strategy until 2015" was approved. The approval of the
Strategy was preceded by a participatory discussion with authorities and public at large. The Strategy
specified major medium- to long-term activities, addressing, inter alia, challenges in economic



                                                    30

development, urban development and social sector. The Strategy outlined a list of primary goals,
objectives and activities that should drive reforms aimed to improve socio-economic situation in the
city. It should be stressed that the reforms presented in the Strategy largely coincide with the key
national priorities. Implementation of the Strategy would help the city to perform key social, economic
and political transformations in line with the national reform agenda.

3.      Prior to Kazan becoming a municipality, the property in the city that routinely was referred to as
municipal was in fact state property of the Republic of Tatarstan and was trust property of the city. City
administration units were subdivisions of regional ministries and agencies as their territorial divisions
and sections.

4.      Since until 2004 Tatarstan did not have any local self-governance experience, implementation of
Federal Law #131-FZ dated October 6, 2003, "On Key Principles of Local Self-Governance in the
Russian Federation" caused additional efforts and costs on the part of city authorities. In particular, in
terms of financing capital investments there has always been a strong dependence on sizeable grants
provided by federal and regional authorities from respective budgets. During that period, 80% of such
grants, while present in the federal targeted program, were block grants (construction of new housing,
metro network, restoration of monuments of culture). Implementation of the program was largely
completed in 2005, and since 2006 such grants were no longer transferred to the city budget. In
addition, due to changes in the legislation regarding reallocation of tax revenues collected by
municipalities with the share of municipalities being reduced, Kazan started to face the risk of shrinking
municipal revenues and heavier dependence on intergovernmental transfers and that risk had to be
reduced. This severely constrained the ability of the city to design and implement long-term
development policies.

5.      Between 2000 and 2003 Kazan experienced major financial risks that emerged primarily due to
adoption of a new Budget Code. Because of changes in the system of intergovernmental fiscal relations,
in 2002-2003 the city budget accumulated payables overdue totaling 2.4 billion rubles (USD 80 mln.) as
of January 1, 2004. This posed a major threat to stability of the city financial system.

6.      Improving the standards of living for vulnerable populations is the key priority in the social
policy of the city. In 2002, 23% of city residents had incomes below subsistence level, and 19% had
monthly incomes at the subsistence level (1,199.6 rubles as of September 1, 2002). About 52.9% of
population had incomes below the minimal consumer budget ­ between 1,215.6 and 3,569.3 rubles per
month. Only 5.1% of city residents had incomes on par with the national level, - 11,800 rubles per
month. The city administration faced a lot of challenges in managing the social protection system. The
social safety net present in the city offered a complex array of in-kind benefits targeted to various
groups. Because of such benefits and privileges (free city transportation, free medicines, sanatorium-
resort therapy, covering rent and utilities, free communication services) various municipal enterprises
required subsidies from regional and municipal budgets, and inadequacy of such subsidies severely
affected the quality and quantity of services. There are about 300,000 eligible beneficiaries in Kazan,
and this accounts for one third of the city population. The practice of "double dipping" was widespread,
i.e. beneficiaries of federal and regional programs somewhat overlapped. Very often municipal
enterprises were made responsible for provision of in-kind benefits without appropriate funding, and this
undermined attempts to introduce market reforms in the social protection system.




                                                    31

7.       Institutional and managerial limitations were yet another factor preventing a higher efficiency of
this sector. The bulk of water supply and sanitation services in Kazan, as well as over 30% of heat
supply, 50% of housing maintenance and almost 100% of residential property management services,
were provided by municipal unitary enterprises.

         Technological and economic inefficiency of the HCS enterprises was reflected in higher
operating costs, high network losses, high consumption of power and other resources. In 2003 the total
water use bill covered only 65% of the total volume produced in Kazan, and estimated cost of cubic
meter produced in Kazan proved some 15% higher compared to capital cities in neighboring Volga
regions. The key factor behind such inefficiency is obsolescence and depreciation of infrastructure
(utilities and networks) and equipment. Depreciation rate of plant and equipment in Kazan "Vodokanal"
[water supply and sewerage enterprise] averaged 61.4%, including 72.1% for water pipes, 66.5% for
sewerage pipes and 65.3% for water supply facilities. As a result, 454.4 km of water supply network
and 232.1 km of sewerage require replacement.

8.       Municipal procurement procedures lacked efficiency. Not all goods were procured on a
competitive basis. The Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Tatarstan established a list of goods and
services (fuel and lubricants, water, heat, power, communication, utility services) to be procured from a
limited number of suppliers. The list was duplicated in an Order issued by the Mayor of Kazan where
the suppliers were specified. As a result, direct contracts accounted for about 30% of the city budget.
Based on the data from the Committee on Economy and Industry of the Ministry of Economy and
Industry of the Republic of Tatarstan, in 2003 in Kazan direct contracts were used to procure goods and
services worth some 4 billion rubles, which was 55% of the city budget. Such system resulted in higher
costs for the budget, absence of competition and increased opportunities for corruption.

                                     III. Stages in the Project Design

         In May 203, V.Putin, the President of the Russian Federation, instructed the Ministry of Finance
of the Russian Federation to review a possibility of providing the city of Kazan with an IBRD
adjustment loan and issuing necessary sovereign guarantees.

         In the course of consultations with the World Bank, the Kazan Municipal Development Project
was selected as the basis and it was updated to include activities that would contribute to the
development of local self-governance in Kazan and would help to address issues faced by low-income
populations.

         The city administration with active support from the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of
Tatarstan and the Government of the Russian Federation put a major effort in designing the loan draft.
More that 10 WB missions visited the city in the course of this work.

         The draft loan covered design and implementation of specific programs in selected urban
development areas. The resultant programs were agreed with the Word Bank, national and regional
governments and approved by the local representative body ­ Kazan Council of People's Deputies - in
October-November 2004.




                                                     32

       The following agreed conditions for the presentation to the World Bank Board of Directors and
release of the first tranche, except agreed programs, were complied with by the city administration:

- a medium-term (2005-2007) financial plan was developed;
- the budget for 2005 allocated 12% of the total expenditures to capital investment in health, education
and social protection;
- a mechanism was developed to monitor assumed budget obligations, including by introduction of
mandatory registration of all contracts with the treasury;
- an independent evaluation of the procurement system present in Kazan to establish a measurable
baseline was performed;
- a plan to privatize municipal property of the city of Kazan for 2005 was developed; it called for
privatization of 21 MUEs, including all MUEs in housing maintenance, as well a selling 15 stakes in
municipality-owned enterprises.

       The draft loan was approved by the Operations Committee of the World Bank on November 1,
2004, and on February 24, 2005, the World Bank Board of Directors made a decision to extend a loan
"for the purposes of Kazan municipal development". The loan proceeds in the amount of USD 125
million were disbursed in two tranches: the first (in the amount of USD 50 million) in 2005, and the
second (in the amount of USD 75 million) ­ in late 2006. Pursuant to Loan Agreement #4766 between
the Russian Federation and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the World
Bank Group) (hereinafter referred to as the IBRD) dated June 3, 2005, on August 11, 2005, the IBRD
disbursed the first tranche in the amount of USD 50 million to the Russian Federation.

       In the course of complying with conditions for the second tranche, uncertainty developed with
regard to the condition of establishing the city treasury (due to changes in the national legislation) and
placing the "Vodokanal" enterprise in management. This caused delays in disbursing the second tranche.
In this connection, in the second half of 2006 the parties put a major effort to identify and agree on
mutually acceptable solutions.

       In the middle of 2006, the WB supervision mission that visited Kazan and evaluated the first
tranche implementation outcomes and compliance with conditions for the second tranche release, as well
as audited the first tranche deposit account, concluded the following:

       "The Borrower and the city authorities have complied with seven out of nine key conditions for
the release of the second tranche in full, and have made a significant progress in meeting one of the
conditions; another key condition related to the city "Vodokanal" had become excessive since the EBRD
started to design a separate project to address the issues specified by the mentioned key condition. The
progress in meeting non-key conditions of the Program mentioned in the Development Policy Letter is
satisfactory with respect to all material aspects. Also the city authorities continue to comply with
conditions for the release of the first tranche."

       Based on the supervision results, the Bank released the second tranche (USD 75 million) that was
received with a significant delay in December 2006.

                                IV. Key Project Objectives and Activities




                                                     33

        A mandatory condition for the WB loan was availability of an implementation action plan to be
pursued by the city administration (so called Administration Actions Matrix) as well as availability of
subcomponents that would cover various aspects of the city activity and would be agreed with the
national and regional governments and the World Bank.

        The key objective of the loan was to provide support to Kazan in developing local self-
governance and increasing its investment attractiveness; the key project subcomponents were as follows:

        - development of the social protection system;
        - improving efficiency of managing municipal property;
        - improving management efficiency in the housing and communal sector;
        - improving management of the budget;
        - enhancing transparency and effectiveness of the municipal procurement system.

These objectives were reached in the course of implementing the loan subcomponents developed by the
city administration and agreed with the Bank:

    · "Improving Efficiency of Managing Municipal Property of the City of                   Kazan" aimed at
        developing a registry of municipal assets and property, optimizing municipal property
        management, developing city land market.
    · "A Program of Activities to Improve Social Assistance" aimed at replacing all in-kind benefits
        with cash benefits, transferring all the authority in the social protection area to the Department of
        Social Protection, moving toward provision of social services on a contractual basis.
    · "A Program of Reforming the Housing and Communal Sector of Kazan" that includes:
               - demonopolization of the HCS and privatization of utilities;
               - improving tariff regulation;
               - institutional support in setting up and development of home owners' associations.
    · "A Program of Improving Municipal Procurement System" aimed at making tenders for
        procurement of works and goods to municipal entities more transparent and accessible as well as
        automating the municipal procurement process.

                                   V. Allocation of the Loan Proceeds

        The following activities were supported by the first tranche:

- improving the social sector of the city, including health, education ­ 632.05 million rubles;
- improving the system of social protection in the city ­ 120 million rubles;
- repayment of debt of public sector entities ­ 415 million rubles.

        Proceeds of the second tranche have been allocated to the following sectors of the city:

- improving the social sector of the city, including health, education, culture, youth policy ­ 1,715.4
million rubles;
- social protection ­ 85.1 million rubles.

                                     VI. The Main Project Outcomes



                                                      34

        Owing to the project implementation, the main objectives of the budget system, social policy and
the HCS sector reform have been reached. The city continues to meet its commitments in addressing
key tasks as specified by the project subcomponents.

        Implementation of the loan program allowed the city to achieve a significant progress in
establishing local self-governance system.         A clear delineation of municipal property in the city,
concentration of authority regarding implementation of social programs based on the "one shop stop"
approach, setting up a transparent and efficient municipal procurement system that meets international
standards, transfer of residential properties to city residents for management, - these outcomes have
established a solid foundation for further development of local self-governance and civil society in
Kazan.
        The main project outcomes are as follows:
        1) For the subcomponent "Improving Budget Planning and Implementation":
        - quality of budgeting has improved thanks to the introduction of three-year financial plans
applied on a rolling basis;
        - debt of public sector entities to social finds has been settled;
        - the share of social spendings has been increased: at the start of implementation social spendings
accounted for 7.5% in total budget spendings, whereas by the time of the project completion this figure
has reached 15.3% of the city budget.

        Implementation of the above activities was made difficult by the following: by the time the city
obtained the legal status of a municipality, financial, managerial and supervision powers had been
assigned to different units at the Administration of the President of the Republic of Tatarstan and city
administration. This required an in-depth revision of mechanisms and policies employed to manage the
budget, as well as operations of the treasury and auditing procedures.

        Three-year financial plans applied on a rolling basis with systematic adjustments as introduced
by the city administration helped to significantly improve the quality of medium-term budgeting owing
to better tools available for financial (fiscal) analysis. In particular, the city benefited from better
projections of aggregate revenues and itemized expenditures; thus, now the city can develop sound
budget outlays projections, e.g., to support reforms in social protection, HCS sector and municipal
property management. Development of borrowings strategy and investment program by the city under
financial plan has become one of crucial factors enabling improvements in budgeting.

        The qualitative improvements in financial planning are confirmed by a comparison between
indicators of the financial plan for 2005-2007 and indicators for the 2006-2008 plan against actual
budget execution outcomes. In particular, deviation of key projections from actual values is observed to
have reduced from at least 17 to 4 per cent.

        In the period between 2004 and 2006, expenditures of the city budget went down from 19.5
billion rubles to 10.2 billion rubles, or by 48%; the budget deficit shrunk from 16.9% (2.8 billion rubles)
to 3.6% (.36 billion rubles) of municipal revenues.




                                                       35

        Another issue caused by inefficient management of municipal finance was lack of adequate
control over contracts registration with the treasury. In order to alleviate this, the city improved the
system of contracts registration, and now all contracts must be registered with the city treasury.

        2) For the subcomponent "Strengthening the Treasury Function": a unified account for the city
budget has been set up.

        In the course of improving the treasury budget execution system, a set of measures has been
implemented to consolidate all municipal budget revenues and municipal assets sales proceeds on one
account set up at the Federal Treasury for the city of Kazan. Based on agreements established between
regional and city administrations, as well as on a number of regulations, the city authorities monitor the
unified account of the city budget.

        Implementation of this subcomponent helped to set up a system where since 2005 100% of off-
budget revenues of public sector entities have been channeled to accounts at the municipal treasury.

        3) For the subcomponent "Improving the Municipal Procurement System":
        - procurement procedures and tender documentation have been improved;
        - the share of direct contracts established outside bidding procedure (including contracts with
natural monopolies) has come down from 55% to 25% of the total volume of municipal procurement;
        - a single registry for contracts established for municipal needs has been set up; it comprises
registries of municipal and city customers.

        The procurement procedure present at the time of the project launch lacked efficiency, in
particular, because a lot of municipal procurement of goods and services (in addition to goods and
services provided by natural monopolies) was done non-competitively. For instance, in 2003 direct
contracts accounted for 55% of the annual city budget. In addition, contracts under 200,000 rubles
(about USD 6.7 thousand) were not registered with the Committee on Economy and Industry of Kazan
(municipal procurement coordination body).

        The new law on public procurement limited the use of non-competitive procurement practices.
Given this, in order to increase transparency and cost-efficiency of municipal procurement procedure,
and to improve quality of services offered under this subcomponent, a list of organizations eligible to
enter into contracts without bidding was approved, as well as a procedure to inform the public about
municipal procurement.

        Procurement procedure and tender documentation have been amended. The amendments specify
the methodology for bids evaluation, narrow the time lag between the bids submission deadline and
opening of tenders to one hour. Besides, they specify the procedure which tender participants may use to
appeal to the Expert Commission under the head of the city administration in case of procurement
procedures violations, and also specify decisions made by the Commission including sanctions against
municipal customers that violate procurement procedures.

        The reform of municipal procurement system resulted in a reduction in the number of direct
contracts established non-competitively (including contracts for goods and services of natural
monopolies and extensions of contracts that had been established using tender procedures), - in 2005



                                                    36

they were down to 25% of the total municipal procurement volume (which exceeded the target of 35%).
Thus it is possible to assume with a degree of confidence that the city will maintain the same share of
direct contracts in the future. Thanks to centralization of municipal procurement, its procedures have
been put in order; the number of bidders per procurement contract has increased, quality of goods, works
and services has improved.

        4) For the subcomponent "Improving Municipal Property Management System":
        - the procedure to identify excessive and idle assets of municipal unitary enterprises (MUEs) and
their registration in the municipal property registry has been specified;
        - municipal property registry that records transactions with assets has been developed;
        - landmarking plan has been approved and is implemented.

        In order to maximize the city property management efficiency, a Program to Improve Efficiency
and Management of Municipal Property of Kazan was developed and approved (2004) with
participation of the Bank. The Program aims at enhancing positive impact of municipal property on
social and economic life of the city in the medium- to long run. In order to achieve the main objectives
of the Program, such as property restructuring and increasing revenues from property ownership and
management, measures have been taken to strengthen market approaches to managing municipal
property, support market infrastructure by establishing a comprehensive regulatory framework and
establish rules for the market participants interactions.

        Under this subcomponent the city set up and currently operates a registry of municipal property
where transactions with municipal property (except land lots), unitary enterprises, shares as well as
property of municipal enterprises to be privatized are recorded. In addition, a landmarking plan has
been approved and is implemented.

        In order to eliminate infrastructure constraints in managing municipal property, information on
municipal property transactions is disclosed regularly, and the registry of municipal property has been
transformed into a state-of-the-art data base.

        The city complied with all conditions related to improvements in collecting revenues from
municipal property. In particular, lease rates for the premises owned by the municipality at the time of
the loan completion were at least 90% of the market rates (compared to 50% in 2004). The number of
lease-holders eligible to preferential lease rates reduced dramatically.

        In the course of implementing this subcomponent the regulatory framework specifying land
parcels provision for design and construction as well as a competitive procedure regarding the right to
dispose of municipal property, was improved.

        5) For subcomponent "Improving Legal Framework of Social Protection":
        - powers of the authorities of the Republic of Tatarstan regarding social protection have been
transferred to the city;
        - implementation of all city social programs have been put under one municipal Directorate.

        Increased efficiency in implementing social protection programs, clear division of social support
responsibilities in Kazan among various agencies and organizations and bringing implementation of all



                                                      37

programs under a single municipal Directorate was a major achievement under this subcomponent. The
responsibility for social protection programs in Kazan was transferred to the city administration,
whereas funding was provided by categorical grants from republican and municipal budgets.
Administrative and HR capacity of the city in social protection has been strengthened, case management
is used in social protection offices, an integrated data base covering all social assistance programs has
been implemented, a comprehensive system to monitor standards of living operates successfully.

        6) For subcomponents "Increasing Transparency in Social Protection" and "Improving Targeting
in Social Assistance":
        - social benefits and housing subsidies are provided in cash using individual accounts.

        This subcomponent allowed to provide additional cash support to individuals with average per
capita income (due to reasons beyond their control) less than 75% of the subsistence level.
        Targeted social assistance to vulnerable populations in Kazan uses means testing and "municipal
contracts" with all organizations rendering social services. The subcomponent created incentives for the
unemployed to return to the labor market; procedures for targeted cash subsidies to support
kindergartens and summer camps for children were introduced. In 2006 the city budget allocated 70
million rubles to support targeted benefits to low-income individuals; in the coming years this practice
will continue.

        In 2005 a cumbersome system of in-kind benefits provided to various groups that were approved
by different governments was replaced with cash benefits. The city administration specified the
procedure of social benefits provision in Kazan, including by transfers to individual accounts, which
helps to make the social assistance system hihgly transparent.

        In 2006 the city received 870 million rubles as subventions from the regional budget to provide
cash benefits. This money was sufficient to support all payments under monetization of benefits.

        7) For subcomponent "Improving the HCS Sector Finance":
        -subsidies to heat suppliers were eliminated in the city budget;
        -the HCS sector regained financial sustainability, inter alia, thanks to pricing reform.

        Activities under this subcomponent were implemented in full compliance with objectives of the
Program to Reform the HCS Sector of Kazan approved in September 2004.

        Direct budget subsidies to heat suppliers were eliminated; the resources go to eligible
individuals. In 2006 the budget provided no subsidies. The 2007 municipal budget does not provide for
subsidies to heat suppliers either.

        The city repaid all debts of public sector entities to utilities, as well as debts of district housing
directorates (DHD) to organizations responsible for maintenance of residential properties.

        Since 2004, the authority to approve prices on housing and communal services (except electricity
and heat prices that are set by the Russian Federation and the Republic of Tatarstan) has been transferred
to the city administration; the pricing mechanism is based on full cost recovery for all heat suppliers
operating in Kazan. However, with the approval of amendments to the federal law "On Basic Provisions



                                                    38

of Price Regulation in Housing and Communal Sector" which constrain the right of municipalities to set
prices for water and sanitation services and also constrain price growth, the city failed to completely
eliminate cross-subsidies for water, sanitation and heat users, i.e. to introduce uniform pricing. Yet the
city has achieved some progress and agreed with the Bank a program to equalize prices for residential
and industrial users by 2008.

       8) For subcomponent "Increasing Competitiveness in Providing Housing and Communal
Services":
       - establish a competitive environment for service provision by privatizing all MUEs that service
residential properties;
       - establish contracts on managing municipal residential properties by non-sate managing
companies.

       In 2004 some 52% of residential properties were served by non-state contractors. In order to
promote competition in the provision of HCS services, all MUEs that serviced residential properties
were privatized. As of the end of 2006 all residential properties in Kazan were serviced by about 60
private companies, and there are 9 private managing companies on the residential properties
management market.

       During 2004-2006 more that 200 new home owners' associations (HOA) were established. In
order to promote market­bases approaches and competition in service provision, the city developed a
procedure for voluntary establishment of HOA.

       In the middle of 2006, the EBRD started to design a project aimed at reconstructing Kazan
"Vodokanal" facilities and improving management of city water supply and drainage. The EBRD
project is to finance priority capital investments of the "Vodokanal", to support its corporate
development to improve infrastructure of municipal water supply and sanitation, improve the quality of
service, improve the pricing mechanism and explore possible corporatization options.

       Overall, the project outcomes helped the city to develop clear and transparent procedures for
implementing local self-governance, improving management of the budget and social sector in the city.
The fact that over the past two years local self-governance has made a major leap forward and now this
experience is regarded as one of the most successful cases of urban development in the Russian
Federation is admitted by numerous delegations from Russian regions and other Russian municipalities.
A significant boost in investment appeal of the capital of the Republic of Tatarstan should also be
emphasized, and successful Annual Meetings of the EBRD held in Kazan in May 2007 as well as MoUs
with IBRD and EBRD testify to this. The project was instrumental in turning Kazan into one of the
leaders in local self-government in Russia.
