the Kazan Municipal\n            Development Project for Russian Federation were as follows:\n            outcome was highly satisfactory; risk to the development\n            outcome was low; Bank performance was satisfactory; and\n            Borrower performance was highly satisfactory. Lessons\n            learned from the projects included: once-off grant funding\n            at the sub national level can be used to compensate\n            municipalities for the larger losses they may incur through\n            reduced fiscal transfers. As long as the cost of the grant\n            funding to the higher level government is below that of the\n            transfers it made before, the net fiscal effect of the\n            subsidy for the country or region will be positive. To\n            strengthen city management in transition economies, bringing\n            younger and innovative staff on board as well as deploying\n            experienced and traditional staff, can help form the dynamic\n            local teams and leadership needed. A city's single\n            celebratory event, with the municipal pride it engenders,\n            can be used by the Bank and Borrower as an opportunity to\n            start reform. The special occasion can also serve as a\n            pretext for exceptional grant financing, without undermining\n            medium term financial reform. In Kazan the occasion was the\n            city millennium. In other cities, it can be hosting a major\n            trade, sporting or cultural event."}, "docdt": "2008-03-03T00:00:00Z"}
