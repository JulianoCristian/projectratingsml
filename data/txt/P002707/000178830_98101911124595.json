11,000 ha of existing plantations, and\n            for the development of infrastructure and forest services\n            within the project area. Specifically, the project would\n            provide for the afforestation of a total of 15,750 ha of\n            pulpwood plantations, surveying of the area to be planted,\n            the establishment of nurseries, ground preparation, weeding,\n            silvicultural treatment and disease control. In addition,\n            some 330 ha within the designated sawlog area would be\n            replanted during the project; 8,800 ha of existing pulpwood\n            plantations and of about 2,500 ha of sawlog plantations\n            would be maintained; some 164 km of primary and secondary\n            roads and 393 km of tracks would be constructed; staff\n            housing and 20 administrative and social buildings would be\n            established; and financing for research, training and\n            studies would be provided."}, "docdt": "1976-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
