In\n            contrast, the Rural Development III Project was designed as\n            a smaller, low cost, quick maturing program that would\n            benefit large numbers of low income rural dwellers. In both\n            cases, the implementation experience was cut short by the\n            serious ethnic conflict which erupted in July 1983 between\n            the Sinhalese and Tamil parts of the population. The\n            conflict spread with increasing intensity from the northern\n            part of the country to the east, eventually forcing the Bank\n            to cancel the loan/credits for both projects. For this\n            reason, the present report deviates from the guidelines\n            usually followed in preparing project completion reports.\n            There was little implementation and there were no apparent\n            benefits, and it would serve no useful purpose to speculate\n            how preparation, design, Bank or Borrower performance would\n            have affected project results had the projects gone forward.\n            The main lesson learned from this project was that the Bank\n            acted prudently, with the Government's best interests\n            in mind and taking into account the broader political ramifications."}, "docdt": "1991-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
