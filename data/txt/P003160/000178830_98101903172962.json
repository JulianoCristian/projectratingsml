The total cost of the program\n            excluding interest during construction, is about $99\n            million, of which about $20 million is for the transmission\n            system in Zambia and about $30 million for the system in\n            Southern Rhodesia. The project proposed for bank financing\n            is confined to the construction of the Kariba North\n            generating station in Zambia. The station will have an\n            installed capacity of 600 MW, to be provided by four 150 MV\n            turbo generating units, the first to be in operation by June\n            1974 and the fourth unit by June 1975. The station will be\n            designed so that capacity could be subsequently increased to\n            900 MW."}, "docdt": "1970-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
