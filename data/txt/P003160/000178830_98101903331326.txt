APPRAISAL OF KARIBA NORTH HYDROFELCTRIC STATIOII
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report covers the appraisal of a project of the Kariba
North Bank Company Limited (KNBC) which is wholly owned by the Govern-
ment of Zambia.  The Project consists of a 600  ZW hydroelectric station
on the North Bank of the Zambezi River at Kariba in Zambia. The output
of the station would be fed into the transmission system of the Central
African Power Corporation (CAPC) which is jointly owned by Zambia and
Southern Rhodesia, and which supplies nearly all of the power require-
ments of the two countries.
ii.       The Project is urgently required to enable CAPC to meet increas-
ing demands on its system. In Zambia adequate supplies of power are vital
to the economy of the country since the copper industry, which accounts for
about hO% of the gross domestic product, is a very large user of power.
iii.      The estimated cost of the Project is equivalent to about US$48 mil-
lion. The Zambian Government has asked the Bank to make a loan of US$h0 mil-
lion equivalent to KNBC to finance the estimated foreign exchange cost and
interest during construction on the Bank loan. The Project is the least cost
way of providing the required additional generating capacity. The incre-
mental financial rate of return on the Project would be about 17%.
iv.       The Bank made a loan of US$80 million in 1956 to finance part of
the cost of the first stage of Kariba, consisting of a dam across the Zam-
bezi River, a 705 MW power station on the South Bank (in Southern Rhodesia)
and a 330 kV transmission system. It made another loan of US$7.7 million
to CAPC in 1964 to finance part of the cost of transmission expansion in
Zambia. Both loans were completely drawn down and the projects are opera-
ting satisfactorily.
v.        In normal circumstances CAPC would construct the Project and carry
out needed expansion of its transmission system and the Bank would make a
loan to CAPC to help finance the work. Because such an approach is not pos-
sible at the present time, the Zambian Government has established KNBC to
construct the Project.  KNBC will appoint CAPC as its agent for construc-
tion and will lease the station to CAPC after it is completed. CAPC will
make a loan to KNBC to cover the local costs of construction and it will
finance the whole of the cost of the expansion of its transmission system in
Zambia and Southern Rhodesia during the next six years.
vi.       The proposed Bank loan would be guaranteed by the Government of
Zambia. To meet the Governmentts request that its responsibilities as
guarantor under the existing Kariba loans and the proposed Bank loan will
not exceed 50% of the total loan amounts and thus continue the present
arrangements for the equal sharing of guarantees by Zambia and Southern
Rhodesia, the Bank would, on making the loan, release Zambia from its



- ii -
guarantee obligations on parts of the existing loans, after an agreed
date (but not before July 1, 1973) in order to maintain the equal sharing.
The existing loans would continue to be backed by a United Kingdom guaran-
tee.
vii.      Because of the Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) by
Southern Rhodesia in 1965, the Board of CAPC and the Higher Authority for
Power, which has to approve major decisions of CAPC, are not considered
legally constituted by the Zambian Government and cannot function effec-
tively. To give effect to the above arrangements both should be able to
function effectively. The United Kingdom Government has made an Order-in-
Council which will permit the Government to appoint two members to the
Authority.  This will permit the Authority to function effectively and
to take action which will enable the Board of CAPC to also function
effectively.
viii.     At the end of the construction period, KNBC's sole asset will be
the North Bank Station, on which the annual depreciation will equal the
amortization on the proposed Bank and CAPC loans. KNBC's gross income,
which will be paid by CAPC in the form of rent, will be the sum of the
debt service on its loans and reasonable administration expenses. During
the period June 30, 1970, to June 30, 1976, the consolidated net fixed
assets of CAPC and KNBC will increase from K142 million (US$199 million)
to K185 million (US$259 million), an increase of 30%. The overall
financial position of CAPC and KNBC will be satisfactory; the rate of
return on combined net fixed assets in operation will be about 9% in
1975/76, and the debt/equity ratio as at June 30, 1976, 58/42.  CAPC will
also have built up funds amounting to about K13 million (US$18 million)
which could be used to assist in financing the next stage of development.
ix.       Satisfactory agreement having been reached regarding the matters
summarized in paragraphs 7.01 and 7.02 of this report, the Project is
suitable for a Bank loan of US$h0 million equivalent to KMBC for a term of
25 years, including a grace period of 5 years.

APPRAISAL OF KARIBA NORTH HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report covers the appraisal of a project of the Kariba North
Bank Company Limited (KNBC) which is wholly owned by the Government of Zam-
bia. The Project consists of a hydroelectric station on the North Bank of
the Zambezi River at Kariba in Zambia with an installed capacity of 600 MW.
The estimated cost of the Project is equivalent to about US$48 million.
The Bank has been asked by the Government of Zambia to make a loan of US$40
million equivalent to KNBC to cover the foreign exchange cost and interest
during construction on the Bank loan. The Project will be part of the second
stage of the Kariba development.
1.02      The Bank made a loan (No. 145-RN) of us$80 million to the Federal
Power Board (tile predecessor of the Central African Power Corporation (CAPC))
in 1956 to finance part of the cost of the first stage of Kariba.  The first
stage, corsisting of an arch dam across the Zambezi River, a 705 MW power
station on the South Bank in Southern Rhodesia and 330 kV transmission sys-
tem, commenced supplying power in December 1959 and was completed in 1962.
In October 1964 a loan (No. 392-RNS) of US$7.7 million was made to CAPO to
finance part of the cost of transmission expansion in Zambia. Both loans
have been drawn down and both projects are operating satisfactorily.
1.03      Zambia is a landlocked country with a population of about 4 mil-
lion and an area of some 290,600 square miles. It is bordered on the north
by the Democratic Republic of the Congo, on the east by Tanzania and Malawi,
on the south by Mozambique, Southern Rhodesia and South West Africa, and on
the west by Angola. Mlost of the country consists of a high plateau with an
elevation of 3,000 to 4,000 ft above sea level, which is intersected by the
deep valleys of the Zambezi River and its main tributaries, the Kafue and
Luangwa Rivers.
1.04      The lifeline of the country is the railroad which runs from Living-
stone in the south on the Southern Rhodesian border to the Copperbelt near
the Congolese border in the north. MIost of the modern sector of the econom'
and a large part of the population are concentrated in areas near the rail-
road. The production of copper dominates the economy of Zambia. It accounrt3
for about 40% of the gross domestic product, about 95% of total exports
which are shipped mostly by rail to Beira in Mozambique or tobito in Angola,
and provides more than 60% of recurrent government revenue. During the
period 1962 to 1969 copper output increased at an average rate of over 4%
per annum and during the next five years an average increase of 3% per annDItD
is forecast. The Government considers this forecast to be conservative.
It now has a 51% participation in existing mining companies and wants to
increase production more rapidly and it is endeavoring to get foreign inter-
ests to start new mining ventures.
1.05      Adequate supplies of electric power are vital to the economy of
Zambia since the copper industry is a very large user.  Consumption in t:he
Copperbelt during 1968/69 was nearly 3,000 GWh, about 92% of the total con-
sumption in Zambia;  it is likely to reach about 5,000 GHh during 1975,/'6.



- 2 -
1.o6      The CAPC, which is jointly owned and operated by Southern Rhodesia
and Zambia, supplies power in bulk to undertakings distributing electricity
in both countries (see map). During 1968/69 sales by CAPC in Zambia
amounted to 3,237 GWh and in Southern Rhodesia to 2,429 GlWh. It supplies
nearly all of Zambia's requirements by generating stations (Kariba South
and thermal stations) situated in Southern Rhodesia.  Less than 10%o is
supplied by generating stations located in Zambia. To meet increasing
system demand, CAPC requires additional generating capacity in service by
June 1974 and an expansion of its transmission system.
1.07      Although the Zambian Government is aware of the benefits obtained
from CAPC's integrated system, it is concerned that should supply from
Southern Rhodesia be discontinued or curtailed its economy would be seri-
ously affected. It is, therefore, most anxious to have generating capacity
in Zambia sufficient to meet its own demand should such an occasion arise.
With this object in view, it commenced in 1966 the construction of two
hydroelectric stations at Victoria Falls, with a total installed capacity
of 100 NW, and another hydroelectric station at Kafue with an installed
capacity of 600 IlW early in 1967.  The output of these stations would be
purchased by CAPC and fed into its transmission system. Because of lack
of storage at Kafue its firm output will be small and the combined output
in 1972, when all three stations are scheduled to be in operation, would
meet less than half of Zambia's requirements. To achieve its objective
and to provide the additional generating capacity required by CAPC, the
Zambian Government wants to proceed with the construction of Kariba
North as soon as possible.
1.08      In normal circumstances CAPC would construct the Kariba North
Station and carry out the expansion of its transmission system and the
Bank would make a loan to assist in financing the work. Because of the
UInilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) by Southern Rhodesia in
November 1965, the above arrangemei.s cannot be followed at the present
time. Other arrangements have been worked out which include the establish-
ment of KNBC to construct the Kariba North Station. KNBC will appoint
CAPC as its agent for construction and will subsequently lease the station
to CAPC which will operate and maintain it. CAPC will make a loan to
KNBC to cover the local cost of the construction of the station and it
will finance the total cost of transmission development during the next
six years. The history of events leading up to these arrangements is
given in Annex 1.
1.09      At the present time the Board of CAPC and the Higher Authority
for Power (see paragraph 6 of Annex 1), which has to approve major deci-
sions of CAPC, are not considered legally constituted by the Zambian
Government and cannot function effectively. To give effect to the above
arrangements the Board and the Authority must be able to function effec-
tively since they should both approve capital expenditure on the Project,
and the transmission expansion program, and the proposed Loan to KNBC.
The Board should also approve and sign agreements with KNBC covering
Agency and Lease Arrangements and the proposed CAPC loan (see paragraph



- 3 -
1.10      The Higher Authority for Power, which should consist of two
Ministers appointed by the Zambian Government and two by the Southern
Rhodesian Government, cannot function because all decisions have to be
unanimous and the Zambian members do not recognize the ministers appointed
by the Smith regime in Southern Rhodesia. The Board of CAPC should have a
Chairman and seven members. Three of the members should be appointed by
the Zambian Government, three by the Southern Rhodesian Government and the
Chairman and one member by the Higher Authority for Power. A quorum of
five members is required.  The terms of office of the Chairman, the
Southern Rhodesian members appointed before UDI and the member appointed
by the Higher Authority have expired and the Board is without a quorum
and is unable to exercise its statutory functions. Day-to-day operations
are carried out under a Committee consisting of the three Zambian members,
the three Southern Rhodesian members and the Chairman who has remained in
function after his legal term of office expired.
1.11      The United Kingdom Government has made an Order-in-Council
which will permit the Government to appoint two members to the Higher
Authority in place of the Ministers to be appointed by the Southern
Rhodesian Government. Before the Order-in-Council can be made operative
it will be necessary for the Zambian Government to have taken legislative
action regarding the change in membership of the Authority. As the
Zambian Parliament is presently in recess and does not meet until Septem-
ber 1970 the United Kingdom Order-in-Council will not be operative until
October 1, 1970.
1.12      After the Order-in-Council has become operative and two members
have been appointed to the Higher Authority by the United Kingdom Govern-
ment, the Authority would be able to appoint a Chairman and a Board member.
The Board would then have a quorum of five members, and could approve the
Agency, Lease and Loan Agreements with KNBC. The execution of the three
agreements would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed Bank
loan to KNBC.
1.13      This report is based on information obtained from the Zambian
and United Kingdom Governments, the CAPC and its Consultants (Merz and
McLellan, Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners of London, and Coyne et Bellier
of Paris), the results of many meetings and discussions and the findings
of an appraisal mission, consisting of Messrs. C.H. White and A.A.M.
Onslow, which visited Zambia in M4arch 1970.



2. THE POVER SECTOR
2.01      CAPC supplies nearly all of the power requirements of Zambia and
Southern Rhodesia. CAPC is well managed and efficiently operated by a
competent and experienced staff. It has only five consumers. Four of
these are public supply undertakings, namely, the Southern Rhodesia
Electricity Supply Commission (SRESC), the Bulawayo MTunicipality and the
Salisbury Yunicipality, in Southern Rhodesia, and the Central Electricity
Corporation (CEC) in Zambia. The fifth consumer is the Copperbelt Power
Company (CPC) which supplies the Copperbelt area in Zambia.
2.02      The SRESC is responsible for power supply throughout Southern
Rhodesia, except for a few isolated areas which have their own small
generating stations, and the areas supplied by the Bulawayo and Salisbury
Miunicipalities.
2.03      In Zambia, in addition to the CEC wthich supplies Lusaka and the
surrounding area, and the CPC, there are two small Government-owned
undertakings. These are the Victoria Falls Electricity Board which supplies
the Livingstone area and the town of Victoria Falls in Southern Rhodesia, and
the Northern Electricity Supply Corporaticn which supplies small tcwrs and
villages in isolated areas by diesel generating stations, which have a
combined capacity of about 11 MW.
2.04      The Zambian Government has recently established the Zambia
Electricity Supply Corporation Ltd. (ZESCO) to take over existing supply
undertakings in Zambia, other than CAPC and KNBC, and to be responsible
for all aspects of the generation, transmission and supply of electricity
other than those carried out by the above-mentioned two authorities.
2.05      The General lIanager of ZESCO is M. P.A. Bertrand from Electricit4y
de France who has had many years of experience in the supply industry.
Staff of the Government Electricity Department and of the Authorities to
be taken over will be transferred to ZESCO and other staff will be re-
cruited. ZESCO will take over from the Government Electricity Department,
a 60 114W station in operation and another 40 14W station under construction
at Victoria Falls and the Kafue hydroelectric project presently under
construction. The output of these stations will be purchased by CAPC from
ZESCO. It is expected the Victoria Falls Electricity Board, the Northern
Electricity Supply Corporation, the CEC, and the Government Electricity
Department will be taken over by ZESCO in July or August 1970.
Generating Capacity Available to CAPC
2.06      The CAPC owns only one generating plant, the 705 14W Kariba
South Hydroelectric Station. The output of the 60 NiW station at Victoria
Falls, owned by the Government, and the output of an 8 SW hydroelectric
station (except for a small amount of power required to meet local needs),
owned by the Victoria Falls Electricity Board, are purchased by CAPC and



fed into its transmission system. CAPC also purchases power from Oecomin,
a mining company in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. At the present
time CAPC can take up to 60 YiW from Gecomin, to be reduced to 40 NW in
1971 and 20 14 in 1972 when the contract expires.
2.07      The Bulawayo and Salisbury Municipalities and the SRESC in
Southern Rhodesia and the CPC in Zambia each have thermal stations which
supply CAPC's system. The CEC also has a small station (12 MW) at Liusaka,
which could supply CAPC's system, but it is not used as it is old and expen-
sive to operate. The operations of the above-mentioned stations are
controlled by CAPC which meets their fixed and operating costs (see para-
graph 6.11). The combined effective capacity of the thermal stations
(excluding Lusaka) is 451 N4W.
2.08      ]he total generating capacity presently available to CAPC is:
Kariba South              705 MW
Victoria Falls             68  "
Gecomin                    60
Thermal Stations          451
_L,~28h I
2.09      A table showing available generating capacity and the capacity
required to meet expected system demand and energy requirements during
the period 1968/69 through 1979/80 is attached as Annex 5. At the present
time the capacity available is more than sufficient to meet system demand.
Provided the Victoria Falls 40 MW station is completed on schedule and the
Kafue project commences providing power not later than December 1971
(6 months later than the present scheduled date) sufficient capacity should
be available to meet system demand and energy requirements up to late 1974.
Additional capacity would then be required, otherwise a deficit of 100 MW
could be expected in 197h/75. If a supply is given to Gecomin (see
paragraph 4.C6) the expected deficit would be increased to 168 nlW.
Development Program
2.10      CAPC's development program for the period July 1, 1969, through
June 30, 1976, consists of:
(a) the Kariba North Hydroelectric Station (the Bank Project)
with an installed capacity of 600 NW;
(b) the expansion of the 330 kV transmission system in Zambia
which includes the installation of additional substation
capacity at Kitwe and Leopard's Hill and the construction
of additional transmission lines between Leopard's Hill
and Kitwe substation (see map);
(c) the expansion in Southern Rhodesia of the 330 kV transmis-
sion system, which includes the construction of new



-6-
substations at Alaska and G^welo, the installation of
additional capacity in substations at Sherwood, Bulawayo
and Norton, and the construction of additional 330 kV
transmission lines between Kariba and Norton and between
Sherwood and Bulawayo (see map).
The estimated cost of this program is about US$99 million excluding inter-
est during construction.    The transmission expansion is to be financed
by CAPC almost entirely from internally generated funds (paragraphs 6.14
and 6.15).
2.11      The Kariba North Project is scheduled to have its first genera-
ting unit in operation in June 1974 and all units in operation by June
1975 (see paragraph 3.01). Provided this is accomplished and the trans-
mission expansion is completed on schedule, CAPC should have sufficient
generating and transmission capacity to meet system requirements, based
on present forecasts, up to 1977/78. Additional generating capacity and
transmission facilities would then be required and these should be provid-
ed by the second stage of the Kafue Hydroelectric Scheme and the further
expansion of CAPC's transmission system.  Although it would be possible
to install another 300 ]M of generating capacity at Kariba North this
could not be considered as an alternative to the second stage of Kafue
as the additional capacity would provide very little firm power. Plans
have not yet been made for the construction of the second stage of Kafue.
To have it in operation by 1977/78, a decision will have to be made
early in 1972 for construction work to start in 1973/74.

3. THE PROJECT
3.01      The Project proposed for Bank financing consists of an under-
grcund power station on the North Bank of the Zambezi River at Kariba in
Zambia, with an installed capacity of 600 MW. The station will be de-
signed so that the capacity could be subsequently increased to 900 MW. The
initial generating plant will consist of four 150 Iti turbo-generators.  The
turbine would be of the vertical-shaft Francis type and will utilize an
average net operating head of about 305 feet. The first 150 MW generating
unit is scheduled to be in service by June 1974, the second in October 1974,
the third in February 1975 and the fourth in June 1975. These dates are
realistic.
Estimated Cost
3.02      The estimated cost of the proposed Project is the equivalent of
US$47.7 million. The estimated cost of the principal features of the Pro-
ject is shown in the following table. A more detailed breakdown of costs
is given in Annex 2.

Basis for Cost Estimates
3.03      In preparing the cost estimates the Consultants were guided by
the costs of similar civil works (the Kafue project) now under construc-
tion in Zambia and by their knowledge of working conditions in Zambia.
The costs of plant and equipment are based on prices recently obtained
as the result of international competitive bidding for similar plant
and equipment.
3.04      To cover increases in cost due to any difficulties which might
arise during the construction of the Project, and unforeseen extras,
contingency allowances of 20% on civil works and 6% on plant and equip-
ment have been included in the estimate. Following an investigation
by the Consultants, an allowance for price increases at the rate of 2.4%
per annum on labor and materials has also been included.
3.05      The cost estimate and the contingency and price allowances
are realistic.
Unit Costs and Generating Costs
3.C6      The estimated cost of the 600 SW Kariba North Station (US$h7.7
million) is equivalent to a cost of only US$79.50 per kW installed. This
very low cost is due in part to the fact that many required facilities
were installed with the Kariba South Station.
3.07      In 1975/76 when Kariba North is expected to be in full opera-
tion the capability of the Kariba South Station may be slightly less
than its present capability of 705 INT because the net available head
may be reduced due to a rise in tailwater level and a small reduction
in the average level of the reservoir. To take account of these possi-
bilities the capability of Kariba South has been tentatively reduced to
666 HIJ (see Annex 5).
3.08      Taking the above reduction into account, the combined capa-
bility of the North and South Stations would be 1,266 MW. The cost of
the two stations is estimated at about US$196 million, equal to US$155
per kW, which is a low cost for hydroelectric capacity.
3.09      During the year ending June 30, 1976, the combined output of
the North and South Stations is expected to reach the estimated annual
average output of 8,500 GIh.  The estimated cost per kWh produced
during this year is about 1.74 US mills, which is very low cost power.
Status of Engineering
3.10      The Project has been planned and is being designed by Merz and
McLellan and Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners of London, and Coyne et
Bellier of Paris, wJho were the consultants for the first stage of the
Kariba development. The Consultants will supervise the construction of
the Project. With the approval of the Bank an invitation to contractors
to apply for prequalification for the main civil works was advertised iC



- 9 -
February 1970. Twenty-four firms submitted applications and twelve of
these have been approved.  Contract documents and specifications for the
generating plant (2 contracts) and for the main civil works are scheduled
to be issued in June 1970 and contracts awarded by January 1 and January 31,
1971, respectively.
Procurement and Disbursement
3.11      Procurement will be on the basis of international competitive
bidding except for items involving expenditures of less than US$10,000,
which would be procured on the basis of other procedures to be approved
by the Bank. Disbursements from the proposed loan would be made only for
the foreign exchange cost of plant and equipment, materials, services and
erection, and civil works contracts. Expenditure prior to the signing of
the loan would not be eligible for reimbursement. Any unutilized balance of
the loan at the completion of the Project should be cancelled.

4. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
4.ol      Sales by CAPC during the past four years have increased from
4,237 GWh in 1964/65 to 5,666 GXh in 1968/69 at an average rate of 7.5%
per annum. During the period sales in Zambia increased from 2,445 GWh
to 3,237 GXTh and in Southern Rhodesia from 1,792 GMTh to 2,429 GWh.
The rate of increase has, however, been very uneven (see Annex 3).
4.02      In Southern Rhodesia, the increase in sales by CAPO was very
small during the two years after the unilateral declaration of independence.
In 1967/68 a considerable amount of industrial development resulted in
a 17.3% increase in sales, followed by an increase of 9.8% in 1968/69.
4.03      In Zambia, sales to the Copperbelt Power Company in 1966/67
showed only a 2.7% increase over the previous year. This was due to a
reduction in mining activities because of difficulties experienced in
the transportation of copper for export resulting from Southern Rhodesia's
declaration of independencee However the average rate of increase for
the past four years was 6.5% per annum.
4.04      Sales to CAPC's other consumer in Zambia, the CEC, which
supplies the Lusaka area, increased at the very high rate of 21.1% per
annum over the past four years. This was due to the rapid growth of the
city after Zambia became independent in October 1964 and the industrial
development which is taking place.
Forecast of Sales
4.05      The CAPC's forecast of sales for the years 1969/70 through
1979/80 broken down into sales to each of its five consumers is shown
in Annex 3. The forecast shows that during the period sales are expected
to increase at an average rate of 8.5% and amount to 13,749 GWh in
1979/80. Because of the situation in the area the forecast of sales
is of course subject to some risk but as it is conservative it is
considered reasonable and acceptable. A summary of the forecast is
given in the following table:
Forecast of Sales (GWh)
Total.
Consumer         Bulawayo      Salisbury   SRESC       CPC     CEC      Sales

1979/80               729        1,152      4,768    6,163      937     13,4Q

4.o6      Gecomin, a mining company in the Democratic Republic of th,e
Congo which presently supplies a small amount of power to CAPC under
an agreement which terminates in 1972, has asked for a supply of up to



- 11 -
1O  NT from CAPC during the years 1972/73 through 1976/77 (see Annex 4).
As negotiations for this supply are in an early stage and as a tariff
has not yet been discussed, possible revenues from sales to Gecomin have
not been included in CAPC's financial forecast (see paragraph 6.12).
4;07      Sales to the Bulawayo and Salisbury Municipalities in Southern Rho-
desia during the period are expected to increase at an average rate of 6.8%
and 4.9% respectively, but sales to SRESO are expected to increase at
the much higher rate of 11.8%. This is due mainly to a very big increase
in sales in 1971/72 and 1972/73 when a large fertilizer factory, now
under construction, comes into operation, and to a considerable increase
in 1975/76 when consumers in the eastern districts presently supplied
by local generating plants are connected to the SRESC system.
4.08     Sales to the CPC in Zambia during the period are expected to
increase from 3,193 GWh in 1969/70 to 6,163 GWh in 1979/80 at an average
rate of 6.8% per annum. This increase is based on a number of factors,
such as:
(a) an increase in copper production. The planned increase is
relatively small. The mining companies are reluctant to
disclose production estimates, but as far as can be ascer-
tained the increase is probably about 3% per annum.
(b) the need to mine lower grade ores at deeper levels.
Mainly because of this, electricity consumption per ton of
copper produced increased from 2,h50 kWh in 1959/60 to
3,182 kWh in 1968/69 and this trend is expected to continue.
(c) the installation of new processes, which include a fur-
nace at the Mufulira mine, and a leach plant at Nchanga
which will require 25 vrT and 15 SW respectively.
(d) the opening up of new mining areas, and an increase of
about 7% per annum in bulk supplies to municipalities and
townships in the Copperbelt.
Taking the above factors into consideration, the forecasts of sales to
CPC are considered acceptable. They may in fact be on the low side as
the Zambian Government wants the copper mines to increase production at
a higher rate.
4.09      Sales to CEC in Zambia during the period under consideration
are expected to increase at the high average rate of 13.1% per annum.
During 1969/70 the rate of increase is expected to be 66% because of
new industrial loads being connected. Sales for the first nine months
of the year indicate this rate of increase will be achieved. In view
of the industrial expansion which is taking place in the CEC area of
supp'y, the forecast of sales is considered acceptable.



- 12 -
Growth in Demand and Energy Requirements
4.10      During the year 1968/69 the demand on the CAPC system was 879 Mg
and energy requirements, including transmission losses, were 5,929 GWh.
The system load factor was 77% which is very high. This is due mainly
to the copper mines in Zambia which operate on a 24-hour basis. The
load factor of the Zambian system was 84% and that of the Southern Rhodesian
system 69%.
4.11      During the period 1969/70 through 1979/80 the system demand is
expected to increase and reach about 2,150 iW in 1979/80. Energy
requirements, including transmission losses, during this year are
expected to amount to about 14,500 GWh. The load factor of the system
is expected to remain about 77%. An amount of 18% of system demand is
included in Annex 4 as a reserve to cover spinning reserve, breakdowns,
and planned outages of generating plant. This amount may appear a
little high but, in view of the fact that during recent years some
trouble has been experienced with the Kariba South turbines (hairline
cracks have appeared in the runners) and taking into account the age of
the thermal plant in Rhodesia and teething troubles that may be experi-
enced with new plant at Victoria Falls, Kafue and Kariba North, it is
reasonable.
Alternative Means of Providing Additional Generating Capacity
4.12      There are three possible ways of providing the additional
generating capacity needed for the CAPC by late 1974, at the same time
meeting the Zambian Government's requirement that sufficient capacity
should be available in Zambia to meet the power requirements of the
country should the need arise (see paragraph 1.07). These are:
(a) the construction of a thermal station in Zambia;
(b) the construction of the Kariba North Project followed by
the second stage of Kafue;
(c) the construction of the second stage of Kafue followed
by the Kariba North Project.
4.13      The construction of a thermal power station in Zambia with a
capacity of 600 MET as a possible alternative to the Kariba North Project
was investigated by CAPCts Consultants. The estimated cost of the
station is US$90 million (excluding interest during construction) some
US$42 million more than Kariba North. As the cost of operating the thermal
plant would also be far higher than the operation of Kariba North, such
a station could not be considered as an alternative to Kariba North.
4.14      A comparison of alternatives (b) and (c) shows that it is
more advantageous to construct Kariba North first followed by the second
stage of Kafue, since the estimated cost of Kafue is higher than that
of Kariba North (US$63.7 million compared with US$47.7 million) and
the estimated firm output of the two schemes is about the same. This



- 13 -
arrangement would be more advantageous at all discount rates; at 7%
it shows a saving of US$8.8 million, which would increase with higher
discount rates.
Incremental Rate of Return
4.15      The incremental financial rate of return on the proposed Project
is about 17%. The cost stream made for this calculation includes the
capital cost of the Project plus the cost of additional transmission
facilities attributable to the Project. The revenue stream was calculated
by multiplying the incremental kWh sales attributable to the Project by
the estimated average price per kTTh sold.
Other Benefits
4.16      Apart from the need to construct the Kariba North Station to
provide additional generating capacity, there is another reason why the
Project should be constructed as soon as possible: this is to alleviate
the need for the systematic spilling of water not needed for power pro-
duction at Kariba, the effects of which are causing concern.
4.17      Spilling, which now takes place during four or five months of
each year, is affecting the stability of the banks downstream of the dam,
particularly the South Bank, and is causing enlargement of the stilling
pool. Although sealing work on the banks and underwater has improved the
situation, there is still a possibility that a deep-seated slide on the
South Bank could develop; the Consultants consider this unlikely, but if
it should occur the power station tailrace tunnels could be blocked,
causing the generating plant to be shut down. To avoid such a possibility
the Consultants recommend the need for systematic spilling should be
obviated as soon as possible. The Bank and CAPC agree with this recommen-
dation.
4.18      The Project would have no other environmental consequences for
it would not alter the characteristics of Lake Kariba or the regime of
the Zambezi River, except for slightly lowering the average level of the
lake and evening out the river flow below the dam. The environment was
significantly affected some twelve years ago when the dam was constructed
and the lake created. The most important environmental impact of the
Kariba development was the relocation of about 55,000 Africans whose
villages were flooded by the lake. The dam also interfered with tradi-
tional agriculture along the river which was based on the annual floods.
In recent years an increase in bilharzia has been noted. There were
also some environmental benefits - a reduction of tsetse fly migration,
making tsetse control easier, flood control, and the creation of a poten-
tial for the development of tourism and fisheries. Although the environ-
mental costs of the Kariba development have not been quantified, the
benefits of the Kariba development to the economies of Zambia and Southern
Rhodesia have been considerable and judged more than sufficient to outweigh
such costs.

5. THE BORROWER
5.o1     The Kariba North Bank Company Limited (KNBC) was registered
as a private limited company under the laws of Zambia with a nominal
share capital of K100 (US$140) in March 1970, after the Memorandum and
Articles of Association of the Company had been agreed to by the CAPC
and the Bank. The capital of the Conpany is divided into one hundred
shares of one kwacha each. Ninety-nine shares are held by the Minister
of Development and Finance and one by the Minister of Power, Transport
and kbrks. Although the objects of the Company are very wide it intends
to confine its activities to the establishment of the Kariba North
Station, the proposed Bank Project.
5.02     The Articles of Association of the Company require that the
number of Directors shall be not less than five or more than ten.
Directors may be appointed and removed from office at any time by the
majority shareholder of the Company (the Minister for Development and
Finance).  Nine Directors have been appointed of whom one, Mr. E. M.
Shepherd, is the General 1Manager of CAPC.
5.03     KNBC will appoint CAPC as its agent for the construction of
the station and it will lease it to CAPC which will operate it. As a
charge for the lease of the station, CAPO will pay to KNBC amounts
equal to the interest and redemption payment due by ICNBC on all loans
made to it for the construction of the station plus all reasonable
administrative costs of KNBC.
5.04     The senior staff of KNBC will consist only of a Managing
Director or General Manager, a Financial Controller and a Secretary.
The Managing Director or General Mlanager designate is Mr. A. J. Davidson,
the Zambian Government's Director of Electrical Engineering, who is
acceptable to the Bank. A person suitable to fill the post of Controller
has been located and is being recruited. The duties of Secretary will
probably be carried out by an Assistant Secretary in the Ministry of
Power, Transport and Works on a part-time basis. The duties of the
Managing Director or General Manager will include advising the Board on
the award of construction contracts. The Financial Controller will be
responsible for the maintenance of proper accounting records of the
company and preparation of quarterly and annual accounts. He will also
be responsible for withdrawals from the proposed Bank aid CAPC loans.
Assurance has been obtained from KNBC that it will consult the Bank
before making appointments to the post  of Managing Director or General
Manager.
5.05     CAPC has agreed to make a loan to KNBC to cover the local cost
of the Project. Draft agreements covering the Agency and Lease arrange-
ments and the proposed loan by CAPC to KNEC have been approved by the
Zambian Government, the Committee of CAPC, and the Bank. The signing
of these documents is a condition of effectiveness of the proposed Bank
loan. The draft loan agreement between CAPC and KNBC contains a covenant



- 15 -
that requires KN\BC not to enter into any activity other than the
establishment of the Kariba North Station, during the life of the loan
(25 years), without written permission of CAPC. Similar assurances have
been obtained by the Bank from KNBC. Assurance has also been obtained
that KNBC will not amend the Agency, Lease and Loan Agreements with CAPC
without the prior approval of the Bank.

It is proposed that the foreign exchange cost of the Project would be
financed by a loan from the Bank of US$40 million (X28.6 million), and the
local currency by a loan from CAPC of n22.2 million (US$17.1 million). It
is assumed that both loans uould be for 25 years, with a grace period of
about five years, during which the interest would be financed. It is also
assumed that interest on both loans would be at the rate of 7% per annum,
and, in the case of the Bank loan only, there would be a commitment charge
of 3/4% per annum on the undisbursed balance of the loan. During negotia-
tions, the Zambian Government agreed to provide, on terms satisfactory to
the Bank, any additional funds necessary to complete the Project.



- 16 -
5.07     It is estimated that KNBC will earn 7.1% on its net fixed assets
in operation 1975/76.  However, since it is presently envisaged that KNBC
will engage in no project other than the Kariba North Station and since
the lease agreement between KNBC and CAPC will require CAPC to meet all
INBC's costs (see paragraph 5.03), it is considered a rate covenant would
be   inappropriate.  (Additional earnings from the Project will, of course,
accrue to the Zambian Goverrmient through its 50% interest in CAPC.) KNBC
has therefore agreed that the lease agreement will not be amended without
prior approval of the Bank (see paragraph 5.05). To ensure that its
financial position will remain sound, assurances have been obtained from
KNBC that it will not borrow any funds additional to those provided for
in the financing plan (paragraph 5.06).
Guarantees
5.o8     The proposed loan of US$40 million to KNBC would be guaranteed
by the Zambian Government. Under the original arrangements contemplated
for financing Stage II of the Kariba Project, a loan to CAPC would have
been guaranteed as to 50% by Zambia and 50% by Southern Rhodesia.  All
concerned agree that Zambia should not be required to incur a greater
liability under the proposed arrangements than it would have incurred
under the original arrangments. The United Kingdom, which continue to
guarantee in full the existing loans, has accordingly agreed that the
Bank release Zambia of its obligations as guarantor of 50% of the dis-
counted amount of loans 145-RN and 392-INS to such an amount as will,
when taken together with Zambia's guarantee obligation under the proposed
loan, result in Zambia being responsible for no more than 50% of the
discounted total outstanding loan obligations for the Kariba system.
Both Governments have agreed that such release would take place at a date
on Which one-half of the discounted value of the payments of principal
and interest on the portions of loans 145-RN and 392-RNS held by the
Bank and by the 1btropolitan Life Insurance Company, a major participant,
would equal one-half of the discounted payments of principal and interest
on the new loan. The applicable discount rate would be the rate of
interest on the new loan.
Audit and Insurance
5.09     KNBC has not yet made any arrangement for the audit of its
accounts. During negotiations assurances were received that KNBC will
have its accounts audited annually by independent auditors acceptable
to the Bank, and that its accounts and audit reports will be submitted
to the Bank within four months of the end of KINBC's fiscal year. CAPC
is required to carry adequate insurance under the terms of its lease
from KNBC, and KNBC has agreed to a similar convenant in its loan agree-
ment with the Bpnk.

6. FINANCIAL POSITION OF CAPC
Past Operating Results and Financing of CAPC
6.01     Since CAPC will finance the local cost of the Kariba North
Project and will also be KNBC's sole customer, it is necessary to review
CAPC's past and future financial position as well as that of KiBC'.
Annex 6 shows the income statements for the four years ended June 30,
1966 through 1969, These reflect a satisfactory financial position with
a return on average net fixed assets in operation ranging from 6.4% to
8,1% (see Annex 14). This return has enabled CAPC to meet the financial
requirements of previous Bank loans, namely, for CAPC to finance 50%
of the second stage of Kariba including transmission (see paragraphs 6.13-
6.15).
Present Financial Position
6.02     Annex 8 shows CAPC's Balance Sheets for the years ended June 30,
1966 through 1969. The Balance Sheet of June 30, 1969 can be summarized
as follows:
ASSETS                                             K & $R million
Gross Fixed Assets                 166.5
Less:  Depreciation                 22.6
Net Fixed Assets                                     143.9
Administrative Assets etc.                              .9
Net Current Assets                                     3.1

LIABILITIES
Equity                                                26.9
Long-term debt (excluding
current portion)
IBRD                            42.9
CDC & CDFC                      29.0
Governnent                       49.1             121.0
-147.9
The debt/equity ratio of 82/18 reflects the fact that no equity contri-
butions have been made by the owners; the K26.9 million equity is an
accumulation of earned surplus (K18.4 million) and exchange adjustment
reserve (K8.5 million).  The cash working capital of CAPC, with K5.4
million in Zambia and $R2.2 million in Southern R-hodesia, is currently
satisfactory (future cash positions are discussed in paragraph 6.16).
6.03     The loans as at June 30, 1969, can be summarized as follows:

All these loans should be serviced by CAPC, but due to reasons stated in
paragraphs 6.04 to 6.07 below, the guarantors have serviced the IBRD loan,
while the Zambian Government has serviced half the CDC and CDFC loans.
6.o4    The Bank loans consist of:  the first loan (145-RN), made in
1956, of tS$80 million, repayments commenced in June 1963, finish in
December 1981, and bear interest at 5%; and the second (392-RNS), was
made in l964 for US$7.7 million, repayments commenced in March 1968,
finish in September 1989, and bear interest at 51%.  Following the dis-
solution of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, the IBRD loans were
guaranteed as to one-half by the Zambian Goverrment and as to one-half by
the Southern .fodesian Government, the whole loan being backed up by a
guarantee from the U.K. Government. With the Unilateral Declaration of
Independence by Southern Rhodesia in November 1965, CAPC found itself,
due to exchange control regulations in Zambia and Southern .Rhodesia, un-
able to meet the debt service. The Zambian Government, as Guarantor,
paid one-half of the debt service to the Bank, and the U.K. Government
paid the other half. Subsequently, CAPC reimbursed the Zambian Govern-
ment in kwacha for the amount paid by them; no request for reimbursement
has been made by the U.K. Government, but CAPC was ordered by the Southern
Rhodesian Exchange Control to pay an equivalent amount into a blocked
account, in the name of the U.K. Government, in Southern Rhodesia. This
arrangement has been in force for all debt service payments due to the
Bank after the payment made December 1, 1965, and is likely to continue
until the present situation in Southern Shodesia is solved.
6.05    The Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) loan was for
Lstg 15 million; repayments, with an average interest rate of 6.975%,
started in March 1965 and the last amount will be due in lMarch 2002.
CDC is hoping that this can be rescheduled to shorten the terms (see
paragraph 6.17). The Governments of Southern Rhodesia and Zambia have
each separately guaranteed one-half of the debt service on the loan.
CAPC was unable to obtain Zamnbian or Southern Rhodesian Exchange Control
approval to pay installments of intereat and principal due on and after
March 25, 1967. Half the amounts due were paid by the Zambian Government
in its capacity as part guerantor and were reimbursed by CAPC to them in
i/ I&th the revaluation of sterling, French francs and Netherlands
guilders, the loans were revalued to take into account the new rates
of exchange, with a resulting exchange adjustment reserve of K8.5 million.

kwacha. The other half, following a series of Zambian High Court judg-
ments against CAPC in Zambia, was paid by CAPC to CDC in Zambian currency;
the funds were blocked by Zambian Exchange Control, but may be invested
by CDC in projects in Zambia approved by the Government. CAPC is expect-
ed to have to continue to service the CDC loan in this manner.
6.06    The loan from the Commonwealth Development Finance Co., Ltd.
(CDFC) was for Istg 3 million, repayments, with interest at 6% per annum,
both of which are due in sterling, started in June 1963, the final one
being due in December 1981. CAPC was unable to obtain Exchange Control
approval from Southern Rhodesia and Zambia to pay the debt service due
on or after December 15, 1965 (except that Zambia gave approval for
payment of its half of the installment due December 1966). Half the
amounts due have since been paid in sterling by the Zambian Government
in its capacity as part guarantor, and have been reimbursed by CAPC in
Zambian currency. The other half has been paid in Rhodesian currency
to a blocked account in the name of CDFC in Southern Rhodesia in compliance
with directions by Southern Rhodesian Exchange Control and it is likely
this procedure will also cortinue. CDFC does not acknowledge that payments
made to the blocked account in Southern Rhodesia constitute a valid dis-
charge of CAPC's obligations under the loan agreement.
6.07    The Government loans originally consisted of three loans from
the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, as under:
Loan No.          Original            Interest         Redemption
Amount              Rate              Dates
1           LR 20,000,000             1i%       June '62 - June '94
2           LR  4,000,000             5%        June '66 - June '85
3           LR  4,000,000             6%        June '77 - June '80
With the dissolution of the Federation, the Zambian and Southern Rhodesian
Governments succeeded the Federation as creditor in respect of one-half ol
each loan.  Debt service has been duly paid by CAPC in Zambia and Southern
Rfhodesia, on due dates.
6.08    While CAPC can be seen to be in technical default on its loans,
other than those from the two Governments, it is through no fault of
CAPC itself, which has reimbursed the guarantor or paid, on instructions,
the amount to blocked accounts.  CAPC has always had sufficient funds
and been willing to meet its debt service payments as and when due.  khile
IBRD has been satisfied, CDC and CDFC have not, both of them should be
repaid in sterling, whereas the Southern Rhodesian portion of the amounts
due has been paid in blocked funds.
Estimated Future Operating Results and CAPC's Financial Position
6.09    Under the terms of the lease agreement between KNBC and CAPC,
the whole of the Kariba North output will be used in CAPC's system. The
rent will equal IKBC's administration costs and the debt service due by



- 20 -
MOBC on the Bank loan, CAPCOs loan and any other loan made to INBC for
the purpose of constructing the Project.
6.10     CAPC has agreed tariffs with Zambia for the supply of power
to its system from Kafue and Victoria F-alls. The average cost to CAPC
will vary, depending on the amount of primary and secondary energy
taken, between 0.143 ngwee (2.00 mills US) and 0.221 ngwee (3.09 mills
US) per kWh at Kafue and will be about 0.233 ngwee (3.26 mills US) per
kWh at Victoria Falls. While the Kafue tariff does not cover the full
operation costs and debt service of the station, both CAPC and the Zambian
authorities are satisfied at present with the tariff agreement as an in-
terim measure. However, it is expected that the Kafue tariff will have
to be revised on completion of the second stage of the scheme. At that
time, the rate baze will be higher following the provision of upstream
storage and the installation of additional generating capacity; the
energy available will also be increased.  Additionally, Zambia has indi-
cated that it may refinance the first stage of Kafue on more conventional
terms (i.e. about 20-25 years at 6&-7%)in which case Zambia would request
a review of the tariff after the refinancing had been completed. For these
reasons, the Kafue tariff agreement, which will be for a period of twenty-
five years, will have provision for review at the request of either party
at any time, provided that any adjustments agreed between the two parties
receive the concurrence of the Bank. The government of Zambia and the
Committee of CAPC have agreed the Kafue tariff and, prior to the proposed
Bank loan being made effective, a formal contract, based on the agreed
taziff, will be signed.
6.11     CAPC controls the operations of the interconnected thermal
generating stations at Bulawayo, Lusaka, Salisbury, and Umniati and is
obliged, by statute, to purchase their output of electricity for such sum
as is necessary to reimburse the owners the cost of generation.  There,
with CAPC's concurrence, the output at any generating station has ceased,
CAPC shall defray all expenses of that station. A similar agreement was
reached with the Copperbelt Power Company, effective December 1, 1966.
There are also other agreements for smaller supplies and for standby
arrangements.
6.12     Annex 6 gives the estimpted income statements for CTPC for
1969/70 through 1975/76, which are consolidated with KNBCIs in Annex 11,
omitting inter-company transactions. These show satisfactory results,
with CAPC generating sufficient funds to finance 50% of development,
earning a rate of return on its net fixed assets in operation of between
7.7% and 10.8%. The consolidated rate of return is about 9.6% in 1975
and 9.5% in 1976.  In arriving at the estimates, the gross revenue has
been based on the most recent estimates of maximum demand and energy
consumption (February/March 1970) using the present tariffs. It is possible
that there may be additional revenue from Gecomin in the Democratic Republi.c
of the Congo from 1972/73 onwards. This has been excluded from the;present
forecasts since negotiations for suchi export are at an early stage and the
tariff has not yet been discussed.



- 21 -
6.13     Under the terms of previous Bank loans, CAPC is required to
provide at least 50@b towards the cost of the second stage of Kariba,
including transmission. Until March 31, 1970, CAPC had provided
slightly over 50%o of such funds.
6.14     A suzmary of the combined financing plan of IMNBC and CAPC,
(Ainnex 12), is shown below. It presents the situation much as it
would have been, if CAPC had been able to carry out the Project as
originally intended (see paragraph 1.08).

6.15     In order to finance part of the Southern Rhodesian transmission
expenditure, it will be necessary for CAPC to borrow about $24.3 million
in that country, which it anticipates can be done without difficulty. It
is estimated that this amount will be borrowed over the years 1971/72
through 1973/74 and repaid during 197k/75 and 1975/76. During the period,
C_PC will be providing 57% of the total sources from its internal cash

generation with a further 37% coming from the proposed Bank loan and
the final 6% from temporary borrowing in Southern .3hodesia. In 1976
CAPC's debt/equity ratio is expected to have inproved to 50/5O (58/42
CAPC and KNBC combined). CAPC's debt service will then be covered
1.6 times by internal cash generation (1,5 times for the two companies
combined).
6.16     Balance Sheets for CAPC and for KNBC and CAPC consolidated
are shown in Annexes 8 and 13. It will be noted that CAPC's cash
position shows balances of K13 million in 1976. It is unlikely that
balances will in fact be as high, since it is probable that by 1976
CAPC will be involved in capital expenditure on the next generating
project after Kariba North. No provision for any generating facili-
ties beyond the present Project has been made in the forecasts.
6.17     CDC considers that its loan to CAPC extends for too long
(originally 46 years), and has asked CAPC if it will reschedule the
loan, the last repayment of which is not due until 2002. The Chairman
of CAPC has undertaken to put to the Board of CAPC, when it has been
legally reconstituted, a proposal that, effective 1975, debt service
payments will be increased so that the loan is fully amortized at the
same time as that for the Bank, namely in 1995. It is anticipated that
the rescheduling would increase CAPC's annual debt service by some
K(213,000 for the years 1975-1995. No provision has been made in CAPC's
financial forecasts. Rescheduling would effect no significant change
in the debt service coverage, and no difficulty in rescheduling the
loan is anticipated.

APPRAISAL OF RARIBA NORTH NYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
HISTORY
1.        When the Bank loan (Loan 145-RN) of US$80 million equivalent for
the first stage of the Kariba Project was made in 1956, the power situation
in the three territories of Southern and Northern Phodesia and Nyasaland,
which at that time formed the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, had
reached a critical stage where it was no longer practical to meet growing
demands by additions to existing thermal generating stations.
2.        In 1955 the Federal Government reached the conclusion that the
construction of the Kariba Hydroelectric Project on the Zambezi River, with
a transmission system to interconnect existing generating stations in
Southern and Northern Thodesia, would be the best solution to the power
problem. It decided that the Project should be built in two stages: the
first consisting of an arch dam, an underground power station on the South
Bank (in Southern Rhodesia) with an installed capacity of 500 MW, and a
330 kV transmission system; and the second consisting of an underground
power station on the North Bank (in Northern Rhodesia) with an installed
capacity of 700 4W, and the expansion of the 330 kV transmission system.
3.        The Government also decided that the first stage should be built
as soon as possible so that demand in 1960 could be met without adding
thermal units other than those already committed. At this time it was
envisaged that construction work on the second stage would commence
immediately after the completion of the first stage.
4.        On May 1, 1955, a Federal Electricity Act came into force and
the Federal Power Board was established, the Board having among its general
functions and duties "the provision or administration of services common
to two or more Territories for the bulk supply of electricity." The Board
was directed by the Federal Government to undertake the construction and
subsequent operation of the first stage of the Kariba Project. To finance
this stage the Board obtained, in addition to the Bank loan, loans of
£ stg 15 million from the Commonwealth Development Corporation, £ stg 3 mil-
lion from the Commonwealth Development Finance Company Limited and £R28 miu-
lion from the Federal Government.
5.        Work on site commenced late in 1955. The first generating unit
at Kariba South commenced supplying power on December 28, 1959;  and the
first stage, comprising an arch dam which impounds the Zambezi River and
creates a reservoir with a capacity of some 130 million acre feet, an
underground power station with an installed capacity of 600 lAW, and a
330 kV transmission system, was completed in mid-1962 on schedule. Instead
of five 100 MW generating units, as originally planned, six 100 lAW units
were installed. Although the nameplate rating of each of the units is
100 NW, they are each capable of a maximum output of 1.17.5 iW, and the



ANNEX 1
Page 2 of 5 pages
capability of the station is therefore 705 FW. The cost of the first
stage, K155.2 million (US$217.3 million), was lower than the original
estimated cost of K161.6 million (US$226.2 million).
6.        At the end of 1963 the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland
was dissolved and the Central African Power Corporation (CAPO) was
established by a United Kingdom Order-in-Council to take over the opera-
tions of the Federal Power Board, which ceased to function. Under a loan
assumption agreement and guarantee agreements, which were signed with
the Bank on December 30, 1963, CAPC assumed the Federal Power Board's
obligations to the Bank and Northern and Southern Rhodesia each guaran-
teed a half of the payments due under Bank Loan No. 145-RN. The United
Kingdom guarantee remained unchanged. A Higher Authority for Power was
established comprised of two Ministers from Northern Rhodesia and two
Ministers from Southern Rhodesia. All major decisions regarding CAPC,
including the approval of capital expenditure and borrowing, have to
be made by the Higher Authority. Decisions by the Higher Authority must
be unanimous.
7.        On October 2, 1964, the Bank made a loan (Loan 392-RNS) of
US$7.7 million equivalent to the CAPC to finance part of the cost of a
second 330 kV transmission line between Kariba South and Kitwe in the
Copperbelt in Northern Rhodesia and the expansion of substations at
Kariba, Lusaka and Kitwe. These facilities were required to enable CAPC
to meet increasing demands for power and to give greater security of
supply.  This development, which is considered part of the second stage of
the Kariba Project, was commissioned in October 1968, some months ahead
of schedule. The total cost was slightly less than the estimated cost of
US$15.4 million.
8.        On October 2h, 196h, Northern Rhodesia became independent as
the Republic of Zambia and succeeded to the responsibilities of Northern
Rhodesia under the Guarantee Agvpements for Loans Nos. 1h5-RN and 392-RNS.
9.        Load growth on the CAPC system during the early 1960's was less
than expected and this, coupled with the fact that the South Bank station
had a capability of 705 MW instead of 500 FTW, as originally planned,
resulted in the postponement of the construction of the Kariba North
Station. However, by January 1965 it became apparent that additional
generating capacity would be required by 1970 and CAPC instructed its
Consultants to prepare a report on system development. The report was
received in September 1965 and it recommended the construction of the
Kariba North Station with six 150 WIT generating units and the expansion of
the 330 kV transmission system, the first 150 Mi unit to be in service in
1970 and the sixth unit by 1976. The report was accepted by CAPC.
10.       CAPC notified the Higher Authority for Power in December 1965
of its acceptance of the Consultants' report and requested permission to
proceed with the proposed development, but by this time Southern Rhodesia
had declared itself independent (November 1965) and the Authority had
ceased to function because the appointment of two Ministers to it by the
Smith regime to represent Southern Rhodesia was not recognized by the

Zambian members. The Bank subsequently worked out a number of schemes
to permit preliminary work on the Project to go ahead. Satisfactory
arrangements were not agreed until the beginning of 1967, but by this
time the Zambian Government had decided to proceed with the construction
of a 200 SW hydroelectric scheme on the Kafue River in Zambia and two
schemes at Victoria Falls with a combined capacity of 100 Mi. One of
the Victoria Falls schemes with an installed capacity of 60 MW was com-
missioned in 1969 and the other 40 Ng scheme is scheduled to be in opera-
tion in May 1971. The power generated by the Victoria Falls stations,
with the exception of a small amount to meet local needs, will be purchased
by CAPC and fed into its transmission system.
11.       In September 1966, the Zambian Government announced the size of
the Kafue scheme would be increased and that it would have an initial
capacity of 500 MNW and an ultimate capacity of 750 1M4.  Although the cost
of this Kafue development was more than twice as much per kW installed as
the proposed Kariba North Station, the Zambian Government decided on its
construction instead of Kariba North for security reasons.
12.       Construction of the first stage of the Kafue scheme commenced
early in 1967. It is being financed by the Zambian Government and the
Yugoslav contractors. The scheme will have an initial installed capacity of
600 NW (instead of 500 NW as originally planned) which could be increased
to 900 MW by the installation of two additional generating units at a
later date. As very little storage will be provided initially, the firm
output will be little more than 200 MW. During a year of average rainfall
the firm energy output is expected to be about 1,800 GNh and the secondary
output about 1,000 GHh. The power generated at Kafue will be purchased
by CAPC and fed into its transmission system. The first generating unit at
Kafue is now expected to be in operation by July 1971 (some 6 months behind
schedule) but it is by no means certain that this date will be achieved,
as a considerable amount of work has to be completed before the river is
in flood in November/December 1970. If this work is not completed in time
it is doubtful if the first unit could be in operation before December
1971.
13.       The estimated cost of the initial development at Kafue is
US$100.5 million, to which must be added about US$14 million for interest
during construction, making a total of US$114.5 million.  The cost per kW
installed (excluding interest during construction) is US$167.5, which is
low, but this cost is misleading as the firm capacity of the scheme is
only about 200 Mv.
1h.       To increase the firm capacity of Kafue to 900 IYW it would be
necessary to provide upstream storage and install two additional 150 1W
generating units. The cost of this second stage (excluding interest during
construction) is estimated at US$63.7 million. The total estimated cost of
the two stages (excluding interest during construction) is about UTS$16h.2
million, or US$182 per kW installed, which is a low cost for the type of
development.

15.       In view of the relatively small amount of firm power which will
be obtained from the first stage of Kafue and the Victoria Falls schemes
and the cbvious need within the next few years for additional generating
capacity to meet growing demands on its system, CAPC instructed its Con-
sultants in April 1968 to report on the next stage of development. The
report was received in February 1969 and it recommended the construction of
Kariba North with an installed capacity of 600 MW (which could be expanded
at a later date to 900 YW) and the expansion of CAPCts transmission system,
followed by the construction of the second stage of Kafue. An economic
comparison of the two developments showed that, by constructing the
schemes in this order, a considerable saving would be obtained (see para-
graph 4.14).  The installation of another 300 MW at Kariba North could
not be considered as an alternative to the second stage of Kafue as the
additional capacity would provide very little firm power.
16.       The report further recommended that four 150 MN  generating units
be installed at Kariba North and that work on the station be commenced as
soon as possible in order to have the first generating unit in operation
by June 1974 and the fourth unit by June 1975. The recommendations were
accepted by the CAPC and the Zambian Government which are both most anxious
to proceed with the construction of the Kariba North Station, and the
Zambian Government has asked the Bank to assist in its financing.
17.       Before Southern Rhodesia declared itself independent of the
United Kingdom, the arrangements for financing the Kariba North Project
and the expansion of CAPC's transmission svstem would have been for CAPC
to provide half the cost from earnings (in accordance with covenants
in Bank Loan Agreements Nos. 145-RN and 392-RNS) and for the Bank to have
made a loan to CAPC to cover the other half of the cost, which, with the
existing loans to CAPO, would have been guaranteed severally in equal
shares by the Southern Rhodesian and Zambian Governments with the United
Kingdom backing the Southern Rhodesian guarantee. The Southern Rhodesian
and Zambian Governments would have provided the necessary foreign exchange
to enable CAPC to meet its loan liabilities from its own funds within the
two countries, while keeping its reserves in the two countries under
arrangements which reasonably shared the location of the resources taking
into account the cash requirements of CAPO.
18.       Because of the situation in Southern Rhodesia the above arrange-
ments could not be followed at the present time. Also, because of the
situation, neither the Higher Authority for Power nor the Board of CAPC
are properly constituted.
19.       The Higher Authority for Power, which should consist of two
Ministers appointed by the Southern Rhodesian Government and two by the
Zambian Government, cannot function because all decisions have to be
unanimous and the Zambian members do not recognize the Ministers appointed
by the Smith regime (see paragraphs 6 and 10). The Board of CAPC should
have a Chairman and seven members. Three of the members should be
appointed by the Zambian Government, three by the Southern Rhodesian
Government, and the Chairman and one member by the Higher Authority for

Power. A quorum of five members is required. The terms of office of
the Chairman, the Southern Rhodesian members appointed before UDI and the
member appointed by the Higher Authority have expired and the Board is
without a quorum and is unable to exercise its statutory functions. Day-
to-day operations are carried out under a Committee consisting of the
three Zambian members, the three Southern PRhodesian members and the
Chairman who has remained in function after his legal term of office
expired.
20.       In these circumstances, a number of possible arrangements for
financing, constructing and operating the Kariba North Project and the
expansion of CAPC's transmission system have been considered. After a
series of meetings between representatives of the United Kingdom and
Zambian Governments, the CAPC and the Bank, agreement was finally reached
at a meeting held at the Commonwealth and Foreign Office in London from
July 30 to August 1, 1969. The arrangements now being followed are based
on those agreed at the above-mentioned meeting.
