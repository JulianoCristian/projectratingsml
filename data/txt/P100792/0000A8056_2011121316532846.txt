                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Disbursements. Implementation of the Road Infrastructure and Safety Project (RISP) has progressed well since the last full implementation support mission in the first quarter of
                         2011. As of November 21, 2011, 95 percent of the total IDA credit has been disbursed, up from 81 percent since the end of the March 2011 mission. The FY11 disbursement ratio
                         was 70.3 percent, the highest of the Bosnia and Herzegovina portfolio, reflecting good progress in implementing the road and bridge rehabilitation component. The FY12
                         disbursement ratio as of November 21, 2011 is 67.96 percent.

                         Project Restructuring. The project restructuring, requested by the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina--approved by Bank management on July 6, 2011-- asked for a
                         reallocation of funds across categories in the Financing Agreement and for a six month extension of the closing date of the project. The reallocation of funds affects the following
                         components of the project: Consultants services for Part 2.C to be reduced by SDR 200,000 and a concomitant increase of SDR 200,000 to Goods, works, and consultants services

                         for Part 2.B of the Project, and Works for Part 2.A to be reduced by SDR 210,000 and a concomitant increase of SDR 210,000 to Goods, works, and consultants services for Part 2.B
                         of the Project. The requested reallocation reflected the decision taken by the Republika Srpska to finance component three of the project, the preparation of the Output and
                         Performance Based Maintenance Contracts, with funds available from the European Bank from Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). The funds reallocated for the road safety
                         component of the project are required to finance the road safety consultancy contract. The new closing date is end June 2012.

                         Road safety technical assistance. The FRD signed a contract with the Swedish consulting firm SweRoad on November 29, 2010, for a one year technical assistance consultancy,
                         which is under progress. The RSD has signed a contract for the road safety technical assistance consultancy, with SweRoad, on August 1, 2011.

                         The FRD is asked to raise maintenance expenditure in its revised 2011 Business Plan, in order to ensure compliance with the Financing Agreement. This has not happened due to a
                         difficult financial/fiscal context and a decline in value-added tax, which is the main source of income for the road directorate in the Federation.
