                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Disbursements. Implementation of the Road Infrastructure and Safety Project (RISP) has progressed well since the last full implementation support mission in October 2010. As of
                         March 14, 2011, 81 percent of the total IDA credit funds have been disbursed, up from 58 percent since the end of the October mission. The FY11 disbursement ratio is currently 62
                         percent, reflecting good progress in implementing the road and bridge rehabilitation component.
