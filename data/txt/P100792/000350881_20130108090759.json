performance was\n            satisfactory. There were eight lessons learned: (1) there\n            are important benefits from ensuring that project sites are\n            visited before completing appraisal. (2) It is important to\n            have separate provisions for physical and price\n            contingencies in costing of projects as a tool for dealing\n            with cost variations during implementation. (3) Need for\n            timely review of procurement thresholds. (4) Programmatic,\n            repeater projects help to sustain institutional\n            strengthening efforts. (5) Promotional activities, public\n            campaigns are important components of road safety\n            activities. (6) Exposure to international good practices is\n            beneficial. (7) The relevance of covenants should be\n            evaluated if they are not implemented.  (8) Baseline\n            indicators need to be established in a timely fashion."}, "docdt": "2012-12-27T00:00:00Z"}
