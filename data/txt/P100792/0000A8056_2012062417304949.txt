                         The Project Development Objectives are to reduce user costs on the priority sections of the trunk and regional road networks, to improve the institutional framework for
                         road safety, and to modernize road maintenance practices.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project was approved by the Board of the Bank on December 17, 2007. The project became effective only on September 19, 2008, reflecting the institutional complexities of
                         Bosnia and Herzegovina. This delay in effectiveness explains in part the delays in implementation with the first contract for the project signed in the Federation of Bosnia and
                         Herzegovina (FBH) in May 2009 and in the Republika Srpska (RS) in April 2009, for road rehabilitation under Component 1. This is a year behind the schedule foreseen in the
                         Procurement Plan as per the PAD. The delay in launching the main component of the project, at an initial value of US$19 million--out of a total credit of US$25 million equivalent--

                         meant that the road agency in th FBH, the Federation Road Directorate (FRD) and the road agency in the RS, the RS Road Directorate (RSRD) focused in 2010 on launching
                         procurement for over 240 km of road rehabilitation and bridges, with the implementation of the technical assistance components--Component 2 for road safety and Component 3 for
                         technical assistance and capacity building--starting later. There was good progress in implementation in 2010 and 2011. As a result, as of June 11, 2012, SDR 15.8 million out of
                         SDR 16.4 million or 97 percent of the total IDA credit funds have been disbursed. The activities related to the RS road safety consultancy will be completed before end June 2012.

                         During the course of this mission it was confirmed that allocations for road maintenance in the FBH were increased by 5.6 percent in 2012. This brings the nominal cumulative
                         increase in regular maintenance expenditures to 10 percent over 2007-2012.
