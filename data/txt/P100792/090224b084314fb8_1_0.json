The key results\n            achieved were as follows: (a) Out of 241 km of roads to be\n            rehabilitated by the project and financed from the IDA\n            credit, 61 kilometer have been rehabilitated in the\n            Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and 43 kilometer in\n            Republika Srpska, which has reduced road user costs; (b)\n            There was significant progress with the development of the\n            institutional framework for road safety, with the approval\n            of entity level road safety strategies, and the\n            establishment in the Republika Srpska of a road safety\n            agency; and (c) Modernization of road maintenance was\n            progressing more slowly, with a pilot output and performance\n            based maintenance contract signed in March 2010 in the\n            Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina."}, "docdt": "2011-12-31T07:59:05Z"}
