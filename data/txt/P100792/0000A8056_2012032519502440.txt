                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Disbursements. Implementation of the Road Infrastructure and Safety Project (RISP) has progressed well since the last full implementation support mission in the first quarter of
                         2011. As of February 13, 2013, 95 percent of the total IDA credit has been disbursed, up from 81 percent since the end of the March 2011 mission. The FY11 disbursement ratio was
                         70.3 percent, the highest of the Bosnia and Herzegovina portfolio, reflecting good progress in implementing the road and bridge rehabilitation component. The FY12 disbursement
                         ratio as of February 13, 2012 is 67.96 percent. Disbursements are expected to rise sharply before project closure end June 2012.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The FRD was asked to raise maintenance expenditure in its 2012 Business Plan, in order to ensure compliance with the Financing Agreement. This has not happened earlier due to
                         a difficult financial/fiscal context and a decline in value-added tax, which is the main source of income for the road directorate in the Federation.
