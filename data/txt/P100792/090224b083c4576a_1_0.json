Half of the roads in the\n            country were in poor shape which led to more bottlenecks and\n            also more accidents. Road Infrastructure and Safety Project\n            rebuilt about 2,500 kilometers of roads around the country.\n            A major bridge spanning the Bosna River that squeezed\n            traffic coming in and out of the city was rebuilt which\n            saved lots idling time in the car. Significant progress had\n            been made to work towards better drivers and safer roads in\n            Bosnia and Herzegovina."}, "docdt": "2011-07-19T07:26:03Z"}
