                         Disbursements. Implementation of the Road Infrastructure and Safety Project (RISP) has progressed well since the last full implementation support mission in May 2010. As of
                         November 17, 2010, 69 percent of the total IDA credit funds have been disbursed, up from 58 percent since the end of the October mission. The FY11 disbursement ratio is currently
                         37.4 percent, reflecting good progress in implementing the road and bridge rehabilitation component.

                         for both entities, raising funds available for component 1, road and bridge rehabilitation, necessary due to actual costs being higher than estimated at project preparation.
