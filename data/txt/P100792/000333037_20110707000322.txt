                            PROPOSED CHANGES
 1.      The proposed changes, requested by the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina
 in letters signed by the Minister of Finance and Treasury—dated March 17, 2011 and
 June 10, 2011—ask for a six month extension of the closing date of the project and a
 reallocation of funds across categories in the Financing Agreement (IDA 4371-BOS).

 2.      Project implementation progress. As of July 5, 2011, SDR13.99 million out of
 SDR 16.4 million (US$25 million equivalent) or 85 percent of the total IDA credit funds
 have been disbursed, with 70 percent disbursement ratio in FY11. The majority of
 remaining funds are expected to be committed during calendar year 2011. Out of 241 km
 of roads to be rehabilitated by the project, to date 92 km have been rehabilitated in the
 Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and 124 km in the Republika Srpska, which will
 reduce road user costs and travel time. There is significant progress with the development
 of the institutional framework for road safety, with the approval of entity level road
 safety strategies, and the establishment in the Republika Srpska of a road safety agency.
 Modernization of road maintenance practices is progressing more slowly, with a pilot
 output and performance based maintenance contract signed in March 2010 in the
 Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

 3.      Proceeds for the Bosnia And Herzegovina, Road Infrastructure And Safety
 Project, Credit 4371-BOS, will be reallocated as summarized in the Table below.

 4.    Proposed reallocation. The proposed reallocation of funds is across the following
 components of the project, as specified in the Financing Agreement (IDA 4371-BOS):

    •   Republika Srpska: Goods, works, and consultants’ services for Part 2.B to be
        increased by SDR 200,000 and Consultants’ services for Part 2.C to be reduced
        by SDR 200,000 and Works for Part 2.A to be reduced by SDR 210,000 and a
        concomitant increase of SDR 210,000 to Goods, works, and consultants’ services
        for Part 2.B of the Project.

5.     In both the Republika Srpska (RS) and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina
(the Federation), there has been considerable progress in implementing the road safety
component, from non-credit proceeds. The Republika Srpska approved a road safety

 The categories of expenditures are taken from Schedule 2, Section IV, Withdrawal of the Proceeds of the
Financing of the Financing Agreement, A2. Part 1.A and Part 2A refer to the road rehabilitation component,
Part 1.B and Part 2.B refer to the road safety component, and Part 1.C and Part 2.C refer to technical assistance
and capacity building component.

strategy in December 2008, "Republika Srpska Road Safety Strategy (2009-2013)" and a
Law on "Traffic Safety on Roads in Republika Srpska" has been prepared and adoption is
in process. This establishes the RS Traffic Safety Council and RS Traffic Safety Agency.
Meanwhile, the Federation passed the "Basis of the Road Transport Safety Strategy
(2008-2013)" in September 2008 and has developed an Action Plan for implementing its
strategy. At the State level an amendment to the Road Safety Law was passed by
Parliament on June 14, 2010.

6.      Due to delays in project effectiveness, the World Bank decided to finance
technical assistance for the introduction of output and performance based maintenance
contracts (OPBMC) through Bank budget, instead of through the Technical Assistance
and Capacity Building component of the project. The Republika Srpska has requested
additional funds to finance technical assistance for the introduction of OPBMC, but will
be financing this with funds available from the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (EBRD) project—prepared in parallel to the World Bank road
rehabilitation project—releasing project funds for the road safety component. The
requested reallocation is required to finance the road safety consultancy in the Republika
Srpska.

7.      The proposed closing date extension to June 30, 2012 is necessary for the road
safety consultancy in the Republika Srpska, as delays in procurement mean that the
contract is expected to be signed shortly and a minimum contract duration of 11 months
is required.

8.      No changes have been made with regard to implementation agencies, there are no
outstanding audits and financial management reports are satisfactory, and the project is
progressing satisfactorily. The project objectives continue to be achievable; the
performance of the borrower and project implementing agencies continue to be
satisfactory, and the implementing agencies have prepared an action plan acceptable to
the Bank to complete the project.
