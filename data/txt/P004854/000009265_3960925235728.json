Development Plan (1985-1987). The subprojects will\n            provide direct and indirect support for production (domestic\n            as well as export-oriented), strengthen and diversify the\n            country's economic base, enhance the generation of new\n            economic activities, and create new employment\n            opportunities. The following subprojects have been\n            identified: (i) tree crop support; (ii) upgrading of rural\n            roads; (iii) construction of a small industries center, and\n            (iv) upgrading of a container park."}, "docdt": "1985-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
