to improve reliability and efficiency of electricity\n            supply, and improve financial and corporate management in\n            the wholesale electricity market. The project contains seven\n            components. The first component will support the\n            rehabilitation and upgrade of metering of electricity flows\n            in the transmission network. The second component will\n            support the rehabilitation and upgrade of system control.\n            The third component will support the rehabilitation and\n            upgrade of telecommunication, including installation of the\n            necessary communication equipment. The fourth component will\n            support the rehabilitation of selected transmission\n            substations. The fifth component will support the management\n            of information systems by installing the computerized\n            management information system at Electrogadatsema. The sixth\n            component will bring the necessary market and management\n            expertise and improve the commercial and technical\n            performance of the system by signing the management\n            contracts with international firms to manage the Wholesale\n            Electricity Market, and the transmission and dispatch\n            companies. The seventh component will support consulting\n            services and incremental operating costs."}, "docdt": "2001-04-09T00:00:00Z"}
