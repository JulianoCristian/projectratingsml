The\n            project has two main components: 1) a rural credit component\n            (RCC), which includes a US $30 million line of credit and an\n            institutional development program for the Agricultural Bank\n            of Lithuania (ABL) and local banks; and 2) an institutional\n            and human resources development component (IHDC), which\n            consists of technical assistance for land reform, extension\n            services, marketing, business skill training, and rural\n            employment generation and targeted poverty alleviation. The\n            RCC aims to: 1) strengthen and restructure rural credit\n            delivery systems; 2) develop commercial lending channels for\n            rural credit; 3) restructure the ABL; 4) finance upgrading\n            of technology and production facilities; 5) foster\n            development of private farms and promote emergence of\n            private small and medium enterprises in rural areas; and 6)\n            provide seed money for opportunities for income and\n            employment generation in rural areas. Finally, the\n            objectives of the IHDC are to: 1) increase productivity,\n            competitiveness, and marketing prospects for Lithuanian\n            products; 2) expedite land reform and develop a mortgage\n            system for increased access to credit; 3) increase the\n            availability of alternative employment opportunities through\n            retraining and diversification of farm businesses; 4) reduce\n            rural poverty; 5) improve human skills and local\n            institutional capacity; and 6) improve business management\n            skills of farmers and entrepreneurs in identifying,\n            evaluating, and pursuing business development opportunities."}, "docdt": "1996-03-07T00:00:00Z"}
