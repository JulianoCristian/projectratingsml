"Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for Higher Education Support\n            Program Project (HESPP) for Pakistan were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was substantial, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            the Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: complete ownership by the Borrower is\n            essential for the momentum of reforms to be sustained. The\n            Bank's financing was tied only to the achievement of\n            the prior actions in the HESP. Had the Higher Education\n            Commission (HEC) not fully owned the program and not been\n            committed to its own Medium Term Development Framework\n            (MTDF), substantial progress could not have attained in\n            implementing other components of the reform program.\n            Committed leadership and political will is extremely\n            important in spearheading reforms. Without the professional\n            and competent leadership of the HEC, and the commitment of\n            the Government of Pakistan (GoP) to continue to support\n            higher education, the reform agenda of the HEC could not\n            have been pursued in this manner. Flexibility in project\n            design is critical. A large measure of the successful\n            performance of the HEC stemmed from its commitment to\n            monitor progress and institute corrective measures when it\n            felt that the outcomes of its policies were not consistent\n            with, or hampering, the achievement of the overall\n            objectives of the program. While all key players in the\n            higher education sector were going up a learning curve, the\n            flexibility with, and the timely manner in, which, actions\n            were carried out have been critical to this success. In an\n            environment in which resource availability is uncertain or\n            constrained the financial sustainability aspects need to be\n            factored early into the program design. These considerations\n            should influence the nature and scope of the proposed\n            interventions, instruments and mechanisms to achieve the\n            desired goals without unduly compromising the objectives of\n            access and equity. Sustained support by the Bank, outside\n            the realm of assured funding, is necessary. There were a\n            number of areas in this program where - while progress was\n            made - the provision of technical assistance could have made\n            it easier for all principle stakeholders to implement the\n            reforms speedily, efficiently, and in a cost-effective\n            manner. An example of this is the establishment of quality\n            enhancement cells in universities; with extended guidance\n            and external support, Higher Education Institution (HEIs) in\n            Pakistan would have found the institution of self assessment\n            systems a simpler exercise than their experience to date."}, "docdt": "2010-06-14T00:00:00Z"}
