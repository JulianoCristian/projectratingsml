"abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Anhui Highway\n            Rehabilitation and Improvement Project for China were as\n            follow: outcomes were moderately satisfactory; risk to\n            development outcome was moderate; Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory; and borrower performance was\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: the monitoring\n            indicator must be tailored with cause and effect relations\n            between the project interventions and the indicators.\n            Monitoring indicator selection and target-value setting are\n            critical to measure the effectiveness of project\n            interventions. Inadequate indicators distort the performance\n            results and lower the confidence on evaluation system. When\n            project interventions merely focus on civil works, freight /\n            passenger tariffs and commodities prices should be\n            cautiously used as project indicators unless their\n            correlation with the project interventions is clearly\n            identified and the risk of policy and market fluctuations is\n            considered since they may be affected by external factors\n            other than the project interventions. As experienced in this\n            project, fuel and labor price rose rapidly and a global\n            economic crisis was encountered, which had dominant\n            influence on transport price rather than that of road\n            condition improvements. Similarly, many factors may\n            contribute to traffic safety. It is necessary to conduct\n            quantitative impact evaluation and/or economic analysis to\n            isolate the impacts of project investments from the effects\n            of other exogenous factors that are expected to increase or\n            decrease substantially during project implementation. To\n            avoid major technical changes and environmental impacts, it\n            is critical to control the quality of feasibility study and\n            optimize engineering designs at project preparation stage.\n            Both time and fund for project preparation and\n            implementation should be adequately considered."}, "docdt": "2012-12-12T00:00:00Z"}
