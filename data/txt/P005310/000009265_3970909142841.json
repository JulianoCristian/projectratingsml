sustainability was likely,\n            institutional development was modest, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: where demand\n            management through water tariff increase is problematic,\n            there can be alternative measures (such as handing over to\n            farmers some of the responsibilities and costs) that\n            contribute to the same objective. It is important to build\n            on national ownership and to involve co financiers\n            throughout. The origins of ASAL in joint work and shared\n            analysis led to a high degree of ownership of even\n            politically difficult measures and even in the fast-changing\n            environment that has characterized the country and the\n            region in recent years. Monitoring and evaluation of\n            adjustment is a long-term affair, and it is a mistake to\n            expect quick results as was the case during appraisal.\n            Thorough preparation is a good investment, as implementation\n            is correspondingly smoother. The Bank and Government\n            invested large resources in preparation, but implementation\n            required far less attention."}, "docdt": "1997-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
