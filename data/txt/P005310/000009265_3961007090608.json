promote transition\n            to a more sustainable and efficient use of resources,\n            particularly water; and 2) free up markets and enable the\n            private sector to invest, produce and trade in line with\n            Jordan's comparative advantage in agriculture.  The\n            project has three main components.  First, efficient natural\n            resource use will support the transition to an optimal use\n            of water and land resources.  Within an intersectoral water\n            policy framework, ASAL supports comprehensive reforms to: 1)\n            restructure water sector institutions to maximize efficiency\n            and unify planning and management; 2) promote efficient use\n            of existing water resources through demand management; 3)\n            establish control on over-exploited groundwater resources;\n            and 4) prioritize public investments in water.  Second,\n            market liberalization will free up markets and thus\n            encourage private investment and trade to flourish.  The\n            adjustment program supported by ASAL provides for\n            improvements to the incentive structure through the removal\n            of subsidies and price controls, liberalization of external\n            trade and lifting of monopolies.  Internal and external\n            markets in agricultural produce will be deregulated, and\n            there will be deregulation of markets in services and land.\n            Third, institutional development will assure efficient\n            public investment and service provision between the\n            Government and the private sector."}, "docdt": "1994-11-15T00:00:00Z"}
