as\n            follows: the outcome was satisfactory, the sustainability\n            was likely, the institutional development impact was modest,\n            and the Bank and borrower performance were both\n            satisfactory,. The lessons learned indicate that in the Loan\n            Agreement (schedule 6), it was stipulated that the Borrower\n            should provide funds for maintenance of the urban and\n            inter-urban roads through an annual budget allocation of\n            US$21.0 million. This was introduced as a Table but no\n            reference was made to a covenant clause within the Loan\n            Agreement (LOA). It would have been preferable to work under\n            the time-slice project in two phases. The first would have\n            been a transport rehabilitation project with technical\n            assistance to Ministry of Public Works (MOP) to streamline\n            its capacity to plan and manage projects and funds for the\n            preparation of the second phase. The second would have been\n            an urban transport project, including a quick disbursing\n            policy-based component, rehabilitation and maintenance\n            component, urban and road sub-projects with a technical\n            assistance to strengthen MOP and the regulating entity for\n            the urban public transport. An operational manual that\n            describes a summary framework of the project design,\n            policies, definitions, indicators, procurement procedures,\n            guidelines and plans should be agreed with the Bank, prior\n            to effectiveness. Successful implementation of the project\n            is highly dependent on the stability of key project\n            management staff, both at the local and Bank levels, and a\n            stable political environment. The project did not develop an\n            appropriate monitoring and evaluation system to follow\n            throughout the implementation period. Indigenous Peoples\n            Development Plan (IPDP) should have ownership from the\n            beneficiary indigenous communities."}, "docdt": "2004-06-16T00:00:00Z"}
