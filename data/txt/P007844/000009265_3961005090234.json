          competition in the road transport industry and provide the\n            foundation for future regulatory reform; (b) improve the\n            management of the transport sector through the coordination\n            of investments and the formulation of policies; (c) continue\n            strengthening the administration and maintenance of roads;\n            (d) assist the Ministry of Public Works (MOP) in removing\n            the existing road maintenance backlog and preventing its\n            future occurrence through the implementation of a\n            well-coordinated rehabilitation and maintenance program; and\n            (e) reduce the traffic congestion and provide more\n            efficient, safe and reliable passenger transport services in\n            the city of Panama and other major cities in the country.\n            The project comprises the following components:  (1) an\n            urban transport component covering:  (a) street\n            rehabilitation and/or widening and maintenance, intersection\n            improvement, improved signalization and traffic management;\n            and (b) institutional reforms and regulatory changes in\n            public road transport; (2) an inter-urban roads component\n            comprising:  the improvement, rehabilitation and maintenance\n            of roads and bridges; and (3) a policy reform and an\n            institutional strengthening component aimed at:  (a)\n            reforming the regulatory policy of the for-hire road\n            transport services; (b) improving overall transport sector\n            planning and policy formulation, the institutional set-up\n            for managing urban transport, and MOP's capacity to\n            coordinate investments in the entire transport sector and to\n            address environmental issues; (c) training MOP staff to\n            prepare projects for private sector implementation and to\n            manage the contracts; and (d) preparing studies for possible\n            follow-up activities.  The other elements of the total road\n            program are justifiable road upgrading and improvement\n            investments, which the government intends to carry out\n            mostly under build, operate and transfer arrangements with\n            the private sector."}, "docdt": "1993-11-29T00:00:00Z"}
