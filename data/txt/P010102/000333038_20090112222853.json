Frequent changes in personnel adversely\n            affected management's efficiency and effectiveness.\n            Problems identified in built facilities were caused by some\n            design and specification weaknesses which were not detected\n            by either the Federal Coordinating Unit (FCU) architect in\n            Pakistan or the architect at the Bank during project\n            development, and a lack of systematic and effective\n            supervision and quality control at critical points by the\n            Public Works Department (PWD) in the Punjab, Baluchistan and\n            North West Frontier Provinces (NWFP) during the\n            implementation of the project. The Government needs to take\n            corrective measures regarding under-enrollment in order that\n            the expected benefits of the project might be fully\n            realized. A few major lessons learned which could improve\n            future projects include: (a) the importance of good design\n            and clearly written specifications; (b) a clear\n            understanding by the Borrower of the total project funds\n            available and procedures for requesting withdrawals; (c) the\n            need for more effective supervision by the FCU at all sites;\n            and (d) the importance of all sites being visited at least\n            once by the Bank supervision missions, especially at\n            critical point of project implementation."}, "docdt": "1986-06-16T00:00:00Z"}
