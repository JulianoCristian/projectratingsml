REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
CREDIT TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
FOR THE THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the equivalent
of US$15 million on standard IDA terms to help finance the Third Education
Project. The proceeds of the credit would be made available to the Provinces
of Baluchistan, North West Frontier (NWFP), the Punjab and Sind on the same
terms as the IDA credit.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent economic report "Recent Trends and Development
Prospects" (1023-PAK, dated March 1, 1976) was distributed to the Executive
Directors on March 10, 1976. Country data sheets are attached as Annex I.
3.        The economic development of Pakistan since 1970 compares some-
what unfavorably with the record of rapid growth of output and exports of the
1960's. Starting with the war with India and the separation of Bangladesh,
there followed a series of poor monsoons and floods, and consequently poor
harvests. Added to this were the twin effects of deteriorating terms of
trade and world recession. The magnitude of the problem was intensified by
the loss of momentum of the "green revolution" which had been one of the
mainstays of the favorable economic period of the late 1960's. In additio1,
industrial development was discouraged by changed attitudes toward the pri-
vate sector and a series of nationalizations, beginning with the nationali-
zation of a large part of private industry in 1972. As a result, the basic
productive sectors have had an average growth of about 2% per year since
1970, although total GDP has grown by about 4% per annum because of the rapid
expansion of construction, government and other service industries.
4.        The stagnation of agricultural production during the 1970's con-
trasts with the rapid growth attained during the 1960's. This slowdown is
the result of many factors, including unfavorable growing conditions, a
slower rate of adoption of high-yielding varieties, and adverse pricing
policies. Heavy rains and floods in August 1976 have once again lowered out-
put levels below potential in the summer season. Cotton has been particularly
affected, and production is liable to be barely sufficient to meet domestic
demand. Rice and sugarcane, which reached record levels last year, show
sligFt declines due to flood damage. Wheat production in the winter season,
on the other hand, could achieve another record as a result of increased
fertilizer consumption, residual moisture left in the ground after the floods
and the use of water from the Tarbela Dam.   Fertilizer consumption, which
leveled off at about 400,000 tons when retail distribution was taken over by
the Provincia. Governments, reached 570,000 tons last year and is expected to

-2-
expand to 680,000 tons this year. This is a result of lower prices for
fertilizer and the return of the private sector to the retail distribution
field.
5.        For the next few years, further improvements from the exten-
sion of the "green revolution" technology can be expected, particularly
through increased use of fertilizer and pesticides, improved seeds and
further development of the groundwater potential. Growth thereafter will
require more fundamental change in on-farm practices regarding land and
water management, particularly in terms of increasing the efficiency of the
watercourse distribution system. Central to improved farming techniques is
an upgraded, more effective extension service, with greater emphasis on
reaching the small farmer, and with better linkages to an effective research
program. In order to increase the basic productivity of the land, a major
effort needs to be made to increase investments in projects designed to
reverse waterlogging and salinity.
6.        After agriculture, which accounts for about 32% of GDP, manufac-
turing is the second largest sector of the economy, contributing about 16%
of GDP and 50% to 60% of total exports. Since 1973, the major. change in the
industrial sector has been the expansion of the public sector, from about 10%
to about 25% of industrial assets. In January 1972, the Government took over
ownership of 31 private companies in 10 basic industrial categories. This was
followed by takeovers of the vegetable ghee industry, the cotton and rice
export trade, commercial banks, shipping, life insurance and gasoline and oil
distribution. The most recent action occurred in July 1976 when the Govern-
ment nationalized the larger units in rice and flour milling, as well as all
of the cotton gins. These actions have adversely affected the climate for
private investment, particularly in the industrial sector. It remains to be
seen what their effect on agricultural production will be.
7.        While industrial growth averaged close to 10% per annum during the
1960's, since 1970 it has been only about 3% per annum. The decline in the
growth rate is a result of a number of factors including lower private in-
vestment during the late 1960's and early 1970's and the problems with agri-
cultural production which reduced the availability of some raw materials.
Since FY74, the international recession has had a major impact by reducing
demand for Pakistan's exports, particularly textiles. Output of both cotton
yarn and cloth is estimated to have been lower in FY76 than in FY74.
8.        Exports have remained depressed for the past few years, in part
because of the international recession, while imports have increased rapidly.
Import prices increased 36% in FY74 and 27% in FY75, but in FY74 the rise was
offset by increases in major export prices, particularly of cotton and rice.
In FY75 the full effect of earlier petroleum price increases, combined with
falling export prices for most products, produced an 18% decline in the terms
of trade and a further deterioration of 12% is estimated to have taken place
in FY76. As a consequence of these developments, the deficit on the current
account of the balance of payments increased from $130 million in FY73, an
exceptionally good year, to $924 million in FY76. It is expected to rise
to about $1.1 billion in FY77. These large deficits have been financed



- 3 -
by expanded borrowings from foreign sources, particularly the OPEC countries
and the IMF. Domestic resource mobilization, on the other hand, has declined
markedly, with the overall saving rate falling from about 13% of GDP in 1973
to 6% in FY76. The decline in private savings can be traced to lower corporate
profits as well as the lag of interest rates behind the rate of inflation.
While annual price increases have averaged over 20% during the past three
years, interest rates on savings at banks have averaged only about 7-8%.
9.        In the past few years the contribution of the public sector to
domestic savings has been quite unsatisfactory. Recently a number of steps
have been taken to improve public sector resource mobilization, including
substantially higher prices of electric power, cement, petroleum products,
railway and air fares, and import tariffs. Steps have also been taken to
simplify the income tax and improve its enforcement. Subsidies of various
types which amounted to Rs 3 billion in FY75, or about 15% of current govern-
ment expenditures, are estimated to have been reduced to Rs 1.5 billion in
FY76. These revenue efforts have not been sufficient, however, to fully meet
the Government's increased spending. While public saving was positive in
FY1976, the overall budget had a deficit of Rs 4.0 billion. Despite this
deficit, wholesale prices during FY76 increased by only 8%.
10.       For the longer term, the Government is in the process of drafting
a new Plan for FY78-83 which calls for substantially higher levels of output,
exports and domestic savings. Investment levels would amount to about 19% of
GDP. With an expected decline in foreign capital available from OPEC sources,
however, this target can be reached only by sharply increasing the rate of
domestic savings to 15% of GDP by 1983. Large public sector investments are
contemplated in steel, power, fertilizers and petro-chemicals; these would
seek to reduce dependence on imports and encourage greater reliance on domes-
tic raw materials. A substantial increase in exports will depend largely on
rapid growth of agricultural output, particularly rice and cotton. The agri-
cultural strategy focuses on increased use of fertilizer and pesticides,
further mechanization, expansion of the extension services, and programs to
reduce waterlogging and salinity.
11.       The balance of payments and debt management position will be
difficult for the next few years. By the end of FY76, the total debt out-
standing, including undisbursed amounts, was about $7 billion. Debt payments
as a ratio of export earnings and workers' remittances will be about 15%, as
a result of $650 million of debt relief which is being given by the Consortium
countries for the years 1975-78. The debt service ratio is expected to rise
to 20%, and, possibly, more after 1978 since the end of the debt relief arrange-
ment coincides with a sharp increase in repayments owed to the OPEC countries
and the IMF. On the positive side, workers' remittances have risen sharply
and totalled $350 million last year; they could exceed $400 million this year.
Nevertheless, it is important that borrowing on conventional terms be held to
the minimum. For this reason the major part of Bank Group operations in
Pakistan consists of IDA credits. Including undisbursed amounts, Pakistan's
debt to the Bank and IDA now represents about 16% of its external public



-4-
indebtedness; by 1980 this ratio is likely to fall to about 13%.     The
share of the Bank Group in total debt service (after taking account of the
debt relief which Pakistan will receive from other creditors) is now about
23% but is expected to decrease to about 9% in 1980.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN PAKISTAN
12.       The cumulative total of Bank/IDA commitments to Pakistan (exclusive
of loans and credits or portions thereof which were disbursed in the former
East Pakistan) now amounts to approximately US$1.4 billion. During its long
association with Pakistan, the Bank Group has been involved in almost all
sectors of the economy. Through FY76, 43% of total commitments were for
public services, 24% for agriculture, 32% for industry, of which 12% was
for industrial imports, and 1% for education. Lending for public services
has amounted to more than $600 million and has included loans and credits
for railways, electric power, gas pipelines, Karachi Port, highways, tele-
communications and water supplies. A large part of past lending for agri-
culture was for Indus Basin projects. Apart from lending for the fertilizer
sector, lending for industry has been mainly through the Pakistan Industrial
Credit and Investment Corporation (PICIC). For most projects for which loans
and credits are being disbursed, construction is now going ahead satisfactor-
ily. The principal problems being encountered are that the rates charged by
some of the public services have not kept pace with inflation. Hence, some
utilities are not earning the return which they need. Annex II contains a
summary statement of Bank loans and IDA credits as of November 30, 1976, and
notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
13.       Lending operations in Pakistan have three main objectives.     One of
these is to support the directly productive sectors of the economy, and in
particular, to increase production of import substitutes such as foodgrains,
edible oils, fertilizer and engineering goods and to sustain export growth
in cotton yarn and textiles, rice and a large number of other industrial and
agricultural products. The main part of Bank Group assistance for industry
will continue to be through financial intermediaries, such as PICIC, which
finances the medium and large-scale private sector and will thus contribute
to exports and industrial growth, the Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan
(IDBP) for the small and medium scale industrial sector, with possible parti-
cipation by commercial banks, and the National Development Finance Corpora-
tion (NDFC) for industries in the public sector. The most important part
of future lending for agriculture is expected to be for the Government's new
program to increase productivity in the Indus Basin by controlling salinity
and improving the utilization of surface irrigation and groundwater. The
Bank is the Executing Agency for a UNDP technical assistance grant for
improving agriculture and water planning in the Indus Basin.
14.       Another objective is to support the necessary expansion and to
improve the institutions which are responsible for the principal public ser-
vices which have benefitted from Bank Group lending in the past, such as
the Telegraph and Telephone Department, Karachi Port, Water and Power



-5-
Development authority, Pakistan Railways, Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Com-
pany and the Lahore Water and Sanitation Agency. In most of these operations,
institutional improvements are being made with technical assistance financed
by the Bank Group.
15.       A third objective is to expand lending operations in other fields,
particularly those which reflect the Government's effort to bring economic
development to the poorest strata of the population. This shift implies
increased lending for agriculture and rural development and will involve
significant lending for projects complementary to the Indus/Tarbela works.
In the urban sector, Bank missions have been working with municipal authori-
ties on plans for the urban-development of Karachi, whose population now
exceeds 4 million. A Karachi master plan was completed in 1974 with the
assistance of consultants financed by UNDP, and urban projects are being
developed within the framework of this plan. A project for urban upgrading
in the Lyari section of the city has been appraised. The Government has also
asked the Bank to study urbanization problems in Lahore, Pakistan's second
largest city. Planning in Lahore is at a much earlier stage than in Karachi
and the immediate need is for technical assistance. A credit for the second
Lahore water supply, sewerage and drainage project includes provision for the
financing of urban studies in Lahore.
16.       Other projects which have been appraised are a livestock project,
a fertilizer project, a further railway project and the SCARP VI irrigation
and drainage project. Preparatory work is also proceeding on a further
irrigation and drainage project, a Karachi water supply project and projects
involving agricultural extension and rural development.
17.       IFC has made investments in nine Pakistani enterprises for a total
of US$30.2 million, of which US$22.9 million was by way of loans and US$7.3
million by equity participations (these are shown in Annex II). About US$12
million remains outstanding. The enterprises assisted by IFC include three in
the field of pulp and paper products, two in textiles, and one each in steel,
cement and fertilizers. IFC is also a shareholder of PICIC.
PART III - THE EDUCATION SECTOR
18.       Although in recent years there has been a substantial increase in
school enrollments in Pakistan, large sections of the population are still
excluded from basic education. In FY76, the primary school enrollment
ratios were 68% of the corresponding age groups for boys and 29% for girls.
In the same year, the enrollment ratios for middle and high schools were
32% and 20% for boys and only 8% and 4% for girls. These low figures reflect
not only high dropout rates but also the unequal distribution of educational
opportunities between the sexes as well as between rural and urban areas.
19.       Primary and secondary education suffers from serious problems.    In-
adequate physical facilities and teaching materials and poorly qualified and
motivated teachers are major causes of the high dropout rates. The almost



complete separation of male and female education keeps schools small. Rote
learning predominates and there has been little emphasis on the relevance of
the subjects taught. Vocational education is provided in separate vocational
schools, but enrollment is only about 10% of the corresponding high school
stage. The capacity for training professionals and sub-professionals, par-
ticularly in agriculture, is insufficient. With a few notable exceptions,
adult education (including literacy) campaigns have been unsuccessful. At
present, the adult literacy rate is estimated at about 22%.
20.       Government expenditures on education have been low.   During FY1971-
75 total public expenditures on education averaged about 5% of total gov-
ernment expenditure. Moreover, there has been a tendency for the educational
system to develop more capital intensive forms of higher education at the
expense of the lower grades.
21.       The Government is concerned about these shortcomings.    Starting in
1972, a number of important reforms are being gradually introduced. These
include free primary and secondary education, the nationalization of private
schools, the introduction of curricula with greater emphasis on agrotechnical
education, adaptation to local conditions and a better balance between mental
and manual skills. In addition, the reforms emphasize the teaching of home
economics, agricultural and industrial arts. Efforts are being made to restrict
admission to intermediate and degree level courses in arts and to encourage
enrollment increases in science.
22.       The draft Five Year Plan envisages primary enrollment goals of 85%
for boys and 49% for girls by 1981, which implies an annual growth rate
averaging 9.3% as compared to 3.4% during 1968-73. Annual expansion rates
by 8% is envisaged for the middle and high school levels. To achieve these
goals, double shifts would be extensively used to minimize new construction.
New facilities would be created for teacher training; teachers would also be
trained at high schools and colleges. Efforts would be made to equalize
access to education for females and children in less developed areas. About
80% of the new middle stage facilities would be located in rural areas. MIore
use would be made of mass media. The literacy rate is expected to increase
from 22% to 28% by 1981. The achievement of these goals will require a
substantial increase in expenditure on education.
23.       Two areas to which the Government proposes to give increased
attention are teacher training at primary and middle school levels and
training of staff for agriculture and rural development. Teacher training
is conducted in one-year courses in Teacher Training Institutes and Colleges
of Education. Present enrollment is about 11,000 in the Teacher Training
Institutes and 4,000 in Colleges of Education. In 1971-73 the Government
organized a crash training program for about 50,000 teachers. However, the
expected rapid expansion of primary school enrollments did not materialize
and there is therefore at present a temporary surplus of male primary school
teachers. On the other hand, female teachers for girls schools are in short
supply, which severely limits the expansion of female education. There is
also a shortage of teachers for secondary and higher education for agricul-
ture, industrial arts and science.



- 7 -
24.       An upgraded, more effective extension service, with greater emphasis
on reaching the small farmer. ias cri"tial to. improved farming techniques.  An
increased supply of qualified agricultural personnel would meet an important
requirement of the Government's programs for higher agricultural productivity.
The Government has set its target at 19,000 additional field assistants, to
reduce the field assistant - farmer ratio from 1:900 to 1:450 by 1986.
25.       Field assistants for agriculture are trained in two-year courses
in Agricultural Training Institutes run by the Provincial Departments of
Agriculture. The present output of the agricultural training system is
250 new field workers a year, which does not even provide for the annual
turnover of current staff. Improvement of the agricultural extension service
requires both an improvement in the quality of pre-service training and more
frequent in-service training. Higher education in agriculture is mainly pro-
vided by the Lyallpur Agricultural University and the Sind Agricultural Uni-
versity in Tandojam. The Lyallpur Agricultural University has an enrollment
of 3,000 and the Sind Agricultural University 1,420, including 200 students
in two-year certificate courses.
26.       IDA has made two credits for education in Pakistan.    In March
1964 a credit of US$8.5 million (Credit 50-PAK) was made to finance equip-
ment for six polytechnic institutes, to expand the Agricultural University
at Lyallpur, and to provide technical assistance. In August 1970 a credit
of US$4 million (Credit 206-PAK) was made to reconstruct and relocate an
engineering college in Karachi. The first project was one of the first
education projects financed by the Bank Group. It was subject to prolonged
delays due to several factors including two wars and floods. However, the
project is now completed and the benefits are being realized through in-
creased output of improved agricultural and technical manpower. The second
project is about three years behind schedule and was about 75% complete by
the original Closing Date of December 1976. Delays have principally occurred
in executing the technical assistance component of the Project. An action
program has recently been formulated for the remaining project activities
and the Association has agreed to extend the Closing Date to December 1978
as soon as required technical specialists have been appointed.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
27.       The proposed project was identified and prepared with the assis-
tance of UNESCO in 1974 and 1975. It was appraised in April/May 1975. Sub-
sequent to appraisal, the Government requested modifications to the project,
mainly because of budgetary constraints. The revised project, as worked out
jointly by Government officials and Bank staff, incorporates suitable economies
in design. It was also established that more economical use of existing facil-
ities would allow certain project components to be deferred or deleted with-
out undermining project objectives. Negotiations were held in Washington
during December 1976. The Pakistan delegation was led by Dr. Tahir Hussain,



-8-
Joint Educational Adviser, Ministry of Education. The Appraisal Report (No.
905a-PAK) on the project is being circulated separately. A credit and project
summary is attached as Annex III.
28.       The proposed project is aimed at expanding and improving primary
and middle education (grades 1 through 8) by increasing the supply of qual-
ified teachers, particularly for children in rural areas and females; and at
increasing the supply of trained personnel for agricultural and rural devel-
opment. The project consists of two major components and related technical
assistance:
(a) the improvement of basic education by the expansion, con-
struction or reconstruction of 17 Teacher Training
Institutes (TTIs) for primary and middle stage teachers,
the execution of the second phase of an adult education
pilot project, and the carrying out of a study of future
demand for female teachers; and
(b) the improvement of agricultural education by the expan-
sion or reconstruction of six Agricultural Training
Institutes (ATI), the remodeling and equipping of the
Sind Agricultural University at Tandojam, and the carry-
ing out of studies of training programs for irrigated
agriculture and water management and of projected supply
and demand for agricultural manpower.
Basic Education
29.       Teacher Training Institutes.   The project will increase the enroll-
ment capacity of the TTIs from 2,800 to 5,000, representing increases of 10%
in the capacity for training male teachers and 50% for training female teach-
ers. Given the number of qualified female applicants available, the expan-
sion provided by the project represents the maximum considered to be feasible.
The TTIs would be provided with multipurpose workshops, laboratories, teaching
aids and furniture. Facilities would be provided for practice teaching and
demonstration of teaching methods. Boarding places for about 2,440 students,
for whom commuting distances would be excessive, are included. To ensure that
teachers are adequately trained, the Government has agreed that within one
year from the date of the credit Agreement at least nine months of full-time
training will be required for obtaining teacher certificates (Section 3.08 of
the credit Agreement).
30.       Pilot Project and Study.   At present a pilot adult literacy program
is being undertaken by Pakistan Television Corporation (PTV) with the assist-
ance of UNICEF. The proposed IDA project includes the second phase of this
program. The techniques currently used would be refined and the target group
extended from 24,000 to 96,000 villagers. Teaching materials oriented towards
nutrition, hygiene, child care and basic agricultural skills would be used.
The study of supply and demand for female teachers would cover the period 1977
to 1987 and would recommend plans for overcoming imbalances. This study may
lead to a further education project in due course.



Agricultural and Rural Development Education
31.       Agricultural Training Institutes.   Four of five existing ATIs would
be expanded and one would be reconstructed at a new location. All five insti-
tutes would offer both pre-service and in-service training. The pre-service
training capacity would be expanded from 600 to 1,280 places, increasing the
annual output from 250 to about 640 a year. The project would aim at improv-
ing the quality of training by integrating the present separate crop and animal
husbandry courses, by making the training more relevant by introducing new
courses and by requiring that at least half of the two year pre-service course
is spent in farming practice and field demonstrations. At each ATI, farmer
leader training programs (180 places) would be established.
32.       Sind Agricultural University.   The present academic facilities
at Sind Agricultural University would be remodeled and equipped, and board-
in facilities provided for 80 students. In addition to the three existing
Faculties of Agriculture, Agricultural Engineering and Animal Husbandry/Vet-
erinary Medicine, a new Department of Agricultural Education, Extension and
Short Courses would be established for programs of teacher training in agri-
cultural education and extension. The present enrollment capacity of 1420
would be increased by 40 to 60 places in the newly created department. An
educational development plan would be formulated for the university in con-
sultation with the Association; enrollment would not be increased further
until this plan has been completed (Section 2.08 of the draft Project Agree-
ment with Sind Province).
33.       Studies on Irrigated Agriculture and Water Management Training.
Tte study on training needs for irrigated agriculture and water management
would assess existing curricula and long-term manpower requirements and recom-
mend development programs. A province-by-province study of projected supply
and demand of middle-level agricultural manpower in the period 1977 and
1987, together with proposals for overcoming imbalances in the context of
the Government's proposed agricultural and rural development programs, would
also be carried out. A further project for possible IDA assistance may
emerge from the studies.
Technical Assistance
34.       About 28 man-years of specialists' services would be used for va-
rious purposes connected with the Teachers Training Institutes, the Agricul-
tural Training Institutes and the Sind Agricultural University, including
assistance in organization and management, curriculum development and train-
ing methods. Specialist services will also be required for the studies on
irrigated agriculture and water management and manpower studies. The fellow-
ships (about 60 man-years) would be used for study abroad by the staff of the
Agricultural Training Institutes and the Sind Agricultural University.

Prolect Implementation
35.       A Federal Project Unit has been established within the Federal
Ministry of Education, which would coordinate and carry out functions that
are most conveniently performed centrally, such as international procurement,
recruitment of specialists and administration of technical assistance. As
the project institutions are located in all four provinces, each province
will assign staff in the line department concerned for obtaining architectural
services, selection of fellowship candidates and local procurement of civil
works, furniture and equipment. Special revolving funds would be established
in each province for project implementation    (Section 2.06 of the Project
Agreements). Establishment of, and payment of the initial deposits into these
revolving funds would be a condition of the effectiveness of the Credit
(Section 6.01 (b) of the Credit Agreement).
36.       Construction is scheduled to start in mid-1977 and the physical
facilities should be completed by 1981. The technical assistance program
would start in 1977. The whole project is expected to be completed by
December 1981.
37.       Except in Sind, the provinces would use the provincial public works
departments for design, tendering and supervision, supplemented where necessary
by local consultants and the project architect. The services of local con-
sulting firms have been obtained for the design of the institutes located in
the Sind Province including the Sind Agricultural University. All the sites
for the new and relocated schools have been selected and most have been
acquired. Preliminary equipment lists have been prepared and submitted to
the Association for approval, and terms of reference and operation plans for
the pilot program and studies have been prepared. Acceptable sketch plans
have already been prepared for most project institutions.
38.       The Government has agreed (Section 3.07 of the Credit Agreement)
to establish a tracer system covering all the schools in the project to
collect information on applicants, enrollment, the number of graduates and
their employment as well as other data. This information, which would assist
the Government in its future education planning, would be made available to
the Association.
Cost and Financing
39.       The total project cost is estimated at US$27.2 million equivalent
inclusive of duties and taxes (US$2.1 million equivalent). Of this amount,
about US$11.1 million would be in foreign exchange. A summary breakdown of
costs is given in Annex III. The proposed credit would cover about 60% of
net of tax costs, and would finance the foreign exchange cost and about
US$3.9 million of local costs. The remainder of the required financing would
be provided by the Government. Retroactive financing, estimated at up to
$40,000, is proposed for expenditures incurred on architectural services since



May 1, 1976. At full operating capacity, the project would require an esti-
mated PRs 18 million (US$1.8 million equivalent) at 1976 prices in incremental
annual operating costs; this is expected to be less than 1% of the projected
total public recurrent expenditure on education in FY 1980.
Procurement and Disbursement
40.       Previous experience with education projects in Pakistan suggests
that, because of the small size of the civil works contracts involved (esti-
mated to range from US$0.1 million to US$0.6 million equivalrhnt) and the
geographical dispersion of the sites, foreign firns are unlikely to bid.
Civil works contracts under the project would therefore be awarded on the
basis of locally advertised competitive bidding in accordance vith -!-ern-
ment procurement procedures acceptable to the Association; foreign firm~s,
however, would be allowed to participate in the bidding if they so wished.
Equipment and furniture contracts would, to the extent feasible, be grouped
to permit bulk procurement. Equipment and furniture contracts in excess of
US$50,000 would be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding
in accordance with Bank Group procurement guidelines. Contracts for equipment
and furniture which cannot be reasonably grouped in packages exceeding $50,000
would be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally in
accordance with procedures acceptable to the Association. Miscellaneous items,
subject to a maximum of US$10,000 per contract and an aggregate of US$250,000,
may be purchased by local shopping. Books would be procured in accordance
with Government procedures. The total value of equipment and furniture to
be purchased by local bidding is estimated at about US$1.8 equivalent. The
credit would be disbursed over a period of about five years to meet: (a) 100%
of the foreign expenditures for furniture and equipment or 100% of the ex-
factory cost of locally manufactured furniture and equipment, or 85% of local
expenditures for furniture and equipment purchased off-the-shelf; (b) 45% of
the total expenditure for civil works and related professional services; and
(c) 100% of the foreign expenditures of overseas training and 100% of total
expenditure for project specialists.
Benefits and Risks
41.       The proposed expenditures on Teacher Training Institutes would
facilitate the expansion of enrollments in primary schools from the present
level of 5.1 million to 7.5 million by 1985; a large number of these addi-
tional students would be girls. It would also assist the introduction of
improved curricula. The proposed pilot schemes for adult literacy programs
would seek to develop a comprehensive strategy for carrying out the Govern-
ment's intensified effort to improve educational opportunities among less
developed regions and groups. The assistance to the Agricultural Training
Institutes would contribute to agricultural growth throughout the country
by enabling the Government to reduce the ratio of field assistants to far-
mers from the present 1:900 to 1:450 by 1986. The improvement of the Sind
Agricultural University would enhance the quality of agricultural graduates
who serve Sind and two less-developed regions, Baluchistan and Azad Kashmir.



- 12 -
The Government's requirements for agricultural graduates in these regions
would be met through an output of about 1,300 graduates by 1986. The pro-
posed studies would identify further training needs and would provide a
basis for future investment. Project risks are no greater than can normally
be expected with operations of this type.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
42.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Islamic Republic
of Pakistan and the Association, draft Project Agreement between the Associa-
tion and the Provinces of Baluchistan, North West Frontier, the Punjab and
Sind, respectively, the Recommendations of the Committee provided for in
Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a draft
resolution approving the proposed credit are being distributed to the Execu-
tive Directors separately. Special conditions of the credit are listed in
Section III of Annex IV. Establishment and payment of the initial deposits
into the project revolving funds would be a condition of effectiveness. Other-
wise the draft agreements conform to the normal pattern for development cre-
dits for education projects.
43.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
44.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Loan No. 548         Tarbela Dam:  US$25.0 Million Loan of July 10, 1968;
Effective Date: August 2, 1968; Closing Date: Dec-
ember 31, 1977
The Loan is intended for residual financing, and disbursements
began in March 1975. On September 29, 1973, the Indus River was diverted
through tunnels on schedule to enable the final stage -- the construction
of the closure section of the dam -- to be undertaken. By June 30, 1974,
the main embankment had been completed to full height, and the first
impoundment began on schedule in July 1974. In early August, difficulties
were encountered in the operation of the tunnel gates and damage to one
of the tunnels necessitated the emptying of the reservoir, in the course
of which further damage was incurred. A program of remedial works is
nearing completion. Agreement was reached with the parties to the Indus
Basin and Tarbela Development Fund Agreements whereby special contributions
were made by a number of the parties and IDA (Credit 581-PAK) to help meet
the costs of the repairs and additional remedial works. Meanwhile, the
reservoir was filled to within 20 ft. of the maximum pool level in the sum-
mer of 1975 and irrigation releases have been made through the Service and
Auxiliary Spillways. In the course of tests to the stilling basins further
damage was incurred in April 1976. A program of remedial measures is under-
way and Stilling Basin 3 is scheduled to be completed in May 1977.
Loan No. 621         Railways:  US$14.5 Million Loan of June 26, 1969; Effect-
ive Date: August 28, 1969; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
About 80% of the Loan has been committed, and it is anticipated
that the project will be virtually complete by June 1977. To provide for
reimbursement of commissioning expenses during the following year, however,
the Closing Date, formerly D)ecember 31, 1975, has been extended to June 30,
1978. The main outstanding item is construction of the first stage of a
new marshalling yard at Pipri, near Karachi. The location of this yard
was changed twice following protracted investigations and negotiations bet-
ween various agencies and planning authorities. Consultants have modified
the design of the yard for the new location, selected to reconcile urban
planning and railway marshalling objectives, and construction is underway.
While progress on improvements to the main line, which will permit removal
of speed restrictions, has been rather slow, a new timetable for passenger
and goods trains was introduced in November 1975. This should help to

tion of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

improve utilization of motive power and rolling stock, especially freight
wagons, eventually producing large cost savings.
Credit No. 177       Development Finance Company - IDBP:   US$20.0 Million
Credit of February 11, 1970; Effective Date: June 25,
1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1977
Amendments to the Credit Documents became effective on April 25,
1974. These enabled IDBP to resume utilizing IDA funds to finance Pakistan
industry without bearing the financial risk, pending settlement of its lia-
bilities with respect to projects it had financed in Bangladesh. The original
Closing Date of December 31, 1974 was then postponed to December 31, 1977.
The Credit has been fully allocated by IDA and only $1.0 million remained
undisbursed as of November 30, 1976. The Bangladesh liabilities issue is no
longer a problem. The major problem remaining is the large arrears in IDBP's
portfolio and its consequent effect on liquidity. The liquidity problem has
been eased with Government assistance but the long-term portfolio prospects
will depend mainly on developments in the textile sector which accounts for
a large portion of IDBP's outstandings.
Credit No. 206       Engineering Education:  US$4.0 Million Credit of
June 29, 1970; Effective Date: July 14, 1971; Closing
Date: December 31, 1976
The physical facilities of the project are nearing completion about
three years behind appraisal schedule and are expected to be in full use by
mid 1977 except for about 15% of the equipment purchases, which are linked to
the Technical Assistance program. This program will require at least two years
extension of the Closing Date because of delayed recruitment of experts and
fellows. The staffing situation shows some signs of improvements following
substantial salary increases in early 1976. Project costs are expected to
exceed the appraisal estimates by 98% in rupee terms, but total project costs
are unlikely to exceed the appraisal estimate of US$6.3 million due to the
1972 devaluation of the rupee. Disbursement remains slow, about 63% of the
appraisal estimate.
Credit No. 213      Power Transmission and Distribution:    US$23.0 Million
Credit of August 13, 1970; Effective Date: December 11,
1970; Closing Date: June 30, 1977
Since the extension of the Closing Date to June 30, 1977, project
implementation has been improving. As consultant services terminated on
September 30, 1976, WAPDA will continue supervision of construction until
the project is completed.

Credit No. 422-PAK Third Karachi Port: US$18.0 Million Credit of July 19,
1973; Effective Date: December 14, 1973; Closing
Date: June 30, 1979
Work has commenced on both the Juna Bunder shipping berths and
Napier Mole Bridge sites. Some contractor organizational and technical prob-
lems have delayed commencement of the permanent works at Juna Bunder. Work has
started on the abutments of the new bridge. Permanent way materials and water
pipes and fittings are being rezeived. Over 90% of the Credit allocation has
been committed.
Credit No. 492-PAK Fourth Karachi Port: US$16.0 Million Credit of July 8,
1974; Effective Date: September 18, 1974; Closing
Date: December 31, 1979
The two lowest bids for construction of the oil berth were reviewed
in detail by KPT and, since the lowest bidder refused to delete numerous
conditions from the bid, an acceptable contract was negotiated with the next
lowest and signed by KPT in June 1976. The foreign exchange component of the
bid was twice that included in the appraisal estimates. Oil berth construction
has been delayed but completion is scheduled by November 1977.
Loan No. 961         Industrial Investment:  US$25.0 Million Loan of
January 31, 1974; Effective Date: April 3, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The Loan was made to the Government to be administered by PICIC
rather than directly to PICIC pending settlement of PICIC's foreign cur-
rency liabilities with respect to projects it had financed in Bangladesh.
This problem has been solved. PICIC's major problem is a substantial volume
of arrears which has accummulated as a result of the difficulties of the
private sector over the last few years, particularly textiles. PICIC, in
cooperation with GOP, have undertaken a number of remedial measures and the
situation is now improving. The loan has been fully committed and disburse-
ments amounted to $18.0 million on November 30, 1976.
Credit No. 466       Flood Rehabilitation:  US$35.0 Million Credit of
January 31, 1974; Effective Date: April 3, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976
The general imports and civil works categories of this credit have
been fully disbursed. The original Closing Date of June 30, 1975 has been

Loan No. 988         Multan Fertilizer:  US$35.0 Million Loan of May 24,
1974; Effective Date: July 30, 1974; Closing Date:
June 30, 1977
Delays and escalating prices for civil works and, to a lesser
extent, for foreign equipment have raised the total project cost above the
appraisal estimate by about 83 (US$88 million). Construction delays have
been due to a shortage of civil contractors' capacity in Pakistan and to late
deliveries of critical equipment. Project completion is currently forecast to
be about 16 months longer than the appraisal estimate. The project's economic
return is still close to 30%, because of higher forecast international fertil-
izer prices. The company has secured all but US$16 million of the extra
financing required, in equity from the Government and the foreign partner,
and in debt from local banks. The additional funds needed are being sought
in equity. The project's corporate and field management has been strengthened.
Craftsmen and field supervisors from Europe have recently been hired to expe-
dite plant construction.
Credit No. 510       Third Telecommunications:   US$36.0 Million Credit of
September 12, 1974; Effective Date: October 25, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
The project covered by this Credit is proceeding satisfactorily
though somewhat behind schedule. Procurement action for all the main equip-
ment items is well advanced. T&T was required under Credit Agreements of
145-PAK and of 510-PAK to be reorganized to function more effectively along
commercial lines and to be given a greater degtee of autonomy. This reorgan-
ization has not yet been effected. The delay in introducing a satisfactory
reorganization has recently been taken up again with the Government.
Credit No. 546       National Development Finance Corporation (NDFC):   US$30.0
Million Credit of May 15, 1975: Effective Date: July 17,
1975; Closing Date: September 30, 1979
During 1975, the National Development Finance Corporation (NDFC)
rapidly expanded its level of business with cumulative loan approvals total-
ling Rs 670 million and has forecast further expansion during the calendar
year 1976. To meet the new levels of business, NDFC has substantially in-
creased both its domestic currency resource position and its professional
staffing. NDFC forecast that the IDA credit will be fully allocated by mid
1977 and disbursed by December 1978. As at November 30, 1976, US$21.2 million
of the credit had been allocated and US$6.4 million disbursed.

Date: December 31, 1979
Pipeline construction work is proceeding on schedule but installa-
tion of the two purification and dehydration banks will be delayed beyond
the planned date of June 1977 because of delays in preparing tender docu-
ments and evaluating bids. One of the banks should be installed by
December 1977 and contingency plans have been made for the winter season
