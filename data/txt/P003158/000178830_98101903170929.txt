INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF ZAMBIA
FOR A COMMERCIAL CROPS FARKING DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
l.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US $5.5 million to
the Republic of Zambia for a Commercial Crops Farming Development Project.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        In November 1968, the Z'mbian Government requested a Bank loan
for the expansion of production of flue-cured tobacco and the develop-
ment of commercial farming. The application was based on a report pre-
pared by the Government with assistance from the Permanent Mission in
Eastern Africa. The project was appraised in December 1968. Following
the appraisal, the Government proposed certain changes in the structure
of the project which were reviewed by a second mission in June 1969. In
the course of further discussions with the Bank, the Government indicated
that it wished to reconsider some other details of the project. Negotia-
tions were finally completed in April 1970. The Zambian delegation was
led by Mr. U. A. McInnes, Under Secretary, Budget Office, Ministry of
Development and Finance. The other members of the delegation were:
Mr. G. A. Zaza, Assistant Secretary, Budget Office, Ministry of Develop-
ment and Finance; Mr. N. C. Chibowa, Chief Agricultural Economist, Minis-
try of Rural Development; Mr. G. A. White, Principal (Legal Questions),
Ministry of Rural Development; Mr. M. Chaila, Attorney, Solicitor
General's Office; Mr. W. R. Mondelah, Chairman, Tobacco Board of Zambia,
Mr. J. J. Costelloe, Chief Accountant, Tobacco Board of Zambia; and
Mr. D. R. Mackay, Project Manager, Tobacco Board of Zambia.
3.        Prior to Zambia's independence in October 1964, the Bank made
two loans for railways in what were then Northern and Southern Rhodesia
and two loans to the Central African Power Corporation (CAPC), jointly
owned by Zambia and Southern Rhodesia, for the first stage of the Kariba
project and for transmission. Zambia assumed responsibility for its
share of these loans, which are guaranteed by the United Kingdom. The
following is a summary statement of these loans and of the five loans
made after independence to Zambia, as of March 31, 1970:

4.        Since June 1, 1966, CAPC has been unable to obtain the foreign
exchange from Southern Rhodesia and Zambia for payments under the 1956
and 1964 loans (Loans 14'-RN and 392-RNS).   Zambia and the United Kingdom
have each made one-half of these payments as guarantors.
5.        Ongoing projects in Zambia are generally proceeding satisfac-
torily, except for the forestry project (Loan 562-ZA) which has en-
countered both staffing and technical problems. These have required
close supervision.   Progress is now being made towards a solution to the
technical problems, which arose with a particular species of tree. A

with the dissolution of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland at
the end of 1963.
2/ Amount guaranteed by Zambia, i.e., one-half of loan.



- 3 -
supervision mission is now in Zambia to work out proposals to resolve
the staffing problems, as well as the changes that may be necessary in the
organization of the Industrial Forestry Department, which is responsible
for the project. The undisbursed balance of $5.9 million of the 1966 road
loan (469-ZA) reflects in part the existence of claims between the Govern-
ment and contractors that have yet to be resolved. It also reflects the
fact that the cost estimates for the project included an unusually large
allowance for contingencies, in view of the uncertainties arising at the
time of appraisal from the Unilateral Declaration of Independence by
Southern Rhodesia. The full amount provided for contingencies is unlikely
to be required and some part of the loan may be cancelled at the closing
date.
6.        The Bank has appraised a second Kariba project, consisting
principally of the construction of a 600 NW generating station on the
North Bank of the Zambezi River at Kariba to complement the existing
station on the South Bank. It is hoped that negotiations for a Bank
loan of about $40 million can be started shortly. It is probable that
a loan for a second livestock project, now under preparation, will be
ready for consideration by the Executive Directors in the course of the
next fiscal year.

PART III - THE PROJECT
8.        An appraisal report entitled "Commercial Crops Farming Development
Project - Zambia" (No. PA-28A dated May 8, 1970) is attached.  The project
would assist the Zambian Government in financing schemes for training,
settling and supervising Zambian commercial farmers and in expanding pro-
duction of maize and flue-cured Virginia tobacco.
9.        About half the population of Zambia is engaged in agriculture,
but there are still very few Zambian commercial farmers. Commercial
farming, concentrated north and south-west of Lusaka along the "line of
rail" from the south to the Copper Belt, has largely been in the hands of
non-Zambians whose farms have produced almost all the tobacco for export
and a large part of the maize, livestock and fresh milk sold in Zambia.
The number of expatriate farmers has been declining since independence, and
those who remain have tended to limit their reinvestment and, as wages have
increased, to switch to less labor intensive activities such as livestock.
As a consequence, there has been a marked decline in maize and flue-cured
tobacco production, which has not been offset by sufficiently rapid growth
in cash crop production by Zambians. Production of flue-cured tobacco
reached a peak of 24.2 million lbs. in 1964 but has latterly declined to
about half that level. Maize prodcction has declined from over 4 million
bags of 200 lbs. in good years to less than 3 million bags in 1969, when
Zambia had to import substantial amounts to satisfy local needs.
10.       The Government is now making serious efforts to increase as
rapidly as possible the number of qualified Zambians entering commercial
crop production, as well as to encourage production by expatriate farmers.
The proposed project is in line with this policy. It is concentrated on
arresting the decline in tobacco production at a time when Zambia could
profitably sell more tobacco on world markets, and increasing the productior±
of maize, the basic foodstuff in Zambia, to assure self-sufficiency and,
in good years, to provide a surplus for export, particularly to the Katanga
region; of neighboring Congo (Kinshasa), which has a shortage. A combination
of maize and tobacco growing offers attractive financial returns to farmers.
11.       The project will be carried out on behalf of the Government, by
the Tobacco Board of Zambia (TBZ) a statutory board created in April 1968.
TBZ has full powers in the tobacco field, including promotion, control and
regulation of production, marketing and export, research, operation of
tobacco auction floors and packing plants. The Board is financed by funds
obtained from operating an auction floor and packing plant, by levies paid
by growers and by funds from the Government. The Board has recently been
strengthened by the appointment of a full-time Executive Chairman. The
Government is now preparing amendments to the Tobacco Act to give TBZ legal
power to operate the Mukonchi Scheme (see para. 13) and participate itself
in the production of tobacco, in addition to its existing marketing
responsibilities.



- 5 -
12.       Several types of tobacco are grown in Zambia, but by far the
most important is Virginia flue-cured. During recent years British
manufacturers purchased 60% of Zambia's production, local cigarette
manufacturers approximately 25% and the remainder was exported to Europe.
Zambia's tobacco has characteristics similar to the Southern Rhodesia
crop and Zambia now sells its entire production to manufacturers who used
to buy from Southern Rhodesia. Taking into consideration present and
estimated future demand, it is expected that Zambia will be able to main-
tain its share of the market in the event of Southern Rhodesia's again
becoming a major exporter. The farms included in the project will also
grow maize and each farmer will cultivate an area of maize twqice as large
as that under tobacco.
13.       The Mukonchi Training Unit, which has been placed under the
TBZ is located in the Central Province, north of Lusaka. The unit has
been modelled on a highly successful training scheme in Malawi under the
management of the Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC), which is
also managing Mukonchi. The Training Unit consists of ten nucleus
estates of 350 acres each. The nucleus estates operate as commercial
farms in addition to providing training facilities.  At present, Mulkonchi
trains 25 new farmers each year. Under the proposed project, the training
capacity at Mukonchi will be doubled. Farmers will undergo a training
period of four years after which they will be settled on farms developed
under the second part of the project as described below.
14.       The second component of the project would be the development of
new farms, consisting of 270 farms of about 170 acres which would support
an annual production of 20 acres of tobacco and 40 acres of maize, and
approximately 30 farms of 500 acres each which would support 60 acres
of tobacco and 120 acres of maize annually. The 170 acre farms would be
allotted to graduates of INIukonchi and to other Zambian farmers with
adequate experience. In both cases the farmers would be supervised and
assisted by the i'ukonchi staff and, for purposes of the project, are
classified as "assisted tenant farmers". The 500 acre farms would be
made available to Zambian and non-Zambian farmers, who are fully capable
of handling their farms without assistance. These are classified as
"tenant farmers". Zambian farmers, whether "assisted tenants" or
"tenants", would purchase long-term leases, generally for 99.years, over
a period of 20 years at 7 percent interest. Non-Zambian farmers, of
whom there are expected to be about 12, would not be eligible for lease-
hold titles, but would pay an annual rent equivalent to 6-¼4 percent of
the value of fixed assets of their farms.
15.       Finally, the project would also provide for one specialist in
small holder tobacco growing to enable TBZ to prepare and implement the
so-called "One-Acre Scheme". Under this Scheme, small farmers who
usually cultivate one acre or less, will be trained and supervised in
growing tobacco. This type of scheme has been successful elsewhere in
Africa where high cash returns are possible with tobacco and the parti-
cipants are given close supervision. During the current season a small
number of "one-acre farmers" will be growing their first crop.  The



- 6 -
Government hss emphasized the importance it attaches to this scheme,
from wyhich it hopes to acquire valuable experience for the preparation of
a large-scale--possibly country-wide--"one-acre scheme" project.
16.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US $11.4 million
equivalent. The proposed Bank loan of $5.5 million would cover the
estimated foreign exchange component representing 50% of total project
costs. The Government will make annual grants to the TBZ to cover the
remaining costs of the project. It is possible that the CDC will lend
the Zambian Government US $1.4 million equivalent in support of the
proposed scheme; but should that loan not be forthcoming, the Government's
obligation to the Bank to meet the local costs of the project is unaf-
fected. The economic rate of return from investment in the tenant and
assisted tenant schemes is approximately 19%.
17.       Contracts for equipment and materials amounting to US $30,000
equivalent or more, and contracts for construction and development amounting
to US $140,000 equivalent or more, would be awarded on the basis of
international competitive bidding. Contracts for lesser amounts would
be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding in Zambia, in compliance
with existing Zambian legislation covering civil works contracts and
in accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AhD AUTHORITY
18.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Government of Zambia and
the Bank, the draft Project Agreement between the Tobacco Board of Zambia
and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of a Resolution
approving the proposed Loan are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately.
19.       The provisions of the draft Loan and Project Agreements generally
conform to the pattern of Bank Agricultural loans of this type.
PART V - THE ECONOMI-Y
20.       The last economic report entitled "Economic Position and
Prospects of Zambia" was distributed.to the Executive Directors on
August 27, 1968. A new economic report is under preparation and will be
distributed to the Executive Directors in the near future.
21.       The copper industry is the most important sector of Zambia's
economy. It contributes about 42% of GDP and 95% of exports. Copper
prices have been rising steadily since the end of 1968 and are now at
a record level of 55% above the November 1968 level. This has put the
economy in a strong position; there have been substantial budget surpluses
and large reserves of foreign exchange have been accumulated. The future
of copper prices is uncertain, but they would have to decline considerably
before the government would have to face serious internal or external
problems.



- 7 -
22.       In August 1969, the Government announced its intention to take
a 51 percent shareholding in the copper mining companies and negotiations
for the take-over have been completed. At the same time, changes in the
taxation system were introduced under wzhich the royalties and export
taxes based on copper production and prices were abolished and replaced
by a new mineral tax based on profits. These reforms had two purposes.
They were designed to curtail foreign influence in the leading sector of
the economy and to give Government a direct control over it, and to
encourage mineral production by attracting new mining interests. The
previous mining concessions in perpetuity have been replaced by 25-year
leases in areas where mines are in operation. Elsewhere, to encourage
the entry of new companies, the areas covered by existing prospecting and
exploration licenses have been considerably reduced.
23.       Since 1964, agricultural production has hardly increased at
all; its share in GDP has declined from 11% to about 7% in 1968. At the
same time, food imports have increased rapidly and have reached about
10% of total imports in 1969. Agricultural production has been hampered
by the exodus of European farmers after Independence, and the slow pace
at which African farmers could be brought into the market system. In
its attempt to diversify the economy, the Government has been spending
a growing share of its recurrent and capital budget for agriculture.
24.       The most dynamic sector of the economy during the last few
years has been manufacturing. It now contributes about 10% to GDP and
has surpassed trade as the second largest productive sector. The rapid
growth of manufacturing is the result of import substitution, in particular
of imports of manufactured consumer goods from Rhodesia following its
Unilateral Declaration of Independence, and of the active role which
Government is playing in the promotion of industrial activities through
its Industrial Development Corporation.
25.       For many years to come, Zambia's creditworthiness will remain
dependent on the fortune of her copper industry. Copper prices are
expected to fall gradually to an "equilibrium level" of some 50 US cents
per pound by about 1974. Given this assumption, foreign exchange reserves
would reach a level of almost two years of merchandise imports by 1973.
In spite of its high budget surplus the government is pursuing a cautious
expenditure policy in order not to put too much strain an the economy.
Zambia's external debt at the end of 1968 stood at US $264 million. Debt
service represents about 5% of the annual foreign exchange earnings.
Zambia's strong internal and external financial position justifies
borrowing from abroad on conventional terms, but the Government considers
as a matter of general policy that borrowing at this time should be
limited to the financing of projects accompanied by a substantial element
of technical assistance.

PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
26.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECONEEWDATION
27.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
