Providing Legal Aid for Poor Women in Ecuador                                                           July 1, 2002
                      Twenty percent of households in Ecuador are headed by women - women who are more vulnerable to
                      the threat of poverty than any other group in society.  

                      The economic crisis of the 1990's brought them new risks.  Women seeking to collect social welfare
                      benefits, to escape abusive home situations, even to register their newborn children faced increasing
                      obstacles and petty corruption. 

                      In 1996, Ecuador launched a judicial reform project to provide legal services that respond to the needs
of women.  The "Law and Justice" component of the project, which was partially financed with a $10.7 million World Bank
loan, undertook reforms that lent support to non-governmental organizations working to provide free legal services to
disenfranchised women.  This was the first World Bank-financed project to include a legal aid component aimed squarely at
poor women and their children.

"Legal Aid for Poor Women" provided legal consultation and representation, counseling, and dispute resolution services to
almost 17,000 poor women.  It also assisted another 50,000 indirect beneficiaries, most of whom were the children of women
making use of these services.  Through this program, women gained a greater awareness and understanding of their rights. 
The evident success of the program has inspired other governments to examine similar initiatives, and plans are underway to
replicate it in Sri Lanka and Jordan.
