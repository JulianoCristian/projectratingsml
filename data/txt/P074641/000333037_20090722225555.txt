general population; (b) strengthening of treatment, care and support for persons living
with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA); and (c) strengthening Jamaica's multi-sectoral capacity to
respond to the epidemic.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country Background. Jamaica is the t hird largest i sland i n t he C aribbean r egion, w ith a
population of 2.8 million. The country has been a stable democracy since its independence from
the United Kingdom in 1962. Since the early 1990s, the Government has followed a program of
macroeconomic stabilization (introduced in 1991) which focused on tight fiscal and monetary
policies, reducing inflation rates, maintaining strict fiscal discipline, greater openness to trade,
market liberalization and reduction in the size of Government. In the early 1990s, the overall
poverty ratio was roughly 30% (population living below the poverty line). After a period of
steady growth, Jamaica underwent a financial crisis in 1996, which was followed by four years of
negative growth. Nevertheless, by 2001, when the Human Immuno-Deficiency Virus/Acquired
Immune Deficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS) Prevention project was under preparation, the overall
poverty ratio had been reduced by roughly 40% to 16.8%. The fiscal situation stabilized and
GDP rose by 1.1% in 2001 and 2002. This growth demonstrated a resilience by Jamaica given
that it occurred despite multiple shocks in 2001: an outbreak of violence in Jamaica's capital
Kingston; a drop in tourism as a result of the September 11 events; and extensive floods in
November 2001, w hich d amaged one -fifth o f Jamaica's c rop a creage. H owever, Jamaica's
economy remained vulnerable, with a large debt overhang of 131% of GDP in 2002, one of the
highest among the Bank's IBRD borrowers.

Sector Background. In 2001/2002, Jamaica's national health expenditures were roughly 9% of
GDP and overall health indicators were generally more favorable than those in other countries of
Latin America and the Caribbean at similar income levels. However, while life expectancy was
relatively high, the levels of infant and maternal mortality were also high. The Government faced
continued challenges, i ncluding i mproving t he ov erall health sector performance, i mproving
sustainability in an overextended public health system, rationalizing the division of labor between
public and private sectors, addressing the growing burden of non-communicable diseases (60% of
the total disease burden), and a growing HIV/AIDS epidemic with prevalence estimated at 1.5-
2% ( 24,000 to 32,000 p eople - t he t hird largest population living w ith H IV/AIDS i n t he
Caribbean after Haiti and the Dominican Republic.)

Jamaica's first AIDS case was diagnosed in 1982, and by 2002, 5,100 AIDS cases were reported,
50 percent of which were recorded in the four preceding years. Lack of access to antiretrovirals
and unsystematic access to treatment of opportunistic infections resulted in very high annual
mortality rates (60%). Also, given that 85% of HIV/AIDS cases were in the 20-59 age group, the
economic effect on these households was also significant. HIV incidence was particularly high
among young people, resulting in higher prevalence rates among the young: 2.5% and 2.0% in the
15-19 and 25-29 age groups of Antenatal Clinic (ANC) attendees, respectively. HIV infections
among young females (ages 10-19) were 2 to 3 times higher than in males. Overall, women have
represented 40% of all AIDS cases since the start of the epidemic.

HIV transmission rates were and remain primarily heterosexual in nature (roughly 60% of AIDS
cases). Mother-to-child transmission accounted for 8% , m en-having s ex w ith m en (MSM)
transmission accounted for 6%, 25% reported as "unknown transmission" (the majority of these
reported AIDS cases were male). The main risk factors associated with the high heterosexual
transmission rates and the growing epidemic are: (i) early start of sexual activities, with 41% of
young males ( ages 12- 14) r eported a s s exually a ctive; ( ii) m ultiplicity of sexual p artners
reinforced by c ulturally t olerated high m ale pr omiscuity; ( iii) high l evels of s tigma a nd
discrimination which undermine prevention and care efforts; (iv) inadequate institutional and


                                                  5

legal f ramework to protect against discrimination; and (v) h igh r ates o f sexually tr ansmitted
infections (STI) with 27% of women attending clinics reported having at least one STI.

Government Priorities, Country Assistance Strategy and Rationale for Bank Assistance.
Against this background, the threat of a generalized HIV/AIDS epidemic in Jamaica seemed high.
AIDS and STI were the second leading cause of death among the 30-34 age group. In the late
1980s, t he G overnment of J amaica r esponded t o t his t hreat by s etting up a c omprehensive
National HIV/AIDS/STI Program which had led to some positive results by early 2000. The
overall pu blic a wareness of HIV/AIDS was v ery h igh ( 95%), c ondom us e w ith non- regular
partners increased significantly from 37% in 1992 to 67% in 2000, and syphilis cases decreased
dramatically from 90/100,000 in 1987 to 10/100,000 in 2000. H owever, the epidemic was not
stabilized and significant additional efforts were required to curb and reverse the development of
the epidemic. In 2001, the Government adopted the 2002-2006 National Strategic Plan (NSP) to
target five key areas to improve the overall HIV/AIDS response. These areas were as follows:

    ·    Create conditions for a more open, tolerant and supportive society towards persons living
         with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA);
    ·    Mobilize a multi-sectoral coordinated response;
    ·    Focus on behavior change in the high-risk groups;
    ·    Increase access to quality care, treatment and support for PLWHA; and
    ·    Increase understanding of HIV/AIDS trends to better plan prevention and care efforts.

With t he s upport of t he W orld B ank, t he G overnment e mbarked on t he pr eparation of t he
HIV/AIDS Prevention Project which was to provide support for the five priorities of the 2002-
2006 National HIV/AIDS Program. The Bank was well-placed to support this operation given its
extensive involvement world-wide in HIV/AIDS issues and particularly given its involvement in
the study, HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean: Issues and Options, which was published in June 2000.
The findings of the study formed the basis for the preparation of the Multi-Country HIV/AIDS
Prevention and Control Adaptable Program Lending (APL) for the Caribbean Region which was
approved by the World Bank Board in June 2001. The First Phase of the APL included support
for HIV/AIDS Prevention Projects in the Dominican Republic (US$25 million) and Barbados
(US$15.15 million). The Second Phase included support for the Jamaica HIV/AIDS Prevention
and Control Project which was approved shortly thereafter, in January 2002. The project was an
integral part of the 2000 Country Assistance Strategy second pillar on "protecting the poor and
ensuring inclusion," a nd was a lso reflected i n the 2002 CAS P rogress R eport as a k ey
Government challenge.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The project's objectives were identical to the objectives of the overall Caribbean APL and aimed
to s upport s elected a ctivities o f Jamaica's N ational H IV/AIDS S trategic Plan (NSP), a s
mentioned above. Using a multi-sectoral approach, the project was to assist the Government in
curbing t he spread of t he HIV epidemic through: (a) the expansion of preventive pr ograms
targeted on high-risk groups as well as the general population; (b) the strengthening of treatment,
care and support for PLWHA; and (c) the strengthening of Jamaica's multi-sectoral capacity to
respond to the epidemic. T hese objectives are stated in the Loan Agreement (LA), dated May
10, 2002.

It should be noted that the first objective, (a), is stated differently in the PAD, Annex 1, as
follows: " reduce H IV t ransmission, especially by targeting hi gh-risk groups a nd reducing
stigma." This version of the PDO actually addresses more specifically what is required in order


                                                 6

to "curb the spread of the epidemic." Therefore, these slightly different formulations actually
refer to the same overall goal of the project. The version in the PAD also places an explicit
emphasis on stigma reduction, which is consistent with the design of this project and which is
evaluated by this ICR.

Key pe rformance i ndicators included t wo impact indicators, seven ou tcome indicators and
thirteen output i ndicators. T wo a dditional ou tcome i ndicators w ere added during the I CR
preparation because they include critical data on HIV t esting which was not included in t he
original indicators. These indicators focus on changes in prevalence, behavior changes, coverage
of pr evention and treatment pr ograms, a s well a s on i nstitutional de velopment a nd r esponse
capacity to the ep idemic, al l o f w hich a re d irectly linked to t he three PDOs s tated above.
Progress against these indicators is detailed in the ICR datasheet above.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

The PDOs and/or key performance indicators were not revised during implementation.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

Project b eneficiaries w ere to i nclude: ( a) h igh-risk g roups w ho would be nefit f rom t argeted
interventions under the project. These groups include commercial sex workers (CSW) and their
clients, men who have sex with men (MSM), the population with signs and symptoms of STIs,
prisoners, adolescents in and out of school, and street children; (b) persons living with HIV/AIDS
who would benefit from better access t o treatment, care and support interventions under t he
project; and (c) the entire population in Jamaica who would benefit from interventions aimed at
the general community and from reduced HIV transmission from the high-risk groups.

1.5 Original Components

The project had three components, as follows:

Component 1: Preventive Programs Targeted at High-Risk Groups and the General
Population (US$7.55 million estimated base costs) - this component was to be a central project
component a imed t o support s caling up o f s ix areas of i nterventions, including: B ehavioral
Change C ommunication (BCC), V oluntary C ounseling a nd T esting ( VCT), Condom Social
Marketing Programs, S yndromic M anagement of                STI, P revention of Mother-to-Child
transmission of HIV, S trengthening the C apacity of t he Blood B ank t o Provide Safe B lood.
These interventions were to be prioritized to target high-risk groups (including PLWHA) through
a decentralized, multi-sectoral approach. This component included f ive s ub-components, a s
follows:

    Sub-component 1: Program targeting high-risk groups ­ through: (a) the identification of
    high-risk groups; (b) the provision of peer education, outreach programs and condoms to
    target groups, including CWS, MSM, and prison inmates; (c) strengthening of HIV/AIDS
    drop-in centers with VCT and STI services; and (d) strengthening of STI management.

    Sub-component 2: Carrying out broad-based programs for the general population­
    through: (a) mass-media awareness campaigns; (b) training of peer-educators and counselors;
    (c) increased condom a vailability; ( d) t argeted community c ampaigns i n hi gh-prevalence
    areas; ( e) e stablishing o ne V CT s ite p er d istrict; (f) s trengthening S TI s yndromic

                                                   7

    management and provision of STI drugs; (g) expanding VCT services at ANC clinics and
    providing m other t o c hild t ransmission (MTCT) interventions to HIV-positive pr egnant
    women ( also dissemination of the M TCT p rotocol); and (h) i mplementing work pl ace
    intervention programs for key employers in the formal sector.

    Sub-component 3: Reduction of Stigma ­ through interventions including: (a) promotion
    and mobilization of support from public and private leaders for the HIV/AIDS cause and
    protection o f P LWHA r ights; (b) o ffering t raining t o pa rtners t hrough H IV/AIDS
    sensitization workshops; (c) anti-stigma messages as part of BCC campaigns; (d) developing
    a framework for protection of humans rights of PLWHA; (e) creating instruments for voicing
    grievances (complaint hotlines); and (f) provision of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) drugs
    for health workers.

    Sub-component 4: Strengthening the technical capacity of the blood transfusion system
    to provide safe blood through: (a) amending and disseminating the national blood transfusion
    policy; (b) strengthening voluntary blood donors recruitment program; and (c) computerizing
    the blood bank's data management system.

    Sub-component 5: Demand-driven subprojects. This subcomponent aimed to involve
    NGOs and other agencies in the provision of HIV/AIDS interventions to communities and
    marginalized groups through subprojects.

Component 2: Basic Health Care, Treatment and Support for PLWHA (US$3.53 million
estimated base costs). This component was to increase the capacity to provide basic treatment,
care and support to PLWHA. The Component included three sub-components, as follows:

    Sub-component 1: Providing basic care and treatment ­ through: (a) development and
    dissemination of treatment g uidelines f or H IV/AIDS; ( b) t raining of h ealth workers on
    HIV/AIDS t reatment a nd care; (c) provision of d rugs f or opportunistic i nfections (IO)

    HIV/AIDS patients.

    Sub-component 2: Supporting home and community care for PLWHA by NGOs and
    community based organizations (CBOs) ­ through: (a) developing homecare guidelines;
    (b) training community health workers in home care and support; (c) providing home care
    through visits by NGOs, community health workers, CBOs, etc; (d) establishing a network of
    social support, integrated into the existing social safety net; (e) strengthening the hospice
    network; and (f) establishing half-way care facilities.

    Sub-component 3: Improving the diagnostic capacity, efficiency and quality of the
    laboratory system - t hrough ( a) pr ovision of d iagnostic e quipment a nd t est k its; ( b)
    improving di agnostic s kills of he alth w orkers; ( c) developing ope rational g uidelines f or

Component 3:        Strengthening National Capacity for an Intensified Response to the
Epidemic (US$4.65 million estimated base costs). This c omponent m eant to improve the
technical, managerial and implementation capacity of key players in the Government and in civil
society who are involved in the fight against HIV/AIDS. T his component included three sub-
components, as follows:



                                                 8

    Sub-component 1: included: (a) enhancing the planning, management and implementation
    capacity to implement the National STI/HIV/AIDS Program at the regional and parish levels,
    through de velopment of work programs of R egional H ealth A uthorities (RHAs) a nd
    developing m echanisms t o c hannel f unding for H IV/AIDS pr evention and treatment; (b)
    strengthening ca pacity o f t he N ational A IDS C ommittee ( NAC) an d t he Parish A IDS
    Committees; and (c) coordinating/providing t echnical a ssistance for th e fo rmulation o f

    Sub-component 2: Improving the information base for better decision making ­ through:
    (a) expanding a nd i mproving t he H IV/AIDS/STI surveillance system; ( b) s etting up an
    integrated da ta management s ystem f or National Public H ealth L aboratories, hospital
    laboratories, STI and ANC clinics, sentinel surveillance sites and hospital pharmacies; (c)
    increasing capacity for operational research and dissemination of best practices in priority
    areas of the National Strategic Plan for HIV/AIDS; and (d) building capacity for monitoring
    and evaluation of program activities.

    Sub-component 3: Project Management w as t o s upport p roject i mplementation by
    financing staff costs of the Project Coordination Unit, the set-up costs of the unit, technical
    assistance and training.

1.6 Revised Components

Project components were never officially revised. However, during implementation, activities
originally meant to be i mplemented under certain components w ere actually i mplemented in
support of o ther c omponents. F or e xample, the prevention a nd treatment services for HIV-
infected mothers and infants were planned under Component 1 on pr evention; however, t his
activity was operationally a better fit under Component 2 on t reatment. The blood transfusion
system, or iginally unde r C omponent 1, was i mplemented unde r C omponent 3. A s t he I CR
mission found, the PCU staff in charge of specific components made conscious decisions to
ensure that a cohesive and comprehensive approach to implementation was taken, more in line
with what made sense on the ground and what was more appropriate for local circumstances.
Regardless of these shifts, the originally planned/intended activities were implemented.

In terms of project costs, the original estimates and LA allocations turned out to be dramatically
different at the end of the project. The Sub-component 5 on demand-driven subprojects to NGOs
cost only 25 percent of the original estimate because the capacity of NGOs turned out to be more
limited than originally expected. Also, the condoms turned out to cost only 10 percent of the
original estimate, which was likely too high to begin with. This low cost was due to the fact that
USAID and The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (The Global Fund) also
provided funding f or condoms. L astly, t he hospital w aste m anagement a ctivity more t han
doubled in price from the original estimate because the design of this activity changed during
implementation. The project was to provide incinerators for health facilities but mid-way through
the project, it was decided to construct a waste management plant in Kingston that would serve
the Kingston/St. James area. This was a more expensive alternative but one which was more
effective in disposing of medical waste. The ICR mission found that the Borrower made these
adjustments in t he co sts because i n so me ca ses t he o riginal cost es timates either over o r
underestimated the needs on the ground and because other international agencies also contributed
more than originally foreseen. Indeed, the eventual partial loan cancellation of US$4.4 million
(discussed below) was a reflection of these changes as well.

1.7 Other significant changes

A significant change made early in the project was the approval in October 2003 of Round 3
grant by t he G lobal F und c overing t he period 20 04-2009, t otaling U S$23 m illion. This
contribution was a significant boost to the Government's National HIV/AIDS/STI Program and,
together with Bank financing, ensured a comprehensive multi-donor and Government response.
These funds were particularly critical in terms of: (i) providing the necessary anti-retrovirals
(ARVs) to supplement what was being procured under the Bank-financed project; (ii) purchasing
of diagnostic and monitoring equipment (CD4 and Viral Load); and (iii) enhancing adherence to
treatment. P rior to 2003, less than 100 people (adults and children) in Jamaica were on anti-
retroviral treatment (ART), and by the end of the project in mid-2008, that number was increased
to 4,400. This infusion of resources by the Global Fund as well as the resources of the Bank-
financed project (Component 2 on treatment) led to substantial reductions in the number of AIDS
deaths from 665 in 2004 to 320 in 2007. In addition, the Global Fund grant supported prevention
and behavior change activities together with the USAID supported project.

In addition to the above, the following three amendments were made to the Loan Agreement
(LA):
1. Amendment dated June 1, 2004 reallocated funds across different disbursement categories in
    Schedule 1 of the LA and changed several provisions in Schedule 4 regarding procurement
    processes. These changes were made in order to increase the pace of project implementation
    and to better reflect the needs on the ground. Under this amendment, the total allocation for
    the procurement of condoms was reduced from US$2 million to US$0.6 million, and the
    allocations for works and the hospital waste management equipment were doubled.
2. Amendment dated March 2, 2006 was processed to extend the Closing Date by 12 months
    until December 15, 2007 in order to ensure the completion of project activities due to early
    delays in implementation and t o make f urther r eallocations i n the proceeds of t he l oan,
    including additional reductions in the allocation for condoms and a significant reduction in
    the allocation of drugs, works, consultant services and goods under the sub-project grants
    (NGOs). F urther increases were made f or hospital w aste m anagement e quipment. The
    amendment also canceled US$4.4 million from the Loan because the Global Fund picked up
    financing for some project activities, and the cost estimates for several activities were revised
    downward. This partial cancellation w as also a r ecognition o f t he f act t hat loan
    disbursements were low (20%) after 3.5 y ears of implementation and that the loan would
    likely not disburse fully. It should be noted that in the end, the project was fully disbursed
    against the revised amount, and ended up implementing all of the main planned activities
    allowing the Government of Jamaica to avoid duplication of effort between different donors,
    and therefore, to make savings in the loan.
3. Amendment dated July 24, 2007 was processed to extend the Closing Date by 5.5 months
    until May 31, 2008, mainly to complete two large contracts for the Laboratory Information
    System and for the Waste Management/treatment Plant, and to make additional reallocations
    in the proceeds of the loan, mainly to reduce the allocation for condoms further, and to cut the
    allocation to sub-project grants by another 50% while increasing allocations for drugs, civil
    works and training.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Sector work: This project was prepared as a second phase of t he Multi-Country HIV/AIDS
Prevention and Control APL for the Caribbean Region which was approved in June 2001. In

                                                10

June 2000, the Bank published a study entitled HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean: Issues and Options
which provided the background for the preparation of the APL. During the course of project
preparation in Jamaica, additional studies were carried out, financed by a PHRD grant from the
Japanese Government (US$75,000), which was approved in March 2001. These included: (i) an
assessment of Jamaica's hum an resource ne eds i n order t o e xecute the H IV/AIDS pr ogram
effectively; (ii) a study on the critical areas of focus, specific mechanisms for a national response,
including organizational structures and functions and evaluation of the capacity of the National
AIDS Committee; and (iii) an assessment of Jamaica's electronic HIV/AIDS/STI data collection
system, design of system requirements, and the design of a monitoring and evaluation plan for the
project. The PHRD grant was almost fully disbursed (US$71,000) and these studies yielded
important information on the existing set-up, system requirements, and human resource needs.

Project preparation: This pr oject was p repared i n one y ear a lthough m ost of t he c ritical
preparation and appraisal work took roughly 3-4 months. The preparation of the project was
financed by t he G overnment of Jamaica, a PHRD g rant ( discussed a bove), a nd a P roject
Preparation Facility (PPF - US$509,933), which was approved in October 2001, just prior to
project appraisal. T he PPF (disbursed US$266,000) mostly financed the set-up of the Project
Coordination Unit (PCU) in the MOH, the initial work of several PCU staff in preparing various
parts of the project, and the preparation of the necessary project documents such as the Project
Operational Manual, which was a condition of Loan effectiveness. The establishment of the PCU
was a condition of Negotiations.

Project design: The overall objectives and the design of the project were consistent with the
goals of the National HIV/AIDS Program and were consistent with the overall Bank strategy in
the Caribbean region, as discussed above. The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) presented a
comprehensive approach t o expand the H IV/AIDS response by G overnment. T he i dea of
ensuring a multi-sectoral response and involving all strategic partners in this effort was a result of
a clear recognition that reversing the HIV/AIDS epidemic i s ultimately an i ssue of behavior
change on many levels and beyond strictly the health sector. Therefore, the design of the project
placed a s pecial e mphasis on developing linkages w ith all relevant sectors and i nvolving all
partners on the National, Regional and Local levels, including NGOs, CBOs and Faith Based
Organizations (FBOs), and strengthening the capacity of the National AIDS Committee and of
the Parish AIDS Committees to help them to coordinate and mobilize support to fight HIV/AIDS.
It must be noted that w hile this d esign w as sound, t he p roject w as complex, w ith 11 s ub-
components and many separate activities s ubsumed unde r e ach s ub-component, as w ell a s
challenging multi-sectoral arrangements. This was a particularly ambitious undertaking for a first
time operation in the HIV/AIDS sector in Jamaica.

Lessons taken into account: The most important lesson from other Bank-financed HIV/AIDS
projects was the need to have Government commitment and dedication at the highest levels,
including t he c ommitment t o r educe s tigma a nd a ssociated di scrimination. D uring t he
preparation of this project, Government commitment was high, and it remained high during the
entire implementation process as well. Other lessons learned from successful projects in other
countries were incorporated into the design. T hese included: (i) the need for a multi-sectoral
comprehensive response; (ii) the need to include care and support measures to reduce stigma and
discrimination;, (iii) the need to focus on prevention, particularly in high-risk groups, as it is the
most co st-effective w ay o f m anaging t he epidemic; ( iv) t he need t o s trengthen s urveillance
systems; and (v) the need to remain flexible in terms of implementation procedures to improve
responsiveness to changes. It should be noted that while the lesson on the importance of targeted
prevention measures under this project was incorporated into the design (in fact, the prevention
component was estimated as being the most critical in the project), only 3% of the total project


                                                    11

costs were set aside for prevention measures targeted on the high-risk groups such as MSM and
CSWs. This figure is net of other planned expenditures such as condoms, VCT services, etc.
which also contribute to this prevention among high-risk groups.

Risks identification and mitigation measures: The PAD identified a number of risks, with an
overall Substantial risk rating. Two of these risks (inadequate institutional capacity and slow
disbursement) t urned ou t t o b e a ctual problems during the p roject. H owever, t wo m ajor
challenges which had a significant impact on the speed of implementation, namely the budget
ceilings and insufficient counterpart funds, were not identified as risks in the PAD, despite the
fact that Jamaica had persistent issues with budget deficits and a major fiscal space constraint.

Project readiness for implementation:           While o verall i mplementation arrangements were
specified in the PAD, these likely needed additional refinement. There appear to have been some
inconsistencies in documentation between the Loan Agreement (LA), the PAD and the Project
Operational Manual (POM) on some operational issues. For example, the POM stated that 90-
day advances can be made from the Special Account to the local project account for activities to
be undertaken by the Regional Health Authorities. The PAD and the LA stated that advances
could only be made for no more than 30 days. Also, the PCU understanding was that UNFPA
would be contracted to provide all condoms under the project and yet this was not provided for in
the LA. Likewise, in procurement, there was a provision in the PAD that the Health Corporation
Limited (HCL) would handle all procurement of drugs under the project. However, this was not
provided in the LA. Consequently, when implementation started, these issues had to be resolved,
and this took most of the first year and a half of the project.

In addition, the exact modalities and arrangements with respect to all the implementing agencies
(Line M inistries, R egional Health A uthorities, National A IDS Committee, Parish A IDS
Committees, and NGOs) and how they would c arry out t heir activities w ere not c ompletely
worked out. What is clear in the PAD was that there would be Participation Agreements between
the MOH and these agencies and the PAD went on to describe future responsibilities of these
agencies. In reality, a number of steps were needed, including legal steps to change the status of
these agencies (e.g. National AIDS Committee and Parish AIDS Committee); also, a number of
detailed working arrangements, such a s c larification of r oles a nd f unctions in the a gencies
(including in the PCU), the appointment of staff and focal poi nts i n line-Ministries, and the
specific plans for the training of staff required by these agencies to formulate their annual plans,
were not available at the start of implementation.

Overall Quality at Entry: There was no Quality at Entry Assessment (QEA) by the Quality
Assurance Group (QAG). However, this ICR rates the overall project quality and readiness as
Moderately Satisfactory. T he project design was comprehensive, although complex for a first-
time implementing agency. Appropriate sector work and necessary assessments were carried out,
but t he pr oject readiness t o s tart i mplementation was not a s s trong g iven w eaknesses in
arrangements and lack of clarity on some crucial processes.

2.2 Implementation

This was the first project financed by the Bank supporting the HIV/AIDS Program in Jamaica,
and therefore, the start-up phase was challenging. In the words of the Project Director, "there
was a steep learning curve for everyone pa rticularly g iven t he complex B ank r ules a nd
guidelines." The challenge was that much greater because: (i) the Bank supervision staff changed
three times after Board approval; (ii) the project was complex in its design and in the number of
players involved; (iii) the P CU ha d to w ork i n a hi ghly bur eaucratic a nd i nertia-prone


                                                  12

environment; and (iv) there were a number of fiduciary issues which surfaced almost immediately
after the project became effective. All this negatively affected the start-up phase of the project. It
must be noted, however, that despite these challenges, project activities were launched and the
substantive work began across all components during this time. Unsurprisingly, what turned out
to b e s ome o f the g reatest challenges are p recisely those areas that w ere ei ther n ot as w ell
prepared, i.e. implementation arrangements, or not identified as a risk, i.e. budget ceiling issue
and c ounterpart f unds. The following three sets of issues p rovide a su mmary o f these main
problems.

1.       Fiduciary issues:     During t he first B ank s upervision m ission i n December 2002 ,
following the declaration of Loan Effectiveness in August 2002, several issues surfaced related to
the operation of the Special Account (SA) and the procurement of drugs and condoms. With
respect to the SA, the Bank learned that the PCU was making 90-day rather than the standard 30-
day advances to the project account. In addition, a co-mingling of Bank and Government funds
was found and corrected. The PCU requested that the Bank accept a 90-day advance because it
would be a more practical mechanism for making disbursements for activities to be carried out by
Regional Health Authorities. Indeed, this was provided for in the Operational Manual approved
by t he B ank. H owever, t he P AD a nd the L A referred to a 30- day a dvance a nd the B ank
disbursement officers insisted on keeping this arrangement. After a year and a half, the Bank
agreed to accept the 90-day advance mechanism which allowed greater flexibility for planning
purposes and reduced excessive report preparation so that more time could be concentrated on
actual project activities. Likewise, two disagreements arose with respect to procurement of drugs
and condoms. In the end, the Bank agreed to the PCU request to have the Health Corporation
Limited (HCL) be responsible for drug procurement for the project and to sign an agreement with
United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) for the procurement of condoms rather than going
through ICB bidding.

In addition to the problems which arose during the first year and which were eventually resolved,
there w ere p ersistent p rocurement d ifficulties. F irst o f a ll, t here w ere d iscrepancies i n t he
procurement thresholds set by the Bank and by Government. This was never resolved during the
project. S econdly, t hresholds w ere undu ly low w ith, f or example, the p rocurement of goods
above US$25,000 requiring National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures. T his meant that
many activities costing just above this threshold were severely delayed because of the necessary
preparation of large bidding documents for which there was limited capacity at the local levels.
This arrangement also reduced interest on the part of some suppliers to participate in the bidding
process altogether. Further, even for activities costing below US$25,000, it was difficult to get
responses because o f the limited n umber of suppliers. S everal l ayers o f reviews on the
Government's side led to delays in the procurement process, and there were also delays on t he
Bank's side in reviewing procurement documentation and providing `no-objections'. The Mid-
term review report noted that on average shopping procedures took 7.3 weeks and NCB took 19.6
weeks. O verall, the p rocurement a rrangements a nd p rocesses were inadequate a nd likely
inappropriate for country circumstances. This emerged as one of the main concerns by the PCU
Director and all staff.

Budget ceilings and counterpart funds: Right from the start of the project, the main challenge
was the insufficient budget allocations for the project as well as limited counterpart funds. The
following table summarizes the provision of funding.

                     Summary of Annual Budget Allocations and Expenditures
                                         2001/ 2002/ 2003/ 2004/ 2005/ 2006/ 2007/
                                         2002     2003    2004    2005     2006   2007    2008

      Actual expenditures                0.14     0.76 1.41 1.84 2.35 3.81 4.97

In 2003, the originally estimated funds needed for the project were US$3.48 million. However,
this w as d ramatically r educed to US$0.68 m illion i n the revised budget. Likewise, the
Government contribution w as one t hird of the p romised a mount a t t hat t ime. W hile t he
counterpart f unds i ssue was r esolved by m id-2006 a nd the Government made s ubstantial
contributions to the project (US$4.53 million), the restrictions on t he available project budget
continued for most of the implementation period, until 2006/2007. The reductions in the budget
were due to the strained fiscal situation in the country and had a major impact on the speed of
implementation. During the first three years of implementation, only 20% was disbursed from
the loan. This was highlighted in every supervision mission by the Bank. The Budget Planning
Office, on the other hand, claimed that there was insufficient absorption capacity by the project to
utilize greater allocations which indeed was the case earlier in the project. However, as capacity
was de veloped f or f aster i mplementation by 2004/ 2005, t he budg et constraint be came a n
overriding factor in slowing down the pace of implementation.

3.       Capacity weaknesses: During the initial years of the project, there were persistent and
wide-spread capacity weaknesses that led to delays. The first year was a challenge for the PCU
with a number of issues impeding effective project management. The Bank supervision missions
found unclear roles and responsibilities, cumbersome processes, and inefficiencies related to staff
spending too much time on applying rules and regulations and not enough time on executing
work programs. As soon as this was identified as a major project management issue, immediate
actions were taken to i mprove t he situation. By early 2004, t he overall management of the
program was more effective.

The participation of Regional Health Authorities (RHA) in the project was also a major challenge
during the first half of the project. The original assumption was that existing RHAs could handle
the proposed annual work programs. However, the reality was that the existing capacity of the
RHAs in fighting the HIV/AIDS epidemic was actually quite weak at that time. This was a
significant drawback to effective implementation as f ew staff were willing to take on the extra
work required to implement project activities, as they were already overstretched. To correct this,
during the course of implementation, it was decided that additional staff and teams would be
hired as consultants to carry out the project and to expand regional operations to an effective
level. The Bank agreed with this change in implementation arrangements. The high turn-over of
staff was an issue, however, and the PCU struggled with how to ensure continuity and to provide
the necessary training to new staff. Eventually, all RHAs were fully involved in the project and
managed in the short time to implement roughly 25% of the project activities through annual
work plans signed with the PCU.

In a ddition, another a rea of w eak c apacity was i n t he i mplementation of de mand-driven
subprojects by NGOs. Firstly, it must be noted that the general operating environment for NGOs
was not entirely hospitable, with reluctance to transfer responsibility for program implementation
by Government to the NGO sector. This is not an uncommon problem worldwide. Nonetheless,
major efforts were made to launch this critical part of the project to reach the high-risk groups.
The main problem was that NGOs generally had limited staff and little capacity to prepare quality


                                                 14

proposals, the necessary procurement documents, and a number of these groups either failed to
participate o r l ost interest i n pa rticipation d ue t o s tringent B ank pr ocurement r equirements.
Indeed, original procurement arrangements were not conducive to an effective operation of this
sub-component, and later on the Bank agreed to simplify the procurement procedures through the
use of Service Level Agreements although none of these were ever utilized under the project
because it was too late. As a result of these weaknesses, only a quarter of the originally intended
resources were spent on this sub-component.

Project ratings: The project was at risk twice, first for a period of 6 months in 2003 due to
fiduciary issues, budget ceilings and general start-up delays, and secondly, from mid-2005 to
mid-2006 due to persistent slow implementation and continuing budget ceiling issues. By end
2005, only 20% of the loan had been disbursed. After extensive consultations, it was decided to
cancel US$4.4 m illion from the l oan. Following t his c ancellation, project i mplementation
accelerated and the project was rated Satisfactory until it closed. The project was fully disbursed
within the last two years. There was no QAG assessment of Supervision.

Implementation Strengths: D espite the c hallenges e ncountered during i mplementation, the
project was c ompleted, ut ilized f ully t he r evised L oan a mount, a nd made s ome i mpressive
achievements. There were several key positive factors which played an important role in this
outcome: (i) v ery s trong, a ctive a nd sustained l eadership of t he H IV/AIDS P rogram w hich
enabled the program to get off the ground and to implement successfully; (ii) highly motivated
and organized PCU staff; (iii) excellent working relationship between the Bank and the PCU in
the Ministry throughout the implementation period; (iv) high commitment by Government for the
national H IV/AIDS Program, pa rticularly from t he M inistry of F inance w hich e nsured a
successful implementation of the project in the end; (v) close relationships developed with all
relevant line-ministries that participated in the project. These factors cannot be underestimated
and serve as important lessons for future projects.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Design: The project identified key indicators that were listed in the Supplemental Letter, dated
May 10, 2002, and remained unchanged during the project. They include: two impact indicators,
seven out come indicators and t hirteen output indicators. Data on t wo additional ou tcome
indicators on HIV testing (indicator 8 and 11) were added during the ICR preparation in order to
reflect better this crucial aspect of prevention measures supported by the project. For the most
part, these indicators are appropriate and measurable, notwithstanding the inherent difficulty of
collecting data from the at-risk groups targeted under this project, and the reliance on surveys. It
is important to note that the project's first impact indicator - keep prevalence rates below certain
percentage - is a perfectly legitimate and appropriate long-term goal of the National HIV/AIDS
program but may not be the most ideal way of measuring the success of a five-year operation
which focused its efforts on expanding prevention and treatment. While pr evention activities
would lead to lower prevalence rates, increased testing for HIV could increase these rates as more
people test positive for HIV. Most importantly, the provision of treatment for HIV infected
persons would also increase prevalence as people start living longer. Therefore, the percent
change in this i ndicator should be v iewed w ith c aution a nd in the b roader context of o ther
indicators to judge the overall impact of this project.

Implementation: Following effectiveness, it took more than two years to have an M&E officer
in place and to establish the M&E unit in the MOH. This was consistently raised by the Bank
team and by the management of the project in the MOH as a major challenge. After a long and
thorough search a suitable M&E officer (now Director of M&E unit) was hired in September


                                                    15

2004. During the last three years of the project, this unit was expanded to include six full-time
staff (M&E director/specialist, an M&E officer, a database manager, a database officer and 2 data
entry clerks). These staff were trained and received the necessary hardware and software to
support the implementation of the main M&E databases. T hese included computers, servers,
wireless area network equipment and USB flash drives were purchased for field implementation
of the web-based HIV/AIDS Tracking System (HATS) and STI databases. In addition, printers
were purchased for treatment sites to support the electronic HIV register. In addition, citrix
software was purchased to secure the network for web-based transmission of highly confidential
data collected.

M&E unit staff have developed a number of databases in order to improve the overall information
collection and reporting systems. These include a web-based HIV/AIDS tracking system, a rapid
test database and STI databases. Other databases developed or being developed include a M&E
database, TB database and HIV electronic register, and medical records database. Also, several
special surveys c onducted dur ing the course of t he pr oject include a N ational Knowledge,
Attitude, Practices and Behavior (KABP) study (carried out every 4 years), a second generation
surveillance of commercial sex workers (CSW) and men who have sex with men (MSM), sentinel
surveillance of ANC and STI clinic attendees. In addition, with support from groups such as the
Global AIDS Monitoring and Evaluation Team (GAMET) and the USAID funded MEASURE
group at the University of North Carolina, new data collection tools were developed for collection
of out put da ta from s takeholders. This includes tracking pe rsons on treatment, c ollection o f
Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission (PMTCT) output data, and streamlined reporting by
sub-recipients and other stakeholders.

Utilization: The M&E unit serves a crucial function in the MOH and regularly collects and
aggregates da ta, g enerates r eports, pr ovides f eedback t o s takeholders a nd c ontributes t o t he
further development of the M&E capacity of various stakeholders in the health sector. The data
collection and analysis is based on output, outcome and impact indicators developed to track and
evaluate the national HIV/AIDS response. T he M&E unit produced a number of reports and
other project doc uments, i ncluding r evised l aboratory forms, s elf-addressed envelopes f or
confidential HIV case reporting and HIV case report forms. The 2005 United Nations General
Assembly Special Session (UNGASS) report was also published for distribution to stakeholders.
Several reports were generated by the M&E unit including reports for donor agencies, quarterly
bulletins, UNICEF report card, and an annual HIV report. The unit serves as a main catalyst for
convening a forum of stakeholders to discuss HIV/AIDS indicators. A list of 30 indicators has
been harmonized with UNAIDS and the Global Fund and progress against this list is reviewed
annually. The M&E unit also plays a critical role in the preparation of the National HIV Strategic
Plan (NSP) for which it prepares an M&E plan. After it became operational, the M&E unit
produced an M&E Plan for the 2002-2006 NSP and for the 2007-2012 NSP, currently being
finalized. In fact, the M &E unit pr ovided t he f irst c omprehensive l ist of i ndicators f or the
National Health Program (NHP).

Convening of the Monitoring and Evaluation Reference Group (MERG) and M&E capacity
building. S everal M &E workshops a nd training w orkshops on u se o f t he n ewly de veloped
databases have been conducted. These include training on basic computer skills for prospective
users of the databases, including contact investigators. In addition the increased cadre of M&E
staff at the national level resulted in greater availability of technical support for NGOs and field
staff in planning and analysis of studies as well as participation in regional workshops. The
meetings of the MERG (reconvened in 2005) provided a forum for stakeholder discussion of
project implementation based on indicators.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Environment: A n environmental a ssessment (EA) was triggered unde r t he pr oject and t he
environmental category was B. During preparation, an Environmental Management Plan (EMP)
was prepared to ensure compliance with respect to medical waste management. It was found that
the handling of medical waste had a number of deficiencies including: inadequate incineration
facilities, indiscriminate disposal of blood and blood products, inadequate storage, no system for
identification of infectious waste and generally low awareness among hospital staff in proper
handling of infectious materials. The project supported the Government in drafting appropriate
legislation and regulations (adopted as Law) which addressed the resolution of these issues. The
project also s upported upgrading of w aste m anagement and treatment c apacities, including
training of relevant personnel. Initially, the plan was to procure new incinerators for the entire
country but later it was decided, and the Bank team agreed, that it was more appropriate and
effective to construct a waste management and treatment plant in Kingston to serve the entire
Kingston/St. James r egion. T he p lant w as c onstructed a nd a ll a ppropriate e nvironmental
standards were followed in accordance with the project EMP.

Fiduciary compliance: Project financial management was handled satisfactorily throughout the
project and audit reports were received on time and had unqualified opinions. The Financial
Management Reports were received regularly. As described above, during the first year of the
project, there were issues related to the flow of funds, specifically advances from the Special
Account to the participating entities and the co-mingling of Loan and counterpart funds. T his
issue was successfully resolved.

Procurement: The handling of pr ocurement w as a ppropriate t hroughout the i mplementation
period, with proper application of all procurement procedures. T he major issue, as described
above, was the persistent delay in the procurement process due to highly bureaucratic internal
review layers, the Bank's stringent requirements and low procurement thresholds. This has been
noted in all s upervision documents a nd w as confirmed during t he ICR mission by t he P CU
procurement officer.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
A follow-on operation, the Second HIV/AIDS Project, was approved by the World Bank Board of
Executive Directors on May 13, 2008; it was signed on June 10, 2008 and became effective on
September 23, 2008. This pr oject bu ilds on the m ajor achievements of the f irst p roject and
supports expanded prevention and treatment efforts. In addition, the Global Fund has approved a
second grant of US$44 million to continue to support the Jamaica's National HIV/AIDS Program.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The objectives, design, and implementation of the project were and remain highly relevant and
consistent with Jamaica's priority to fight the spread of HIV/AIDS. The project was and remains
consistent with the global commitment to fight the spread of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, with the
Bank country and sectoral assistance strategies and with the National HIV/STI/AIDS Program
adopted by Government. The project was implemented under the 2002-2006 National Strategic
Plan and briefly under the follow-on 2007-2012 National Strategic Plan which has the same goals
as the project, including explicit emphasis on reducing stigma and discrimination towards people
living with HIV/AIDS, focusing on improving and expanding prevention services to most-at-risk



                                                 17

groups, achieving universal access to high quality treatment, care and support of people with
HIV/AIDS, and to achieving a sustained multi-sectoral response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The development objective to "curb the spread of the HIV epidemic" required a multi-pronged
comprehensive approach with the involvement of all relevant agencies in addition to the Ministry
of Health. Indeed, this approach was built into the design of the project. The reduction in HIV
transmission necessary to curb the spread of the epidemic is best measured by the reduction in the
incidence rate (# per 100,000 = number of new cases of the disease occurring in the population/
number of persons exposed to risk of developing the disease). In this project, a proxy indicator
for the i ncidence rate is used - t he syphilis sero-prevalence r ate for ante-natal clinic (ANC)
attendees (% of persons infected/population) - which is an impact indicator (PDO indicator #2).
In addition, a second impact indicator (PDO indicator #1) measures the HIV prevalence rate
among: (a) ANC attendees aged 15-24, with the goal to keep prevalence below 2%; (b) young
army r ecruits, keeping pr evalence below 1%; and (c) C SWs in Montego Bay and Kingston,
reducing prevalence to 10% in Montego Bay and to 7% in Kingston. It should be noted that
while a decrease in prevalence is certainly desirable, increased treatment measures which allow
people t o live l onger will actually i ncrease p revalence rather t han r educe it in t he s hort- to
medium term. Also, increases in testing (also a desirable measure) could potentially increase
prevalence further until there are significant gains made from prevention measures to offset these
gains.

The data for the two impact indicators suggests that the overall PDO to curb the spread of the
HIV epidemic has been largely achieved as follows:

    ·   PDO indicator #1: HIV prevalence rate among: (a) ANC attendees aged 15-24 increased
        from 1.2% to 1.3% but remained under 2%; (b) young army recruits increased from
        0.22% to 0.72% but remained below 1%; and (c) CSWs in Montego Bay and Kingston
        were reduced from 20% in Montego Bay and 10% in Kingston to 9% in both cities.
    ·   PDO indicator #2: syphilis sero-prevalence rate for ANC attendees was reduced from
        1.27% to 1.1% which is a reduction of 15% against the goal of 25%.

It should be noted that the most recent estimates (2007) by UNAIDS place overall prevalence at
1.6% of Jamaica's population. The PAD reported prevalence at roughly 1.5%-2% in 2002 which
means that efforts to stabilize the growth of the epidemic over the last 6 years are proving to be
successful despite continuing challenges related to overall high risk behavior by the sexually
active population.

Outcomes against the three specific PDOs are as follows:

PDO #1: to expand prevention programs targeted on high-risk groups as well as the general
population (Rating: Satisfactory). Major efforts have been made to achieve this PDO. The
detailed extensive list of prevention programs and interventions carried out in support of this
PDO by RHAs, line ministries, NGOs, PACs and the PCU are presented in Annex 2 of this ICR
under Components 1 and 2. The outcome (PDO) and intermediate outcome (IO) indicators which
measure the achievement of this PDO in the two population groups are as follows:

High-risk groups (CSW, MSM, youths) prevention programs:
    ·   PDO# 3: Delay in median age at first sex by 0.5 years for boys and girls (achieved)



                                                 18

     ·   PDO # 6: Percent of CSWs who report condom use with last client increases to 85%:
         (achieved ­ target surpassed)
     ·   PDO # 11: Percent voluntary testing for HIV increases among youth ­ actual 46.8%
         (achieved)
     ·   IO# 1: At least one outreach program with adequate peer educators for each high-risk
         group in every high-transmission area (for CSW, MSM, out-of-school youths, prisoners):
         (achieved)
     ·   IO# 2: Number of peer educators trained for each high-risk group ­actual 89 CSWs, 37
         MSM, 241 inmates. (achieved)

Broad based population prevention programs:
     ·   PDO#4: Reduction in proportion of men/women ages 15-49 who report having sex with a
         non-regular partner in the last 12 months by 25% (no real change in outcomes)
     ·   PDO#5: Proportion of men/women 15-49 who report using a condom in their last sexual
         intercourse with non-regular partners increases by 9% (mixed achievement)
     ·   IO# 8: Health clinics have at least one trained counselor providing specialized HIV/AIDS
         counseling ­ 2653 V CT counselors t rained a nd 36 0 f acilities o ffer V CT a cross t he
         country (in every district) (major achievement)
     ·   PDO#10: Formal sector employees targeted with HIV/AIDS workplace interventions
         implement such policies (achieved)

All indicators were achieved in relation to the high-risk groups who are the main drivers of the
HIV/AIDS epidemic. The training of peer educators for CSWs, MSM and youth, the workshops
carried out (reaching 2348 CSWs), rapid testing for HIV, the increased availability of condoms
(3.5 million provided under the project), and most importantly the actual prevention and outreach
activities carried out by t he peer educators a cross the c ountry ha ve made a s ignificant
contribution and led to these important outcomes.

The achievements for the general population, as judged by indicators PDO#4 and #5, are more
modest and reflect the continuing challenge in Jamaica with respect to risky behaviors among the
sexually active population age 15-49. Indeed, according to the last KABP 2008 survey, 38.9% of
sexually a ctive r espondents r eported having m ultiple partners i n the last 1 2 months, with
incidence significantly higher for males (61.5%) and even higher for 15-24 age males (76%). By
contrast, in terms of condom use, the data is more positive, with overall high condom use at last
sex w ith m ultiple p artners ( 77.9 f or m ales a nd 68 .8% f or f emales), a lthough t his do es no t
represent a real change from 2000 or 2004. T his correlates well with the overall knowledge of
HIV/AIDS transmission, with "use of condom" cited by 62% of respondents in the KABP 2008
survey. T here ha s be en a s ubstantial r eduction i n t he pe rcentage o f 15- 24 m ales w ho had
unprotected sex with non-regular partners in the last 12 m onths from 30.5% (KABP 2004) to
12.9% (KABP 2008), which is an encouraging sign.

In terms of stigma reduction (partly measured by PDO#10), a number of important achievements
were made by the project, including HIV/AIDS awareness days, workplace interventions, anti-
stigma messages in media campaigns, and sensitization workshops for employers, journalists, and
health workers. The achievements of these interventions are reflected in the increased accepting
attitude towards PLWHA. Overall, there has been a 10% increase in the acceptance levels from
the 2004 to 2008 KABP surveys, particularly for the 25-49 age group. Also, roughly 83% of
respondents claimed that they would be willing to take care of the HIV-infected family member
and 76.4% s aid they supported an H IV-infected female t eacher be ing a llowed to c ontinue
teaching. On the legal front, there have been major achievements made with the approval of the



                                                  19

HIV/AIDS Policy in 2005 and the National HIV/AIDS Workplace policy approved in 2007. Also,
an amendment to include HIV/AIDS rights was made to the Occupational Health and Safety Act .

The achievements made with respect to the population at large are a result of the enormous efforts
made under the project including mass media campaigns, targeted community interventions at the
regional and parish levels, the increased availability of condoms, the significant scaling up of
VCT, increased civil society participation, demand-driven sub-projects, increased private sector
involvement, improved legal environment, coordination and program implementation with line
ministries.

PDO #2:         to strengthen treatment, care and support for PLWHA (Rating: Highly
Satisfactory). The PDO and IO indicators which measure the achievement of this objective are as
follows:

    ·    IO#6: Turn-around time for HIV test reduced from 10 days to 15 minutes for negative
         results; from 2-3 weeks to less than 7 days for positive results (major achievement)
    ·    PDO#8: % o f A NC a ttendees testing f or H IV i ncreased t o 9 5% from 39% (major
         achievement)
    ·    IO#3: % of A NC Clinics of fer VCT and MTCT i nterventions - 100% (major
         achievement)
    ·    PDO#7: % of A NC a ttendees tested p ositive fo r H IV re ceiving M TCT (A RV)
         interventions increased from l ess t han 10 % i n 2002 t o 85% in 2 008 (major
         achievement)
    ·    PDO#9: Coverage of primary prophylaxis of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) for
         AIDS patients in HIV/AIDS specialty centers ­ 100% (achieved)
    ·    IO#4: National Guidelines for Opportunistic Infection (IO) management developed ­ a
         number of guidelines developed on HIV, STI and IO management (achieved)
    ·    IO#5: Health c are facilities deliver a ppropriate pa lliative care a nd I O management
         according to national guidelines ­ 100% (achieved)
    ·    IO#7: Improved availability of hospice and halfway care services based on regional case
         rates with at least 1 hospice & 1 h alf-way care facility for PLWHA per region (no
         change)
    ·    IO# 8: Health clinics have at least 1 trained counselor providing specialized HIV/AIDS
         counseling ­ 2653 V CT counselors t rained a nd 36 0 f acilities o ffer V CT a cross t he
         country (in every district) (major achievement)
    ·    IO#10: Complete computerization of drug inventory for Health Corporation Limited and
         four regional treatment center pharmacies (achieved)

Outcomes in support of this PDO include: significant achievements in screening of ANC clinics
(95% tested); improved S TI, O I, P EP management i n a ccordance w ith ne wly e stablished
guidelines; trained staff in HIV, STI and IO management; improved diagnostics of advanced HIV
(viral l oads, C D4 count, DNA P CR, r esistance testing); improved dr ug management s ystem;
improved testing, treatment and care (250,000 rapid tests for HIV done annually, 19 treatment
centers established, VCT established in 360 facilities, and 2653 VCT counselors trained). The
project also put in place a waste treatment plant which processes about 60% of all biomedical
waste in the country. Last, but not least, ARVs for PMTCT and PEP were provided under the
project with coverage of infected mothers at 87% and infants at 97%. I mportantly, working
jointly w ith t he B ank-financed project, the Global Fund provided ARV drugs worth U S$6.6
million from 2004 to 2008. The number of persons who received treatment in 2003 was less than
100, and by 2008, the total was 4,458 persons. As a result of these combined interventions, the



                                                 20

total number of AIDS deaths were greatly reduced (from 665 deaths in 2004 to 320 deaths in
2007). The economic impact of HIV treatment is discussed in Section 3.3 and in Annex 3.
PDO #3: to strengthen Jamaica's multi-sectoral capacity to respond to the epidemic
(Rating: Satisfactory). The P DO a nd I O i ndicators that m easure t he a chievement of this
objective are as follows:

    ·   IO#9: Second generation surveillance for HIV/AIDS in place (achieved)
    ·   IO#10: C omplete c omputerization o f: ( a) N ational L aboratory; ( b) N ational B lood
        Transfusion S ervices; (c) s urveillance s ystem; a nd (d ) d rug i nventory fo r H ealth
        Corporation Limited and four regional treatment center pharmacies (achieved)
    ·   IO#11: National AIDS Committee (NAC) and each line Ministry report twice a year to
        the National Planning Council and Human Resource Council (achieved)
    ·   IO#12: Increases in annual project funding for activities executed by the Regional Health
        Authorities (RHA) (achieved)
    ·   IO#13: 10% of project funding disbursed for activities by NGOs, CBOs and FBOs ­
        US$506,000 was spent by NGOs on 12 sub-projects which represents 3% of total project
        costs. (partially achieved)

All i ndicators i n support of this PDO have been achieved a nd e xtensive information on t he
specific accomplishments made to strengthen a multi-sectoral response is further described in
Annex 2 of this ICR, under Component 3. This response entailed making strong partnerships
with all relevant line Ministries, in addition to the Ministry of Health. Five ministries were
involved in the project and in the overall National HIV/AIDS response, including the Ministry of
Education and Youth, Ministry of T ourism, Entertainment and Culture, Ministry of National
Security, M inistry of L abor a nd S ocial Security a nd t he Ministry of Local Government and
Environment. A ll of these ministries de veloped a nd adopted H IV/AIDS workplace pol icies,
appointed focal points and program officers in their ministries, implemented annual programs that
included testing, increased public access to condoms, training of social workers, carrying out
interventions in the business communities (tourism sector in particular), interventions for prison
inmates, and information/awareness/peer education workshops. The efforts by the line-ministries
have l ed t o increased a wareness a nd ownership of t he H IV/AIDS a genda, and r esulted in
improved coordinated response. These ministries were supported by regional and local partners
under excellent coordination by the PCU.

The RHAs also were strengthened in expanding their capacity for the implementation of the
HIV/AIDS program. The RHAs now have trained teams made up of numerous community peer
educators, targeted intervention officers, behavior change coordinators, and fiduciary staff trained
in Bank fiduciary procedures. These teams worked effectively in launching and developing the
agreed annual activities and in building partnerships and linkages with the relevant stakeholders
in the regions. In total, roughly 25% of loan funds were disbursed by the RHAs in accordance
with agreed annual programs. During interviews conducted with the heads of RHUs during the
ICR mission, it became evident that without their active and effective involvement, the project
would not have achieved its objectives. Also, their role was critical in terms of coordination with
the central level HIV/AIDS Unit in MOH and provision of data and information on pr ogram
implementation. The RHAs carried out multiple prevention, testing and treatment interventions,
working closely with local agencies, PACs and NGOs.

The overall multi-sectoral response was coordinated by the National AIDS Committee (NAC),
which was elevated in importance and profile during the project. The NAC was established as a
non-profit LLC and became a member of the National Planning Council. The NGO sector
received s upport un der the pr oject a nd i ts c apacity w as s trengthened i n a n umber of a reas


                                                  21

including be havior c hange communication, pr oject management, pr ocurement a nd f inancial
management. Twelve sub-projects were carried out by carious NGOs and these made important
contributions in the fight against HIV/AIDS. O verall, the project contributed to increased civil
society participation, including increased private sector involvement, which is part of a multi-
sectoral response.

In a ddition to t he m ulti-sectoral capacity s trengthening out comes described a bove, t he
institutionalization of the M&E unit in the Ministry of Health is a major achievement under this
project. The i mprovements in the data c ollection, monitoring, a nd t he e stablishment of t he
surveillance system contribute to this PDO. The information provided by the M&E unit serves all
relevant a gencies a nd line ministries by i mproving their und erstanding of t he t rends i n t he
HIV/AIDS epidemic and in preparing an effective coordinated response as exemplified by the
2007-2012 National HIV Strategic Plan.

Summary of Outcomes: The overall rating is Satisfactory, given the attainment of goals against
the t wo impact indicators, t he s ubstantial a chievement of P DO 1 a nd 3 and s ignificant
achievement of PDO 2. The project was instrumental in jump-starting the nationally coordinated
response by all involved parties to stem the growth of the epidemic.

3.3 Efficiency

An economic a nalysis was c onducted t o qu antify t he e fficiency of bot h the pr evention and
treatment components of the project (see Annex 3 for details). For comparison purposes, the
economic impact of t he prevention c omponent w as e stimated using t he c ost-benefit analysis
methodology t hat w as us ed in t he original P AD. In t his c ost-benefit a nalysis, prevention
interventions avert HIV infections, resulting in quantifiable benefits of averted productivity losses
and savings on in-patient care and on treatment of opportunistic illnesses. The net present value
(NPV) of the project is estimated to be US$50.8 million (based on a 10% discount rate), and the
internal rate of return (IRR) is 64.9%. Thus, the realized project NPV and IRR are higher than
originally estimated for the project ($36.3 million and 57.6%). Lastly--although it is difficult to
disaggregate funds spent purely on the high-risk groups from the total prevention interventions,
since community interventions, workplace interventions, and VCT also invariably reach most at
risk g roups--it w as e stimated t hat roughly 20% of total expenditures o n t he prevention
component were spent on prevention that specifically targets high risk groups (CSWs, MSM,
youths). This i s a n insignificant a mount in c omparison w ith s ome of t he a chievements
accomplished. For example, the CSW worker 2005 s urvey found that 84.2% of CSWs use a
condom regularly and 60% of CSWs were reached with prevention programs.

The e fficiency of t he treatment c omponents of the pr oject w ere qua ntified i n t erms of cost
effectiveness f or a d eath av erted d ue t o t reatment an d ca re. P ublic a ccess t o t reatment w as
established in 2004 during the project, and treatment expanded from less than 100 adults and
children on treatment to 4,458 as of September 2008 under the Bank-financed project and the
Global Fund. AIDS deaths have declined since 2004 from 665 deaths to 320 deaths in 2007. The
cumulative deaths averted between 2004 to 2007 due to treatment are estimated to be between
729 to 1,044, and the estimated cost per death averted between US$20,596 to US$29,507. It
should be noted that the estimated cost effectiveness is likely to be an upper estimate as future
deaths averted due to treatment from 2004 t o 2007 are not yet included, although interventions
have already been provided. The actual number of deaths averted is likely to be higher than that
estimated.

On the basis of these achievements, efficiency is rated as Satisfactory.

The overall outcome rating of the project is Satisfactory based on the high relevance, satisfactory
achievements of the PDO and satisfactory efficiency.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts


(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

This w as no t a pov erty-targeted ope ration. H owever, t he p roject d id p rovide t argeted
interventions to specific gender groups as part of its targeted prevention programs, including
CSWs and MSM. The project also had a substantial impact in terms of broad social development
through its outreach programs to communities which included awareness campaigns, setting up
out-reach H IV testing a nd c ounseling sites, parenting workshops, youth l eader training, pe er
education, condom provision, etc. This also included targeting of certain community groups such
as police officers, taxi drivers, youths in correction facilities, and prisoners. Anecdotal evidence
and information collected dur ing the I CR mission, i n interviews w ith all t he r elevant
stakeholders, highlighted overall increased awareness and social cohesion of the communities,
and better understanding by communities of the main risk factors and drivers of the HIV/AIDS
epidemic. This finding is also consistent with the results of the most recent KABP survey (2008)
which s hows that Jamaicans di splay i ncreasing a cceptance o f people living with AIDS with
(82.8%) willing to take care of an infected family member, with 77% supporting HIV infected
teachers to continue to teach and 58.2% supportive of a family member disclosing his/her HIV
status.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The p roject had a substantial impact on i nstitutional de velopment bot h i n t erms of the
establishment and development of an effective HIV/AIDS Unit in the Ministry of Health and also
in expanding the capacity of line ministries with focal points appointed in each, the strengthening
of capacity of Regional Health Authorities, of the NAC and NGOs. These achievements are
discussed above in Section 3.2 in greater detail since institutional strengthening was an actual
project development objective and a component of this project. It should also be mentioned that
the formal business sector also benefitted from information and stigma reduction workshops and
from specific interventions supported by the project.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Negligible.

The r isk t o de velopment out come i s considered to be ne gligible. The National H IV/AIDS
Program is well-accepted and enjoys support at the highest levels of Government. The 2007-
2012 National HIV Strategic Plan i s currently under implementation. The project helped to
expand and firmly establish an HIV/AIDS coordination unit inside the MOH which is now an
example of a w ell-functioning and effective operation. The un it i s c harged w ith t he

implementation of the National HIV/AIDS program as a whole and works closely with all donors,
external partners as well as with a variety of internal stakeholders, including the relevant sector
Ministries, Regional Health Authorities and parishes, and the NGO sector. The unit is now
staffed with competent professionals all of whom have a high degree of professional and personal
commitment t o t his p rogram. Additionally, t he pr oject ha s p rovided f inancing f or t he k ey
HIV/AIDS staff of the Regional Health Authorities and for focal points/coordinators in the five
key sector Ministries who are implementing their respective parts of the National Program. Most
recently, the Government has agreed to convert 21 staff (some staff of the PCU and staff of
Regional Health Authorities) to regular Government positions, which further demonstrates a high
degree of confidence and commitment by t he Government in the operation of the HIV/AIDS
program. T he G overnment pl ans t o a bsorb m ore pos itions i n t he c oming ye ars du ring t he
implementation of the second Bank-financed HIV/AIDS project.

The sustainability of the project's achievements also appears very likely given the continued
demonstrated Government interest and commitment in working with the Bank and other donors
(Global F und, U NAIDS a nd U NICEF). A s a lready mentioned a bove, a s econd H IV/AIDS
project (US$25 million) was approved in May 2008 and has become effective in October 2008.
This second project will build on the many achievements of the first project, in particular, in the
expansion of the prevention measures. Also, the MOH has received a second grant in mid-2008
from the Global Fund in the amount of US$44 million to cover the 2009-2012 period which will
further expand HIV/AIDS treatment.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The B ank's s upport a t t he t ime of pr eparation was i nstrumental in further de veloping a nd
expanding the National HIV/AIDS Program. The project was included in the CAS and the Bank
approved this operation one year after the first identification mission. The Bank team prepared a
well-written PAD, with a clear and comprehensive project design and objectives although the
project was rather complex and ambitious, with multiple s ub-components. To i mplement t he
project successfully, strong implementation arrangements were necessary particularly given that
this was a first Bank-financed health project in Jamaica, with a new team on the ground which
had not previously i mplemented a Bank-financed project, and in light of the r elatively weak
implementation capacity in this field in the country. Indeed, the PAD and several aide-memoires
placed great importance on having workable implementation arrangements. However, despite the
best i ntentions o f t he B ank t eam a nd c learly formulated do cuments to ensure appropriate
arrangements, several interviews conducted during the ICR preparation point to t he fact that
operationally practical implementation arrangements, appropriate for country circumstances, with
clear procedures (particularly procurement and financial arrangements) were not in place to get
the project off to a good start. This inevitably led to delays later on.

To the Bank's credit, the project design included a separate component on strengthening capacity,
and indeed, weak capacity was identified as a risk. T his component envisioned major changes
and improvements in the overall management structures in the Government at central, regional
and local levels. However, these changes require dedicated financial resources and a long period
of time to materialize which the Bank team recognized as a challenge for implementation. In
terms of the involvement of the NGO community, the Bank could have done a more realistic
assessment of their capacity to participate in the demand-driven sub-projects. Likewise, the Bank

                                                  24

team assumed that the existing capacity of RHAs would either be sufficient or be strengthened,
but in reality this turned out to be a major challenge during implementation, with high turn-over
of staff and very weak capacity. In retrospect, the project may have benefitted from a less
ambitious d esign a nd a more g radual, pr actical a nd f ocused approach, w hich m ight ha ve
prevented s ome of t he i mplementation di fficulties. In a ddition, the or iginal f low of f unds
arrangement turned out to be inadequate and the Bank assessment that "this project had a simple
level of financing" did not consider the actual needs and the realities on the ground.

The Bank's assurance of quality at entry is rated as Moderately Satisfactory because the Bank
provided critical support to the Government for the HIV/AIDS Program and acted as a catalyst
for the other international efforts to support Jamaica in the fight against HIV/AIDS, most notably
the Global Fund. The Bank team prepared an excellent project, albeit complex and challenging.
As noted above, the Bank could have done a better job in establishing an appropriate flow of
funds mechanism, better aligned procurement arrangements with country circumstances, as well
as clear and practical implementation arrangements.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Bank's performance during project supervision is rated as Moderately Satisfactory. During
the first year of the project, the Bank team leadership changed several times (different task team
leaders from the preparation period) w hich made supervision difficult, but most importantly,
these changes were not helpful to the client at a crucial time when the Jamaica PCU was just
starting its operation. During the initial period, the Bank fiduciary specialists did not display the
needed flexibility with respect to the flow of funds issues and the procurement issues which
arose. I t took roughly a year to reach final agreement to adjust the flow of funds to project
implementation needs and to allow certain procurement procedures, as discussed earlier.

After mid-2003, the project was supervised by the same task team leader through semi-annual,
albeit short, s upervision missions. Missions w ere us ually he ld in Kingston a nd relevant
counterparts from the regions came to Kingston during some supervision missions. The Bank
team occasionally made some field visits, although generally the Bank team relied on the strong
support provided by the HIV/AIDS unit (PCU) in Kingston. I n retrospect, it might have been
useful and possibly more effective to spend more time in the field to gain additional information
which can only be available at that level. S upervision missions were also carried out by the
fiduciary team and these specialists worked closely with the counterparts and with the Bank task
team leader to resolve issues. During the ICR mission, the Government counterparts expressed
their appreciation f or t he Bank s upervision team a nd f elt t hat the G overnment r eceived t he
necessary assistance, although at times the assistance may have taken longer than desired. This
was particularly the case with respect to the Bank's financial/disbursement assistance on issues
which proved to be especially challenging during the course of implementation. Also, the PCU
complained that the Bank took a long time to send its `no-objections'. Overall, however, the
project received appropriate supervision which allowed for the identification of bottlenecks in
project implementation and development of appropriate solutions.

In terms of supervision documents (aide memoires, ISRs and follow-up letters), these were timely
and provided updates on the project, highlighted pending or important issues to be followed up,
and generally rated project implementation realistically. The project was downgraded twice by
the Bank team due to implementation delays and the Bank team worked closely with Government
to identify ways to speed up implementation of the project. The Bank approved three separate
amendments to the LA in order to facilitate implementation and supported the extension of the


                                                 25

project and the cancellation of US$4.4 million when it became clear that the Loan would not be
fully disbursed. M anagement comments were not included on at least half of the supervision
documents, although management was aware of the project's progress.

The ICR mission found that the Bank team did not systematically track data on all agreed project
indicators, and information on indicators was not included in any of the aide memoires. During
the first three years, no data on indicators were recorded at all; this was due to the fact that the
PCU could not find a suitable Monitoring and Evaluation specialist, and therefore, no work was
done to track progress on indicators. The first time that any progress data on indicators was
recorded i n B ank s upervision doc uments w as m id-2005, although t his w as f or only a few
indicators. None of the supervision documents ever included an Annex with information on the
full set of agreed indicators. Based purely on documentation available to the ICR author, there
appears to have been insufficient attention paid to this issue during supervision. The reason for
lacking documentation in this area may stem from the Bank's comfort level with the PCU M&E
team in collecting and monitoring the necessary data. I ndeed, information was collected and
monitored by the PCU as described in Section 2.3 on Monitoring and Evaluation. In any event,
the collection and verification of data was challenging and took some time during the preparation
of the ICR because data had to be found and verified for each of the 24 indicators from scratch.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The overall Bank performance in supporting the Government in its expansion of the HIV/AIDS
program is rated as Moderately Satisfactory given the same rating for both quality at entry and
supervision.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Government remained highly committed and supportive of the HIV/AIDS Program and to
the project. In terms of Government counterpart contribution, the Government opted not to have
100% Bank financing of project activities and insisted that the Government contribute to the
project. The original estimated Government contribution was 10% of the loan (US$1.5 million).
However, two issues that plagued project implementation and that were continuously highlighted
by the Bank were the insufficient budget line items for the project and insufficient counterpart
funds. These issues were particularly problematic during the first half of the project and affected
the s peed of p roject i mplementation. The financial pe rformance o f t he G overnment w as
continuously r ated as unsatisfactory for t hese reasons by t he Bank, a nd while t his w as
understandable given t he fiscal c onstraints i n Jamaica, this di d ha ve a negative i mpact a nd
required enormous efforts to resolve. In the end, the Government ended up contributing a total of
US$4.53 million, w hich is t hree times the original estimate. In view of earlier contribution
difficulties, it is an impressive achievement.

In terms of other Government support provided to the project, the National Planning Council, a
multi-sectoral body of representatives of v arious line m inistries, a cted as an overseer of the
progress in t he ov erall HIV/AIDS P rogram a nd c ontributed to r aising a wareness about
HIV/AIDS. All line ministries were very supportive during the project, establishing focal points
and implementing annual agreed awareness and outreach programs.




                                                26

Also, during 2008, the Government made a decision to convert 21 staff supporting the HIV/AIDS
Program into regular Government staff and there are plans to continue to convert other staff in the
future. This is an indicator of the importance that the Government of Jamaica places on the
continued successful roll-out of the HIV/AIDS Program.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The Ministry of Health (MOH) was the implementing agency for this project, but specifically the
HIV/AIDS coordination unit for the HIV/AIDS Program (PCU) was in charge of the day-to-day
implementation. The MOH Minister (until 2006) provided substantial support to the HIV/AIDS
program and had an excellent relationship with the PCU Project Director and staff. Likewise, the
PCU worked effectively with the Ministry of Finance whose support was critical despite the fiscal
deficits and tight fiscal space.

A number of c hallenges ha d t o be ov ercome by t he MOH P CU dur ing the c ourse o f
implementation. This was the first Bank-financed HIV-AIDS project in the health sector, and the
staff were all new and had to learn quickly on the job and deal with very complicated issues in a
highly bureaucratic environment. During implementation, the PCU f aced a number of ot her
hurdles, i ncluding t he ne gotiation o f annual b udgets w ithin a c onstrained f inancial resource
envelope, financial management and disbursement issues which arose during the first year of the
project, the lengthy and complicated process of preparation and approval of annual procurement
plans, cumbersome procurement processes, including extensive procurement review layers (both
internal and Bank) which led to implementation delays, limited NGO capacity and consequent
need to provide NGOs with extensive training on pr oject procurement and management, and
limited capacity and high turn-over of staff at the Regional Health Authorities who also received
substantial training by the PCU.

The PCU managed to overcome these challenges thanks to the leadership of an exceptionally
dedicated Project Director. His keen knowledge of the sector and his overwhelmingly good sense
of what had to be done and when made him an excellent manager of the HIV/AIDS Program, and
this was a key factor contributing to the success of the project. H is ability to build a strong,
experienced a nd committed t eam in t he P CU really l aunched the program a nd e nsured its
sustainability in the future. As the Director mentioned during the interviews for this ICR, the
PCU staff were among the best in Jamaica and were responsible for moving this project forward.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The rating for overall Government performance in the expansion of the HIV/AIDS program and
the implementation of this project is rated as Satisfactory. Overall, the Government remained
highly committed to the cause of the HIV/AIDS and continued to support annual project plans
and programs in a substantial way. This is particularly significant given the overall tight fiscal
situation t hroughout t he project period a nd the persistent budg et de ficits. The M OH was
supported in t he i mplementation by a n e xcellent P CU t eam l ed by a highly c ompetent and
dedicated P roject Director an d w ith dedicated t eams o f r egional an d l ocal co ordinators,
counselors, peer educators, and key partners in line ministries.


6. Lessons Learned

General:


                                                 27

   ·   Investment in human capacity yields high results in the end despite the enormous efforts
       required; adequate financial resources should be provided to this task so that people can
       properly implement activities and sustain achievements made.
   ·   Continuity in Bank preparation and supervision staff is critical to ensure effective project
       start-up. Supervision budgets need to be sufficient to allow teams enough presence in the
       country to develop an in-depth understanding and to conduct first-hand reviews of project
       implementation in detail.
   ·   Clear implementation arrangements must be in place at start of implementation, both in
       terms of institutional and fiduciary arrangements.

Project Specific:
   ·   In countries such as Jamaica, where high-risk groups are still the main drivers of the
       HIV/AIDS epidemic, project efforts and expenditures should be concentrated on these
       groups to yield maximum results.
   ·   During project preparation, the overall environment for procurement should be assessed
       and t he de sign of procurement arrangements should ba lance t ransparency and
       accountability with effective i mplementation. F or i nstance, h igher t hresholds for
       requiring competitive bidding should be considered. .
   ·   Financial a rrangements a nd the f low of funds m echanisms should respond to the
       implementation set-up, particularly in a project where a large portion of funds must be
       spent on the regional and local levels, where there is not always the experience in filling
       out complex pr ocurement documentation and where t he number of suppliers may be
       limited.
   ·   Simplified "service level agreements" should be recommended for projects with demand-
       driven subproject components in order to expand NGO involvement.
   ·   Decreases in prevalence s hould not be used as indicators of s uccess or f ailure o f
       HIV/AIDS projects because i ncreased testing a nd treatment m easures m ay actually
       increase prevalence rather than reduce it. C learly, an overall reduction in prevalence
       should be a long-term goal.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1. Introduction: Jamaica has both a generalized and concentrated AIDS epidemic with an HIV
prevalence of 1.6% in the general adult population in 2007, based on UNAIDS estimates. The
Jamaica HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Project contributed US$10.6 million (not including
government c ontributions) t o pr evention, t reatment, a nd s trengthening capacity f or A IDS
response in the country, a nd t he m ajority of the loan w as used for pr evention e fforts. This
analysis will attempt to quantify the economic impact of the prevention and treatment efforts
separately in the following two sections.

2. The Economic Impact of HIV Prevention in the Jamaica HIV/AIDS Prevention and
Control Project: The original total cost of the project was supposed to be US $16.5 million with
$15 million through an IBRD loan from the World Bank and $1.5 million through borrower
contributions. Of the total $16.5 million project cost, 47% of the original budget ($7.82 million)
was allocated for prevention activities. The project was later restructured with the World Bank
loan being r educed t o $10.6 million. The actual government contribution was $4.53 million,
resulting in a total of US$15.13 million. With the receipt of a Global Fund grant for treatment
activities in 2004, the majority of these funds were used for prevention activities.

These prevention efforts included VCT, STI services, peer education, mass media and outdoor
advertising c ampaigns, r isk r eduction c ounseling, a nd c ondom promotion a nd access. The
prevention activities w ere t argeted a t hi gh-risk g roups ( such as sex w orkers, MSM, p rison
inmates, and young people) as well as the general population.

The impact of HIV prevention programs is difficult to determine for a variety of reasons: HIV
incidence data rarely exist, particularly for high-risk groups; the lack of an effective surrogate
marker f or HIV; and few na tional programs are r andomized or ha ve e xogenous variation to
develop an appropriate counterfactual for the number of HIV infections if the program had not
been implemented. In fact, the empirical evidence for effective HIV prevention interventions is
rather weak, with few randomized controlled trials showing positive impacts of HIV prevention
interventions, except for male circumcision and needle exchange programs (Potts et al 2008,
Padian et al 2008). Thus, the impact of national prevention programs can be difficult to assess.

For comparison purposes, the economic impact from HIV prevention components in this project
can b e e stimated u sing t he co st benefit analysis m ethodology t hat w as u sed i n t he P roject
Appraisal Document (PAD). The original benefits consisted of averted productivity losses and
savings on in-patient care and on treatment of opportunistic illnesses, all due to averted infections
from HIV prevention activities. Benefits from HIV treatment were not included in the original
cost benefit analysis as the project focused primarily on prevention activities. A summary of the
original be nefits a nd costs i s p resented in Table 1 .1 Based on these costs a nd be nefits, the
prevention components of the project would have had a net present value (NPV) of $36.3 million
(using a 10% discount rate) and an internal rate of return (IRR) of 57.6%.




1The project costs for prevention used in the original cost-benefit analysis were calculated as US
$11 million (costs from 2002-2006), which may have been an approximation for the prevention
and capacity strengthening components.

A revised cost benefit analysis can be conducted to determine whether the project achieved its
estimated net present value using similar assumptions but with actual costs, population, and HIV
indicators over the 2001 and 2008 period. A without-project scenario and with-project scenario
will be constructed to calculate the number of HIV infections averted that can be attributed to the
project. From these infections averted, the project benefits can be calculated for the cost benefit
analysis.

As before, the prevalence rate in year t is equal to the prevalence in year t-1 + incidence in year t
­ AIDS deaths in year t. HIV prevalence in both scenarios is assumed to be 1.52% in 2001, using
the prevalence rate in the original cost-benefit analysis calculation. AIDS deaths are assumed to
be the same in both the without-project scenario and the with-project scenario.

To maintain consistency with the original cost-benefit analysis, the same assumption is used for
HIV incidence rate, which is assumed to be 50 per 100,000 total population in the without-project
scenario. This incidence rate may be an underestimate of the counterfactual trend, however, since
HIV incidence is likely to increase without prevention interventions. Any underestimation of the
counterfactual trend f or HIV i ncidence w ould o nly lead to an und erestimate ( or m ore
conservative estimate) of the project benefits. Table 2 shows the number of people newly infected
with HIV and total people living with HIV for t he without-project scenario. Based on these
assumptions, without the project, the prevalence rate would have reached 1.74% by 2007.

Prevalence rates for age 15-49 are difficult to estimate, with different figures based on ANC
surveillance among pregnant women and other target populations. The prevalence rate we use is
1.60% ba sed on U NAIDS f or 20 07, and the p revalence r ate f rom 2002 to 2006 is linearly
interpolated. Using these prevalence rates, the number of people living with HIV is calculated,
and then the number of people newly infected with HIV (see Table 3).

The number of infections averted is the difference in number of people newly infected with HIV
between the without- and with-project scenarios. The benefits from these averted infections are
calculated in Table 4 and a re comprised of averted pr oductivity l osses (by remaining in t he
workforce) a nd savings on i n-patient c are and on treatment o f o pportunistic illnesses. The
assumptions are the same as in the PAD and are described again here:

    ·   On average, an averted infection provides an individual with thirty-three more years of
        productive life. This figure is calculated as pension age of 60 years minus average age of
        infection of 27 y ears. This figure is essentially the same as the 32.7 a ge standardized
        disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for each HIV infection averted for Jamaica in
        2002 (WHO 2004).

    ·   Average a nnual p roductivity i s v alued a t U S$1,766, which is p er capita spending in
        2000.2

    ·   An infected patient will live for 10 years after infection with adequate care.

    ·   The average a nnual c ost of care pe r pa tient is U S$1,059, which is c alculated a s 14
        hospital da ys a t $61 pe r day + $200 i n pa lliative c are a nd pr evention/treatment of
        opportunistic infections.

    ·   Benefits accrue five years after the infection has been averted for the disease to progress
        and translate into productivity losses and health care costs for the individual.

2This assumption was kept to keep the benefit calculation in 2000 US$ to be comparable to the
original calculation.

The stream of costs and benefits from the HIV prevention components of the project is shown in
Table 5. As before, it is assumed that the Government continues spending US$1 million a year
after project closing to maintain the program.3 Based on these costs and benefits, the net present
value of the prevention components of the project is US$50.8 million (based on a 10% discount
rate) and the IRR is 64.9%. The NPV and IRR are both higher than that originally estimated for
the project.

3. The Economic Impact of HIV Treatment and Care in the Jamaica HIV/AIDS Prevention
and Control Project: The World Bank project directly supported treatment activities in the early
stages of the project including procurement of ARVs for PMTCT and PEP. In 2004, a Global
Fund grant in round 3 was awarded, providing US$23.3 million for treatment and care from June
2004-2009 (of which US$6.65 million has been spent on ARV drugs from June 2004 to March
2008). This funding greatly expanded t reatment s tarting i n 2004 when a program for publ ic
access to treatment was established. Prior to 2004, less than a hundred people in Jamaica were on
ART; as of September 2008, about 4,458 adults and children are on treatment (see Table 6).

Table 6. Number of adults and children on treatment
                               2003         2004       2005        2006        2007        2008

Currently it is estimated that approximately 6,500 persons have advanced HIV (CD4 count < 350
cells/mm3) and are in need of treatment. Treatment coverage has steadily increased over time,

3US$1 million is roughly equal to the amount of government funding for HIV prevention from
2005-2007. This figure was calculated from the current funding for HIV prevention multiplied by
the share of government funding out of domestic sources of funding.

from 50% of adults and children with advanced HIV infection receiving ART in 2005 to 69% as
of September 2008.

Public access to ART, improved laboratory capacity, and general improved quality of care for
PLWHA have greatly reduced the numbers of AIDS cases and deaths in Jamaica. Figure 1 shows
the number of AIDS cases and deaths in Jamaica from 1982 t o 2007, and the epidemiological
data show an increasing trend in AIDS cases until 2005 and for AIDS deaths until 2002. After
each of t hose i nflection points, r espectively, A IDS cases and deaths be gin to de cline. A IDS
deaths declined from 665 in 2004 to 320 in 2007, and much of this decline can be attributed to
public access to ART.

The economic impact of HIV treatment and care provided can be estimated in terms of cost
effectiveness for a d eath averted ( World B ank 1996). The c ost effectiveness ratio w ill be
calculated as the cost of HIV treatment components divided by the number of deaths averted
when c omparing t he a ctual A IDS de aths obs erved w ith t he c ounterfactual of no A RT
intervention. The actual deaths observed will be based on da ta from the Jamaica Ministry of
Health National HIV/STD Control Programme, which assumes that all reductions in AIDS deaths
are attributable to the treatment components of the program. The counterfactual for AIDS deaths
that would have occurred without treatment expansion for 2004-2007 is modeled in two ways: i)
as the linear extrapolation of the trend in AIDS deaths in the previous five years, and ii) as a
constant trend of 2004 AIDS deaths.4 The constant trend is used to derive a lower bound for the
number of deaths averted, and the linear trend is used to derive an upper bound.
Table 7. Estimated Deaths Averted from ART Expansion



4The counterfactual for AIDS deaths could have been calculated using SPECTRUM, however
the AIDS death projections based on UN Population Division demographic projections and actual
HIV prevalence, treatment, and MTCT figures poorly reflect the actual AIDS deaths observed.
The OLS regression equation for AIDS deaths is AIDS deaths = -54809 + 27.7t.

In T able 7, the c umulative de aths averted be tween 2004 a nd 2007 attributable to t reatment
expansion is e stimated to be b etween 729 a nd 1,0 44 deaths a verted. Even the upp er bound
estimate of the cumulative deaths averted is a conservative estimate of the impact of treatment
because future deaths averted are not included. Currently 4,458 people are on t reatment, which
suggests that a large number of future deaths averted could also be attributed to the project.

Using these conservative estimates, the estimated cost per death averted is then between US
$20,596 to $29,507. This cost effectiveness ratio is based on the Global Fund money spent on
treatment to date ($21.5 million) divided by the number of deaths averted. The benefits quantified
in this section are exclusive to averted deaths for HIV treatment, and do not quantify averted
deaths from HIV prevention or other benefits of treatment (e.g., increased productivity, care for
orphans, human capital accumulation). More importantly, this estimate is likely to be a significant
underestimate, as future deaths averted due to treatment today are not included.

                    Implementation Completion Results Report
                                       January 22, 2009


Overview

The National H IV/STI P rogramme (NHP) ha s led t he G overnment's r esponse to the HIV
epidemic since 1986. The programme has three main goals, reducing the transmission of new
HIV infections; mitigating the impact of HIV/AIDS on the people of Jamaica; and achieving a
sustained, e ffective multi-sectoral infrastructure to support the na tional r esponse to HIV a nd
AIDS. T he c adre of i mplementing a gencies i nvolved i n t he na tional r esponse i ncludes a ll
government ministries (notably the MOHE's four regional health authorities), the tripartite team
of government, employers and workers, the business sector and non-governmental organizations
including faith-based entities.

Timing of the support from the World Bank was important as the Programme was in the process
of completing the Strategic Plan (2002 ­ 2006) and there was a significant resource gap. The
ensuing loan proposal was developed with strong involvement of the NHP as it was critical that it
impacted directly the lives of persons infected and affected by HIV and AIDs and stemmed the
epidemic through rapid expansion of existing behaviour change efforts.

A Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) was established and personnel hired in the four regional
health authorities and line ministries to drive the implementation. Implementation delays were
experienced in identifying staff to fill some key posts, there was also an underestimation of the
level of effort required to effectively roll-out the project resulting in additional staff being added
to the list to be hired. Procurement issues including discrepancies between the Government of



                                                  47

Jamaica pr ocurement system t hresholds and t he W orld B ank t hresholds; a nd one rous
procurement processes further compounded delays.

Despite the c hallenges, all s tated activities w ere implemented. The d ecision t o adopt a
programmatic approach to implementation based on the strategic plan and guided by continuous
research (monitoring and evaluation) proved sound. Prevention interventions however need to
extend be yond t he i ndividual and the i nterpersonal to execute s trategies t hat mobilize ot her
players who critically impact the environment. These strategies must of necessity include the
social agencies as well as those organizations that are responsible for the economic development
that translate into employment opportunities for those below the poverty line. Interventions must
also b e c ognizant o f g ender r elated issues that i mpact the p ractice of the d esirable s afer
behaviours. In addition there has to be capacity building within the sectors as it relates to both
technical and human resources in order to achieve a multiplier effect thus scaling up coverage.

One of the key lessons learned from implementing the National HIV/AIDS Response is that the
successes in treatment cannot be sustained without significant scaling up of prevention efforts--
namely be haviour c hange e fforts w ith specific v ulnerable groups. P IOJ d ata indicates t hat
approximately 37% o f t he popul ation l ives be low the pov erty l evel a nd a n additional 20 %
fluctuate in and out. Jamaica Survey of Living Conditions, 2004 indicates that in 2003, 11% of
children living in poverty; in rural areas 27% children living in poverty. The linkages between
poverty, social vulnerability and HIV are well known and intricately linked in a vicious cycle
being intensely fueled by each other. These individuals are more vulnerable to HIV infection
because m aking s afer he althy c hoices s ometimes c onflicts w ith de cisions f or da ily s urvival.
Therefore despite a high level of knowledge and attempts at practicing the new behaviours, the
behaviours are not sustained as they are usually i n conflict with choices for daily existence,
gender norms and the constantly evolving sub cultural norms and values.

Component 1: Preventive Programs Targeted at High Risk Groups and the General
Population

The prevention component of the national programme evolved since its first campaigns of the late
1980s. The national Knowledge A ttitude P ractice and B ehaviour ( KAPB) surveys conducted
from 1988-1994 pointed to significant increases in knowledge (as much as 97%) but a lagging in
behaviour change ( approximately 47%). The s upport of t he W orld B ank Loan pr ompted t he
introduction and t he intensification of s trategies that w ould encourage be haviour c hange.
Consequently there has been a mix of strategies that have been directed at the general population
as well as clearly identified sub populations that practice behaviours that increase their risk of
HIV infection.

The strategies have ranged from targeted interventions within geographical high transmission
locations as well as targeted to specific audiences, to the use of cultural vehicles, various print
and electronic media materials and mass media campaigns. The interventions have extended to
the bu ilding of alliances a nd several collaborative e fforts w ith the n on-governmental
organizations (NGOs) including faith-based (FBOs), and government organizations. During the
collaboration with these organizations, the technical capacity of the agencies were improved to
deliver more effective behaviour change interventions

The implementing capacity was expanded to include five sector (line) ministries with increased
focus on w orkplace p olicy de velopment and i mplementation. This approach a ssisted t he
establishment of enabling e nvironments within government w orksites for e ncouraging s afer
sexual behaviours.


                                                48

Increased collaboration with NGOs and non-health government sectors resulted in the expansion
of interventions to targeted communities and workplaces. It also built the technical capacity of
sector a nd community groups t o c onduct interventions based on be haviour change
communication strategies. To complement the World Bank funded activities, the Global Fund
supported a cadre of outreach behaviour change community peer educators and the introduction
of (PLACE) ­ Priorities for Local AIDS Control Efforts. PLACE provided another research and
intervention tool to identify sites where people meet new sexual partners, confirm t hem and
conduct randomized control trials. This process broadened the scope of targeted intervention and
provided a resource team equipped to use culturally-appropriate strategies within a time-sensitive
framework.

Targeted Community Intervention (TCI): Targeted c ommunity i ntervention strategy is
conducted in geographic communities that have been identified as high transmission areas. The
areas are identified primarily from surveillance data relating to STI and HIV prevalence. This
approach emphasizes the need for sustainability hence peer education and increasing condom
access are t wo main activities t hat the community members are e xpected to c arry out. T his
strategy has been implemented to varying degrees within the regions. The national BCC team
provides technical guidance to the regional team to design, implement and evaluate this strategy.

Youth Interventions: Adolescents 12 -19 years were identified as one of the primary vulnerable
groups to HIV infection. Prevention interventions were designed to reach specific segments of
this population. The segmentation was based on gender and age, namely: males and females
adolescents 12- 14 y ears, 15 - 19 y ears a total o f four g roups. The interventions h ave be en
conducted primarily in informal settings. However there has been collaboration with the Ministry

of Education Youth and Culture (MOEYC) to build the capacity of that sector to implement
interventions in the school setting.

Condom Social Marketing: A condom social marketer was contracted in the last quarter of 2005
to promote the increased establishment of non-traditional condom outlets. The stated strategy of
the m arketer w as to secure t he commitment of t he major condom distribution companies to
provide c ondoms to non-traditional condom di stributors a nd to establish 30 non- traditional
condom outlets. A t the end of the loan period, forty-one (41) non-traditional distributors were
identified in the South East Region (St. Thomas, Kingston & St. Andrew and St. Catherine).
Vulnerable Populations: Baseline research was conducted among men having sex with men
(MSM) during 2003. The study identified some of the issues and barriers to access to prevention
and treatment. The NHP commissioned this study and the Consultant established a partnership
with the Jamaica AIDS Support for Life (JASL) to gain access to the MSM community. Peer
education was used as a key intervention strategy for reaching MSM and other vulnerable groups
such as commercial sex workers (CSW).

Other k ey P revention a chievements i ncluded t he establishment of a n a lliance w ith m edia
managers facilitating substantial discounts in the placement costs for mass media campaigns. The
Programme collaborated with the Ministry of Education to revise the Health and Family Life
Education (HFLE) curriculum in primary and secondary schools and the pilot of this curriculum
in 24 schools. Workplace policies were developed and implemented in five sectors including the
development of the National HIV/AIDS Workplace Policy by the Ministry of Labour and Social
Security. This development has also resulted in the substantial involvement of PLWHA in sector
programmes geared toward sensitising workers. The loan also supported: the increased cadre of
community peer educators and targeted intervention officers who have been trained in conducting
risk reduction conversations and other targeted approaches; the development and placement of
mass media c ampaigns had m essages t o address prevention o f m other-to-child t ransmission
(PMTCT), adherence to ARVs; abstinence, and condom-use among sexually active young men.
Three a nti-stigma c ampaigns were de veloped " Live P ositive," w hich f eatured na tional
personalities endorsing t he stigma r eduction m essages, "Defend This" w hich f ocused o n
reduction of stigma and discrimination in the workplace and "Getting on With Life" which put a
face on HIV by highlighting two persons living with HIV.

Sector & Community Response:              The Five L ine M inistries w ere L ocal G overnment,
Community Development and Sport, Labour & Social Security, National Security, Education and
Youth, Tourism, Entertainment & Culture. The Line Ministries strengthened mechanisms to
coordinate their response, Focal Points were hired and later the World Bank supported the hiring
of Local Technical Assistants to assist them. These were replaced by Workplace Programme
Officers and these individuals led the process to develop workplace polices and workplans aimed
at implementing and sustaining the efforts. The Tourism ministry was among the first ministries
to create a draft policy in 2002.

HIV/AIDS Demand Driven Sub-Projects: The Programme underestimated the capacity of the
NGOs t o deliver the services required under this component. Many NGOs do not have t he
required staff to run their organisations and to apply the same procurement processes as utilized
by the PCU. A proposal was therefore drafted for the use of service level contracts when granting
funds to Civil service Organisations for HIV/AIDS demand driven Projects. While the proposal
for civil service contracts was reviewed and approved by the World Bank, the project to date has
not utilized a s ervice level contract. The procurement a nd financial management capacity of
NGOs still remains in the implementation of HIV/AIDS Projects.

Challenges: Although the majority of persons report condom use with a non-regular sex
partner, there has been no further change in reported safer sexual behaviours in the past
ten years. Just about 77% of males and 67% of females aged 15 ­49 years reported condom
use at last sex with non-regular partners. In addition, inaccurate perceptions about
HIV/AIDS transmission persist (such as the erroneous belief that you can actually tell by
looking who has HIV). This is evidenced by the fact that only 36% of young men and 40%
of young women were able to identify correctly the ways of preventing the sexual
transmission of HIV and at the same time, reject major misconceptions about AIDS.

There has also been a decline in the median age of first sex from 15.7 years in males and 17.2
years in females in 2004. The 1996 KAPB revealed the median age of first sex at 16.43 years in
males and 18.2 years in females. The survey conducted in 2000 recorded this at 15.5 years for
males and females 17.5 years. In addition, high-risk behaviours such as having unprotected sex,
multiple sex partners and sex with CSWs were reported by a significant portion of the general
population. In 2002, about 27% of those aged 15-24 who wase married or with a common-law
partner, had sexual relations with more than one partner. Nearly half of those with a `visiting
partner' had sexual relations with more than one partner (RHS 2002). Moreover, there has been
an increase in reported sex with CSWs over the last decade.

Component 2: Basic Health Care and Treatment and Support for PLWHas

Over the last five years Jamaica has developed and is on the road to implementing an extensive
system of care t hat i ncludes H IV voluntary counselling a nd t esting, diagnostic services,
counselling, psychological and social support, provision of specialized clinical care inclusive of
access t o antiretroviral medications. This programme augmented by t he W orldbank pr oject
received a Global Fund grant in 2004 which faciliated the provision of life saving Antiretrovirals
to persons with AIDS.

Screening and Diagnostic Service: Currently a vol untary counselling a nd t esting s ite i s
established i n a ll m ajor health c entres w ith ov er 95% o f r elevant s taff ( including C ontact
Investigators, Social Workers and Public Health Nurses) trained in VCT protocol. HIV testing is
now decentralized. HIV rapid testing was introduced in peripheral clinics allowing same day
results in some instances and provider initiated testing implemented at major hospitals.

Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission (PMTCT): The P MTCT pr otocol using
AZT/NEV w as de veloped and i mplemented as well a s a ne w protocol using HAART.
Antiretroviral (ARV) treatment for the Prevention of Mother-To-Child Transmission (PMTCT)
was provided to 84% of HIV-infected pregnant women and more than 90% of HIV-exposed
infants in 2007. Currently screening is done for more than 90% of public sector Antenatal Clinic
attendees (97% in 2005 compared to 39% in 2003) and more than 50% of STI Clinic attendees
(19,000 in 2004). PCR tests for infants of HIV positive mothers are undertaken allowing for
early diagnosis and treatment of paediatric AIDS

Post-Exposure Prophylaxis: A Training manual was developed and antiretroviral drugs for the
prevention of HIV transmission to accidentally exposed health care workers currently available in
all regions. Waste disposal supplies and personal protective equipment were provided at HIV
treatment sites

Medical Management: Most of the relevant health care workers have been trained in STI and
Opportunistic Infection (OI) Management and drugs procured and distributed to all regions for
the treatment of OIs and STIs. A manual on the nutritional management of HIV/AIDS was

                                                 51

developed and circulated by CFNI and CIDA. Nineteen treatment sites (paediatric and adult)
were established across the island with trained team of providers. Partnerships were established
with private physicians to enable the treatment of PLWHA in private setting. More than 3,500
adults and children started on A RVs, as per the National guidelines (at May 2008). Clinical
management of HIV/AIDS Guidelines were developed (2nd edition completed and to be placed
on NAP's website). Several trainings sessions were conducted for all categories of health care
workers ( including P harmacists, D octors, N urses, Social w orkers Contact I nvestigators,
adherence counsellors etc.) in clinical management of HIV/AIDS. An annual HIV/AIDS Clinical
Management Workshop through CHART was institutionalized.

Waste Management. The main activities achieved included the procurement and
distribution of waste disposal supplies and equipment, the implementation of waste audits
and training workshops on proper waste management procedures at 15 treatment sites, the
preparation of a National Medical Waste Management Policy and Code of Practice, and the
installation of the Treatment Plant and Equipment for Hazardous Healthcare Waste
Collection and Treatment. Identifying a suitable location for the waste treatment plant
presented some initial challenges. There was significant opposition by the community, which
resulted in the change of the original site identified. The contract was signed on July 4, 2007,
with the effective date of contract date established on August 13, 2007. However, there was
a delay at of the start of the contract due to the passage of hurricane Dean and the holding
of the General elections. Construction of the facility commenced in January 2008 and was
successfully completed in December 2008, including the installation, pre-commissioning
testing and training on all equipment. Interim operation of the plant is now in progress,
providing c ollection a nd t reatment s ervices to h ealthcare f acilities/treatment s ites w ithin th e
Southeast Health Region. This is a major milestone in the World Bank loan, as this, along with
the Laboratory Information System accounted for a significant portion of the loan funds.

Challenges: While m uch was ac complished, t here were ch allenges. I n o rder f or H IV/AIDS
Treatment Care and Support to be sustained and fully integrated within the mainstream health
services the following challenges must be addressed:

Testing: It is estimated that potentially 15,000 of the HIV infected persons do not know their
status; this represents 60% of the total number of infected individuals in Jamaica. Young people
15-24 years old are less likely to be tested than those aged 25-49. Less than half of CSWs tested
in the last 12 months knew the results. Only about 10% of hospital admissions were tested for
HIV, and even smaller percentages from Family Planning and other regular Clinics. Confirmation
of results at the NPHL was grossly inadequate with the turn-around time for results being months
at t imes due t o frequent reagent s tock outs. A dditionally, the s tandardized database for t he
capture of HIV rapid testing data was not widely implemented.

Diagnostic Services and Laboratory Capacity: The N ational L aboratory h as played a
significant role in the programme, however, the structure and management of the existing lab
services does not allow for efficiency. The facility has been heavily reliant on the NHP for
funding many aspects of its functioning. For example, between 2002 and 2006 in excess of J$58
million were spent through the NAP on consultancy fees, equipment and supplies.

The c apacity t o pr ovide CD4 and Viral Loads i n a ccordance w ith I nternational T reatment
Guidelines remained limited. As did the capacity to diagnose TB and track resistance to ARVs.

TB Screening: The s creening of H IV i nfected pe rsons for TB i s l imited. There w as a lso
inadequate follow up of TB contacts and i ndividuals w ho w ere t o c omplete t herapy i n t he

                                                 52

communities. Also, the limited as well as c entralized di agnostic capacity f or TB a nd the
absence o f su rviellance for m ulti d rug r esistant TB ad versly affected the s uccess of t he
programme.

Resurgence of Syphillis: The decline in the prevalence of syphillis has plateaued over the last
five years and recently there has been a small but significant increase in the rates of congenital
syphillis and syphillis among pregnant women and as well as STI Clinic attendees.

Stigma and Discrimination: The i mpact of stigma and discrimination prevents many f rom
getting tested, accessing regular care and/or disclosing their status to their partners. PLWHA
often do not want to receive treatment in their community because of concern that others may
learn their status. Women, in particular, fear violence from their partners if they disclose their
status. There is also a general inadequacy of customer service approaches within the health sector
which may also impact on persons Living with HIV

Staffing: There was a severe shortage of human resources in the field. Doctors, Nurses, Social
Workers, Nutritionists and others were all limited in numbers. T his limited the extent of the
Programme. Additionally, the numbers of staff were also threatened by attrition. The lack of
routine testing throughout the health system, limited integration with existing health and family
planning services, and inconsistent implementation and monitoring of the policies and plans were
in part due to this shortage.


Enabling Environment (Policy)

The component was designed to effect policy actions to support prevention and treatment care
and support has evolved as a more discreet feature of the response since 2004. P rior to this
period, policy interventions were part of other components. Workplace interventions began under
the Prevention Component through the integration of implementation into the national strategic
plan (2002-2006) by the five line ministries. G uidelines and regulations for HIV/AIDS were
developed und er t he treatment c omponent such a s g uidelines for a dolescents and m inors,
guidelines for home-based care, guidelines for accidental exposure of HIV, guidelines for clinical
management of HIV and AIDS and guidelines for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission.
With the advent of the Global Fund grant in 2004, a discreet component was created to deal with
improvement of accepting attitudes to PLWHAs through public education and advocacy and by
establishment of a policy framework to reduce dicrimination to PLWHA. Objectives therefore
focused on long-term outputs/outcomes such as the creation of an enabling environment and a
policy and legal framework.

Achievements during the period include approval of the National HIV/AIDS Policy by Cabinet
(2004) a nd by Parliament ( 2005) (National H IV/STI P rogramme), A pproval of t he N ational
HIV/AIDS Workplace Policy by Cabinet in 2007, Adaptation of the National HIV/AIDS Policy
and the Draft National HIV/AIDS Workplace Policy by public sector agencies and over 90 large
private s ector o rganisations. ( National H IV/STI Programme t hrough t he P rivate S ector
Organisation of Jamaica, the Jamaica Manufacturers Association, the Jamaica Business Council
on HIV/AIDS, the Jamaica Employers Federation, the Jamaica Confederation of Trade Unions
and all government ministries). This resulted in stand-alone HIV/AIDS workplace policies based
on the 10 key principles on HIV/AIDS in the world of work documented as guidelines by the
International Labour Organisation (ILO) in its Code of Practice on HIV/AIDS and the world of
work. Each organisation with an HIV/AIDS workplace policy has a one-year implementation
plan and this plan is being implemented by many of the organisations that have approved their
policy.

A review of existing l aws ha s b een c ompiled s ince 200 6 w ith r ecommendations for law
amendment to support policy interventions. Three areas have been earmarked for lobbying and
advocacy among Parliamentarians: (1) Occupational Health and Safety Act (Ministry of Labour
and Social Security); Amendment to the Public Health Act (Ministry of Health and Environment)
and Advocacy for approving the National HIV-Related Discrimination Reporting and Redress
System (National HIV/STI Programme).

Component 3: Health Systems and Capacity Development

Civil Works: The physical f acilities o f five treatment ce nters a nd t wenty-seven v oluntary
counselling and testing sites were improved thereby increasing accessibility and efficiency of the
delivery of health care.

Blood Safety: Efforts were aimed at switching from replacement to volunteer Blood Donor
recruitment.   A Communications Officer was hired and the post subsequently absorbed by
Ministry of Health into the National Blood Transfusion Service. Public awareness campaigns
launched to raise awareness, the Blood Transfusion Services Policy was drafted and equipment
purchased to support the efforts. Some of the achievement are donations from private firms
significantly increased, a database of volunteers established, visibility of the Blood Bank
increased, improved relationship with the private sector, increase in number of voluntary donors.


Improved Diagnostic Capacity of Service Delivery: Sixteen Voluntary Counselling
and Testing Sites were rehabilitated and Bills of Quantities prepared to inform a further
thirteen sites. Expansion/rehabilitation work on five Treatment Centres were completed ­
(South East ­ St. Jago Health Centre, Western ­ Cornwall Regional Hospital, Savanna-
La-Mar Hospital (waiting area expanded), North East ­ St. Ann's Bay (waiting area
expanded) and Southern - Mandeville Health Centre. Medical equipment and furniture
was also purchased for health facilities across the island.




Laboratory Information System: The LIS was the first of its kind in Jamaica and there was a
steep learning curve for all involved. The software was installed at the NPHL in May 2007 and
the process of configuration to meet the needs of the NPHL began. The configuration was a
detailed and lengthy process taking over a year to complete. D uring this time, the removal of
user fees in public hospitals resulted in an increase in the throughput creating a challenge for staff
especially in the Sample Reception area with a three-fold increase in the number of samples
presented. A t the e nd of t he loan pe riod, the process w as ne aring c ompletion with most
departments able to utilise the system. There are still minor issues being resolved and the vendor
and the lab continue to work together with the input of the Information Systems unit. The loan
supported the hiring of a Project manger (later replaced by a Project Coordinator), and a Systems
Administrator to support the implementation. For sustainability the Ministry of Health will be
hiring a Systems Administrator for the lab to ensure adequate management of the system.

In pr eparation for the L IS i mplementation, several a ctivities w ere und ertaken i ncluding
renovation activities t o the Sample R eception a rea, t he c reation o f a t raining room a nd
construction of a UPS room to house the two Unlimited Power Supply units also procured under
the programme. The lab was networked as well as t he Blood Bank, Comprehensive Health
Centre (CHC), Kingston Public Hospital (KPH) and Victoria Jubilee Hospital. Computers and
servers and computer related furniture was also purchased and installed.

Information for Better Decision Making:

Establishment of the M&E unit: T he M &E unit i s currently staffed with an M&E
director/specialist, an M&E officer, a d atabase manager, a database officer and two data entry
clerks. The Unit collects and aggregates data, generate reports, give feed back to stakehopders
and contribute to the further development of M&E capacity of various stakeholders. The data
collection and analysis is based on process, outcome and impact indicators developed to track and
evaluate the national HIV/AIDS response.

Drafting of the National HIV/STI Program's M&E Plan: An M&E Plan was dr afted in
accordance with the 2002 to 2006 N ational Strategic plan with TA provided by the GAMET
group. This provided the first comprehensive list of indicators for the NHP. A new M&E plan has
been drafted with TA from MEASURE in keeping with the new NSP (2007 to 2012) and is being
reviewed by stakeholders.

Convening of the MERG: This g roup w as r econvened i n 2005 a nd p rovides a f orum f or
stakeholder discussion of project implementation based on indicators.

Development and implementation of software to improve the M&E information system.
Several databases have been developed under the world bank project and are at various stages of
implementation. These include a web-based HIV/AIDS tracking system, a rapid test database and
STI databases. Other da tabases d eveloped or be ing de veloped i nclude a M &E database, TB
database and HIV electronic register, and medical record.

Purchase of hardware to support the implementation of databases: The r equired
infrasttructure to support implementation of the aforementioned databases were lacking. Under
the world bank project computers, servers, wireless area network equipment and USB flash drives
were purchased for field implementaion of the web-based HATS and STI databases. In addition,
printers were purchased for treatment sites to support the electronic HIV register . in addition,
citrix software was purchased to secure the network for web-based transmission of this highly
confidential data.

Improved data collection: Some special surveys conducted during the course of the project
include a National KABP, second generation surveillance of CSW, sentinel surveillance of ANC
and STI clinic attendees. In addition, with support from groups such as GAMET and MEASURE,
new data collection tools were developed for collection of ouput data from stakeholders. This
includes tracking the persons on t reatment, collection of pMTCT output data, and streamlined
reporting by sub-recipients and other stakeholders.

M&E capacity building: Several M&E workshops and training workshops on use of the newly
developed databases have been conducted. These include training on basic computer skills for
prospective users of the databases, including contact investigators. In addition the increased cadre
of M&E staff at the national level resulted in greater availability of technical support for NGOs
and field staff in planning and analysis of studies as well as participation in regional workshops0.
The meetings of the MERG provided a forum for other capacity building activities including
familiarization with the M&E framework.

Generation of reports and publications: Under the world bank, materials required for output
reporting were printed. These included revised laboratory forms, self-addressed envelopes for
confidential HIV case reporting and HIV case report forms. The 2005 UNGASS report was also

                                                 55

published for distribution to s takeholders. S everal r eports w ere g enerated by the M &E uni t
including reports for donor agencies, quarterly bulletins, UNICEF report card, and an annual HIV
report.

Major Challenges: Data capture: implementation of data c ollection t ools continues t o lag
behind programme implementation as implementing stakeholders lack the capacity to conduct
accurate surveillance. M&E is often perceived as a burden rather than an aid for implementers,
which have tremendous workload and few staff. Late and inconsistent submission of reports by
stakeholders hinders timely generation of reports and much wanted feedback. This ultimately
may prove to be a barrier for programmtic decision-making.

Lack of harmonization of indicators: numerous conflicting, and often duplicative, reports and
surveys a re r equired by i nternational organizations that prove to be a di straction f rom other
essential activities of the M&E unit.

Implementation of databases: despite pr ocuring e quipment, de signing of s oftware and
conducting training of users, implementation of databases have been slow. Users often complain
of lack of human resource to conduct data entry but a general resistance to learning a new,
initially more time consuming, system is an important factor.

Establishment of one M&E system: despite m aking s trides in this a rea, so me gaps e xist.
Monitoring and evaluation r eports pr imarily on Ministry o f H ealth a ctivities in t he n ational
response. They ne ed to i nclude a ll H IV/AIDS-related a ctivities c onducted i n t he c ountry,
regardless of how such activities are funded or which agency is conducting the activity.

Programme Administration

Establishment of PCU and Cross Functional teams: The PCU has managed to attract officers
that are highly qualified and competent in specialized areas, with their remuneration package
being supported by the loan resources. T he Unit has also managed to achieve some degree of
integration by building teams such as Prevention, Treatment, Monitoring & Evaluation, Policy
and A dministration that cross cuts varying or ganizations and in e ffect strengthens the multi-
sectoral approach to addressing HIV issues.

Institutionalization of Established Post to be supported by GoJ: Many Officers working in
the field of HIV were supported under the Consultancy category of the loan agreement. The
impact of their work has aided the case for having a sustainable National HIV/STI Programme
financed through the recurrent budget of the GoJ. This Programme is to facilitate the coordination
of all nation-wide HIV related activities. As a step towards making t his a reality a Human
Resource N eeds C onsultant w as c ontracted t o i dentify t he s taffing r equirements for s uch a
Programme. The result of the consultancy formed the basis of negotiation with the MoFPS to
have established key posts to support the continuation of the NHP. A draft cabinet submission
for sustainability was prepared and presented to parliament for approval. A recommendation has
been m ade t o t he M oFPS and a ccepted for 20 pos itions by t he C orporate M anagement
Development Branch and the MoFPS has given a commitment to support these positions effective
April 2008. The institutionalization of the 20 posts are well in trained, nine of the 20 are filled
internally by persons who were previously supported by Projects.

Merging of Projects into Programme: In the beginning there were small pools of funds from
international a gencies such a s USAID and G TZ w hich s upported HIV a ctivities uni laterally.
Initially when the World Bank came on board there was a similar approach, however, the vision

                                                56

of the C hief, E pidemiology and AIDS resulted in the merging of all t he P rojects under one
umbrella. The Programmatic approach has changed the strategic thinking of all key players, it
has resulted in a m ore holistic approach t o ope rationalizing w ork plans, elimination of
duplications, f acilitation of information s haring and de cision making i n general which has
fostered greater levels of efficiency and effectiveness. Additionally this approach facilitated a
holistic and comprehensive view of funding for the National Strategic Plan.

Annual Reviews and Annual Reports: The Annual Review of the National HIV/STI Control
Programme b rings t ogether a ll k ey p layers such as P ublic S ector B odies, I ncluding L ine
Ministries and Regions; Private Sector; NGOs; involved in making incremental and quantum
changes in the HIV/STI/AIDs interventions done. At these reviews there is a structured, but open
forum where experiences and lessons learnt are shared, along with best practices and information
generally including positioning the epidemic ­ prevalence rate, statistic, GIS data that informs
actions and strategies. Following this review, Annual reports documenting results are prepared
and made accessible to the general population.

Relationship with Implementers and other Partners: As a multi-sectoral Programme a lot of
work has been invested in the formation of partnerships for achievement of national indicators
contained in the National Strategic Plan. Some of the key stake holders implementing aspects of
the HIV/STI Programme are 5 Line Ministries, the Regional Health Authorities and some NGOs.

The regions got off to a slow start, but overtime have managed to buy into the Programme and
have undertaken implementation of related activities that created high levels of awareness among
the general population. NGO's too have played a role in strengthening the community response
by rolling out Programmes related to Prevention.

Key successes under the above arrangement included institutionalization of the Programmes in
some of the entities, whereby regions such as SRHA has put arrangements in place to absorb the
position of a Regional HIV Coordinator. The different entities on their own have also forged
many partnership and linkages within their own surroundings to provide financial and technical
support to sustain the Programme. The Programme also has worked with other major partners
including UN Organizations, mainly UNAIDS that has offered full support to the 'One Authority'
principle and UNICEF which partially supports the expansion of the PMTCT Programme.

Training: The loan resources p layed a n essential part in increasing knowledge ba se a nd
competence of persons supporting the work undertaken by the Programme. Both technical and
non t echnical of ficers received f inancial s upport t o a ttend training s essions, s eminars and
conferences. S ome areas i ncluded w ere p rocurement, f inancial m anagement, adherence,
prevention, HIV pathogenesis and treatment.


Financial Management

Automation of Accounting Department: The Financial Management arm of the Administrative
Unit ha s m anaged to implement an accounting system us ing t he A CCPAC S oftware, which
automates the processing of transactions. The use of the system means that the section is less
pronged to manual errors; there is increased efficiency, response time to customers and increases
reliance and confidence place on information generated by the unit. It also increases the quality
of work as more time is placed on analysis rather than number crunching.




                                                57

Audits: The World Bank funded aspect of the Programme has undergone 5 F inancial Audits,
which has demonstrated that no material weaknesses exist and that the figures presented a true
and fair view of the entity's operations.

Challenges/Lessons Learnt

Human Resource Needs: As the successful implementation of the Programme is heavily driven
by personnel, it is absolutely necessary that funding agency accepts a model where financial
resources are geared towards supporting persons and channel resources accordingly if work on
the ground is to be ongoing and sustained. In the beginning this was a challenge that impacted
the roll out of the Programme as it was conceived that the already overburdened health care
workers should implement the activities and funding agency resources be used mainly for the
activities.

Integration with Programmes already in existence: N HP should strategically integrate t he
Programme with the mechanisms already in existence, so as to eliminate the perception that the
Programme is added burden and there is a new set of rules. Thus, areas such as integration of HIV
data needs on forms already in use in the health care sector, piggy backing on standard meetings
already scheduled is a more strategic approach.

SOE Basis for Funding Projects: This mechanism for reporting expenditure to the World Bank
was time consuming based on its detailed nature.


Recommendations

Procurement/Service Contracting: From the onset of the follow-on project, a set of guidelines
that gives the flexibility for timely and efficient implementation must be documented in the loan
agreement. The use of simplified Service Level Agreements should be made mandatory so as to
eliminate the need for the application of all the stringent procurement guidelines. This will create
a platform for more NGO's involvement and expand and strengthened the mutisectoral response
by including other entities that do no have the capacity to undertake the great rigors of high level
procurement.

Partnership: Additionally e fforts m ust be g eared towards bu ilding and strengthening
partnerships to ensure expansion of coverage and impact of t he work. Proposed mechanisms
include increased support for human resources to help build capacity at the CBOs, FBOs and
NGOs, as a means of long term sustainability of intervention and continuation of the process to
solicit effective proposals for implementation.


Decentralization of the Programme: Creative means must be conceptualized to make the PCU
into a truly coordinating entity and exploration of more alternative mechanism for
effectively rolling out the implementation of the Programme in the field. Thus areas such as
hiring more contractors in the field will be considered in the follow-on.

Programme Reviews: A bi-annual Programme review is recommended to look at operations and
strategies. T his w ill a llow fo r i nformation s haring a nd a g reater l evel o f p articipation and
feedback for measuring performance. The output of these review meetings can then form inputs
into a semi-annual and the Annual Reports, which will be informative to its users.



                                                 58

Automation of Accounting System: The system must undergo a review and modification if
necessary to ensure that all beneficiaries are attaining maximum benefits. The possibility of
rolling it out to the regions and other key implementers must be explored based on benefits to be
derived.

Training: As the Programme expands training should be ongoing specifically in areas that the
greatest benefits can be derived, so value can be added to the Programme. A schedule should be
developed/aligned to the goals of the National Plan so as to ensure that expertise exists to deliver
the required


Procurement

The functions of the Procurement Unit have been fully integrated into the standard operations of
the MoHE, whereby interactions with the various committees (Procurement, Sector and National
Contracts Committee) are normalized. In fact the Programme has managed to get the Permanent
Secretary to intervene when there was a backlog with items to be processed by the Procurement
Committee, resulting i n more frequent m eetings to ex pedite i mplementation of ac tivities.
Additionally, partnerships were forged with HCL and UNFPA through National Family Planning
Board for the procurement and warehousing of drugs and condoms respectively. This mechanism
has decentralized some of the administrative burden away from NHP. Based on the nature of the
Programme a nd t he aspects be ing i mplemented, much was r ealized in g etting t he B anks
concurrence in adjusting procurement thresholds necessary to accelerate implementation pace.
These were formally documented in the amended version of the loan agreement. Additionally,
because o f the high p riority p laced o n p rocurement t he c apacity o f this Unit was increased
through financial support from the Global Fund Project, an expansion which see the lending of
support to all the major implementers, including NGOs, across the Programme.

Procurement Responsibility and Capacity Strengthening: The Procurement Unit was initially
headed by One Procurement Officer and One Procurement Assistant who were responsible for all
procurement activities, including procurement planning, procurement processes, contract' award
and c ontract information system, qua rterly upda te of t he pr ocurement plan. T he PCU a lso
provided oversight of the procurement processes for the five Line ministries and four Regional
Health Authorities. The Health Corporation Ltd, the government procurement agent assisted the
PCU in the procurement of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies. Condoms were also procured
through the National Family Planning Board.

Strengthening of the procurement capacity of the PCU and the Implementing Agencies have been
ongoing throughout the project. The Procurement Unit as conducted quarterly reviews of the
procurement activities of the implementing agencies and used it as an opportunity to provide
technical assistance and guidance on how to conduct the procurement processes in accordance
with the World Bank guidelines for procurement. Additionally training exercises were conducted
for individuals i nvolved in pr oject pr ocurement. High S taff turnover a t the Regional H ealth
Authorities sometimes impacted the pace of procurement, and new staff had to be continuously
sensitized at individual levels in the procurement process.

With the increase in activities and additional donor funded Project to the National Programme,
The Procurement Unit was expanded with an additional Procurement Assistant through financial
support from the Global Fund Project. This expansion enabled the lending of support to all the
major implementers, including NGOs, across the Programme.

Evaluation of the Categories of Expenditure-Amendment to Loan Agreement: An evaluation
of the procurement thresholds for condoms, civil works, and consultants based upon the progress
of the project led to the proposal for the amendment of the loan agreement. The first amendment
of t he loan agreement sought t o r e-allocate t he percentage of loan allocation under the
expenditure categories. The first loan agreement also established new thresholds for prior review
of consultants which were increased from US$ 25, 000 to US$ 50, 000.00 for individuals and
US$ 50, 000.00 to US$100, 000 for consulting firms. The loan agreement also established that
ARVs for post exposure prophylaxis, test kits, reagents, placement of mass media campaign were
to be procured through direct contracting procedures. The thresholds for civil works were also
increased under the first loan agreement amendment.

Procurement Environment and Implementation Issues: In the initial stages of the Project and
with the planning of activities, key government bodies and their impact on project timelines were
not considered. And this impacted on the timeliness of project implementation.
Procurement functional responsibilities and approval of procurement processes are shared by the
following entities according to Government of Jamaica (GOJ) procurement guidelines
    a) National Contracts Commission (NCC): review p rocuring en tities co ntract a ward
        recommendations for procurement of Goods, Services and Works with estimated values
        equal or above J$4Million.
    b) National Contracts Commission Sector Commission (NCCSC): reviews pr ocuring
        entities contract's award recommendation above J$4m
    c) Procurement Committees: review procuring entities contract award recommendations
        for procurement of Goods, Services and Works with estimated values equal or above
        J$250,000 and less than one Million
    d) Cabinet - review procuring entities contract award recommendations for procurement of
        Goods, Services and Works with estimated values equal or above J$15m
    e) Ministry of finance and planning is the focal point for information and clarification of
        public sector procurement.

The discrepancies be tween t he n ational pr ocurement s ystem t hresholds a nd t he W orld B ank
thresholds a lso impacted ne gatively the pr ocurement pr ocesses a nd t imeframe unde r the
HIV/AIDS Project. The procurement procedures that were required in accordance with the Loan
Agreement and the Procurement Guidelines of the World Bank were primary reasons for the slow
rate of expenditure and were often seen as onerous and time consuming by all implementing
agencies

World Bank Procurement Thresholds: National and international shopping procedures were
allowed under the Loan Agreement for readily available goods and services estimated to cost
below US$25,000. The procedures are utilized by the PCU, RHAs, Ministries and parishes. In
many instances, only one or two submissions were received in response to invitations to quote
despite five or more suppliers being invited. This occurs mainly in the parishes where suppliers
are limited or some suppliers ignore requests because they have not been awarded contracts after
repeated efforts. There were also instances when readily available items or services are estimated
to cost more than US$25,000 and other procurement methods with much longer timelines have to
be us ed. These ot her m ethods us ually i nvolve t he pr eparation a nd di stribution of l arge bi d
documents that outline significant demands regarding the composition of bids to be prepared and
submitted by s uppliers. The m ere s ize o f b id do cuments as w ell as the requirements f or
submissions often serve to discourage well-known, reputable suppliers from responding since
they do not have the capacity to devote the resources required to prepare a responsive bid. These
suppliers can easily respond to the requirements of shopping procedures but find the demands of
other methods prohibitive. The process of `no objection' which must be obtained prior to contract


                                                60

award also a dded w eeks of delay. I n r esponse to t he issues a bove t he pr oject made
recommendations for the improvement of the process. These recommendations were:

World Bank
    a) Introduce a ceiling of US$1,000 below which goods and services may be purchased
        through direct contracting without the prior review of the World Bank.
    b) Introduce a c eiling of U S$10,000 be low which s hort-term c onsultants m ay be sole
        sourced without the Bank's prior review.
    c) Formalize the acceptance of the receipt of less than three quotes in response to invitations
        when more than three quotes are requested and when suppliers in remote geographic
        areas are limited.

Government of Jamaica
    d) Introduce a ceiling of US$1,000 below which goods and services may be purchased
        through direct contracting without prior approval.
    e) Introduce a c eiling of U S$10,000 be low which s hort-term c onsultants m ay be sole
        sourced without prior approval.
    f) Streamline a pproval pr ocess t o l imit r equirement f or s ubmissions t o one C ommittee
        within the Ministry.

The recommendations were approved by the Ministry of Finance and the World Bank which saw
the improvement overtime with the process. The streamlining of the approval process within the
Ministry where submissions were limited to one Committee reaped significant improvements in
the turnaround time for procurement. The functions of the Procurement Unit have been fully
integrated into t he s tandard ope rations o f t he MOHE, w hereby i nteractions with the various
committees (P rocurement, Sector and N ational C ontracts C ommittee) are normalized. The
Programme has also managed to get the Permanent Secretary to intervene when there was a
backlog with items to be processed by the Procurement Committee, resulting in more frequent
meetings to expedite implementation of activities.

Completion of Major Activities: The Procurement Unit was successful in completing the tender
processes for the two major items of the project namely the Laboratory Information System and
the Waste Management Project. Generally, whilst there were delays in contract execution at
times, and with limited staff to monitor contracts as closely as possible, the project has been able
to successfully complete its activities.


Lessons Learnt and Recommendations
The lesson learned is that procurement processes that allow for transparency and accountability
but lack efficiency can critically affect project performance and outcome. Planning that does not
consider the procurement environment and make allowances for external conditions can also
impact project outcomes. The following recommendations are provided for future projects.

    1. It is recommended that for future projects in respect to prior review, only the first two
        bidding documents and contracts for goods, services and works be reviewed by the Bank;
        subsequent to which prior review is not required for each tender document and contracts
        of similar nature. This would aid in reducing the time for obtaining Bank's no objection.
    2. An increase of the threshold for national shopping to US $50, 000.00.
    3. An increase in the threshold for national competitive bidding for goods
    4. That c onsultants no t exceeding U S$ 5,000.00 ( or agreed t hreshold) c an b e di rectly
        contracted without the B ank's pr ior r eview. (especially a s it r elates to Consultants
