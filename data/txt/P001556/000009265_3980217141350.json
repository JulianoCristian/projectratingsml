Perhaps the most important\n            finding of the report is that environmental protection and\n            management requires much more than tie establishment of\n            mandate-specific institutions and the execution of a\n            physical action program. In contrast, agencies were\n            established without clearly defined common goals and\n            objectives. As reflected in the lack of both vertical and\n            horizontal coordination between agencies/institutions\n            concerned, the holistic (program) approach was never\n            achieved. The major lessons to be drawn from project\n            implementation experience are that: (a) program objectives\n            and implementation responsibilities should be realistic and\n            as specific as possible reflecting the local environment in\n            which it will be implemented; (b) allocating financing on a\n            component-by-component basis to different executing agencies\n            can undermine program synergy and objective achievement; (c)\n            community participation in management and maintenance of the\n            rural environment can be facilitated through demonstrated\n            financial attractiveness (e.g. ANAE's mini-projects);\n            (d) changing human behavior and developing community-based\n            approaches to managing protected areas will likely require a\n            long-term commitment. These lessons are being incorporated\n            into the design and implementation of the Second Phase Program"}, "docdt": "1998-01-15T00:00:00Z"}
