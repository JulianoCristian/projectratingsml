The\n            project would provide technical assistance, equipment,\n            furniture and minor refurbishment for eight Technician\n            Training Centers to assist YOK in establishing a pilot\n            program of post-secondary pre-service industrial technician\n            training. Technical assistance and equipment would be\n            included to strengthen and expand SEGEM's in-service\n            and on-the-job industrial training programs at the\n            professional, technician and supervisory levels, as well as\n            assist in developing the framework for a national industrial\n            training system.  Overseas fellowship training would also be\n            provided to SIS staff in order to improve the quality and\n            presentation of economic and social data."}, "docdt": "1984-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
