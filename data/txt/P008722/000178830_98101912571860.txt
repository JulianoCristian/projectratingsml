I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     The Government of Romania has request:ed a Bank loan of US$101.5
million equivalent for a project covering the 1982-86 portion of a progrqm
involving the field-wide application of an enhanced oil recovery (EOR)1_
method, namely in-situ combustion, to the Videle and Balaria oil fields
situated about 45 kilometers (km) west-southwest of Bucharest (TBRD Map No.
16066). The Project will be implemented by the Trustul Petrolului Bolintin
(TPB), the operator of these oil fields. In-situ combustion is expected to
increase the ultimate oil recovery from about 15% under existing recovery
techniques to about 39% of the oil initially in place in the reservoirs. This
corresponds to additional recoverable reserves of about 29.9 million tons
(about 200 million barrels) of oil to be extracted during the next 40 to 50
years. The incremental production of oil from the Project is expected to
climb to a plateau rate of about 0.7 million eons per year (tpy) by 1986, by
wlhich time production under existing methods would have declined to an
estimated 0.2 million tpy from about 0.5 million tpy in 1980. Romania
consumed about 19.2 million tons of oil in 1930, but produced only 11.9
million tons. The deficit of about 7.3 milliDn tons was imported at a cost of
almost US$2 billion, a serious drain on its foreign exchange resources.
1.02     Total financing required for the Project is estimated at LEI 6.81
billion (US$454 million), including about LEI 2.45 billion (US$ 163 million)
in foreign exchange. The proposed Bank loan would therefore provide 22% of
the total and 62% of the foreign exchange financing required. The Government
and TPB will provide the remaining funds. While co-financing is not
explicitly included in the financing plan for the Project, the Government
intends to seek co-financing for this project when the foreign financial
market environment improves.
1.03     The Bank's involvement in the Romanian petroleum sector was first
evaluated by a Bank mission to Romania in November 1980. Following an
identification mission and a preappraisal mission in March and in June 1981,
respectively, the Project was appraised in September/October 1981 by a mission
consisting of Messrs. Gultekin Yuksel (Chief), Denis T. Carpio and Ms. Janet
Koch of the Energy Department.
II. ENERGY SECTOR
A. Overview
2.01     Romania's energy situation deteriorated considerably in the last
decade as the country's need for energy outgrew its domestic supply
capacity. The country's increasing demand for energy was compounded by a
sharp decline in domestic oil production since the mid-seventies and
substantial shortfalls in targetted production of solid fuels particularly
lignite. Given the lack of significant new ciil reserve discoveries in recent
1/ Annex 1.1 provides a general description of EOR techniques.



years aLnd with the bulk of Romanian production coming from old fields where
production has peaked, the prospects of reversing the downward trend of
domestic oil supply are not optimistic. Romania is one of the oldest oil-
producing countries in the world and one of the largest producers of natural
gas in Europe. Nevertheless, it became a net energy importer in 1973 and a
net oil importer in 1976, and will continue thus for the remainder of the
1980's. Under presently practiced primary and secondary oil recovery methods,
production from Romania's existing oil fields could be expected to decline by
a further 35% over the period 1980-85. However, the large investments in new
enhanced oil recovery methods in these fields, planned as part of the
country's Five-Year Plan (1981-85), could potentially slow this otherwise
rapid decline.
2.02     The Government's investment program over the next five years aims at
stabilizing oil production (including natural gas liquids) at about 12.9
million tpy and natural gas production at 35 to 36 billion cubic meters per
year (28 to 29 million tons of oil equivalent (Toe)). Total energy self-
sufficiency is planned to be regained by 1990, a rather unrealistic target.
Even partial attainment of these objectives critically depends upon Romania's
success in rapidly increasing its recoverable petroleum reserves through
exploration and enhanced oil recovery efforts as well as increasing energy
production from non-petroleum resources (lignite, hydropower, nuclear energy),
changing the structure of energy use, and implementing effective energy
conservation measures.
B. Energy Consumption and Supply
2.03     The consumption of primary energy in Romania increased nearly four-
fold since 1960 from about 18 to some 66 million Toe in 1980, and is planned
to grow by an additional 15 million Toe by 1985. The rapid growth in
consumption has been closely linked with the requirements of the national
industrialization and development effort. Since 1975 domestic production of
primary energy has stagnated at 51 to 54 million Toe. The current Five-Year
(1981-85) Plan shows an optimistic increase in energy production of 25% by
1985 primarily through increases in production of lignite for thermal power
generat:ion. Net imports currently supply some 20% of Romania's domestic
energy needs, and the Five-Year Plan aims at maintaining this proportion or
less through 1985. The consumption and supply of primary energy in Romania
are given in detail in Annex 2.1 and 2.2, and are summarized below:

2.04     Growth in energy consumption in Romania has slowed in recent years to
an average annual rate of about 4.5% during 1976-80, compared with a growth
rate of about 6% during 1971-75 and over 8% during the sixties. The growth in
gross industrial production has also showed some decline to an average annual
rate of about 9.5% for 1976-80, from one of about 13% for 1971-75. In
Romania, the average energy consumption-GNP growth coefficient during 1971-80
was about 0.6; the current Five-Year Plan essentially reflects the same
coefficient. The recent decline in the growt'i of energy consumption is
attributable in part to Government initiative,, physical and financial, toward
energy conservation.
2.05     Per capita consumption of primary enargy in Romania today, at about
3.0 Toe, is still below that in both Eastern and Western Europe (3.9 and 3.1
Toe per capita, respectively, in 1978 -L). Given its relatively low per
capita GNP (US$2,340 per capita in 1980), howaver, the intensity of energy use
in Romania at 1.3 Toe per thousand US$ of GNP in 1980 is higher than that in
Eastern and Western Europe (1.1 and 0.5 Toe p2r thousand US$ of GNP,
respectively, in 1978 11). The energy-intensive nature of the Romanian and
Eastern European economies stems in part from the relatively greater
importance of the industrial sectors in these countries, arising from the
priority given since World War II to the development of industry in general
and heavy industry in particular with a concomitant slower development of the
services sector. Industry typically accounts for 30-40 percent of GNP in
Western Europe, whereas the corresponding figure in Eastern Europe is closer
to 60 percent (62 percent of national income for Romania in 1980).
2.06     Industry, particularly the chemical and metallurgical sectors,
accounts for some 55% to 60% of primary energy use in Romania and thermal
power production for 25%. Transport accounts for less than 5% due in part to
the dominance of the nation's railway system, while the commercial, services,
agricultural, and residential sectors use the remaining 10% to 15%. The
apparent structure of energy consumption in Romania is somewhat distorted by
the method of reporting energy use on a delivery rather than final use basis;
energy used in transportation, for example, is actually spread over all
sectors, and only the energy directly used by the public and commercially-
hired transportation units are reported as consumed by the transport sector.
C. Energy Resources
2.07     The pattern of primary energy supply and usage in Romania reflects
the country's relatively large endowment of petroleum in the past, which was
used as the base for Romania's strategy for  ndustrialization in the early
sixties. Petroleum still constitutes nearly three-fourths of the primary
energy used in Romania today (discussed in Chapter III), solid fuels somewhat
over 20%, and hydropower less than 5%. Given its declining oil production,
however, Romania has already begun to adjust its energy supply toward solid
fuels (e.g., lignite), hydropower, nuclear power, and non-conventional
sources. The historical structure of the domestic usage of primary energy

1. Coal and Related Fuels
2.09      Domestic production of bituminous ccal and anthracite was 8.1
million tons (3.6 million Toe) in 1980, and ar estimated 10.2 million tons in
1981. The Plan target for 1985 is 12.8 million tons. Exploitable quantities
of such coal are limited to the southeastern part of the country, principally
in the area of Petrosani. Its calorific value is relatively low, only one-
half to three-quarters of that of good quality coal (7,000 kilocalories per
kilogram), and ash content is high. At preserit the coal supplies two thermal
power stations (Paroseni and Mintia) and some local coke production. Given
the limited local resources and high demand, particularly of the metallurgical
industries, imports of coke and coking coal begun in the mid-fifties, have
grown to 7.1 million tons (4.6 million Toe) in 1980, and are expected to reach
9.7 million tons by 1985.
2.10      Production of lignite and brown coal in 1980 was 27.1 million tons
(4.6 million Toe), and in 1981 an estimated 33.6 million tons. The Plan
envisages a major increase in lignite and brown coal production to 72.8
million tons by 1985 which will be very diffiault, and probably impossible, to
achieve. Delays in opening new mines and particularly in constructing and
operating the needed mining machinery and equipment already led to serious
setbacks to the planned doubling of production between 1975 and 1980.
Although lignite deposits are distributed throughout the country, many are of
little economic value as the reserves are contained in a large number of thin
seams and in some areas the geology is very complex. An estimated 90 percent
of the reserves are located in Oltenia in southwest Romania, where the main
deposits are Montru which is mined underground and Rovinari which is mined by
open-cast methods. With a calorific value of just 20% to 40% of that of good
quality coal and a high ash content, transport over any great distance from
the mine is uneconomic and exploitation of dEposits is largely for use in
nearby power plants to produce electricity and heat through co-generating
plants.
2.11      Bituminous and carboniferous shales occur in association with some
c:oal deposits in the Anina-Oravitsa region. There is no significant
production at present. Although the geology of these deposits is reported to
be complex and the calorific value of the shales very low and ash content
high, mining of the deposits for use in thermal power generating plants is
planned for the eighties. A power plant at Anina is now under construction as
the pilot plant, and shale production is expected to reach 10.0 million tons
(1.0 million Toe) by 1985.
2. Hydropower
2.12      Romania's hydropower resources, estimated to be 37 billion kWh, are
about one-third developed, with another 45% to 50% regarded as economically
feasible for development at the present time and the rest technically
feasible. Installed capacity in 1980 was sone 3,414 MW and production about
12.6 billion kWh (2.8 million Toe). Production from Romania's share of five
plants on the Danube, being developed jointly with Yugoslavia and Bulgaria,
should nearly match present production levels. The Five-Year Plan calls for
17.6 billion kWh by 1985, and the Government expects the full hydropower
potential to be tapped by the end of the nineties.

3. Wood and Other Non-Commercial Fuels
2.13      Wood is still widely used in Romania as a domestic fuel for cooking
and space heating. Its availability as fuel is clearly limited, with annual
production appearing to have stabilized at somewhat under 3.0 million tons
(2.8 million tons or 0.7 million Toe in 1980). Other materials such as peat,
maize stalks, and corn cobs are also used for domestic purposes in rural
areas, with their use estimated to be somewhat less (2.5 million tons or 0.6
million Toe in 1980). The Plan targets their joint production to be about 4.4
million tons in 1985.
4. Other Energy Resources
2.14      No information is available regarding the reserves of uranium or
other radioactive minerals in Romania. However, a branch of the mining
industry was created for uranium in 1955, and Romanian authorities have
reported that the 660 MW nuclear power plant, planned for commissioning in the
mid-eighties (perhaps 1987), will be supplied from domestic uranium
reserves. This is to be the first of four units to be developed with the
assistance of Canada.
2.15      There is geothermal potential, probably of low temperature, that
could possibly be developed for space heating; some limited use of thermal
waters is already underway in northwest Romania. Other potential non-
conventional energy sources, including solar, wind and wave energy as well as
biological conversion of organic wastes, are the subject of on-going research
in Romania.
D. Energy Strategy and Government Policy
2.16      As early as 1973, in the aftermath of the first oil crisis, Romania
responded by issuing an emergency decree which fostered domestic energy
production and imposed cuts and stringent restrictions on energy and fuel
consumption in each sector of the economy. These steps were followed by
further energy conservation and diversification measures in 1977 and again in
1979 and 1980. In the face of a rapidly declining energy situation, the
Government adopted in November 1979 an energy research and development
strategy for the period 1981-2000 based on the premise that in the next decade
Romania should achieve self-sufficiency in energy. The plan calls for (i)
increasing the production and use of domestic non-petroleum energy resources,
particularly lignite and bituminous shale, hydropower, nuclear power, and non-
conventional energy sources; (ii) emphasizing energy conservation, with
particular attention to reducing industry's unit energy consumption; and (iii)
stabilizing oil and gas production at levels which ensure minimum use of
petroleum as fuel, while intensifying geological exploration and enhanced oil
recovery to arrest the decline in recoverable reserves.
2.17      The overall energy strategy of the Romanian Government appears for
the most part to be well-founded and sensible, albeit overly ambitious as
detailed in the 1981-85 Plan. Moreover, our somewhat limited knowledge
regarding reserves and sectoral consumption necessarily leaves some question
concerning their long-term policy of conserving petroleum, in particular
natural gas, at the expense of developing less efficient and more costly
energy sources and in the interim using gas as the balancing fuel. It is



- 7 -
expected that the Bank would continue to address this question during the
energy sector survey planned for 1982 (para. 2.31) as well as in the course of
preparing future projects in the sector.
1. The 1981-85 Plan
2.18      The expansion of the Romanian economy slowed perceptibly during the
last Plan period (1976-80); national income grew by only 2.8% (due in part to
a particularly poor agricultural outturn) and gross industrial production by
6.5% in 1980, compared with average annual rates of 7.2% and 9.5%,
respectively, during 1976-80. The 1981-85 Plan calls for an average annual
growth rate of 7.1% for national income and 7,6% for gross industrial
production, compared with targets of over 10% in the preceding Five-Year
Plan. Demand for primary energy, in turn, is targetted to grow at an average
annual rate of about 4.3% over the five years of the Plan, only slightly lower
than that observed during 1976-80. However, the risk of shortfalls in
industrial development and overall economic geowth targets, combined with the
conservation plans of the Government (para. 2.24), would suggest that an
increase in yearly primary energy demand by 1985 on the order of 10-13 million
Toe, instead of the Plan target of about 15.4 million Toe, would be more
realistic.
2.19      Yearly domestic production of primary energy under the Five-Year
Plan is targetted to increase by about 13.0 million Toe to 65.6 million Toe by
1985. This would be a substantial increase in production, particularly in
light of recent performance when the overall level of domestic production
remained virtually unchanged during the previous Plan period, although it was
targetted to increase by 7.2 million Toe. The Plan calls for increasing the
annual production of coal, lignite, and related fuels by 1985 by about 170%
above 1980 levels, with the bulk of the increase coming from lignite
production. Such an increase can only come from a rapid growth in open-cast
mining, geared to a very tight delivery schedule for new equipment, and close
integration with the construction of new lignite-burning power stations. The
1980 target of the previous Plan for lignite production was less than 60%
accomplished. Assuming a slightly higher success ratio in the current Plan in
view of experience gained in alleviating initial difficulties but taking into
account the large quantities involved, an increase of 60% in the annual
production of lignite between 1980 and 1985 (compared with just over 35%
between 1975 and 1980) would be more likely; this would imply a shortfall in
overall coal and lignite production of about 5.9 million Toe in 1985 compared
to the Plan target.
2.20      Increasing hydropower production is another priority area in the
Government's energy strategy; the targetted L.0% increase in annual
hydrogeneration between 1980 and 1985 should be achievable given Romania's
favorable experience in the past in hydropower development.  Production of
wood and other non-commercial fuels is expected to decline somewhat by 1985,
while significant contributions from nuclear power and non-conventional energy
resources are not expected until the late eighties. The outlook for petroleum
production during the 1981-85 Plan and longer term is discussed in some detail
in Chapter III; Bank staff estimate a 0.7 million Toe shortfall in oil

natural gas production target. The details of production and trade achieved in
1975 and 1980, compared with that planned for 1980, 1981, and 1985 are as

a/ Plan figures estimated by Romanian Authorities in the mid-seventies,
converted to Toe using conversion factors in Annex 2.2.
2.21       In summary, a more likely estimate of overall primary energy
consumption in Romania in 1985 is about 75 to 78 million Toe, compared to the
Plan figure of 81.1 million Toe. At the same time, primary energy production
in 1985 would probably be on the order of 59 million Toe, or some 6.6 million
Toe less than the Plan target. Net energy imports of around 16 to 19 million
Toe would thus be required in 1985, compared to 13.1 million Toe in 1980 and
the 1985 Plan target of 15.5 million Toe; energy imports would continue to be
a heavy drain on the country's foreign exchange resources. Alternatively,



shortfalls in domestic supply might be filled by increased production of
natural gas, resulting in faster depletion cf available reserves, or domestic
consumption of energy might be curtailed, pctentially slowing economic growth.
Both means were employed during the 1976-80 Plan period in an effort to
minimize energy imports.
2.22      The volume of investment planned curing 1981-85 for development of
energy production capability (US$ 10.4 billion) in Romania is about 40%
greater than that achieved during the 1976-80 Plan, while overall investments
(US$80.0 billion) are about 30% greater. The schedule of investments by
sector is as follows:

2. Energy Conservation Program
2.23     Public consciousness of the curren: energy deficit in Romania is
high; statements of Government policy, speeches of political leaders, daily
press releases, and public posters keep repeating the energy conservation
theme. Energy use in the public sector, by far the major user in Romania, is
controlled through physical allocations on *:he basis of established norms,
enforced by financial penalties levied on enterprises exceeding their
quotas. Starting around the end of 1977, a large scale campaign for saving
energy was launched, resulting in a number of conservation measures including:
adoption of a large program to channel waste heat to provide process heat, hot
water, and space heating; reductions in the norms governing the use of primary
energy in production, accompanied by large [ncreases in excess-use penalties
(financial and prohibition of delivery); cutting in half the number of taxis
and official vehicles, and reducing gasoline rations; dimming of lights in all
public places; and for consumption by individuals, restrictions on weekend
driving, raising fuel prices, and establishing maximum norms and progressive
rate structures for household use of electricity, heat, and gas.



- 10 -
2.24     The Government reports that it has exceeded its overall targets of a
20% reduction in average specific consumption of fuels and 12% in the case of
electric energy over the 1976-80 Plan period. Romania's energy program to the
year 2000 calls for a further 40% reduction in industry's unit energy
consumption; conservation tasks have also been outlined for the transport,
agriculture, construction, commercial, services, and household sectors.
Industrial restructuring and sectoral energy efficiency programs both for
energy production (electric and thermal power) and consumption in industry
(metallurgy and chemicals) are central aspects of the guidelines. While there
is significant scope for energy conservation in Romanian inyustry,
particularly in the metallurgical and chemical subsectors,- substantial
investments including foreign exchange would be required for the new and more
efficient facilities/technologies to replace the obsolete ones. In addition,
any substantial progress in reducing the overall energy intensity of industry
would also require an alteration of the industrial structure toward a higher
proport:Lon of less energy intensive products; this would additionally need
substantial investments for new projects which would have to be planned and
designed in the context of market prospects and other economic
considerations. Given the budget constraints, competing investments (e.g.,
energy resource development, food production, housing and social services) may
have priority over some of the energy conservation or product-mix diversifica-
tion projects when economic and social factors are considered. On the basis
of the limited information now available, it would appear that these
considerations would preclude the full attainment of this ambitious objective
in the time frame envisaged.
3. Energy Pricing Policy
2.25     Physical planning and centralized control of material balances form
the basis for the development of the Romanian economy. In a system which
relies heavily on physical inputs, outputs, and allocations and which judges
success largely on the basis of physical targets, price plays a secondary role
in resouLrce allocation and is considered an adjunct necessary to facilitate
the financial flows corresponding to the physical targets to be achieved. Set
by the Government and generally left unchanged for one or more Plan periods,
energy prices in the past have had relatively little impact either in
controlling domestic consumption or in stimulating its production. Faced by
reduced supplies and higher costs of energy produced at home, compounded by
higher world prices, the Romanian Government has been forced to adapt its
energy pricing policy toward one which more closely reflects the full costs of
1/  On the basis of the Bank's review of the metallurgical and chemical
subsectors and a small sample of energy conservation projects being prepared
by the Romanians in these sectors, the potential energy savings is on the
order of 20% to 40% in the steel industry and 10% to 30% in the refining and
chemical industry.  Furthermore, on the basis of early 1970 Western European
energy consumption levels and savings potential, the following reductions in
energy intensity may be possible in the following subsectors: textiles 15% to
20%, pulp and paper 10% to 15%, glass 10% to 30%, and food processing 15% to
25%.



- ii -
energy imports and domestic production. Moreover, as a part of its energy
conservation program discussed above (para. 2.23), it has begun to use prices
more as a means of controlling energy use.  The evolving role of energy prices
in the Romanian economy is assessed more fulLy in the context of petroleum
(oil and gas) prices in Chapter III (paras. 3.19-3.24).
E. Institutional Framework
2.26     The State Planning Committee coordinates energy planning and
expansion in Romania, which until 1981 was substantially carried out by five
ministries, each concerned with specific subsectors. These included the
Ministries of: Mining, Petroleum, and Geology; Electrical Energy; Chemical
[ndustry; Metallurgical Industry; and Forestry Economy and Construction
Materials. The Ministry of Mining, Petroleu-n, and Geology was divided into
'three ministries in late 1981. Exploration and production of oil and gas is
the responsibility of the Ministry of Petroleum (MP), while production and
development of coal and related fuels is the responsibility of the Ministry of
Mining. All exploratory work for minerals aad fuels, with the exception of
onshore oil and gas,is carried out by the Ministry of Geology, which transfers
responsibility for development of proven economically exploitable deposits to
the concerned centrals/departments within the Ministry of Mining (or
Petroleum). The Ministry of Petroleum is additionally responsible for the
operation of specialized facilities such as natural gas processing plants and
oil and gas pipelines. Crude oil, natural gas liquids, and a portion of the
natural gas output are handed over to the Ministry of Chemical Industry for
processing into refined petroleum products and petrochemicals in its eleven
refineries (one under construction) and six petrochemical complexes (three
under construction) for sale in domestic and foreign markets. Similarly,
coal, lignite, natural gas, fuel oil, and waste heat in the form of industrial
gases are sold to the Ministry of Electrical Energy for use in its thermal
generating plants, and coking coal to the Ministry of Metallurgical
Industry. In the case of natural gas, MP is responsible for delivering it to
the consumer and, in doing this, exercises a control function by ensuring that
individual consumption quotas are not exceeded. The organization and
activities of the Ministry of Petroleum are discussed further in Chapter III.
2.27     In addition there are at least three other ministries of importance
to the operation of the energy sector: the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
International Economic Cooperation concernec. with trade in energy products and
international cooperation ventures; the Ministry of Machine-Building Industry
concerned with manufacture of equipment for energy exploration and production;
and the Ministry of Technical-Material Supply and Control of Fixed Assets
Administration concerned with setting and monitoring energy consumption
norms. To effect greater coordination among these various facets of the
energy field, the Permanent Commission for the Coordination, Guidance, and
Control of Fuel, Electric, and Thermal Power Consumption was established in
November 1973. The Commission has been instrumental in formulating the basic
energy strategy and policy discussed above and in expediting the development
of action programs for its implementation.

III. PETROLEUM SUB-SECTOR
A. Trends in Petroleum Supply and Demand
3.01     Romania has a history of over 120 years of petroleum exploration and
production; its petroleum industry is the major source of energy with domestic
oil and gas production presently supplying about 18% and 43%, respectively, of
total consumption of primary energy. Annual production of petroleum peaked in
1976 at about 15.1 million tons of oil and 36.3 billion cubic meters of gas.
Oil production has since declined to 11.9 million tons in 1980. Since 1975
additions to reserves have not kept pace with the depletion rate, the peak
having been reached in the mid-sixties when the yearly new reserve discovery
rate was more than twice the most recently reported (1977) figure of 10.9
million tons for oil and 27.7 billion cubic meters for gas. Moreover, the
bulk of Romanian oil production is from old fields developed in the sixties
and now under going extensive secondary recovery operations, such as water and
gas injection, which have also passed their peaks; about 3.3 million tpy of
oil production is attributed to enhanced oil recovery (EOR) processes being
applied in some 185 reservoirs. Natural gas production during the last five
years, by contrast, has remained nearly constant at 34 to 36 billion cubic
meters per year, not including gas reinjected into the reservoirs for
secondary recovery or pressure maintenance. The pattern of petroleum supply
and consumption over the past twenty years in Romania is as follows:

3.02     Domestic consumption of oil in Romania presently accounts for about
29% of energy use. The growth rate of oil censumption during the seventies,
although somewhat sporadic, averaged nearly 8% per year for 1971-78, and has
generally exceeded that of overall energy corsumption. Largely as a result of
stringent restrictions on both public and private use, oil consumption was cut
back sharply in 1974 (by 1 million tons), although it began growing again in
1975 and grew rapidly through 1978, since which time it has been held steady
at 19 to 20 million tons per year.
3.03     To avoid early depletion of its resErves, Romania ended crude oil
exports in 1959. The rapidly growing demand and declining production led to
Romania's becoming a net oil importer in 1976. In 1980 net oil imports
reached 7.3 million tons or about 38% of domestic oil consumption. Meanwhile,
exports of refined products, a profitable business for Romania dating back to
before World War II, continued to grow gradually reaching nearly 9 million
tons in 1980. With the worldwide excess ref.ning capacity and depressed
market for petroleum products, however, competition is intense and exports
have become substantially less profitable. Given a refining capacity (some 30
to 32 million tpy) substantially above its domestic requirements and in a
technical configuration whereby about half o- the refineries are integrated
with petrochemical complexes, a complete match of production with domestic
demand is precluded, necessitating continuation of some product exports.
3.04     Natural gas, the largest single ene:-gy source in the Romanian economy
since the mid-sixties, presently accounts for about 45% of domestic energy
use.  Following a period of rapid growth, domestic consumption has fluctuated
around 35 to 36 billion cubic meters (28 to 29 million Toe) since 1975;
Romania is presently one of the largest users3 of natural gas in Europe.
Although existing fields have a higher produztive potential, current
Government policy is to limit consumption, a-ad hence production, of non-
associated gas to conserve reserves for higher value-added uses such as
feedstock for petrochemicals. However, production has been allowed to expand
as much as 10% over target during 1976-80 to offset coal and oil production
shortfalls. In addition, imports of natural gas from USSR began in 1979,
although the volumes are rather small.
B. Petroleum Resources
3.05     Until the end of World War II, oil and gas were produced only from
the Eastern and Western Carpathian Depressions in Romania and international
oil companies were actively involved in the petroleum sector. Following
nationalization of the industry in 1948, an extensive exploration campaign was
undertaken, and the oil fields of the Moesian Platform and Pannonian Basin
were discovered and developed along with the non-associated gas reservoirs of
the Transylvanian Basin. Some 17,000 exploration and appraisal wells and
roughly twice as many development wells were drilled, resulting in the
discovery of some 200 oil and gas fields. Froduction today is mainly from the
oil fields of the Moesian Platform and gas fields of the Transylvanian
Basin. Recently, oil and gas discoveries of so far undertermined potential
were made in the Romanian Black Sea shelf.
3.06     As of late 1980, cumulative production of oil and gas from Romanian
fields amounted to about 522 million tons ard 468 billion cubic meters,
respectively. Official estimates of remaining reserves are not publicly



- 14 -
available information. However, on the basis of production decline curve
extrapolation, Bank staff estimate that about 125 million tons of oil and 350-
400 billion cubic meters of gas can be considered as recoverable under the
current exploitation methods. Such reserves correspond to a supply of about 6
years for oil and 10 to 11 years for gas in terms of present consumption
levels.
1. Geology and Exploration History
3.07     Onshore.  The Romanian territory meeting geological criteria
favorable for the generation and accumulation of petroleum covers an area of
about 125,000 square kilometers onshore and 16,000 square kilometers offshore
on the Black Sea continental shelf. The prospective areas are divided into
four principal geologic provinces: (i) Carpathian Orogene (Eastern Carpathian
and Western Carpathian or Getic Depressions), (ii) Intercarpathian Depressions
(Transylvanian and Pannonian Basins), (iii) Carpathian Foreland (Moesian
Platform), and (iv) Black Sea continental shelf. Three-quarters of discovered
oil reserves and virtually all gas reserves were reservoired in Neogene (Plio-
Miocene) sandstones in the Carpathian and Intercarpathian Depressions. These
have been extensively explored and only very few prospects of poor quality
remain to be drilled. However, deeper prospective horizons are known to be
present in the Paleogene (principally Oligocene sandstones) below 3500 meters
depth; these prospects will be associated with the shallower producing
structur,es, although likely to be smaller and gas prone. Additional deep
prospects, which have not been intensely explored despite recent promising
discoveries, are expected in the older formations, Mesozoic and Paleozoic
carbonates and sandstones on the basinal edge of the Moesian Platform at
depths between 3,500-8,000 meters.
3.08     The geological structure in the deep Carpathian Depression is
extremely complicated due to overthrust faults and recumbent folds. In
Carpathian Foreland (Moesian Platform) deep prospective zones dip under the
Carpathian Depression and include mainly small normal fault traps below the
thrust of Foreland formations.  The delineation of very deep structures by
seismic surveys is difficult due both to complex tectonic conditions in
Carpathian Foreland and to the carbonate sequence in the Mesozoic which tends
to mask the rather subtle underlying structures. Drilling operations in deep
wells are hindered by numerous difficulties including very high pressure
zones, f:Lowing salt beds, beds dipping at high angles and, in some areas,
hydrogen sulfide corrosion. Nevertheless, very deep exploration is considered
by the Romanians to be the best hope of discovering sizeable reserves
onshore. To date about 200 exploration and appraisal wells have been drilled
to depths ranging from 4,000 to 6,500 meters with about one-third having oil
and gas shows, although most of the discoveries have not yet been either fully
tested or confirmed by subsequent drilling and only 3 or 4 deep fields are
currently producing.
3.09     Offshore. The only prospective area in Romania still virtually
untested is the Black Sea shelf. The Black Sea Basin is separated from the
Carpathian Depression by the Dobrogean uplift, a complex north-south trending
fault block in which basement rocks are found at shallow depths onshore
Romania near the coast. The Dobrogean block itself is cut by a down-dropped
graben more or less normal to the uplift and extending into the Black Sea.
Principal prospects on the Black Sea shelf will be restricted to this graben



- 15 -
zone, more specifically the Tertiary sandstones of both Neogene and Paleogene
age in the center and underlying Mesozoic carbonates and sandstones on the
flanks.
3.10     Exploration of the Black Sea shelf began in 1969 following the
discovery of a small oil field onshore coastal Bulgaria near Varna and several
small gas fields in the USSR immediately to the north. A magnetic survey was
made, followed by 14,000 kilometers of marine seismic. Some 15 structural
prospects and leads were uncovered. To date three of these structures have
been drilled, commencing in 1976 using a jack-up rig built in Romania under
license from the Offshore Co. (Houston, Texas,. The first two structures (one
wildcat each) encountered gas shows in sandstones in Paleogene age but did not
reach the underlying Mesozoic. Three wells hz.ve been drilled to date on the
third structure (Lebada - a sizeable but as yet undelineated feature on the
north flank of the graben zone in a water depth of about 55 meters); at least
two of these wells have encountered rather promising shows of oil at a depth
of about 2400 meters, apparently from a rather tight Mesozoic Upper Cretaceous
sandstone reservoir. However, technical difficulties have been experienced in
testing the oil pay due either to the tightness of the reservoir, formation
damage from excessive mud weight, poor cement around the production casing
string, or all of these. Further plans for the appraisal of the Lebada
discovery are understood to include the drilling of one or two more appraisal
wells after the results of the latest seismic survey are at hand in 1981, and
an extensive production test through an early-production system.
2. Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) 1/
3.11     Since 1950 secondary recovery methods, mainly water and gas
injection, have been applied in the older oil fields in Romania, and almost
all reservoirs responsive to such methods are Dresently producing under a
secondary recovery scheme. Under the present system of exploitation, the
average ultimate recovery from all known reser-voirs is expected to reach 32%
of the oil initially in place, which compares :avorably with estimated primary
recoveries of 5% to 25%. Government policy is to increase the average
ultimate recovery from existing reserves to 37% in the mid-eighties and 40% in
the nineties largely by the application of modern enhanced recovery methods.
3.12     Two industrial-scale in-situ combustion operations and one cyclic
steam injection operation are presently in progress in shallow (100-400
meters) reservoirs. Additionally, some sixteen pilot projects involving in-
situ combustion, steam injection, carbon dioxide injection and polymer
injection are underway. Micellar solution flociding is still in the laboratory
experimentation stage. Recovery increases on the order of 25 to 30 percentage
points are reported from some heavy oil reservoirs undergoing in-situ
combustion and cyclic steam injection pilot teEts.

C. Development Prospects
1. Investment Strategy
3.13     The Government's current Five-Year Plan (1981-85) aims at arresting
the rapid oil production decline of recent years through a priority program
focused on enhanced oil recovery in the near term, and exploration and
development of deep geological horizons and offshore areas for the longer
term. The Ministry of Petroleum's overall investments for exploration and
production over the Plan period are shown below. Better than half of the
investments under the program are for the more difficult and expensive
production prospects, ultimately resulting in more costly domestic supplies of
oil and gas.

a/ Preliminary estimate of investment plan in 1981 Romanian catalog prices; figures
here include investments in sectors other than oil and gas, such as construction
and housing, undertaken by the Ministry as well. These figures are therefore
not directly comparable to the corresponding items in the table in para. 2.22.
b/ About 40% for exploration and 60% for development.
The Ministry's investment plan for onshore exploration and development during
1981-85 calls for drilling some 6,500 shallow and medium depth wells (10
million meters) and 280 deep wells (1.3 million meters). Offshore exploration
now comes under the aegis of the Ministry of Geology; expenditures foreseen
over the Five-Year Plan are some US$400 million.
3.14     Based on extensive laboratory and field tests, some 41 enhanced oil
recovery projects, both industrial and pilot scale, are considered to be fully
justified by the Romanians. Of these, 18 tertiary recovery projects have been
prepared for implementation during 1981-85, including five in-situ combustion,
three cyclic steam injection, two carbon dioxide injection, and eight polymer
and micellar solution injection projects. The presently proposed Project for
enhanced oil recovery in the Videle and Balaria fields is the most important
component of the tertiary recovery program.
3.15     The deep exploration program calls for drilling 50 to 60 deep wells
(4000-6500 meters) per year mainly in the Carpathian Foretrough, and is



- 1 7 -
expected to require the continuous operation of some 90 drilling rigs with
6,000 meter depth capacity because of the difficult geological conditions.
This requires a substantial addition of deep-drilling rigs as Romania has only
20 at present.
3.16     The exploration program for the Romanian Black Sea shelf calls for
drilling some 25 exploration wells with an average depth of 4,000 meters on 20
structures of which 15 are already identified. Romania is about to mobilize a
second jack-up drilling rig, and a third is under construction; one of the
rigs will probably be occupied for two or more years on the Lebada structure.
Although no reserve figures are available for the Lebada field, it is
estimated that the planned preliminary development (including a well platform,
six wells, minimum production facilities on a self-propelled platform, and
necessary pipelines and tanker loading facilities) will result in oil
production of about 1,200 tons per day.
2. 1981-85 Petroleum Production Plan
3.17     Under current production methods, including secondary recovery, annual
production of oil from existing fields is estimated by the Bank staff to decline
to 7.5 million tons in 1985. However, it is expected that the 18 tertiary
recovery projects to be implemented over the next five years would increase
recoverable reserves by about 65.5 million tors, and would sustain an incremental
production of 3.3 million tpy over 20 years. In addition, assuming that the most
recently reported, relatively low oil discovery rate of 10.9 million tpy of new
reserves could be maintained over the next five years through the Government's
intensified exploration program, the country'E recoverable reserves would increase
by roughly another 55 million tons, for an incremental production of 2.7 million
tpy for 20 years. Assuming a 5-year time frame and smooth production-time curve
to reach these incremental production rates and given the Government's targetted
oil production plateau of 12.9 million tpy (including 0.4 million tons of natural
gas liquids), annual production would be as fcllows:

b/' Preliminary figures recently reported for 1981 indicate production may be as

The above oil production profile would result in a cumulative shortfall of nearly
8 million tons of production during 1981-85 relative to the Government's target.
3.18     Domestic production of natural gas in Romania in 1980 and the
Government's targets for 1981-85 are as follows:

a/  Gas production from reservoirs structurally associated with oil reservoirs as
oppcsed to gas dissolved in the oil (associated gas).
b/ Preliminary figures recently reported for 1981 indicate production may be as
much as 36.9 billion cubic meters.
Even assuming no major new gas discoveries, Romania could still increase non-
associated gas production by roughly 15% to 20% by adding more production wells
and some related compressor and pipeline facilities in existing gas fields. Thus,
the non-associated gas production targets could be easily achieved or even
exceeded if necessary. The targetted production of associated and free gas should
also be realizable.
D. Petroleum Prices
3.19     Producer and retail prices-/ are controlled and fixed by the Government
through the State Committee on Prices, and their level and structure have
generally stayed unchanged for long periods. Prior to the price changes put into
effect on January 1, 1981, the last review of producer prices in Romania took
place during 1974-77. Until recently, an exchange equalization fund was used to
bring the foreign currency price for all exports and most imports into line with
the fixed domestic currency price, and the exchange rate was determined separately
for each transaction--largely insulating the domestic economy from foreign price
influences.
3.20     Domestic energy prices have traditionally been low in Romania, reflecting
the country's generally low production cost of primary energy. Rising world
prices ior energy imports, coupled with the country's growing dependence on such
imports,, and increasing domestic production costs, however, have exerted
substantial pressure on the Government in recent years to raise domestic prices.
As part of the general producer price resetting that took effect in January 1981--
which resulted in an average industrial producer price increase of 13%--prices of
petroleum products to industry were doubled on average and the price of natural
gas increased by about 30%. Retail prices for fuels, electricity, and heat had
been increased in 1979 as part of the Government's energy conservation measures
1/ Producer prices represent the ex-factory price of a product; this plus a
fee for transport is the price at which state enterprises exchange inputs and
outputs in the process of production. Retail prices are the price of goods to
the final consumer.

3.21     Petroleum. product prices in Romania, averaged across public and
private consunrys, now appear to be less than 10% below the average of their
border prices.-   With the exception of gasoil and light fuel oil used for
heating, retail (private sector) prices of the major products are well above
their border prices. Retail tariffs for natural gas, electricity, and steam
heat are progressive and increase with consumption. Private consumption of
energy is further restricted by physical means, such as restrictions on
weekend driving and maximal norms of fuel use for heating and hot water for
individual households. Overall, private energy consumption is very low (less
than 15%), and public consciousness of the energy crisis and importance of
conservation is very high in Romania.
3.22     The bulk of energy consumption in Romania is by the public sector,
where in the past the Government has relied primarily on direct controls to
contain domestic energy consumption and to stimulate its production.
Enterprises have to operate within given physical norms of energy input per
unit of output, and face substantial financial penalties, or even suspension
of deliveries, when quotas are exceeded. Similarly, physical targets for
domestic energy production are set yearly, and enterprises rewarded for
meeting or exceeding these targets. As in the case of retail prices, transfer
prices to the public sector for the middle and heavy petroleum distillates
(e.g., fuel oils) are low relative to international prices, although the
mixed-ton price for puOlic sector consumption is still only about 20% below
their border prices. -' The particularly low price of natural gas relative to
a border price estimated in fuel oil equivalent terms is noteworthy. Natural
gas burned as fuel in power plants in Romania is sold for about one-fourth the
price of either fuel oil or lignite; the appropriateness of the relative
prices of these three fuels vis-a-vis their consumption could usefully be
assessed in the context of the overall energy sector survey planned for 1982
(para. 3.31). Nonetheless, there is a very clear Government policy of
conserving gas for higher value added uses such as feedstock for
petrochemicals, which is further reinforced by the threefold price of gas used
for fuel compared to the price as feedstock.
3.23     The above discussion of relative prices of petroleum products is
based on an exchange rate of LEI ll/US$l rather than Romania's official
trading rate of LEI 15/US$l. These prices, in turn, are based on an imported
crude oil price converted at LET 1O/US$I. This represents current practice in
Romania, and suggests that crude oil imports are subsidized from the State
Budget.  However, since the January 1981 price resetting, the revenues
collected from domestic sales as well as from exporting products at an
1/ Estimating private consumption to be 10% and public sector consumption
90%, the domestic price of a mixed ton (about 15% gasoline, 35% diesel/gasoil,
and 50% fuel oil, accounting for about 75% of domestic consumption, based on
apparent net domestic consumption in 1980) in 1981 is about USS231/ton, while
the border price is about US$251/ton; a domestic price of about US$208/ton
results when consumption is taken as 100% public sector.

appreciated exchange rate should largely offset this State subsidy./
3.24     The Romanian authorities, in designing their 1981-85 Five-Year Plan,
adopted a medium-term stabilization program intended to alleviate their declining
balance of payments position; the program is supported by a three-year stand-by
arrangement from the IMF in the amount of SDR 1102.5 million. A major element of
the program is an exchange rate and price reform designed to better reflect the full
cost of imported components in the structure of domestic prices through eventual
unification of the exchange rate and elimination of State subsidies. The
substantial increase in producer prices effected in 1981, along with the abolishment
of the equalization fund and simplification of the exchange rate system, was a first
major step. It is further expected that the Government will apply the official
trading exchange rate to crude oil imports by the end of the IMF stand-by period
(mid-1984), and this would bring the domestic prices of petroleum products closer to
world prices. The resetting and restructuring of retail prices, scheduled for 1982,
along with adjustments in salaries, to take into account the recent changes in
producer prices, has already begun; for example, gasoline prices have been increased
by 20% and diesel fuel by 75%. Producer prices are also in the process of being
increased, retroactive to January 1, 1982, but after the sizable increases in fuel
prices in 1981, the major emphasis is expected to be on the relatively lower priced
middle and heavy distillates and natural gas. At the same time, the exchange rate
foir crude oil imports and product exports is expected to be a uniform LEI 12/US$I.
The progress of the Romanians, with respect to the quantitative performance criteria
under the first year of their program with the IMF, has been encouraging and is
expected to continue into 1983 and 1984; the details of these annual programs will
similarly be agreed between the Romanian authorities and the IMF in the context of
annual consultations. The Bank is cooperating with the IMF in this area, and no
special Bank action is required in the context of the proposed Project.
E. The Romanian Petroleum Industry
i. Organization of Production
3.25     The Ministry of Petroleum (MP) is responsible for overall direction and
coordination of petroleum exploration (onshore), development, and production
activities; its organization chart is given in Annex 3.1. Actual operations in the
oil and gas sector are carried out by a network of operative units subordinated to
the Ministry and reporting to one of two Deputy Ministers. These trusts, centrals,
and enterprises are organized on both geographical and functional bases. The main
elements of this network are six drilling and extraction trusts (Bolintin, Tirgu
Jiu, Arad, Pitesti, Ploiesti, Moinesti) which operate the oil fields, and one
central (Central for Methane Gas in Medias) which operates the non-associated gas
I/ That is, domestic product prices as presently structured should, on average,
more than cover the imported cost of crude (US$267/ton delivered) given that all
domestic crude goes to petroleum products for domestic consumption; this further
assumes that the price paid for extraction of domestic crude (US$47/ton delivered
on average) covers the average cost of production plus a small profit which it
appears to do. Product exports should also, on average, cover the full imported
cruLde cost, although the margin under the presently depressed market conditions
may be negligible and taking refinery use/losses and refining margins into
account could make it negative; this should improve if Romania adjusts its export
mix toward a greater proportion of gasoline as planned.

fields. Several specialized departments and enterprises, in turn, comprise the oil
trusts and gas central which are organized along the lines of a Romanian industrial
central although somewhat more focused on production with relatively limited
autonomy and decision-making responsibilities outside production. Transportation of
oil from the production areas to the refineries, and of imported oil, is handled by
the Enterprise for Pipeline Transport under MP.
3.26     Romania is also active in exporting its technical expertise in all facets
of petroleum exploration, development, and transport. ROMPETROL is the specialized
enterprise under the Ministry of Petroleum which undertakes foreign contracts for
technical services and erection/construction agreements with or without the supply
of equipment and materials. ROMPETROL does not undertake the export of petroleum
equipment and materials, but would utilize Romanian equipment in its foreign
contracts as needed.
3.27     As is typical of the technical ministries in industry, research and project
preparation are carried out by research, engineering, and design institutes,
specifically the Institute of Research and Industrial Design for Oil and Gas
Production (ICPPG). ICPPG is divided into three major centers: Geological Research
Center (Bucharest), Research Center for Drilling, Production and Reservoir
Development (Cimpina), and Design and Engineering Center (Ploiesti). It employs
some 2200 people of whom 1900 are professionals and technicians; its laboratories in
Cimpina are modest but relatively well equipped. Since its establishment in 1950,
ICPPG has been involved in foreign cooperation agreements or consultancy
arrangements in some 29 countries, a particularly long-standing one being that with
Institut Francais du Petrole (IFP) in the field of thermal oil recovery methods
begun in 1969. ICPPG would be responsible for the engineering, design, and
technical supervision of the proposed Project.
3.28     Various other support organizations under the Ministry are concerned with
exploration activities, major construction/maintenance operations and electrical
installations for surface facilities, supply of basic equipment and materials,
cementing, production testing, logging, perforating and other special well services,
and mechanical and electrical equipment repairs. Overall some 100,000 people are
directly employed in petroleum subsector activities under the Ministry of Petroleum.
2. Industry Operation
3.29     Over the years, Romania has developed a commendable technology and
equipment building capacity for the petroleum industry especially for standard
onshore operations through licensing arrangements, local research and development
and, in some cases, imitation. Romanian oil field equipment ranges from tubular
goods to seismic and some sophisticated laboratory equipment. While production is
mostly for domestic requirements, exports of these products have grown rapidly
during the last decade but export markets are beginning to be constrained by the
relatively poor product quality and lack of up-to-date technology.
3.30     Despite the extensive development of the Romanian petroleum industry, it
suffers from a number of shortcomings: (i) almost exclusive reliance on Romanian
technology and equipment, (ii) limited contact with the international petroleum
industry, (iii) lack of incentives at the operating level, and (iv) high degree of
centralization of the planning and decision-making processes. There is a strong
propensity to use Romanian products and technology as much as possible. This, in
turn, has restrained the development in certain special areas such as deep drilling
and offshore exploration where the Romanian products and technology are not at par



- 23 -
with those available internationally and where the industry would benefit
substantially from more contact with foreign petroleum institutions. Moreover, the
dynamic character of the petroleum industry has been constrained by the slow
feedback process between the decisional and operational levels characteristic of
centralized decision making.
F. Bank's Lending Strategy and Role in the Sector
3.31      The Bank's lending in the energy sector in Romania to date has comprised
four loans in power supply: two thermal power projects (Loans Nos. 1028-RO of 1974
and 1652-RO of 1979); one hydropower project ,Loan No. 1242-RO of 1976); and most
recently, a loan to finance part of the 1980-83 investments in the power sector
(Loan No.1936-RO of 1981). In addition, an energy conservation project aimed at
ec[uipment and technology improvements in the Tietallurgical industry is under
preparation. As the next power project, the Government has already requested the
Bank to consider financing a second time-slice covering a cross-section of projects
in their 1981-85 power and heat sector investment program.  Finally, an energy
sector survey is being planned for later in 1982 which would integrate the Bank's
knowledge of the various energy subsectors, p rovide an opportunity to review the
developments and prospects for the sector as a whole, and examine the linkages with
the overall macro-economic framework. The proposed EOR Project would be the Bank's
first lending operation in the petroleum sector in Romania.
3.32      The Bank's role in Romania has tradi:ionally been one of providing foreign
exchange through financing of high priority investments, trying to broaden the
sources of foreign exchange by attracting co-.inancing from external commercial
sources for Bank-financed projects, financing imports of advanced technology, and
providing substantive informal technical assistance, including important
contributions to project design in a number of- projects, during the project cycle.
The primary rationale for Bank involvement in the Romanian petroleum sector, and in
this particular Project, lies in improving the quality and efficiency of the project
preparation and implementation activities of an experienced and capable, but
nevertheless ingrown, petroleum industry.  While the equipment and materials which
will be used in the Project are rather simple and quite standard for the oil
industry, the technical and economic success of the Project is critically dependent
on the way in which these tools are applied a-d the EOR process is implemented,
monitored, and controlled. During the preparation of the proposed Project, the
input of Bank petroleum engineering and geological staff has made a valuable
contribution in improving the overall configu^-ation and design of the Project as
well as bringing to the attention of the Romaalians the technical and economic
considerations affecting Project viability.  'rhe final Project Document prepared by
the Romanians has further benefited substantially from discussions with and
recommendations of the Canadian and Romanian consultants brought in, at the
initiative of the Bank, to review the Project (paras. 5.06-5.07); particularly
critical recommendations were those involving the phasing of Project investments and
operations and systemized monitoring of the oal-going process in the interest of
improving Project economics, reducing operating risks, and optimizing subsequent
investments. We expect that such cooperation will continue throughout Project
irmplementation in the careful monitoring of the Project both by the Romanians and by
the Bank. Given their long-standing collaboration with IFP in the area of enhanced
oil recovery (para. 3.27) and fruitful exhange with consultants under the proposed
Project, we will further encourage the Romanians to continue to seek foreign
expertise and technical cooperation especiall y in those areas such as deep drilling
and offshore exploration where their own indu3try's experience is more limited.

IV. THE BORROWER AND THE BENEFICIARY
A. Investment Bank (IB) - The Borrower
4.01     The Borrower for the proposed loan would be the Investment Bank (IB)
with the guarantee of the Socialist Republic of Romania. IB is the
specialized agency, under the Ministry of Finance, for dealing with investment
projects in all sectors of the economy except agriculture and food
processing. IB has branch offices in all districts of the country and its
staff appraises all major investment projects technically and financially
according to Romanian norms. All investment funds for an approved project are
held in accounts with IB which in turn ensures that the funds are used
properly. It is IB's obligation to ensure that a project is executed
according to the financial and technical data and indicators as approved in
the final technical and economic study. IB's inspectors supervise the
projects to ensure progress according to the approved schedule.
B. Trustul Petrolului Bolintin (TPB) - The Beneficiary
4.02     The Trustul Petrolului Bolintin (Bolintin Petroleum Trust or TPB or
the Trust) is the sponsor of the proposed Project. The Trust is a juridical
entity under Romanian law and was established in its present form in 1974. It
is responsible for oil development and extraction in the southwest region of
the country, and its headquarters is located in the town of Bolintin, about 15
km west of Bucharest. The organization chart of TPB is shown in Annex 4.1 and
follows the typical pattern for industrial centrals in Romania. The Trust
prepares its annual investment and operating program or budget which is
subject to ministerial approval within the context of the current Five-Year
and Annual Plans of the Government. Decision-making power at the Trust level
formally belongs to its Working People's Council which has a membership of
about 25, consisting of the Director, management, labor and union
representatives. The Council normally meets monthly. Within the Council,
there is a Working People's Executive Committee, chaired by the Trust's
Director and consisting of about 7 to 9 members, some from management and
others from among the workers, which is responsible for operations. The
Directori/ and several deputy directors, in turn, are responsible for
implementing the decisions of the Executive Committee.  This type of
organization has worked satisfactorily in the day-to-day routines of the Trust
and is expected to be adequate in the future.
4.03     The main activities of TPB are performed 2y seven semi-autonomous
operating divisions, popularly called enterprisestf while the technical
support, financial and accounting functions, and coordination are performed by
1/ The Director is also responsible directly to the Deputy Minister of
Petroleum with respect to production and investment targets established in the
Annual and Five-Year Plans.
2/ Unlike some of the enterprises under the industrial centrals, the
enterprises under the petroleum trusts do not have a separate juridical
personality.

the headquarters' staff. The crude oil extraction actiyWties within TPB are
geographically divided among four enterprises: Videle, - Cartojani, Titu, and
Braila (which also performs drilling), all naned after the towns located in or
near the corresponding oil fields. As for the other enterprises, one performs
drilling only, another maintenance and manufacture of some equipment/spare
parts, and the last provides construction and erection services. The latter
three are service enterprises providing support to the oil production
enterprises as well as selling their services to outside entities.
4.04     TPB has about 10,715 employees of which only about 170 are in the
headquarters office, with the rest located amcng the seven enterprises. The
total employment is distributed by enterprise and by skill and profession as

4.05     The proposed Project (para. 5.10) will involve the Videle and Balaria
oil fields under the jurisdiction of the Vide]e Enterprise. The organization
chart of this enterprise is shown in Annex 4.2 and follows the same pattern of
decision-making responsibility as the Trust.
C. Recent Production Performance of TPB
4.06     Most of the Trust's oil fields have been in production for about two
decades, and increasingly difficult drilling <nd extraction conditions are
being encountered in these fields. Furthermore, no significant new oil field
has been developed by TPB during the last decade. Consequently, its crude oil
output peaked in the early 1970's and has since been declining as shown below:
1/ The Videle enterprise office as well as the Videle and Balaria oil fields
are about 30 km from the TPB headquarters at Bolintin.

The Suplacu de Barcau enterprise was included under TPB's responsibility during
1977-79 only. This accounted for about 510,000 tons of the 801,000 tons reduc-
tion in TPB's oil production between 1979 and 1980.
b/  All enterprises.
4.07     In 1976, TPB produced about 5 million tons of oil, representing one-
third of total Romanian production which reached its peak at about 15 million
tons that year. For 1981, the Trust's production is estimated at only 3
million tons which would account for about one-fourth of the country's
estimated output for the year. On the basis of the present primary and
secondary oil recovery methods and technologies being used by TPB, oil
produ,^tion from its existing fields is projected to decrease by roughly 0.24
million tpy to about 1.8 million tons by 1986. To reverse this unfavorable
trend, TPB must resort to more expensive and technologically more difficult
tertiary or enhanced oil recovery methods to increase its recoverable reserves
and thereby stabilize production or prevent output from declining as fast as
present trends.
D. Recent Financial Performance of TPB
4.08     The Government (i.e., Council of Ministers and State Committee on
Prices) sets and administers all industrial commodity prices in Romania. In
general, prices are based on industry-wide average operating costs under
normaL or standard conditions plus a profit or benefit margin of up to 15%.
However, in the past, the policy to keep retail prices stable over long
periods of time has led to relatively slow producer price adjustment



- 27 -
procedures, and price changes have lagged behind cost changes particularly
under conditions of rapidly changing operating conditions or production
technology. The industry-wide domestic crude oil wholesale price 1- was kept
virtually unchanged at roughly LEI 211 per ton during 1965-80, but was
increased substantially, by 122%, in 1981 to LEI 446 per ton. This was again
raised to LET 470/ton in early 1982. However, the crude oils from the various
fields have widely different producer prices, reflecting differences in the
extraction costs among the various reservoirs and ultimately, the various
petroleum trusts. As shown in para. 4.10 below, TPB's crude oil producer
price, which was below the industry average price until 1980, increased every
year. Nonetheless, the producer price adjustments prior to 1980 did not fully
keep up with the increases in TPB's unit production costs, thereby causing
the Trust to operate at a loss during 1979 and 1980 which were both covered by
monetary transfers from the State Budget. The 1981 producer price increase,
however, allowed TPB to earn a profit that year. Annexes 4.3 and 4.4 show
TPB's historical (1977-81) income statement and balance sheets, together with
forecasts through 1986 assuming there is no project. The historical results
are summarized below.

1977-80. Up to 1978, any benefit in excess of 15% of revenues accrued to the
Government as profit taxes. Since 1979, a prelevation charge (value-added
tax) replaced the profit tax but the petroleum industry is exempted from this
prelevation charge. Benefits are essentially profits after deducting
prelevation charges (if any) but before interest expenses.

prices charged by the oil extraction trusts to the crude oil transport enterprise.

4a09     The total revenue of TPB can be divided into three groups: (i)
revenue from the sale of petroleum products (i.e., crude oil, associated
natural gas and gasoline) which accounted for about 51% of the total during
1977-80 and 63% in 1981; (ii) income from the sale of excess utilities and
other services directly related to its oil extraction operations which
accounted for about 3% of the total during 1977-80 and 2% in 1981; and finally
(iii) revenues generated from the sale of the services of the three service
enterprises as well as employee (user) fees for socio-cultural activities and
housing supplied by the Trust, which provided the remaining 46% during 1977-80
and 35% in 1981.1/ The service activities of TPB are therefore substantial
and will remain so in the future although their contribution to total
revenues, in terms of percentage, is expected to gradually decline as oil
producer prices and revenues increase.
4.10     The 1981 crude oil average production cost per ton of the Videle
Enterprise was LEI 415; that for TPB was LEI 441; and that for the whole
industry was LE1 401. The structure of costs for the three levels of
aggregation are slightly different, with energy inputs, for example,
accounting for almost 14% of total costs for the Videle Enterprise compared to
13% for TPB and 7% for the industry (Annex 4.5). As mentioned earlier, TPB is
encoun,tering increasingly difficult oil extraction conditions in its existing
oil fields. This has caused output to decrease as well as unit production
cost to increase substantially during 1977-81.  In the near future, unit
production cost will continue to increase, although the application of EOR
techniques would prevent it from increasing as much as otherwise. In
addition, the Government in 1981 reinstated the oil reserve discovery charge
which was discontinued in 1976. The discovery charge is presently set at LEI
100 per ton of crude oil extracted. This amount is likely to increase, albeit
slowly, in the future as the more expensive deep-drilling a2l offshore
drilling increasingly account for discovering new reserves._ ! The trend in
TPB's unit revenues and unit production costs are shown below. It indicates
that during the four years from 1977-81, unit variable production costs
1/ The revenues from these service activities cover only about 95% of the
corresponding costs. This is because revenues from the housing construction,
housing rental, as well as the social and cultural activities do not cover
their full cost. This would represent employee benefits since it is normal
for industrial entities not to cover the full cost of employee facilities
(e.g., housing, clubs and health/vacation resorts) from user charges. The
revenues from service activities are broken-down as follows: drilling and
production tests - 87%; construction and erection (including housing) - 12%;
and social and cultural activities - 1%.
2/ The reserve discovery charge is set roughly equal to the unrecovered
porticon of the cumulative oil exploration costs incurred by the Ministry
(excluding the exploration costs during 1976-80 which were borne directly by
the State Budget) divided by the amount of recoverable reserves at present.
As the recoverable reserves are increased due to EOR methods rather than new
discoveries, the discovery charge would decrease. However, current
exploration costs will continuously tend to increase the charge unless
substantial discoveries are made.



- 29 -
increased by 200% while unit fixed costs and amortization (depreciation)
charges both increased by 100%. Adjustments in selling prices lagged behind
increases in costs from 1977 through 1980 but finally caught up in 1981. It
is now the Government's policy that economic units should earn some minimum
profit rate under conditions of efficient operations (i.e., consumption of
inputs per unit of output does not exceed norris set by the Government). In
addition, the Government is expected to make f'aster price adjustments in
response to changes in production costs as we]l as to gradually reflect the
full cost of imported inputs in the prices of domestic products. This policy
would ensure that TPB will be able to earn suf'ficient revenues to cover costs
and debt service, as well as to finance a subEtantial part of its investment
program from internally generated funds. Thus, in early 1982, the Government
increased TPB's crude oil selling price to LE] 528 per ton.

E. The Romanian Industrial Financial System and the Beneficiary
4.11       In 1978, the Government announced plans to reform the economic-
financial system for the State economic entities in order to improve economic
performance and strengthen self-administratior. Specific legislation and
decrees were introduced from 1978 through 198C. The reforms also placed
emphasis on profitability instead of only physical output as a measure of



- 30 -
performance, provided additional financial incentives to -workers and
management for improving efficiency, and ensured a larger role for the
enterprises in initiating investment proposals to be incorporated in the five-
year plan. The reforms, called the New Economic Mechanisms, are embodied in a
group of laws and related decrees of the Council of State. The four main laws
under this new system are: (i) The Investment Law No. 9 of December 1980 which
defines the role and responsibility of the various state economic entities and
governmental units in the planning, formulation, approval and implementation
of investments to be incorporated in the Five-Year Plan and the Annual Plan;
it prcvides for a system whereby the enterprises, the centrals/trusts and the
ministries have larger roles and more autonomy than in the past; (ii) The
Finance Law No. 9 of July 1979 which authorizes the economic entities to
establish and maintain various accounts or funds at an authorized bank (e.g.,
Investment Bank) for financing working capital increases, capital investments
in specified areas, employee housing, socio-cultural activities and profit-
sharing, as well as incur both short-term loans and long-term loans to help
finance working capital requirements and fixed investments respectively; (iii)
The Profit (and Profit Distribution) Law No. 29 of December 1978 which
emphasizes value-added as the key measure of economic activity, expands the
conterLts of the income and expenditure budget of economic entities by
including, in addition to the usual operating costs and revenues, expenditures
and sources of financing for research and development, for working capital
increases, for fixed investments and for socio-cultural activities. As
incentive, part of the profits will accrue to the workers in the form of
profit-sharing as well as additional funds for housing and other employee
benefits. The law also establishes the manner by which an economic unit
returns or remits back to the State the capital provided to the entity as well
as the manner by which the profits and funds retained by the entity are
allocated to the various funds established according to the Finance Law; and
(iv) The Planning Law No. 8 of 1972 which establishes the basic planning
frame,work for all economic and governmental activities (e.g., investments,
State Budget, local government budgets, balance of payment budget, national
economic targets, etc.). The Planning Law is rather general in many areas,
such aLS investments, and thus related laws (e.g., the Investment Law) and
decrees provide the detailed procedures and the assignment of responsibilities
and authorities. Before the New Economic Mechanisms were introduced, the
industrial investment funds of the State economic units were provided from the
State Budget and administered by the Investment Bank. At the same time,
practically all profits and depreciation funds were transferred to the State
for reallocation. Under the new system, a majority of the investment funds
are expected to be provided by the enterprises through retained profits,
depreciation and loans.
4.12      Petroleum exploration and development is one area of capital
investment listed in the Finance Law as qualifying for financing from the
State Budget. State Budget funds carry no interest charges but are gradually
returned to the State through a share (up to 10%) of the planned annual
benefiLts and any surplus funds.  Should long-term loans be required for fixed
investments, the Law stipulates a maximum long-term loan maturity of 15 years
in industry and 25 years in agriculture. Principal repayments are to start
not later than one year after project completion. The interest rate for both
short and long-term loans are to be specified by a decree of the Council of
State: at present, these are both about 2% for local currency loans but can be
raised to 6% for long-term loans and 12% for short-term loans on portions that



- 31 -
are in arrears. The Law continues to restrict foreign exchange transactions,
including foreign loans, and these can be undertaken only by foreign-trade
enterprises and banks. Thus, banks will pass on foreign loans to the indus-
trial centrals and trusts in local currency, with the State Budget bearing the
foreign exchange risk, at an interest rate about one-half percentage point
above the foreign loan interest rate. When the banks provide credits,
particularly long-term loans to economic units, the Finance Law enumerates
several responsibilities of the banks to ensurE that the investment is
economic, well-formulated and documented, propErly approved and implemented,
and regularly supervised by the banks.
F. TPB's Five-Year (1981-85) Investment Program
4.13      Under the New Economic Mechanisms, therefore, TPB would be expected
to finance from internally generated funds and long-term loans, an
increasingly large proportion of its investment; program. For the current
Five-Year Plan (1981-85), this investment program is about LEI 10.3 billion
(US$684 million) or about 17% of the country's planned petroleum investments
during the period. EOR projects, of which the proposed Videle/Balaria Project
is the largest, will take a major portion (69%: of TPB's future investments.
The breakdown of TPB's investment program is aE. follows:
TPB: 1981-85 Petroleum Investment Program a/

a/ Investment in fixed assets excluding interest during construction (IDC)
and incremental working capital. The estimated cost of the Videle/Balaria
EOR Project during this Five-Year investment program is LEI 4.6 billion or
US$307 million; this estimate reflects Romanian catalog prices for all
cost items and is less than the Bank's cost estimate which adjusts upwards
to international price levels, the cost of direct and indirect imports for
the Project (para. 5.17). In subsequent d:scussions and for the financial
analysis of the Project, the period 1982-86 is more appropriate, and the
investment plan and financing needs for this period are used.
4.14     As shown in para. 6.08, TPB's interna' cash generation during 1982-86
is expected to cover just over one-third of the financing required for fixed
assets, after provisions for IDC and incremental working capital. Financing
from the State Budget and loans from the Invest:ment Bank (including the
proposed Bank and other foreign loans channeled through IB) will therefore
provide a significant proportion of TPB's financing requirements.

V. THE PROJECT
A. Background
5.01     Romania has a long history of oil production, dating back to the nineteenth
century, and its major producing oil fields have long passed their peak productive
years despite the extensive application of conventional secondary recovery techniques
(i.e., water and gas injection). Although the country has an active exploration
program, this is increasingly directed at the more expensive and time-consuming deep
onshore iexploration and offshore exploration in the Black Sea, and has been yielding
low returns to date; new discoveries of oil are quite inadequate to offset the
depletion of older fields. Many Romanian oil fields were discovered and exploited
before the inception of modern reservoir engineering practices and the initial
production methods were inexpensive and simple, with low recovery rates, leaving
unrecovered large amounts of the original oil in place in the reservoirs. Even after
the extensive application of conventional secondary oil recovery methods, there is
still considerable scope for increasing the proportion of oil recovered from known
reservoirs by the application of more expensive modern enhanced oil recovery
techniques which have become economic after the large increases in oil prices in the
mid-1970s. The application of modern EOR techniques is considered as offering the
best possibility of slowing the relatively rapid decline of domestic oil production
which is likely to continue if no action is taken.
5.02     The petroleum mission in November 1980 reviewed the Government's invest-
ment program for increasing oil production, covering onshore and offshore explora-
tion and EOR. While all are important and necessary for the reasons given above EOR
is considered to offer the best prospect of early increases in oil production in view
of the higher risks in oil exploration investments. The Government has under
consideration a number of EOR projects, all of which appear to have merit. The
choice of a specific project was therefore based on the state of preparation of the
various EOR projects and their readiness for immediate investment in oil production
facilities. Of the EOR projects reviewed by the mission, the Videle/Balaria program
appeared to be the most advanced and best prepared, as well as offering immediate
prospects of substantial increases in oil production. This program is the largest,
among those reviewed, in terms of incremental oil production in Romania, and will be
the largest in-situ combustion operation in the world when fully developed. The
technology utilized and experience gained in this project may also be adapted for use
in other developing countries having heavy oil reserves.
1. Main Characteristics of Videle and Balaria Oil Fields
5.03     The Videle and Balaria oil fields are located in the southern alignment of
the Moesian platform in Romania about 45 km west-southwest of Bucharest. The
discovery well was drilled in 1959 and the various producing units were developed and
put on production between 1961 and 1970. The fields produce a rather heavy crude oil
(i.e., low-GOR, high viscosity, 180 to 190 API crude oil) from Sarmatian (Upper
Miocene) sands and sandstones encountered at depths of 500 to 800 meters. The
initial reserves of oil-in-place are estimated at approximately 124.2 million tons
(831 million Bbls). The Videle/Balaria reservoirs have three oil producing horizons
or layers, referred to as 'a", "b" and "c" respectively.  These layers are not
necessarily oil bearing in all areas of the fields. Because of this as well as
faulting and sand pinch-outs, the reservoirs are divided into three main pools:
Videle "a + b", Videle "c" and Balaria "a + b". The two pools in Videle are further
sub-divided into ten production units while the pool at Balaria is sub-divided into



- 33 -
four production units.  The reservoir character:stics for each of the three pools
are shown in Annex 5.1. The Balaria reservoirs produce under natural water drive,
while the Videle reservoirs have been subjected to water injection, a secondary
recovery technique, since 1965. Current daily oil production rates are about
1,200 tons and 180 tons (8,030 and 1,204 Bbls) :7rom Videle and Balaria,
respectively, with water cuts ranging from 86% :o 94%.!' At present there are
about 660 producing wells and 129 water injection wells in Videle and 60
production wells in Balaria. Most of the Videle reservoirs are heavily water-
flooded, and the water-cuts for these reservoirs are expected to approach 98% in a
few years. Thus, water-injection in Videle will approach its practical technical
and economic limits within 3 to 5 years.
5.04     Due to the low gravity and high viscosity of the oil, the economically
recoverable oil under the current exploitation scheme from the Videle/Balaria
fields is expected to be very low, on the order of 15% of the oil initially in-
place resulting in a cumulative production of oily about 18.6 million tons (124.5
million Bbls) out of the 124.2 million tons initially in place. In addition to
this economically recoverable quantity, another 1.3 million tons is technically
recoverable bringing the fields' ultimate recoverable reserves to about 20.0
million tons. Cumulative oil production as of the end of 1981 was already 16.7
million tons (111.7 million Bbls) or 13% of the oil initially in place. Thus, a
total of about 3.2 million tons are estimated to be producible during the next 20
years at very low rates (para. 5.08). A tertiary oil recovery technique is
urgently needed for these two fields.
2. Videle/Balaria Enhanced Oil Recovery Program
5.05     The enhanced oil recovery program prepared for the Videle and Balaria
fields by ICPPG was designed to maximize the final oil recovery while providing an
acceptable rate of return. It calls for the arplication of in-situ combustion
process over the entire productive area of the field2! The program is expected
to increase the final recovery of oil at Videle/Balaria from 15% under present
methods to 39%, resulting in an incremental recovery of 29.9 million tons (200
million Bbls) of oil to be extracted over the r.ext 40 to 50 years. The
incremental annual production from the program is expected to gradually increase
and reach the steady-state rate of 731,000 tpy (approximately 13,400 Bbls/day) by
1986.
5.06     ICPPG, on the basis of experience with pilot tests and commercial
I/ Water-cut refers to the percentage of water by volume in the fluid produced
from an oil well.  A water-cut of 94% means 94, water and 6% oil.  The water and
the oil are subsequently separated. A water-cut of about 98% is considered to be
the practical technical and economic limit.
2/  In-situ combustion is a thermal enhanced oil recovery method in which a small
fraction of the reservoir oil (the residual coke which is not recoverable anyway)
is burned in place to heat up the reservoir fluids and rock and thus increase the
production rate and recovery factor of oil. The combustion process is maintained
by continuous air injection into the reservoir. In one variant of the process
only dry air is injected (dry combustion); in another moderate amounts of water
are injected along with the air to improve the efficiency of the recovery process
(wet combustion). A more detailed technical description of the Project and the
in--situ combustion process is available in the Project File.



- 34 -
operations using in-situ combustion as well as steam injection in Romania, very
early recognized the suitability of in-situ combustion for the Videle/Balaria EOR
program. Four in-situ combustion pilots were thus installed in Videle/Balaria:
one in Balaria "'a + b", two in Videle "a + b" and one in Videle "c" reservoirs.
The Balaria pilot has been in operation for six years, has already produced about
40% of the initial oil-in-place and is expected to produce for another year or
so.-   The other pilots are only one to two years old but have performed
satisfactorily so far and are expected to do just as well. Based on the pilot
results, a field-wide in-situ combustion program was designed by ICPPG; the main
design parameters are shown in Annex 5.2. The pilot test results, the over-all
project design, the estimates of oil initially-in-plac9 as well as of projected
production levels, were reviewed by Bank consultants    during Project appraisal.
5.07     The consultants supported the project concept and design parameters but
made two main recommendations which were subsequently incorporated in the EOR
program design (i.e., Project Document) submitted by ICPPG and TPB for final
approval by the Ministry of Petroleum.   The first recommendation of the
consultants is to lag the combustion fronts in the Videle "a + b" and the Videle
"ic" pools in the part of the field where the two overlap (i.e., the western
portion of the field) to avoid heat damage to the production wells just ahead of
the combustion fronts. The second was to upgrade the monitoring of the combustion
process to allow for quick adjustments to the operations in response to the
dynamic behavior of the reservoirs thereby optimizing output. The information
collected would also be used to plan the best well patterns for subsequent phases
of the EOR program. The consultants and the Bank support ICPPG's choice of in-
situ combustion  vjer steam-injection for the following technical and practical
considerations: -
(i)    Ultimate oil recovery would be significantly higher, especially in
dipping reservoirs such as Videle/Balaria, with in-situ combustion
although in general, the extraction period would be much longer and
the capital costs could be higher compared to steam injection;
(ii)   In-situ combustion is more fuel efficient than steam injection, and
uses as fuel for the process the residual coke in the reservoir
which is not recoverable anyway. Moreover, steam requirements
would be excessive in these reservoirs due to (a) the thinness of
the oil bearing sands resulting in large heat losses to the
overburden and the underburden, (b) the high water content of the
reservoirs, and (c) the depth of the reservoirs;
1/ The commercial scale in-situ combustion operation in Suplacu de Barcau is
achieving an ultimate oil recovery of slightly over 50%.
2/ The consultants were from a consortium of AOSTRA of Canada and ROMCONSULT
of Romania.
3/ Even if in-situ combustion was not clearly superior to steam injection for
the Videle/Balaria oil fields, the former method may still be preferred
because a series of pilot tests would be needed before a steam injection
program could be designed delaying the application of thermal methods by about
two years. This would be a costly delay considering the present high water-
cuts and rapidly declining oil production.



- 35 -
(iii) Practically all of the existing production and injection wells
(about 850) can be used with in-situ combustion but not with steam
injection.
5.08     The estimate of the ultimate oil recorery from the EOR program is shown
in Annex 5.3. ICPPG has used a conservative estimate of 39% of the oil initially
in-place as the recovery factor for the EOR program. The consultants accept this
estimate although they acknowledge that rates as high as 50% are also possible.
At the Suplacu de Barcau field, the recovery rate is slightly more than 50%. For
the purposes of the Appraisal, a rate of 39% is used, although higher rates are
likely. The forecast of the production with and without the in-situ combustion
EOR program is shown below, together with the historical production. To be
conservative, the production forecast without the project is estimated using
technically recoverable reserves, rather than t:hose judged to be economically
recoverable (para. 5.04). The table illustrates the rapid decline of production
since 1975 and the urgent need for an EOR program.

5.09     Although of unusually long duration, *-he major portion of the capital
cost of the Videle/Balaria EOR program would be incurred during the period 1982-
86, when surface facilities required to institute the process in all sections of
the field would be installed and a sufficient number of combustion and injection
wells to start and control the EOR process wouLd be drilled. In subsequent
years, additional wells (about 108 wells per year) and corresponding surface
facilities would be added as the combustion front advances in the reservoirs.
The entire EOR program in Videle/Balaria is es:imated to cost in terms of 1981
Romnanian catalog prices, LEI 12,744 million (U3$849.6 million) excluding
incremental working capital, interest during construction and contingencies. The
proposed Project would constitute about 38% of this extended investment program.

B. Project Description
5.10     The Project comprises the 1982-86 slice of the Videle/Balaria EOR
program. The Project's main objective is to initiate the in-situ combustion
process throughout the entire 18 km width of the fields (which covers roughly
80 sq km) in order to increase the ultimate oil recovery and attain an
incremental output of 731,000 tpy of crude oil from 1986 onwards. The detailed
Project description appears in the Project File and is summarized as follows:
(a)   Well Drilling and Completion.  A total of 909 new wells each
650 to 800 m. deep will be drilled and completed as air
injection and production wells for a total meterage of about
690,000 m. 137 of the new wells will be located in the Balaria
area, the rest being located in the East and West Videle areas.
(b)   Oil and Gas Separation Facilities.  Twenty-four oil and gas
separation centers, each capable of collecting the produced
fluids and separating oil and combustion gases from 48 to 50
production wells will be built. These centers will be
relatively simple installations with oil and combustion gas
separation, measurement, liquids transfer, flaring of
combustion gases and minimal oil storage equipment similar in
design to those already existing in the Suplacu de Barcau
field. Nine of the oil and gas separation centers will be
equipped with water injection facilities.
(c)   Oil Treatment, Storage and Pumping Facilities.  One central oil
treatment, storage and pumping center capable of handling 5,000
m3/day of oil and oil/water emulsion will be built. The center
will have facilities for oil de-emulsification and storage, and
treated oil and untreated water pumping. With the exception of
emulsion treating equipment which is sized larger to handle
increased emulsion forming as a result of the in-situ
combustion process, the new central oil treatment, storage and
pumping facility will be similar in design to the one already
existing in the Videle area. This existing facility will also
be expanded to cater to increased liquids (oil and water)
production and emulsion problems.
(d)   Produced Water Treatment and Injection Facilities.  A new
center for physically treating 8,000 m'/day of produced water
along with water storage and transfer facilities will be built
to ensure adequate treatment of the produced water before re-
injection in the reservoirs.
(e)   Air Injection Facilities.  Five compressor stations with a
combined air injection capacity of 8.7 million standard cubic
meters per day at 60 to 80 atmosphere discharge pressure will
be built at various sections of the Videle/Balaria field.
These compressor stations will be equipped with facilities for
injection air measurement and distribution as well as those
normally required in air compression plants, such as filters,
cooling towers and fire fighting equipment.



- 37 -
(f)  Pipelines.  Approximately 1,300 km of pipelines and flow lines 3 to
14 inches in diameter will be built for air and water injection, gas
supply to combustion wells and various surface installations and
collection and disposal of produced fluids (oil, water and gas).
(g) UJtilities. Adequate facilities will be built for power distribution,
steam generation and treated water supply to wells and field
installations. Also field laboratories will be established to
monitor the in-situ combustion process.
(h) Civil Works and Roads. Approximately 50 km of main and 70 km of
access roads will be constructed to service wells and surface
installations, as well as buildings to house equipment and field
offices and laboratories.
(i) Engineering and Technical Services. Included in this category are
surveys, hydrological and geotechnical investigations, design,
engineering, logging and coring services, cementing and perforation
services to be supplied by the specialized organizations.
The Project Document (para. 5.07) was approved by Decision No. 13 of the
Executive Board of the Managing Council of MP on October 31, 1981, making the
program (and Project) design official and committing the Government to the
Project as well as the entire EOR program. In addition, agreement was also
obtained during negotiations that TPB and ICP!'G will identify key wells (about
75 to 100) to be logged and cored using equipment and techniques agreed with
the Bank and that old wells will be correlated with the new ones through
radioactive logging inside the casing. Since Romanian logging and coring
technology incorporates many of the most recent improvements of the industry,
no specialized foreign coring and logging con:ractor would be needed.
C. Project Implementation
1.   Project Management Arrangements
5.11     The Project will be managed by a tean consisting of the Deputy
Director for Production, Chief of the Department for Oil Works Investments,
Chief of the Office for Technology and ReservDir Engineering and Chief
Accountant of TPB and two senior engineers (oie EOR specialist and one design
specialist) from ICPPG. This team will be responsible for coordinating
various implementing entities, monitoring the progress of implementation and
the reservoir performance and reporting. All members of the group are highly
placed in their respective organizations, have long operating and management
experience and are reasonably well versed in international petroleum industry
practices. This arrangement is satisfactory. TPB is currently putting
together the staff for project management, supervision and control.



- 38 -
2.   Engineering and Construction
5.12     Both basic and detailed engineering will be performed by ICPPG, the
designalted organization in Romania for all research, design and engineering
activities related to oil and gas exploration and exploitation. The reservoir
engineering aspects will be the responsibility of ICPPG's Research Department
for Reservoir Engineering located at its Cimpina headquarters. All other
design and engineering work with regard to wells, surface and subsurface
equipment and surface facilities will be handled by specialized ICPPG
departments located in Ploiesti.
5.13     The drilling of wells and installation of wellheads, manifolds and
flow lines will be undertaken by the TPB through its drilling enterprise and
Videle Enterprise.  Major installations, such as compressor stations, oil and
gas separation, and oil and water treatment centers will be built by the Oil
Installations and Construction Trust. The Electrical Installations Enterprise
will act as subcontractor to the Oil Installations and Construction Trust for
electrical works. All the entities involved in project engineering,
implementation and procurement (para. 5.24) are under the Ministry of
Petroleum which will ensure coordination and cooperation among the various
organizations.
5.14     These arrangements reflect the well-established project implemenation
system in Romania. In addition, the Government, in response to serious
concerns expressed by the Bank in relation to delays experienced in some
projects, just recently established a high level inter-ministerial committee
to review and follow-up every three months, the progress of Bank-financed
projects and to help ensure timely implementation. This is expected to
substantially reduce the risks of delays especially those due to
administrative causes. There is also a long standing collaboration between
ICPPG and IFP (para. 3.28) in the field of thermal oil recovery methods which
gives ICPPG access to specialized expertise, should it not be available in
Romania. Finally, the Romanian petroleum industry has extensive experience
with the in-situ combustion technology.  Given  all these factors, the project
implementation and monitoring arrangements are satisfactory.
3. I]mplementation Schedule
5.15     The Project would be implemented over a period of approximately five
years starting from early 1982 and ending in December 1986, with the major
portion of surface facilities being commissioned by mid-1984. Annex 5.4 shows
the proposed implementation schedule. The construction and drilling schedule
is prepared on the basis of past Romanian experience and is achievable.
D. Pro;ject Cost Estimate
5.16     The total Project cost to the Government is estimated at US$454.2
million (LEI 6.81 billion) including physical and price contingencies,
incremental working capital and front-end fee on the Bank loan. The foreign
exchange component (direct and indirect) is estimated at US$163.1 million, or
36% of total cost. The cost estimate is summarized below:

a/  The Project cost to the Government adjusts the cost of the indirect import contents (e.g.,
petroleum products, iron ore, coking coal, special steels, sub-assemblies) of locally
purchased equipment and materials to import prices or international levels as opposed to the
Government set domestic catalog prices which are reflected in the financial cost to TPB.
The Project is exempt from sales and import taxes.
b!  In mid-1981 prices. Includes the cost of delivery to site and erection.
c/  15% on compressed air supply facilities and 10% on all other items.
d/  For foreign exchange costs, price escalation rates are: 8% per year 1982 and 1983 7.5% in
1984, 7% in 1985 and 6% in 1986. For local currency costs, the rates are: 5.5% in 1982,
9.5% in 1983, 5.5% in 1984, 5% in 1985, and 4.5% in 1986.
e/  The balance of the interest during construction will be financed with equity funds and is
not shown above.
5.17     The estimated financial cost of the Project to TPB (Annex 5.5) is
based on 1981 Romanian catalog prices (i.e., Government-set prices) for
locally purchased items and mid-1981 international prices for directly
imported items that would be financed from the proposed Bank loan. These
catalog prices generally do not fully reflect the cost of the indirect import
contents of locally produced or distributed equipment, materials and supplies
(e.g., petroleum products). For example, imported iron ore, coking coal, and
other inputs for steel-making have catalog prices that are generally below
international levels. Thus, the catalog prices for equipment, steel plates
and tubular products in turn do not reflect the full foreign exchange cost of
the steel contained in these products. The cost of the Project to the
Government (Annex 5.6), who in the final analysis will pay the international
prices for these indirect imports, is therefore about 12% higher than the



- 40 -
financial cost to TPB. The estimated Project cost to the Governmenit shown
above incorporates the adjustments made to reflect as closely as possible the
international prices of the imported inputs for steel, fuels (e.g., diesel
oil) and other materials that would be required by the Project.
5.18     The overall cost of engineering and technical services represents the
sums to be charged to the Project under existing Government regulations and
contractual arrangements to be finalized between TPB and the various
organizations. The estimate for drilling and equipment is based on a detailed
list of equipment prepared by ICPPG. However in view of the uncertainties
involved in estimating air injection requirements due to the heterogeneous
nature of the oil reservoirs, a physical contingency of 15% was applied to the
base costs of compressed air supply facilities. On the other hand, a physical
contingency of 10% was deemed to be adequate for the remaining cost items
because of the repetitive nature and similarity of the existing installations
at Videle and/or Suplacu de Barcau to the ones to be constructed under the
Project. Price contingencies were calculated based on the price escalation
rates shown in the footnote to the preceding table. These contingency
provlsions are satisfactory.  The calcuLation of the interest during
construction is shown in Annex 5.7.
E. Financing Plan
5.19     TPB's cumulative internal cash generation during 1982-86 is expected
to be about LEI 5.16 billion (US$344 million) as shown in para. 6.08. However
assuming that all its investments other than the Project, as well as
distributions and payments from benefits, would be covered first from
internally generated funds and that the balance plus all the State Budget
funds given to TPB during this period will be used for the Project -- then the
Project financing plan would be as shown below.

b/ This amount represent the adjustment from catalog prices to international prices

through other entities.
During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government that it will
provide TPB with funds, including foreign exchange, to complete the financing



- 41 -
plan for the Project; furthermore, should the Trust's internal cash generation
be less than expected or should cost-overruns occur, the Government will
provide or cause TPB to be provided with additional resources on a timely
basis to complete the Project.
5.20     The Government and IB also confirmed during negotiations their
intention to seek co-financing for the Project as soon as foreign capital
market conditions and Romania's external borrcwing program will allow such an
operation. The amount of such co-financing is not explicitly included in the
financing plan for the Project, which shows financing from the State Budget,
but will be used to reduce the Government's contribution when it is
obtained. As in recent projects, the loan documents could be amended to
permit a link (e.g., cross-default clause) between the Bank loan and a co-
financing operation if such linkage would facilitate borrowing by Romania.
5.21     The proposed Bank loan of US$101.5 million would finance about 22% of
the total and about 62% of the foreign exchange financing needed by the
Government respectively. The loan would be made to the Investment Bank (IB)
at the prevailing Bank lending rate with a maturity of 15 years including 3
years of grace. IB will ensure that the proceeds from the loan would be used
exclusively for the Project and would pass on the loan proceeds to TPB under
terms defined by law as well as IB's own policies and regulations. Under the
recently adopted Romanian procedures (para. 4.12) this would mean that IB will
onlend the LEI equivalent of the Bank loan proceeds at an annual interest rate
of one-half percentage point above the Bank's lending rate with identical
maturity and grace period as the Bank loan and with the State Budget bearing
the foreign exchange risk. This is an improvement over the past practice of
passing on Bank funds as State Budget funds (i.e., as equity). It results in
an interest rate to the beneficiary well above the 2% annual rate fixed by law
for local loans, as well as the annual domestic inflation rates expected for
the next several years. The estimated schedule of disbursement for the Bank
loan is shown in Annex 5.8.
F. Procurement and Disbursement
5.22     The equipment and materials proposed for Bank financing have been
agreed upon during negotiations. These items are all suitable for
international competition with standard designs and specifications; they have
been grouped into major categories involving items required for drilling and
completion of wells and items for the surface facilities, e.g., tubular goods,
roller-bits, surface and sub-surface pumps, and special monitoring as well as
sub-surface equipment.
5.23     Procurement of items proposed for Bank-financing will be through
international competition in accordance with Bank guidelines. Of the
internationally bid items, about US$94 million (94%) are expected to be
procured through international competitive bidding (ICB) and about US$6
million (6%) through limited international tendering with quotations being
solicited from at least three suppliers from three different countries.
Limited international tendering will be restriated to items estimated to cost
less than US$300,000 equivalent each (CIF basis) as well as items in limited
international supply whose delivery periods are critical to the timely
completion of the Project, such as high-pressu-e and temperature valves,
control equipment, special packers and bottom-aole assemblies. For



- 42 -
internationally bid items to be financed by the Bank, the list of goods will
require prior Bank approval and bidders will be prequalified or post-qualified
in accordance with criteria acceptable to the Bank which would be specified in
the bidding documents in the case of post-qualification. Qualified local
suppliers will be allowed to participate in ICB with a 15% (or the import duty
rate if lower) preference margin. It is estimated that the number of bid
packages for Bank financing will not exceed 15 and prior Bank review of all
bidding and contract documents will be undertaken. Given the standard nature
of most of the equipment and materials involved in which Romania has ample
supply capacity, and the transport advantage of local suppliers over foreign
bidders, it is expected that Romanian suppliers could win a very high
proportion of the internationally bid items. The Romanian suppliers are
expected to be most competitive with tubular materials and be least
competitive with roller bits, pumping units, and items to be procured through
limited international tendering.
5.24     The responsibility for initiating procurement action for items
financed by the proposed Bank loan will rest with the IB. At the request of
the IB, ROMPETROL, an enterprise under the Ministry of Petroleum responsible
for international cooperation in the petroleum sector, will undertake
procurement of Bank-financed items in consultation with ICPPG and TPB.
ROMPETROL will prepare the bidding documents for approval by the Bank through
IB. All the further procedures, until the final stage of placing the contract
for the supply of materials and equipment, will be processed through IB.
5.25     The proposed allocation of the Bank funds is shown below.
Disbursements are expected to be completed by June 1986, reflecting the plan
to have all materials and equipment needed for the next six months already
stocked at the site to ensure continuous project implementation. The loan
closing date would be June 30, 1987, six months after the expected project
completion.

G. Ecology and Safety
5.26     In Romania, land use for industrial projects is governed by strict
laws and regulations. Any industrial enterprise requiring the use of
agricultural or forest land is obliged to obtain authorization from the
Central and Judetan government authorities at -*he basic project documentation
stage. After usage, the land has to be restored to its original state or a
monetary compensation has to be paid by the en-:erprise to enable agricultural
or forestry institutions to reclaim an equal amount of land elsewhere in the
country. Many of the installations to be provided under the Project will be
located on land already allocated to the use oF TPB and the requirements for
additional land will be kept at a minimum in accordance with the Trust's past
practice.
5.27     Main sources of pollution are well efFluents (oil, water and
combustion gases) which, with the exception of combustion gases, will be
handled in a semi-enclosed system. All necessary precautions will be taken
during design and construction of pipelines to minimize the chances of
overpressurization, corrosion and third-party damage. Surface installations
where oil and produced water are collected and treated will be provided with
containment walls, drain basins and drain removal pumps. The produced water
will be treated in a specially designed plant and re-injected into the
producing formations.  The combustion gases (mostly N2, C02 and CO) separated
from the produced oil will be vented to the atmosphere through 50-meter or
taLler stacks.  During negotiations, agreement was reached that stack heights
would be such that the C02 and CO levels will not exceed 7,000 and 2.0 mg/ma
as the average (24-hour) admissible concentrations, respectively, at the
ground levelI  The maximum admissible 30-minute concentrations would be 10,000
and 6.0 mg/m for C02 and CO, respectively. These limits are consistent with
the Government's guidelines and are satisfactory, especially since the
oiLfields are sparsely inhabited. At the Suplacu de Barcau in-situ combustion
project and the Videle/Balaria pilot tests, 50-meter stacks have kept the
concentration in the atmosphere of CO2 and CO gases (the main harmful
components of the produced gas) below these limits.  Additionally, equipment
to monitor the atmospheric concentrations of CD and C02 will be installed in
alL oil and gas separation facilities.  Becausa of the low gravity of the
produced oil which contains 72-83% of fuel oil, atmospheric pollution due to
hydrocarbon fumes is expected to be negligible.
5.28     Surface installations where oil and cDmbustion gases are handled will
be provided with adequate alarm and fire-fighting facilities including foam-
spraying equipment. Since new wells will be cased and cemented to the surface
with heat-resistant cement and a competent cap rock is present throughout the
field, underground combustion presents no safety hazards until the fire front
reaches a producing well. In order to prevent any damage that may result when
the fire front reaches a production well and the fire and explosion hazards
resulting therefrom, the advance of the front will be continuously monitored
by periodic temperature surveys and cooling water will be circulated inside
the casing of the "hot" wells. This arrangement has proven to be adequate in
the past in both Suplacu de Barcau field and the Videle/Balaria pilots.

H. Project Risks
5.29     The Romanian petroleum industry has about twenty years of experience
in in-situ combustion gained through local research, international cooperation
(with IFP of France), pilot tests and large industrial applications.
Technical project parameters and proposed installations have been reviewed by
reputable independent consultants (AOSTRA/ROMCONSULT) and found to be
adequate. The in-situ combustion process is an established recovery method
with an estimated 46 projects presently under implementation outside
centrally-planned countries yielding between 15,000 to 25,000 Bbls/day. In
view of the qualified staff available to, the strict delineation of
responsibility between, and past local and international experience of the
organizations to be involved in the design, construction and operation of the
Project, the risk of errors in design and/or operation is minimal. However,
in the past, administrative and annual plan rigidities in the Romanian system
have caused serious delays in the deliveries of tubular materials, motors,
drill bits, tires and oilfield chemicals in some petroleum projects despite
the strong emphasis placed by the Government on projects designed to increase
oil production. The recently established high level inter-ministerial
committee (para. 5.14) is expected to reduce the risks of delays due to these
factors.
5.30     There are also technical risks involved in the extrapolation of
confined pilot test results to a field of the size of Videle/Balaria covering
a total surface area of some 80 km2.  These risk elements derive from the
nature of petroleum reservoirs which are invariably heterogenous and exist to
a certain extent in all petroleum development and EOR schemes. As a result of
reservoir heterogeneity which introduces uncertainties in the prediction of
operat:ing results as well as some possible damage to wells, additional wells
may have to be drilled to improve volumetric sweep efficiency or else final
oil recovery may be less. Such additional wells would also mean higher air
compression requirements than predicted. The extreme case would be an
additional 10% to 20% of wells (instead of the expected 5% to 10%) and a four
percentage point drop in ultimate oil recovery to 35% instead of the assumed
39%. To partly account for these eventualities, physical contingencies of 15%
and 10% were applied to air compression facilities and wells,
respectively-!  Additionally, an adequate monitoring program has been
incorporated in the Project design to ensure that the in-situ combustion
process is fully controlled and field results are incorporated in the planning
of su1bsequent phases. Given the design features included in the Project, the
agreements reached during negotiations on the technical aspects, the extensive
practical experience of the Romanians with the process including pilot tests
at the Project site and the generally high level of technical competence of
the Romanian engineers and technicians who would be involved in the Project,
the technical risks are small for a project of this type and are acceptable.
1/ Romanian experience in Suplacu de Barcau field indicates that a 5% to 7%
contingency for wells is sufficient to cover most cases.

I. Reporting Requirements
5.31     During negotiations, the Romanians also agreed that the Bank will
receive from the Investment Bank quarterly progress reports until all
procurement packages have been awarded, and afterwards, semi-annual progress
reports. All reports will be submitted within 45 days after the end of the
relevant period. The contents and format of the progress report have been
agreed upon during Appraisal and was reconfirmEd during negotiations.
VI. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Scope of Financial Analysis
6.01     The financial analysis focuses on: (i) the effect of the Project on
the Videle Enterprise's and on TPB's productior cost structure; (ii) the
implications of the Government's minimum benefit rate (i.e., profitability)
policy on TPB's crude oil producer prices; and (iii) the ability of TPB to
self-finance a significant proportion of its irvestment program from internally
generated funds during 1982 through 1987, one year after Project completion.
Starting in 1987, recurrent annual capital expenditures (Annex 6.1) of about LET
316 million (US$21.1 million) in constant 1981 terms would be required to sustain
the Project's incremental output level of 731,000 tpy (para. 5.09). In making a
comparative evaluation of future production costs, prices and financial
performance of TPB with the Project, it should be borne in mind that TPB does not
pay royalties nor income taxes and that its financial structure reflects a very
low proportion of both short and long-term debt (less than 15% of total assets),
throughout the forecast period, conditions markedly different when compared to
analagous petroleum investments in market econcmies.
B. Revenue and Operating Cost Estimates
6.02     TPB's total oil production, even with the Project and the other
investments planned during 1982-86 for its other oil fields, is expected to peak
at 2.5 million tons in 1986 and gradually decrease by about 0.1 million tpy
thereafter. This projected peak production would still be less than the 5 million
tons produced in 1976 and 3 million tons produced in 1981. With the Project, the
Videle and Balaria oil fields will account for about 38% of TPB's crude oil output
by 1986 compared to about 15% in 1981.
6.03     The specific assumptions in regard to TPB's selling prices and production
costs, are shown in Annex 6.2. The main assumption is that TPB's crude oil
selling price will be adjusted annually so that it will earn profits equivalent to
about 7.5% of its oil extraction operating costs each year in line with Government
policy. Given that the revenues from the non-oil activities of the Trust cover
only about 95% of the corresponding costs (para. 4.09), this price assumption
would mean that TPB's profit would range between 4% and 6% of its total
revenues. The unit cost of operating inputs, with the exception of diesel fuel
and labor, are assumed to increase in line with the projected escalation rates for
industrial wholesale prices. For the low grade diesel fuel used by TPB, the
domestic price by 1983 is assumed to reach 75% of the present border price, and
thereafter, increase at the same annual rates as industrial wholesale prices.
Labor costs are assumed to rise by 11.4% in 1982 and 7% per year thereafter. The
projected 1986 production cost structure of TPB and of the Videle Enterprise, with
as well as without the Project, are shown in Annexes 6.3 and 6.4 respectively.
The production cost structure of TPB is summarized below.

b/ At historical costs.
6.04     TPB's unit production cost by 1986 is expected to increase substan-
tially over the 1981 level, with or without the Project. However, with the
Project, the increase in unit production cost between 1981 and 1986 is slightly
less. The large increase in the Trust's unit production cost without the Project
is due to increasingly unfavorable operating conditions and declining production
under the existing primary and secondary oil recovery methods in almost all its
oil fields which have passed their peak productive years. Thus, without the
Project, both variable and unit fixed production costs would increase. On the
other hand, with the Project, the expected variable cost in 1986 would be less
than that in 1981. The increase in total unit production cost with the Project
is due exclusively to the higher depreciation charges resulting from its large
capital investments. The financial benefits of the Project therefore are derived
from two factors - the slightly lower unit production cost and the higher crude
oil output as compared to the case without the Project. Similarly, the Videle
Enterprise's unit production cost in 1986 would increase in real terms by about
33% above the 1981 level without the Project, but only increase 32% with the
Project. However, if the unit costs of energy inputs (i.e., power and fuels),
increase in real terms between 1981 and 1986 beyond the small increase in diesel
fuel assumed herein, then the financial benefits from the Project becomes
significant compared to the case without the project. Given that the domestic
power and fuel prices to industry are presently very much less than the prices to
private consumers as well as the international prices, it is likely that the
costs of energy inputs for TPB will increase much more than assumed in the
forecast, thereby making the financial benefits with the Project much greater
than indicated in the present forecasts.

e/  Internal cash generation less debt service and benefit distribution as a percentage of

6.06     The financial forecasts indicate that under the present profitability
policy of the Government, TPB's crude oil selling price needs to be increased,
from the 1981 level of LEI 483 per ton to a 1986 level of LEI 847 per ton in
current terms, or a cumulative 75% over 5 years. In real terms, the price
increase between 1981 and 1986 would be about 31%. On the other hand, TPB's
unit production cost would increase by 77% in zurrent terms (32% in real terms)
during the same period. But TPB's assumed 1985 crude oil selling price would
still be less than one-fifth the imported pricsa of similar quality crude oil.
However, in comparing TPB's selling price to the international price of crude
oil, it should be noted that royalties and income taxes generally account for
anywhere from 40% to 70% of the international zrude oil price; and as mentioned
earlier, TPB does not pay royalties or income taxes. While the annual benefits



- 48 -
as a percentage of assets employed (at historical costs 1/) is low at only 1%
to 2%, the proportion of self-financing of investments is satisfactory, at 30%
or more every year. As mentioned earlier, it is the Government's policy that
the oil extraction trusts earn some minimum benefit rate and assume more
responsibility for financing their investment program. This policy, while
perhaps not fully satisfactory in that it does not focus on the return on
capital, is in the right direction and during negotiations, agreement was
obtained that the Government will take all actions to enable TPB to earn
reasonable annual benefits (as defined by Profit Law No. 29 of December 1978)
in relation to total revenues; and furthermore, that the sum of the expected
benefits, depreciation and reserve discovery charges for the coming year,
shc,uld cover the estimated long-term debt service payments for the year, as
well as finance a significant proportion of the Trust's investment program for
the coming year. A self-financing proportion of at least 30% would be
considered reasonable as noted in the minutes of negotiations.
6.07     As discussed in Chapter III, Romania is relying on enhanced oil
recovery, offshore exploration and development as well as deep exploration and
development to prevent its crude oil production from declining further.  These
are all capital intensive activities and would increase the average crude oil
production cost in the country. The increase in TPB's production cost and
selling price discussed above is probably indicative of the order of magnitude
that could be expected for the increase in the petroleum industry's average
production cost and selling price by the second half of the decade.
6.08     The summary financing plan (sources and uses of funds) for TPB's
investments during 1982-1986 is shown below.

1/ The average domestic inflation rate in Romania has historically been low,
in the order of about 2% per year. Practically all of TPB's existing fixed
assets were supplied locally and a large proportion of oil field facilities
area depreciated over 10 to 12 years. Thus, the historical cost of fixed
assets will not be substantially out-of-line with their inflation adjusted
value. In the next few years however, inflation rates are expected to be
higher, perhaps 4% to 8% per year.

D. Auditing and Reporting
6.09     Romania has an elaborate audit system under which enterprises submit
periodic operational and financial reports to their Central, Ministry, the
Investment Bank, and other banks concerned. These reports serve to ensure
achievement of Plan targets and proper use of f'unds. Though the contents and
presentation of these reports differ from those normally received by the Bank,
it has been possible to adjust them to provide sufficient information for the
Bank to adequately monitor the progress of project implementation and
operations. Agreement was obtained during negotiations that the Bank will
receive from the Investment Bank regular project progress reports (para. 5.31)
prepared by TPB as well as the Trust's annual f'inancial statements in a form
satisfactory to the Bank and, within six months after the end of each year,
copies of annual audited financial reports of TPB and the Investment Bank
prepared by the Ministry of Finance.
E. Insurance
6.10     Normal business risks are not insured with outside insurers in
Romania. The Government acts as its own insurEr supporting enterprises which
suffer major losses arising from events beyond their control. Where normal
budget provisions are not adequate to meet the cost of replacement of major
assets arising from such events, specific provision is made in the next State
Budget. In addition, enterprises set aside a small share of benefits to cover
minor losses or damage to property from unforeseen events. These arrangements
are satisfactory. The loan agreement includes the Bank's standard covenant
for the insurance of the imported goods to be f'inanced out of the proceeds of
the loan against hazards incident to the acquisition, transportation and
delivery thereof from the place of importation into the territory of Romania.
VII. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
7.01     The present five-year investment plan in the petroleum sector
provides for substantive investment in enhancec oil recovery to meet future
domestic requirements including some 18 pilot End industrial scale tertiary
recovery operations in different reservoirs. With Romania's import deficit
widening and limited possibilities for further significant reductions in oil
consumption without seriously slowing economic growth, all of the EOR
investments appear prima facie to be economic. Because of the time required
to generate additional subsurface reservoir data, it is not possible to
determine precisely the optimum sequence of the several EOR investments. It
is clear, however, that large investment in EOE. projects will be needed to
meet future domestic supplies; the only alterncstives, deep exploratory
drilling and offshore exploration and development, have not yet established
production potential and involve a high technical risk. Among the tertiary
recovery investments, the proposed Videle/Balaria EOR Project is the most
advanced in terms of project preparation and is the largest. It has both a
satisfactory rate of return and an acceptable technical risk. As such, it
constitutes the most important component of the tertiary oil recovery program
envisaged in Romania's current Five-Year Plan.



- 50 -
A. Economic Costs and Benefits
7.02     The economic analysis of the Project is done on an incremental cost
and benefit basis, by comparing the cases with and without the Project. All
costs and prices are in constant mid-1981 terms, calculated in terms of border
values using the official exchange rate of LEI 15 per US dollar. The basic
assumptions underlying the economic analysis and valuation of economic costs
and benefits are detailed in Annex 7.1.
7.03     In addition to the capital costs incurred under the Project,
recurrent capital expenditures of about US$24.6 million per year for
additional wells and for relocating/revamping surface installations as the
combustion front advances in the reservoirs are included in the analysis
beginning in 1987. The economic analysis assumes a 20-year production life
for the initial investment of the Project, based on the expected life of the
installed equipment, although the overall EOR program for Videle/Balaria is
expected to extend over an additional 20 to 25 years. Field operating costs
are based on technical coefficients of resources used by the Videle Enterprise
estilmated for 1986 when the Project reaches full incremental production.
While the investment cost of in-situ combustion is rather high, the
incremental operating cost for the Project alone is very low, about US$4.6 per
ton of crude produced (US$4.2 for the variable cost portion), as compared with
the Videle Enterprise's present average variable cost of US$16.5 per ton of
crude produced and expected 1986 cost without the Project of US$22.5 per ton
(US$14.3 with the Project). This operating cost savings reflects the relative
efficiency of the in-situ combustion process in the Videle/Balaria field over
present techniques, while the cost increase expected between 1981 and 1986
without the Project demonstrates the fast approaching technical and economic
limits of present recovery practices in these reservoirs.
7.04 The commissioning of a major portion of the surface facilities is
expected to be completed by mid-1984, and substantive incremental production
of crude oil from the Project (395,000 tons) is expected to begin in 1985,
reaching an average incremental production plateau of 731,000 tpy by 1986.
This corresponds to an ultimate recovery factor of about 39X of the initial
oil in place -- more than doubling the expected oil recovery from the
Videle/Balaria field and resulting in a total incremental production of 29.9
million tons over the full 40 to 50 years of the program. Without the
Project,the field's annual production would be expected to decline sharply
from an estimated level of 450,000 tons in 1981 to 35,000 tons by 2000; total
recovery of oil expected over the next 20 years under existing production
techniques would be about 3.2 million tons (16.7 million tons have been
produced to date). The Project is not expected to produce any natural gas of
commercial value. A constant price of US$221 per ton, or about US$33 per
barrel, is used in the economic analysis to value the crude production; this
reflects a discount of US$3 per barrel from Romania's average import cost
because of the heavy nature of the Project's crude oil.
B. Economic Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analyses
7.05     The Base Case cost and benefit streams, as well as the internal rate
of return and net present value calculations, are shown in Annex 7.2 and 7.3,
respectively. The Base Case economic rate of return of the Project is 29%.
The average incremental cost of producing crude oil from the Videle/Balaria



- 5 1 -
field under the Project is about US$90 per ton (based on discounting cost and
production streams at 9%).  This is on the low end of cost estimates based on
U.S. experience (US$110-170 per ton of crude produced), and compares very
favorably with Romania's average cost of oil imports of US$265 per ton in
1981. The net present value of the Project becomes positive by 1988, two
years after full incremental production is achieved, and reaches US$676
million at the end of 20 years of production.
7.06     Sensitivity tests were performed to evaluate the effects of possible
delays in Project completion, cost overruns, End production shortfalls as well
as the uncertainty of international petroleum prices . As demonstrated by the
table below and in Annex 7.4, the Project is sensitive to any one of these
occurrences and most particularly to production delays and capital cost
overruns because of the Project's high initial, investment cost.

2.   Ultimate Oil Recovery Down 10%                                 26%
(i.e., recovery of 35% of the initial oil in place)

8.   Best Case-Ultimate Oil Recovery Up 28%
& 3% Per Year Real Increase in
Oil Prices from 1985 to 2000                                40%
7.07     The risk of substantial delays in Project implementation and
subsequent production of oil cannot be ruled cut given past experience in
Romania whereby petroleum projects were plaguEd by shortcomings in deliveries
of critical materials and spares (para. 5.29). A one year delay in
production, coupled with a 22% increase in Project costs (capital - 20%;
operating - 40%), would reduce the rate of return to about 20%. There are
also a number of technical risks inherent in the full field operation of any
thermal EOR process due to the heterogeneous rnature of oil reservoirs and
potential damage to wells (para. 5.30). In tVe extreme case for this Project,
these could involve an unusually high proportion of additional wells (e.g.,
10-20%) and a lower ultimate oil recovery factor (e.g., by 4-5 percentage
points). The rate of return would still be about 22%. Compounding this with
a one year delay in production would reduce the return to about 18% (worst
case).
7.08 The sensitivity of the return points out: the essential need for good
project management to control capital costs ard avoid delays, and for good
operating practices particularly in the monitoring of the combustion process
and rapid adaptation of operations to the dynamic behavior of reservoirs under
the influence of combustion fronts.  The precautions incorporated into the
Project design in terms of monitoring facilities and practices, the generally

high level of technical competence of the Romanian engineers and technicians,
and ltheir extensive practical experience with the in-situ combustion process
shouLd all contribute to minimize the Project risks. The recently established
high level inter-ministerial committee which follows the progress of all Bank-
financed projects should further help facilitate Project implementation.
7.09 If the results to date in the Suplacu de Barcau field (50% ultimate
recovery of initial oil in place) are also achieved in the Videle/Balaria
field, the rate of return would increase to 37%; combining this with a 3% per
year real increase in the price of oil to the year 2000 (when the typical
crude oil price would reach about US$55/barrel which is presently considered
to be an economic limit), would bring the rate of return to 40% (best case).
The sensitivity tests thus confirm that in the worst of circumstances assumed
here, the economic rate of return would still be about 18%, and in the best
case, could be on the order of 40%.
VIII. RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01     The following major agreements and assurances from the Government and
the Investment Bank were obtained during negotiations.
(i)     TPB will log and core key wells and correlate the old and
the new wells using technology and equipment agreed with
the Bank (para. 5.10);
(ii)    The Government will complete the financing plan for the
Project (para. 5.19);
(iii)   IB will ensure that the proceeds of the loan will be used
exclusively for the Project (para. 5.21);
(iv)    TPB and ICPPG will ensure that the concentration of harmful
gases in the Project area will not exceed agreed limits
(para. 5.27);
(v)     The Government will enable TPB to earn reasonable benefit
rates and finance a satisfactory proportion of its invest-
ments from internally generated funds (para. 6.06); and
(vi)    TPB and IB will provide the Bank regular progress reports
and financial reports according to agreed content and
frequency (paras. 5.31 and 6.09).
8.02       On the basis of the major agreements listed above and the
conclusions of this appraisal report, the Project is suitable for a Bank loan
of US$101.5 million equivalent to IB at the Bank's standard lending rate with
a maturity of 15 years including a grace period of 3 years. The loan would be
guaranteed by the Socialist Republic of Romania.

ROMANIA: VIDELE/BALARIA ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY PROJECT
ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY (EDR)
1.        Oil reservoirs are initially produced using their latent energy in the
form of oil, gas and water expansion and reservoir rock compaction. Depending on
reservoir properties, the final oil recovery obtainable by this technique (primary
recovery) may be as high as 45% of the oil initiaLly in place (OIIP). However,
in most cases it is rather low, being on the orde:- of 15%-30%.
2.        In most reservoirs the ultimate oil recovery can be increased by the
use of- the so-called enhanced oil recovery techniques (EOR).  EOR techniques
essentially consist of introducing extraneous ene:-gy into oil reservoirs in order
to extract more of the oil in place.  The simplesi: and oldest EOR techniques are
waterflooding and gas injection (secondary recovery) in which additional energy is
introduced into the reservoir inthe form of injecl:ed water and gas, respectively.
Being the least expensive EOR techniques, water and gas injection are usually the
first to be considered towards the end of the primary producing life of an oil
reservoir. The additional oil production from these simple and inexpensive
secondary oil recovery techniques would range frort 5% to 20% of the OIIP.
3.        The ultimate recovery of oil can be further increased by the application
of more advanced EOR techniques designed either to improve the performance of water
and gas injection where they are applicable or to supplant them where they are not
applicable, such as heavy oil reservoirs. As such they can be classified as both
secondary (coming immediately after primary) and tertiary (coming after secondary)
recovery mechanisms. Advanced EOR methods which a.re generally accepted as proven
by the petroleum industry can be divided into three groups: (i) improved water-
flooding, (ii) miscible displacement and (iii) thermal oil recovery. In improved
waterflooding the efficiency of oil displacement by the injected water is enhanced
by the injection of chemicals (surfactants), viscous solutions (polymers) or micro-
emulsions of oil and water (micellar solutions) to achieve higher oil recovery.
Miscible displacement achieves the same goal by injecting into the reservoir sub-
stances that are miscible in both the displaced oil and the displacing fluid,
normally a gas. Carbon dioxide, high-pressure natural gas, enriched natural gas,
LPG and solvents are the most widely used miscibility agents. In thermal EOR
techniques, extraneous energy is introduced into the reservoir as heat in the
form of either surface-generated steam (cyclic or continuous steam injection)
or high-pressure air which burns part of the reservoir oil (in-situ combustion).
4.        Although they are rather simple in concept, advanced EOR techniques in-
volve many physical and chemical phenomena which are not yet well understood; have
widely differing conditions of applicability; are expensive and difficult to imple-
ment and monitor; and require extensive pilot-scale testing before full-scale field
application.

ANNEX 6.2
Page I of 2
ROMANIA: VIDELE/BALARIA ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY PROJECT
PRICE ASSUMPTIONS FOR FINANCIAL FORECASTS
1.       Under the current Five-Year Plan, the petroleum industry is supposed
to earn a five-year average benefit (i.e. profit) of at least 7.5% over its
costs for oil-extraction activities. On the other hand, the service
activities of the petroleum trusts are expected to cover just about 95% of
their costs reflecting additional employee benefits. Thus, the overall
benefit rate of the individual trusts during t:he Plan period is expected to be
somewhat lower - roughly ranging from 4% to 6,' of total revenues. The
individual producer prices for crude oil will be adjusted regularly to reflect
changes in operating costs and production levels. In the financial forecasts,
it has been assumed that TPB's selling price ior crude oil will be adjusted
annually so that the Trust will earn an average benefit rate of about 7.5%
above its oil production costs each year. The selling price for TPB's
associated natural gas and associated natural gasoline are assumed to rise in
line with the projected industrial (wholesale) price increases in the country
during the forecast period. Natural gas and gasoline account for less than 2%
of the Trust's total revenues and assumptions about the price trends for these
two commodities are not crucial to TPB's projected financial situation. The
industrial price escalation rates are projected as follows: 5.5% in 1982, 9.5%
in 1983, 5.5% in 1984, 5% in 1985, and 4.5% per year for 1986 and 1987.
2.       The current Five-Year Plan provides :'or an average cumulative
increase, from 1980 through 1985 of about 32% for wages (5.7% per year). The
financial forecasts, however, assume a slightLy higher increase in waris and
some producer prices from 1981 through 1986.  Wages and related costs-  are
assumed to increase by about 11.4% in 1982 and 7% per year thereafter. The
cost of diesel fuel used by TPB is assumed to reach, in 1983, the equivalent
of about 75% of the present border price of similar grade diesel (the lower
grade diesel needed by TPB is priced at 90% of the standard grade diesel motor
fuel). Thereafter, the diesel price is assumed to increase in line with
irndustrial wholesale prices.
1/ Related costs include the 15% wage tax (ii lieu of a personal income tax)
and the 16.5% social security tax imposed on :he wage and wage tax together.

ROMANIA
Videle/Balaria Enhanced Oil Recovery Project
Assumptions Underlying Economic Analysis
1.       The economic analysis of the Project is done on an incremental cost and
benefit basis, by comparing the cases with and without the Project. All economic
costs and prices are in constant mid-1981 terms and are net of transfer taxes and
duties.
2.       A conservative 20-year production life after completion (i.e., 1987-
2006) has been assumed for the initial investment of the Project, based on the
expected life of the installed equipment (e.g., compressors), although the
overall EOR program for Videle/Balaria is expected to extend over an additional
20 to 25 years.
3.       The capital investment costs of the Project in economic terms are
identical to the estimated cost of the Project (including physical contingencies)
to the Government, with the addition of recurrent annual capital expenditures
beginning in 1987. That is, domestic prices of equipment and materials have been
adjusted, where necessary, to reflect the prevailing international prices of
their imported components, and the local components have been converted to border
prices using the official trading rate of LEI 15 per US dollar. Fuels and other
traded goods have been valued at international prices, while labor has been
valued at local prices and converted using the official trading rate. Having
reviewed the production capability of Romania in the area of oil field equipment
and materials, it is the judgement of the appraisal mission that even if the
majority of these goods were purchased locally, as is expected given the strong
desire of the local suppliers to earn foreign exchange and to price their bids
competitively, coupled with the 15% preference for domestic bids, their export
volumes would not be adversely affected. For example, in the case of one of the
major cost items, compressors, there is sufficient flexibility in the production
capacity of the manufacturer and export markets are limited (mostly Eastern
Europe), while in that of another, pipes, the needs of the project represent only
a small proportion of the country's potential production. On this basis, the
marginal cost of domestic supply of such equipment and materials is the
appropriate basis for calculating economic capital costs.
4.       The recurrent capital costs, amounting to about US$24.6 million per
year, are largely for additional wells (108 per year) and for relocating/
revamping surface installations as the combustion front advances in the
reservoirs; their economic valuation (i.e., cost to the Government) is shown in
Annex 6.1. For the purposes of the economic analysis, the recurrent capital
expenditures are taken as zero during the last four years of the assumed
productive life (i.e., 2003 to 2006) because the wells drilled through the
sixteenth year would be sufficient to maintain production through the twentieth
year.
5.       The value of the installed facilities and wells at the end of the
assumed Project life is conservatively estimated as only the scrap value (US$90
per ton) of the recoverable steel initially invested in equipment and structures.
6.       In addition to investments for fixed assets, the Project also requires
additional outlays of working capital for increasing stocks of maintenance

materials and spares, diesel fuel, chemicals, and other consumables. These have
been revalued in economic terms (i.e., the ccst to the Government), and are
assumed to be fully recovered at the twentieth year of production.
7.       The economic analysis is carried out using the incremental operating
costs estimated for the Videle Enterprise for 1986 (in constant 1981 terms) when
the Project reaches the full incremental production level of 731,000 tons of oil
per year; it is also tested with the Enterprise's average operating costs for
1986. These estimates were prepared by TPB in conjunction with ICPPG and the
Ministry of Petroleum in light of the present; technical coefficients and
operating expenses of the Videle Enterprise and of those experienced in the pilot
tests and industrial applications (Suplacu de Barcau) of the in-situ combustion
process. The unit operating costs of the Videle Enterprise in economic terms for
1981 and those estimated for 1986 with and without the Project are as follows:

Total Crude Production (1,000 tons)  1158.5  748.7        1479.7       731.0
The variable operating costs are based on mid-1981 prices, and technical
coefficients of labor, materials, and equipment used by the Enterprise in
effect in 1981 and estimated for 1986. A real increase averaging 2.4% per
year to 1987 is assumed for the price of lator according to the planned
increase in salaries in Romania. The economic cost of power is estimated as
3.5c/kWh, as compared to a financial cost of 2.5c/kWh to the Bolintin Trust in
1981. This estimate is based on the understanding that future investment in
electric power generation will be in coal/lignite-fired and hydropower plants,
and the role of oil and gas in power generation will be substantially
reduced. Moreover, the continued expansion of co-generation of thermal and
electric power should help to hold down the cost of electric power. For
chemicals and consumables, other cash costs, and the administration and
general portion of fixed costs, their local costs in 1981 prices were
converted to border prices using the trading rate and 1986 needs projection,
while maintenance materials and spares were adjusted to reflect international
prices for their imported components.

8.       Fuels used by the Project are valued at international prices in the
economic analysis. Petroleum product prices, namely gasoil (diesel fuel) and
fuel oil, are estimated as the bulk average prices for Rotterdam (FOB barges)
for 1981, since the Rotterdam spot market serves as the basis for fixing
prices on Romanian product export contracts (US$299 per ton of gasoil and
US$184 per ton of fuel oil in constant 1981 terms). This can be considered a
high estimate as an input price since the products are generally sold at a
small discount and when sold to agents rather than directly to countries, the
price is net of transport to Rotterdam (together amounting to a discount of
perhaps US$11-16 per ton). Natural gas used in field operations is priced in
fuel oil equivalent terms using the Rotterdam price, since the gas could
substitute for fuel oil in power plants and as fuel in industry.  This results
in a price of US$159 per 1,000 cubic meters (in constant 1981 terms) as
compared to a financial cost to the Trust of US$5.3. In line with the
assumption below concerning the crude oil price, fuel prices are assumed to
remain constant although the economic analysis is also tested assuming 3%
annual growth from 1985 to 2000 (when the world price of crude would have
reached US$55 per barrel, which is perceived to be an economic limit).
9.       The commissioning of a major portion of the surface facilities is
expected to be completed by mid-1984, and substantive incremental production
of crude oil from the project (395,000 tons) to begin in 1985, reaching an
average incremental production plateau of 731,000 tons per year by 1986. The
Project is not expected to produce any natural gas of commercial value; the
small quantity of associated gas dissolved in the produced oil will be flared
along with combustion gases.
10.      The average OPEC petroleum price (FOB) in 1981 was US$34.2 per barrel
and is expected to reach US$34.6 (in constant 1981 terms) by 1985, reflecting
a growth rate in real terms of only 0.3% per year. The Romanian Government
has estimated a 1981 import price of crude as US$265 per ton, or about US$36
per barrel (typical crudes contain about 7.4 barrels per ton), which is
somewhat higher than the average OPEC price. The crude oil from the Project,
however, is rather heavy (18-190 API, which corresponds to about 6.7 barrels
per ton), and as such its average product yield is higher in the less
valuable, heavy ends (about 75% as compared with 40% for more typical
crudes). Based on relative product yields, therefore, the economic value of
the Project's crude oil output was discounted by US$3 per barrel from the
average import price, and a border price of US$33 per barrel or US$221/ton was
used in the economic analysis. Both the discounted price level and the
assumption that it will remain constant are conservative.

with 1 year delay in production                                     18.3%
1/ Base Case: Details are given in Annex 7.1-7.3.
Capital Costs:   1982-1986  $371.0 million
1987-2002  $24.6 million/year
2006       $-5.1 million (salvage value)
Working capital: 1982-1986  $8.7 million
2006       $-8.7 million (recovered)
Unit operating costs: 1982-1985 variable
1986-2006 $4.6/ton of crude
Oil production:  1982-1985  variable
1986-2006  731,000 tons/year, corresponding
to ultimate recovery of 39% of initial
oil in place
Crude oil price: 1982-2006  $221/ton -- 0% annual real escalation
2/  Combining this with a fall in oil price to US$188/ton (down 15%) results in a rate of
return of 15.4%.
