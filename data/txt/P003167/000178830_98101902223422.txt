REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE
PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO ZAMBIA FOR THE
LUSAKA SQUATTER UPGRADING AND SITE AND SERVICES PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and reconmendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Zambia for the quivalent of US$20.0 million to help
finance the cost of a squatter upgrading and site and services project in
Lusaka. The loan would have a term of 25 years, including 4Y/2 years of
grace, with interest at 71/4 percent per annum. About US$17.5 millior. of
the loan would be relent to the Lusaka City Council on the same terms and
conditions as the proposed Bank loan; the Government would bear the
exchange risk.
PART I: THE ECONOMY
2.        The last Economic Report on Zambia (Report No. 4-ZA) was issued on
December 26, 1972. An updating mission visited Zambia 'n October-November
1973.  The most recent economic lata are summarized in Annex I.
3.        The economy is characterized by a distinct dualism between the
large modern sector and the rural 6ubsistence economy. Almost half the
population of 4.5 million is involved in the modern sector; the remainder
depend for their livelihood on small-scale traditional agriculture. The
average per capita national income in 1971 was estimated at $100 in the
traditional sector while the figure for the modern sector is over $650.
There are approximately 400,000 in wage employment, which has been growing
at about 3 percent per annum in recent years. Population growth is estimated
at 2.5 percent per annum.
4.        The shortage of trained citizens to man the economy has been a
critical constraint to development. At Independence (1964) there were only
about 100 citizens who were university graduates and l,nOO possessing
secondary school level certificates. Since then remarkable progress has been
made in expanding education at all levels. At present there are over 800
Zambian university graduates and the annual output from the secondary schools
has risen to over 6,000. In recent years the Government has placed special
emphasis on expanding vocational and technical training.
5.        The modern sector is dominated by the copper industry, which con-
tributes nearly 40 percent of GDP and 95 percent of exports. Thus the world
copper price has a large and pervasive effect on the economy.   Unfortunatelys
the copper price is notoriously unstable and the Government has inadequate
means of insulating the economy from t-_e fluctuations of the copper market.
In recent months, Zambia has benefitt--c from the record copper prices result-
ing in a dramatic improvement in the country's financial and foreigrn exchange






position. However, it is essenCial to view the present exceptional situation
in a longer term perspective. Economic trends between 1970-73 were in sharp
contrast with those in the preceeding years, as well as current trends.
6.        Between 1964 and 1969, :; ro~;s  gztlonal income at constant prices
grew on the average by almcs: 1   pe Sent a year.   MIore than half of this
increase, however, resulted from. t`e -:rm-rovem ent in terms of trade.  ThEtn,
as now, the sharp increase 4n ,th ~c r.d cooper price had placed Zambia 1n
a strong financial position,   The cer.ermn _s budget and the balance of
payrients produced growing surnlusas.  In   he course of 1970, however, the
period of rapidly rising   nCormene  £nded owing to a combination of unfavorable
factors.  The two most important factors were the sharn decline in the copper
price in the second half of 1970 from US$1680 to US$1090 a ton and the flood-
ing of the Mufulira mine ir. SeDtembet. 1970 which accounted for 25 percent
of Zambia's copper output- T7.e :,a'h±no   resault of lower copper prices and
production losses was a fall .'.r; ,hn value of copper output of 40 percent
between 1969 and 1971 and a fail in gross national income per capita from
US$425 to about US$355 over tile sarme period; with little recovery in 1972
and 1973. Although the price of copner improved markedly in the second half
of 1973, sales fell below tha nroject' ed level due to a combination of produc-
tion problems and transport bottlenLc'Ks.
7.        The decline in the value o'f coppper sales between 1970 and 1972
had a st-rong adverse affect on the budgetary situation, national savings and
the balance of payments.   Jhe deterioration in the budgetary situation was
cmpounded by two additional factors: first, recurrent expenditures had
been allowed to increase sharply and second, government revenue from the
mining sector declined becat!se of new capital depreciation allowances granted
as an incentive to boost sfurther investment. Consequently, the Government's
recurrent budget which in 1970 still h.ae    surplus of US$246 million -- more
than enough to finance all developmente zxenditure -- showed deficits of
US$25 million in 1971 and USh76 m4llion i 1972.     At the same time private
savings were also adversely affected and their domestic availability further
reduced by the mountIng probler, of reia.iti flight since 1969. In 1973,
partly as a resu.t of improved .copre- prices and partly owing to severe aus-
terity measures, the recurrent- buAdgat li.coved a small surplus of approximately
IVS$37 million.
C..       Net foreign reserves deelIned from a peak of US$605 million in
August 1970, to US$131 mi,lion Ty ecenber 1973 (equal to two months imports).
This sharp decline cannot e.'r ri- >f _xpained bv the unfavorable develop-
ment in the prices and otyrtut o;       arr7 'by government's deficit financing
alone.  Part of the decline -:se to liegal and illegal capital exports.
'9.       The Government a.r       ttz  ,r:  'wo years taken steps to restore the
financial balance.   t          .    .      cf   ay-ents, imports of certain
luxury goods and Consumer             irocr  . e.ilso produced locally were prohibited,






-3-
and a surtax on dutiable imports was introduced. Exchange control regulations
were tightened, including measures to curb capital flight. To improve the
budgetary situation, new tax measures were introduced in the 1972 and 1973
budgets. Austere spending policies kept the increase in recurrent expenditure
down to 4 percent in 1972 and 6 percent in 1973. The underlying positive
trend in the balance of payments occuring over the past twelve months has
been obscured by the Government's decision to repay bonds that had been con-
tracted in 1969 in payment for the acquisition of a majority shareholding in
the two major mining groups.  The repayment (US$239 million) was financed,
in part, from two Eurodollar loans totaling US$150 million.
10.       The closure of the Rhodesian border created a serious crisis, caus-
ing severe restrictions on imports and necessitating major expenditures on
expanding the capacity of alternative routes. Shortage of imports held back
investment and interfered with copper production. The value of total iiuports
fell slightly in 1973, and gross fixed capital formation is estimated to have
declined from US$525 million in 1972 to US$367 million in 1973. It is expected
that, as a result of the emergency measures taken over the past twelve months,
imports will rise substantially in 1974-75. The Tanzania-Zambia Railway which
is now being used to transport goods to the Zambian border should become
fully operational in 1975 and, provided the Lobito and Malawi routes remain
open, Zambia should have no problem obtaining all her essential import
requirements.
11.       Zambia's Second National Development Plan, 1972-76 (SNDP) envisaged
a total investment of US$3,000 million, of which approximately one-half was
to be undertaken by Central Government, one-eighth by public sector enter-
prises and the remainder by the private sector. The core of the SNDP was the
proposed investment of US$560 million in the expansion of copper production.
The targets set in the SNDP are now largely of historical interest. The
unanticipated fall in the price of copper and the emergency situation arising
from the closure of the Rhodesian border led to a reduction and distortion
in planned capital expenditure. The Government has commenced the preparation
of the Third National Development Plan (1977-81) which is scheduled for
publication in 1976.
12.        In brief, Zambia's primary objective is to sustain growth
while:  (i) correcting the rural-urban iibalance;   (ii) redistributing
income; and (iii) providing new employment opportunities. Zambia hopes
to achieve this objective by investments in (a) mining and the related
power sector to yield income for strengthening other sectors, (b) manu-
facturing industries to become less dependent on imports and to expand
employment opportunities,   (c) agricultural production and processing
industries to make Zambia self-sufficient in most foodstuffs, and
(d) rural development projects to benefit large numbers of rural poor.
The most difficult challenge is to raise the productivity of the large tradi-
tional agriculture sector.  Recognizing the need for a concentrated effort
to improve traditional agriculture1, the Government has decided on a strategy
of integrated rural development, which. has been successfully introduced in
some other African countries. The Government plans to start "Intensive



-4-
Development Zones" (IDZs) in two or three areas with sufficient potential,
and, if successful, subsequently increase their number. Attempts to increase
agricultural productivity will be accompanied by investments to improve the
quality of life in rural areas by providing, for example, community centers,
rural electrification, improved roads and water supplies, health facilities
and village industries.
13.       Although copper will remain for amny years Zambia's most important
economic asset, sustained long-term economic development depends on the
creation of a more diversified economic structure. To encourage diversifica-
tion, a number of important policy changes, particularly relating to prices
and incomes are required.
14.       The Government has recently boosted agricultural producer prices
but has yet to raise consumer prices so as to reduce the large subsidies
enjoyed by residents in the urban areas. It has put into effect the first
elements of a new incomes policy, which is designed not only to reduce the
great disparity between urban and rural incomes but also to obtain a greater
share of incomes generated by the mining industry for the development of
the rest of the economy. One of these elements is the measures, announced
in August 1973, designed to give the Government a firmer control of the
mining industry. As the new arrangements are still being negotiated, it is
too early to say to what extent they will enable the Government to increase
the contribution of mining to general economic development without affecting
detrimentally the production and efficiency of the mines. Another element
of the new incomes policy relates to wages and salaries paid to Zambian
workers. The manifesto which was recently adopted by the Central Committee
of the ruling party announced the introduction of a "Zambian wage structure".
This would separate the wages paid to Zambians from those paid to expatriates
so that the wage basic levels in the economy could reflect more truly the
economic conditions in Zambia rather than the conditions on the international
labor market for the supply and demand of highly skilled expatriates.
15.       Zambia's financial position over the past year has improved sub-
stantially with the marked upswing in copper prices. Average copper prices
in 1973 were about 50 percent higher than in 1972, and prices in 1974 are
forecast to increase further. The high copper price has increased the
Government's scope for noninflationary domestic borrowing by tapping part
of the excess liquidity created by the external surplus. For 1974, the
bLngetary position should improve further and domestic revenues may once
again be used to finance a substantial part of government investment. In
view of this prospect, Bank lending would be mainly related to foreign costs
of projects but some local cost fir=ncing may be justified for projects in
the social and agriculture sectors where the foreign exchange component is
very small.  Budgetary savings, together with disbursements from foreign
loans, should cover the financial needs of the Government and there would
be no need for deficit financing.
16.       Over the past year5, the Covernment has actively sought foreign assis-
tance for the public-sector investment program. At the same time, it stepped
up borrowing from commercial sources. Because of its limited borrowing in



the past, Zambia's debt service obligations are low. Thus, there is considerable
scope for further borrowing abroad on conventional terms. To achieve a 5%
growth rate Zambia's foreign borrowing will hare to increase gradually from
US$120 million in 1974 to US$250 million p.a. in 1980 and to US$300 million
p.a. in 1985. The debt service ratio would grow from 3.9% in 1974 to 4.5%
in 1985, assuming that exports grow at 5% p.a. in real terms, that copper
prices will increase at the same rate as international prices generally,
and that approximately two-thirds of the borrowing is on commercial terms
(10% p.a. repayable over 10 years), and the remainder on IBRD terms. The
Government recognizes the need to plan external borrowing to reduce as far
as possible the effect of short-term fluctuations in the copper price on
the balance of payments and the development budget.
PART II: BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
17.        The Bank has made sixteen loans to Zambia and the IFC has
two investments there. Four loans were made for railways and electric
power before Zambia became independent and are guaranteed by the UK as
well as Zambia. Since Independence, four loans have been made for agri-
cultural development, three for education, two for highways, and two
for power. Total lending to date has been US$339.1 million
(net of cancellations), of which US$198.9 million is for electric power,
US$47.2 million for transportation, US$55.7 million for education, and US$24.8
million for agriculture. Six loans are fully disbursed and the first loan
made in 1953 (No. 74-RN), was repaid in full in February 1972. The IFC made
its first investment in Zambia in February 1972, providing US$1.1 million for
expansion of a shoe manufacturing company. A second IFC investment in the
same company, totalling US$1.2 million, was made in June 1973. As of December 31,
1972, the Bank's share in Zambia's total debt (disbursed and undisbursed) was
16 percent, while the Bank's share in Zambia's total debt service payments in
1973 was 12 percent. Present projections indicate that the Bank's share in
Zambia's debt would increase to about 29 percent in 1980, while the Bank's
share in Zambia's debt service would increase to about 38 percent in 1980.
Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans and IFC investments as of
May 31, 1974, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
18.       Progress on Bank operations in Zambia has been adversely affected
by the difficulties Zambia has faced over the past decade. The Unilateral
Declaration of Independence in Southern Rhodesia in 1965 led Zambia to
sever her close economic ties with Southern Rhodesia at a considerable cost,
disrupting the development program. Shortage of skilled manpower has inter-
fered with progress on some projects, while recent cost escalations have
caused difficulties on others, especially the Kariba North Project. Finally,
the sharp fall in copper prices in 1971 and 1972 forced the Government to
rephase capital expenditures on several programs; this affected the Bank's
first education project. The Zambia-Rhodesia border closure created an addi-
tional financial burden, but has not, however, caused significant delays to
Bank-financed projects. Substantial assistance was provided by various bila-
teral sources to help Zambia meet this emergency. To help maintain Zambia's
development effort in the face of these financial problems, the Bank made



available in June 1973 a US$30 million program loar.. However, the recent
improvement in Zambia's financial position, caused primarily by tne increase
in copper prices over the past year, diminished the need for part of this
loan. in 1tiarch 197L, after discussions initiated by the Bank, the Govern-
ment requested the cancellation of -US$ 7.5 -121'on of the loan.
19.       We propose to continue assisting Zambia in achieving her develop-
ment objectives. A mixed farming project is presently being prepared and the
Bank is also assisting in formulating proposals for Intensive Development
Zones (IDZ). While still at the early planning stage, the Bank expects to
assist in the financing of these and other projects (e.g., forestry) in the
agricultural sector. Rapid drift of populaticn to the towns has given rise
to serious urban problems which cannot be ignored; the Bank has responded to
this need with the project presently being proposed for the provision of
serviced sites for self-help housing in Lusaka and for the upgrading of
squatter settlements. A project for telecommunications development is also
being prepared and a supplementary loan for the Kariba North Project
to help meet cost overruns will be presented to the Executive Directors at
the same time as the proposed operation.
PART III - THE URBAN SECTOR
20.       With the exception of South Africa, Zambia is the most urbanized
nation in Africa south of the Sahara and is rapidly becoming an urban rather
than a rural society.   The urban population grew at about 10 percent per annum
during the period 1963-69, and is expected to continue growing at aoout 7
percent per annum through 1978. The urban population presently comprises
about one-third of the total population -- 1.5 million people -- and is expected
to reach 40 percent by 1978.
21.       The growth of modern urban centers in Zambia was stimulated by
mining development early in the century and about 95 percent of Zambia's
urban population is concentrated in three cities and five municipalities in
the three line-of-rail provinces (Copperbelt, Central, and Southern) extend-
ing from the Copperbelt towns of Ndola, Chingola, Kabwe, Kitwe, Luanshya,
and Mufulira in the north through the administrative capital of Lusaka and
the central agricultural areas to the southern town of Livingstone.
22.       Rural poverty and the expectation of higher earnings are causing
many Zambians to move to the urban areas. Rural per capita inlcoue is about
US$100. Subsistence agriculture has remained stagnant for maly years and
commercial agriculture is just recovering from the near collapse at inde-
pendence when white farmers left the country. Incomes of urban dwellers in
contrast average about US$650 and have been risinig rapidly. In addition
there has been net migration to the line-of-rail provinces, hsose proportion
of total population rose from 42 to 49 percent.   A further net migration
is anticipated bringing the population in those provinces to about 59 percent
of the nation in 1976.
23.       The urban areas initially developed as wlhite enclaves as exDatriate
workers arrived to manage the mines and administer the country, anid this has
had major consequences for their current developmenc. High quallty, low
density white housing areas are frequenitlv adjacent to cenitral buslnes and



-7-
industrial zones while low-cost, high density African areas are often located
on the periphery of the urban areas away frcm the economic activity. Squatter
settlements have proliferated rapidly with the influx of migrants from the
rural areas. The squatter population is now growing at 15 percent per annum
and the settlements currently house one-fifth of the total urban population --
over 55000 households.
2X.      JUrban unemployment in Zambia has been low.  Aval.aDLe aata suggest
that less than 10 percent of males over age 14 are unemployed, with lower
rates for heads of households. Moreover, African employment in the urban
based formal sector has risen at orer 6 percent per annum between 1961 and
1972, only slightly below the 7 percent rate of growth of the urban male
population. At the same time, wage employment in agriculture fell by some
12 percent. With continued urban growth and greater female participation in
the labor force, however, unemployment is likely to become a problem with
increasing reliance on self and casual employment.
a5.       Government at the local level in Zambia is administered by sixty-two
City, Municipal, Township, and Rural councils. The counciis consist of
elected members and one member appointed by the Central Government Mintctxy
of Local Government and Housing (MOLGH).   The mayor has traditionally been
elected by council from its own elected membership, although at present a
specific councilman cannot serve as mayor without the approval of the Ministry.
In the cities and municipalities, the council dictates policy while the
actual management of the town and its resources is carried out by the town's
oivil service staff. The councils provide a number of services such as water
supply, sewerage and roads, but the Central Government maintains responsibility
for education, electricity, public transport, police, communications, and
health. Moreover, the Central Government maintains strict control over
the amounts that councils can spend, for both current and capital needs,
and over the amounts of revenue which counciLs can collect. The purpose of
this control is: (a) to help maintain budgetary control at the national
level, (b) to help control inflation, and (a) to better control the allocation
of national resources.
Urban Development -and Housing PolicSy
26.       Although Zambian development policy since Independence has stressed
rural development, the Government has been fully aware of urban development
needs for infrastructure and shelter to promote the growth and expansion of
mining and industrial activity. The Government has also long recognized that
the number of housing units required could not be met by building expensive
conventional houses and has therefore been placing increasing emphasis on the
development of serviced plots. Whereas the First National Development Plan
(FNDP, 1966-1970) allocated only 30 percent of all housing investment for site
and services, the Second National Development Plan (SNDP, 1972-1976) establishec:
site and services development and squatter upgrading as the sole vehicles for
public housing investment.
27.       Since 1965, about 25,000 serviced piots have been completed, with
the cities of Lusaka (10,000), Ndola (5,200), Kitwe (3,500) and Chingola
(1,800) accounting for nearly 85 percent. In spite of thlis development,
however, over 55,000 households still live in unserviced squatter areas. The
SNDP estimates of urban growth over the 1972-1976 period indicate a total need



-8-
of approximately 859500 serviced plots (17,000 per year) to cope with popu-
lation increases. The Plan, however, made provision for only 70,000 plots to
be constructed with public support -- a reflection of budgetary constraints.
Planned expenditure for site and services, upgrading, and supporting services
(primary infrastructure and community facilities) was K90 million or K18
million per annum. Further unexpected financial constraints, imposed in the
ea-ly part of the program as a result of the Southern Rhodesian border closure
and low copper prices, has delayed implementation of the SNDP and only a
modest start has been made.
28.       During the early development of the urban areas, the mining
companies, Government, and other major employers provided housing with
attendant services for their employees. This resulted in relatively high
housing standards in urban areas and a belief that employers or local councils
have a responsibility for housing. Since Independence, how-ever, the Govern-
ment has sought to reduce public housing construction and encourage owner-
occupation of dwellings. Government grants and aids to the municipalities,
and therefore the level of direct subsidization of public housing, are being
progressively eliminated. Rents on public housing will therefore have to be
progressively increased, and the costs of site and services schemes will have
to be recovered from the beneficiaries. To provide assistance to those house-
holds with very low incomes, however, the Government has provided legislation
whereby low income private sector employees earning less than K40 per month
must be paid a housing allowance of K5.50 per month by their employers. The
Government is also widening the scope of low-cost residential development to
include fully serviced plots (with individual water supply and piped sewage)
as well as lower cost plots and squatter upgrading providing communal stand-
pipes and pit latrines.
29.       To date, however, Zambia's sqiatter upgrading and site and services
program has experienced a number of problems. Plot output has lagged behind
targets because of both financial constraints and the weak implementation
capacity of most local authorities-, and the timely provision of community
facilities (schools, public health centers and markets) has frequently been
neglected. Land tenure and collection arrangements have also been unsatis-
factory. Other problems include rising building standards and costs. The pro-
ject presently being proposed is an attempt to cope with some of these problem.
An urban sector report now being prepared in the Bank will address itself to
finding more comprehensive solutions.
`%'1ational Housing Authority
30.       The National Housing Authority (NHA), founded on March 4, 1971 and
placed under the authority of the Minister of Local Government and Housing,
performs a number of advisory, regulatory, and project execution functions
in the urban sector. These include advising on national housing policy,
building standards, and housing demand; approving building designs and plans
from any public or private eat:ity; planning improvement and redevelopment of
squatter areas; assisting loca' authorities in housing construction; and
providing town planning and consultancy services.  The Authority operates as
a state-owned corporation;, seekIng work on a contract baais with local govern-
ments, as well as an official advisor to MOLGH.



-9-
The Lusaka Situation
31.       Lusaka was founded as a railway siding in 1905, but grew steadily
in importance and became the capital of Zambia (then Northern Rhodesia) in
1931. It is presently the fastest growing city in Zambia; the population
tripled in the past decade to some 381,000 in 1973 -- an annual growth rate
of over 13 percent -- and is projected to ri3e to over 600,000 by 1980. The
city sprawls over a 360 km2 municipal area and divides into five major
districts: the central commercial/industrial area; the northwestern sector
consisting of mostly high density areas including some oG the major squatter
areas in the city; the southwest containing middle-class and squatter housing;
the southeast consisting of high-income housing areas and government offices;
and finally, the northeast, consisting of the high-income townships of Chelston
and Roma, the National Assembly, the University, and the airport.
32.       Lusaka has the most pressing squatter problem in Zambia.   During
the past decade, the Lusaka City Council (LCC) developed an average of 1,000
site and services plots per annum but about 3,000 new households were formed
annually. As a result, the proportion of the city's population living in
unserviced squatter areas rose from 16 percent to 42 percent. An additional
17,000 households or about 5,000 per annum will be formed during the con-
struction of the project presently being proposed, mostly among the low
income groups. Lusaka's shelter needs are therefore twofold: (1) to bring
infrastructure and services to squatter areas to consolidate existing self-
help housing investment, and (2) to provide sufficient planned serviced areas
to reduce the emergence of new squatter settlements.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
33.       A report entitled "Appraisal of the Lusaka Squatter Upgrading and
Site and Services Project"  (420a-ZA) is being circulated separately to the
Executive Directors. A Loan and Project Summary is provided in Annex III.
Background
34.       In 1972, the Government commenced discussions with the Bank and a
project preparation mission visited Lusaka in February 1973. Appraisal of
the project was completed in January 1974 and negotiations took place in
Washington in June, 1974. The delegation was led by Mr. A. J. Adamson,
Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Local Government and Housing, and included
Mr. N. M. Masemola, Town Clerk, Lusaka City Council* The Minister of Local
Government and Housing, Mr. P. Matoka, participated in some of the discussions.
The Project
35.       The proposed project comprises:
(a)  Squatter Upgrading:  servicing for 17,000 dwellings in four
major squatter settlements and the preparation and servicing
for 7,600 residential plots in three overspill areas   -- areas
located adjacent to major upgraded squatter settlements and



serviced to the same standard. The overspill areas would
be used for relocating households displaced by project works
in existing squatter areas and for new growth;
(b)  Site and Services:  preparat'on and servicing of 1,200 "basic"
and 3,200 "normal" plots in six sites (para 43);
(c)  Building 'Materials Loans:  financing of materials loans for
house imr.ovemenit/construction.  Project fundirg would be
provided as a supplement to other available sources of build-
ding finance at the level of KIOO (US$155) per plot in upgraded
srea,s, Y250 (US$4100) in overspill and basic site and services
areas, and K525 (US$815) in normal site and services areas --
amounts equal to the costs of at least a basic two room
expandable dwelling on the new plo:s;
(d) Primary Infrastructure: essential extensions of Lusaka's
water, sewerage, road, and garbage removal systems consistent
with a phased development program to serve project areas and
adjacent sites to be developed under the SNDP. Included
would be the installation of water distribution mains,
trunk and socondary sewers, pumping stations and stabilization
ponds;  the modification of pumpsets at a reservoir; construc-
tion of access roads; and purchase of garbage trucks and related
equipment;
(e) Community Facilities: construction and equipping of primary
schools providing 9,600 student places, multi-purpose com-
munity centers, health clinics, demonstration houses and
markets;
(f) Consultants' Services: project unit operations for the
execution period of 3-1/2 years; detailed engineering and
construction supervision; an organization and management
study of LCC; project preparation for future squatter up-
grading and site and services; and training of community
development workers; and
(g) Land: acquisition from private owners of about 800 ha of the
1,400 ha of land to be utilized by the project.
Project Execution
36.       The Lusaka City Council (LCC) would be responsible for the implemen-
tation of the major components of the project including:
(a)  supervision of engineering design, tendering, and construc-
tion;
(b) procurement of ecuipment ane materials for civil works;



- 11 -
(c)  organization of self-help labor for water main excavation,
development of community facilities, and house construction
and improvement;
(d) administration of the building materials loans scheme;
(e) participation in the plot allocation procedure and in the
grantinag of house title and occupancy licenses, and;
(f) coordination of the activities of other parties involved
in project execution.
37.       To perform the above fanctions, the Council has established a
Project Unit. The Unit would be headed by a Project Director who would be
assisted by a Deputy, and would be staffed with sufficient technical expertise
to implement the project, although it would maintain close liaison with
existing Council departments. The Unit would contain three sections, each
headed by a Section Chief: Finance and Procurement including an internal
audit division, Engineering, and Community Development, which would be respon-
sible for mobilizing and supervising self-help building activities. It has
been agreed(in the Project Agreement)that LCC would, by not later than
August 31, 1974, appoint a Project Director who is acceptable to the Bank;
the Deputy Projeot Director has already been appointed and the Section Chiefs
would be appointed not later than December 31, 1974. Community development
.staff would be either seconded from existing LCC staff or recruited.
Artisans for supervising self-help housing construction would be furnished
through volunteer agencies such as the German and nanish Volunteers who
have participated in similar schems in Zambia.
38.       The construction of the primary schools for the Ministry of Education
would be undertaken by the Third Education Project Unit (Loan 900ZA). Local
Ward Development Committees, composed of community representatives and chaire'e
by the local city councillor, would participate in plot allocation and the
mobilization of self-help labor. The Ministry of Labor and Social Services
would train community development-workers with the assistance of UNICFF and
the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC). Training programs include one
for basic community development and another for the reorientation of seconded
LCC community development staff for squatter upgrading.
39.       The Project Unit will report to the Council through the Finance
and General Purposes. Committee, which would oversee all matters relating
to the project at the city level, and to an Interagency Steering Committee
representing MOLGH, LCC, NHA, and other Ministries, which.would be created
to facilitate the coordination of project execution at the national level.
40.      All the public works in the upgrading areas and in the site and
services plots will be completed by the end of 1977. House improvement and
construction by participants is expected to occur through 1978, and there-
fore the building materials loans scheme will extend until that year. Upon



- 12 -
completion, the maintenance of water, sewerage, roads and some of the community
facilities would be undertaken by the City Engineer's Department while the
primary schools would be staffed, operated, and maintained by the Ministry of
Education, and health clinics by the Ministry of Health.
Project Standards
41.       The facilities to be provided in the upgrading and basic site and
services areas have been designed so that they could be progressively extended
or upgraded, but the initial standards would be kept at a level consistent
with the available resources of the prospective users.
42.       In the squatter upgrading and overspill areas, water would be
supplied through one standpipe for every 25 households and pit latrines
provided by the occupants would be used for sewerage. The only electric
service to be provided would be security lighting. Bitumenized access roads
and graveled internal roads would facilitate movement. The size of the
overspill plots would be 210m2, in accordance with typical land use patterns
and anticipated density characteristics of the upgraded areas. The cost per
plot is about US$200, making the overspill plots the least expensive now
provided in Zambia. This cost should be within the means of about 92 percent
of existing souatters.e
43.       In the site and services areas, the 1,200 "basic" plots would be
supplied water through one standpipe for every four households, whereas the
3,200 "normal" plots,would be provided with individual water connections.
The "basic" plots,like upgrading areas, would use pit latrines for sewerage
while the "normal" plots would be provided with individual waterborne connec-
tions. Roads and electric service standards would be similar to those in the
upgrading areas but plot size would be substantially larger at 324m2. This
plot size is considered large but is the smallest that local authorities are
permitted to develop under a Ministerial directive. The Government, however,
intends to review the experience in the project overspill areas; the plots to
be developed in such areas being substantially smaller than in the project site
and services areas. The results of this experience would be brought to the
attention of local authorities with a view towards further consideration of the
development of smaller plots in future site and services schemes. The cost per
basic plot is about $730 compared to $1,320 for normal plots with average sub-
soil conditions and $2,060 for normal plots with rocky soil conditions. About
..COO of the 4,400 site and services plots fit the latter category.
44.        The legal basis for registration of titles to dwellings and occupancy
tenure are contained within the pending housing (statutory and improvement areas)
legislation and subsidiary legislation. The legislation mould (a) enable the
establishment of tenure of at least 25 years in upgraded areas where none existed
before and increase the length of serviced plot leases from the current 10 to at
least 30 years;  (b) simpLify registration of land title and regularize plot
transfers and inheritance;  and (c) enable MOLGH to administer by regulation
specific terms of tenure and sais, and building standards in both typesof areas.
Passage of the legislation has been made a condition of effectiveness.



- 13 -
45.       Allocation of the site and services plots would be on a first-come-first-
served basis using the following criteria: (a) residency in Lusaka; (b) self
or wage employment wiih a monthly income of at least K20, and (c) intention
to live on the premises. Not less than 50 percent of the plots   would be
reserved for households with monthly incomes of less than K70 (US$109.0).
46-       The school component is in accordance with the educational sector
goal of correcting the relative oversupply of school places in the rural
areas compared to urban areas. Each school will have a classroom for practical
subjects which should encourage the implementation of a more practically
oriented curriculum -- another important SNDP goal. School buildings would
also be available for adult education and community purposes during evening
hours.
Project Costs and Financing
h7.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$41.2 million equi-
valent. The foreign exchange component is TJS$13.5 million, or about 33 percent
of total costs.  Of the total, $8.2 million is for preparation and servicing of
the upgrading and site and services areas, $9.1 million for building materials
loans, $4.7 million for primary infrastructure, $4.0 million for community faci-
lities, $5.6 million for technical assistance, $187,000 for land, and $9.4
million for contingencies (physical: $2.0 million; price: $7.4 million).
48.       Since the foreign exchange component of the project is small,
adequate support for the project and its institution would require some
local cost financing as well.  We are, therefore, proposing a Bank loan
of US$20.0 million which would finance about 48.5 percent of the total
costs of the project, representing the foreign exchange costs and about
US$6.5 million of the total costs. The Government would provide the
remaining US$21.2 million equivalent, including small contributions from
UNICEF and AFSC, and 600 ha of land. Part of the Government's contribution
would be used to finance the remaining 800 ha of land to be used in the
project.
49.       The Government proposes to hold the LCC responsible for the recovery
of about K23.2 million (US$36,1 million) of project costs through general
revenues (property taxes and local income tax), utility tariffs and monthly
payments from individual beneficiaries, although the Government would bear
the exchange risk. About 48.5 percent ($17.5 million equivalent) of this
amount would come from the proceeds of the proposed Bank loan and would be
on-lent to LCC on the same terms as the Bank loan while the remaining 51.5
percent ($18.6 milion equivalent) would be lent to ICC by the Government
on terms of 6.25 percent over 30 years, reflecting the average cost of the
Government's domestic borrowing.
Cost Recovery
50.       In accordance with current practice, the Government would bear the
costs of the schools, health clinics, training, and land. No charges would
be levied on the direct beneficiaries to recover these costs. The Insaka



City Council would repay the costs of certain community facilities, main
roads and street lighting, the organization and management study and part
of the project unit operations out of general revenues. Individual benefi-
ciaries in the upgrading and site and services areas -mould contribute to
general revenues through local income tax and nominal charges for property
rates and site management. In addition, individual beneficiaries would pay
current utility tariffs for water and sewerage sufficient to recover the
costs of site preparation and servicing on repayment terms of 7.5 percent
over 30 years. Loans for building materials would be repaid with interest
at 7.5 percent over 15 years. The charges, except for bailding materials,
would be set at a level that would allow for a 10 percent default in site
collections and would be approximately K2.75 (US$4.30) per month in the
upgrading and overspill areas, K5M60 (US$8.70) for the basic site and
services plots and either Kll.0 (1S$17.10) or K15.00 (US$23.30) for the
normal site and services plots depanding upon the site. The charges in
the upgrading areas and the basic site and services plots would be within
the means of approximately 80 - 90 percent of the households in the
project areas, While the charges in the normal site and services plots
would be within the means of approximately 45 - 55 percent of the house-
holds.
51.       Collection of charges would be made at income source for beneficiaries
in wage employment, and through ICC site offices for beneficiaries who are
self-employed. Since site and services schemes in Zambia have experienced
continuing problems with payment arrears, the Government has amended the
Rent Act of 1972 restoring local councils' authority to evict tenants for
default.
52.       Based on projected revenues and assuidng a 10 percent default rate,
it is expected that Insaka City Council will be able to meet debt service and
project operating costs while generating a net surplus from project operations.
If defaulat of about 20 percent were experienced, there would be a small deficit
in the early years turning into a surplus by 1981. However, even with a 30
percent default rate, the net deficit from project operations would probably
represent only 9 percent and 3 percent of ICC net revenue surpluses without
the project in 1978 and 1981 respectively, and therefore the project is not
likely to be a serious burden on WCC finances. Nevertheless, since project
viability is dependent upon the soundness of fliture LCC financial management,
the Government intends to vet LCC proposals for capital investment and
additional borrowing through 1980 in accordance with criteria discussed With
the Bank. Furthermore, it has been agreed(in the Project Agreement)that
LCC accounts would be audited by an independent auditor. Sabstantial scope
exists for additional revenue from property taxes and, since a revaluation
is planned in 1975, it has been agreed that a new valuation roll would be
implemented rno later than January 1, 19770 LCC utility operations also need
strengthening and, in this regards, a water distribution and wastage study is
presently being undertaken. Moreover, it has been agreed that LCC would:
(a) also undertake a water source, m4anagement, and tariff study;  (b) consult
with the Bank after the studtr -s completed and before constracting the third
stage of the KaIae water supply scleeRe; anid (c) on tne basis of the above
studies and in consultation with. .he Bank, review tariffs and prepare a
water management program including metering and ataff training. The proposed
tariffs and management program would thern be putt Into effect and instituted,
respectively,no later than June 30, 1976. LC(1i alao plans to put into effect



- 15 -
a new sewerage tariff effective July 1, 1974. The tariff increase ranges
from 20 - 30 percent. A further review is anticipated in another 2 - 3 years.
Procurement and Disbursement
53.        Civil works valued at US$7.6 million, or 18 percent of total project
costs, would be contracted by the Project Unit on the basis of international
competitive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines.  Lesser works totalling
US$4.7 million consisting of small infrastructure works, structural elements of
primary schools, and other community facilities would be procured on the basis
of locally advertised competitive bidding in accordance with existing ICC pro-
curement procedures. Civil works valued at US$3.9 million would be executed
through self-help labor. Materials and equipment valued at US$6.8 million
would be procured on the basis of international competitive bidding while
other various items of materials equipment, and vehicles valued at US$5.8
million would be procured on the basis of locally advertised competitive
bidding.
54.        The Bank would disburse 60 percent against the total costs of civil
works by contractors, 100 percent of foreign costs or 60 percent of local expen-
ditures for equipment, building materials, and vehicles; and 60 percent of local
expenditures for consultant services and Project Unit operations. Included in
the latter would be retroactive financing not exceeding US$500,000 on account
of expenditures incurred after March 1, 1974 -- $250,000 for Project Unit
operations and $250,000 for detailed engineering of primary infrastructure and
community facilities, and construction supervision.   The retroactive financing
has been included in order to speed the preparation for project implementation,
such as the recruitment of staff and the training of community development workers.
Justification and Economic Benefits
55.       The project would provide an early improvement in the social environ-
ment and public health conditions of most of Lusaka's large low-income squatter
population. The project would also strengthen institutional arrangements for
squatter upgrading and site and services in the country as a whole. In general,
the project would have a substantive influence on Zambia's low-income resi-
dential development policies and planning, for it would encourage the Govern-
ment to: (a) make early provision of adequate community facilities in upgrading
and site and services areas; (b) create greater variety of on-plot service
levels ranging from communal services for lowest income households to indi-
vidual water and sewerage connections; (c) strengthen tenure and payments
collection through enactment of legislation and application of appropriate
policies; and (d) train community development staff to expedite self-help
housing construction throughout the country.   The mare easily quantifiable
econoric benefits have been measured in terms of imputed market rental
values for the dwelling units to be constructed or improved under the project.
The rate of return is calculated to be about 12 percent in the squatter settle-
ments to be upgraded, 28 percent in the overspill areas, 25 percent in the
basic site and services area, and about 16 percent in the normal site and
services areas. The lower rate in the upgraded areas is in part a reflection
of the likely stickiness of room rents in upgraded areas due to institutional
rigidities.

C.   Projects in Executionl/
Loan No. 562-ZA - Industrial Forestfy Project: US $5.3 million loan of
October 5, 1968; Closing Date: June 30, 1977
Execution of the project is making more rapid progress than expected
at the time of appraisal. However, there are several staff vacancies which
gives cause for some concern. We have suggested that government seek technical
assistance from bilateral sources until qualified Zambian accountants become
available. Project costs have proved to be hiigher than e-xpected.
Loan No. 592-ZA - First Education Project:  US $17.4 million loar. of
April 11, 1969; Closing date: September 30, 1T97T
As a result of, inter alia, prolonged negotiations with the
architectural consultants; a reduction in 1972 of budget allocations Ilue to
decline in copper prices, and poor management in the early stages of rroiJect
implementation, the project is about 2 1/2 years behind schedule. Progress
in project implementation is now proceeding satisfactorily.  To allow for the
completion of the project, the original September 30, 1974 Closina Date is
proposed to be extended to March 30, 1977.
Loan No. 627-ZA - Livestock Development Project: US $2.5 million loan of
June 30, 1969; Closing Date: November 30, 1974
The project has run into serious management and financial problems.
The Government has recently decided that the scope of the project should be
drastically amended. Discussions on this matter are in progress.
Loan No. 645-ZA - Second Education Project; US $5.3 million loan of
November 30  1969; Closing Date: December 31, 1974
Construction work, procurement of furniture and equipment has
basically been completed.  Recent cost ectimates indicate an expected savings
of about US $0.50 million in loan proceeds. Delays in the initial irnplementa-
tion stage caused by, inter alia, building material shortages and limited
managerial capacity of certain civil works contractors resulted in an extension
of the original Closing Date of August 31, 1973, by about 16 months.  The
project is expected to be completed by the revised December 31, 197h Closin:-
Date.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered and the action being taken to remedy the2.
They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they-
do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weanriesses
in project execution.

Loan No. 685-ZA - Commercia:L Crops Farmin£g 1.oetO   US$5-5 million

loan Of Fe1bruary 2, 19  ~  Clc's<::In Date'. June 30, 1979
Physical development of both the Cotmercial Crops and Family
Farming Projects is satisfactory and benefits realized by farmers are up
to or exceed expectations. However, the Tobacco Board of Zambia (TBZ)
which is responsible for project implementation, faces difficult problems
due to staff shortages and deficiencies in its accounting organization.
Costs of both projects slightly exceed appraisal estimates. Disbursements
on the Commercial Crops Project are close to appraisal estimates but no
requests for withdrawal have yet been submitted for the Fandly Farming
Project.
Loan No. 701-ZA - Kariba North Project:  USL40.0 million loan of July 29
1970;  Closing Date:  July 1, 1976
The cost of the Kariba North Project, for which the Bank made
a loan of US$4.0 million in July 1970 to cover the foreign exchange ex-
penditure, has turned out substantially higher than estimated at the time
of appra:isal. The chief reasons for the cost overruns are (a) under-
estimation of costs at time of appraisal, (b) failure of the civil works
contractor who has subsequently been replaced, and (c) worldwide price
inflation. Civil construction work is now proceeding satisfactorily with
a new contractor. Problems associated with the rerouting of large special
loands of equipment have also been encountered due to the closure of the
border between Zambia and Southern Rhodesia but have now been resolved.
A supplementary loan is proposed to be presented to the Executive Directors
in the near future.
Loan 900-ZA - Third Education Project: US$33.0 million loan of June 6,
1973; Closing Date: September 30, 1979
Problems in recruitment of staff for two of the three Project
Units are creating some initial delays in ,oroject implementation.  Work
..plemented 'y the Project Unit previously established under the First
K'ticn ProJect (Loan 592'-ZA) is proceeding on schedule with numerous
civil works contracts awarded as a result of the utilization of pre-
viously approved standardized drawing and tender documents. Due to the
early stage of project implementation, it is likely that time lost in
recruitment of Project Unit staff will be overcome during the overall
project implementation period.
Loan 911-ZA - Program Loan: US$30.0 million loan of June 18, 1973;
Closing Date:  June 30, 1974
In March 1974 the Government requested the cancellation of
US$17 5 million of the loan, The Bank accepted the request and the
cancellation was made effiective on March 14,, 1971'

Loan 919-ZA - Kafte Hrdroelectric Project (Stage II): U$115.0 million
loan of July 16, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1979.
The date of effectiveness was postponed from October 15, 1973
to January 15, 1974 as the legal opinion which is one of the conditions
of loan effectiveness contained discrepancies.   The preliminary works,
such as access roads and camps, are now substantially complete. Con-
struction of the main civil works started in June 1973 and is proceeding
satisfactorily.
