SU101ARY AND CONCLUSIO.NS
i.        Zambia is the most urbanized count'y in Africa except South Africa.
Although Government has emphasized agricultural productivity and improvement
in rural living standards in order to slow urban migration, urbanization is
continuinz at a significant level. By 1978, over 40% of the population will
be living in towns and cities. Zambia has financed site and services plots
for self-lhelp housing construction since 1965, but output remains low compared
to need. Squatter settlements have proliferated and currently house about
one-fifth of the urban population.  Though productive and permanent (over 90,
of squatter households have one or more persons in employment), these areas
--lack essential services. 
i;.       Under the Second National Development Plan (1972-1976) the Govern-
ment plans to provide 70,000 site and services plots and to initiate upgrad-
in, of existing squatter areas.  Shortage of foreign exchange during the past
two years and generally weak implementation capabilities of most local
authorities have caused the site and services program to lag considerably
behiind schedule and no upgrading has been undertaken.
iii.      Bank assistance would initiate squatter upgrading and accelerate
the Second National Development Plan site and services program. Through the
Lusaka project, and later projects in ocher cities and towns the Bank would
encourage Zambia to widen the range of plot servicing levels in order to
reacih lowest income groups and to strengthen institutional arrangements for
site and services throughout the country, including tenure, payments collection,
and training of support staff for self-help nousing construction.
iv.       Lusaka is the fastest growing city and has the most severe squatter
problem. Its population tripled in the past decade to some 381,000 while the
Proportion living in squatter areas rose from 16% to 42%. The project would
address Lusaka's urgent shelter needs and improve the city's implementation
capacity for future projects.
v.        The project would consist of:
(a)  site preparation and servicing:
- servicing of 17,000 dwellings in four major squatter settlements;
-preparation of 7,600 residential plots in three overspill
areas located adjacent to upgraded settlements and serviced
to the same level as the settlements teLemselves;.
- preparacion and servicing' of 4.400 residential plots in six
sites designated for site and services under the Lusaka ,'4aster
Plan;
(h)  building materials loans for hotuse improvement/construction;



- i L -
(c)  primary infrastructure (water, sewerage, roads) essential to the
project;
(d)  com=unity facilities including schools, health clinics, multi-
purpose community centers, markets, and demonstration houses;
and
(e)  technical assistance, including project unit operations, con-
struction supervision, training of community development workers,
studies and further project preparation.
vi.       The 7,600 overspill plots adjacent to upgraded squatter settlet-nnts
w-ould bc among the least expensive (US$200) developed in Zambia.  The 4,4)0
plots- Eo be-develope&-in-areas designated for site and services will rang±
in cost from about US$700 to US$2,000.
vii.      Squatter settlements to be upgraded were selected on the basis o.r
proximity to employment and infrastructure, suitability for progressive i:n-
proverment and conformity with the Lusaka iMaster Plan.  hre number of site and
Fervices plots to be developed is based on estimated demand for Dlots at
various service levels, and the sites were chosen on the basis of accessioilitv
and proximity to existing infrastructure.
viii.     Total project cost, based on detailed engineering for site and
services and preliminary engineering for other comoonents, is estimated at
K 26.5 (US$41.2) million including land to be purchased for the project. The
foreign exchange costs are estimated at 33%.  The proposed Bank loan wou1c.
cover 43.5% or K 12.85 (US$20.0) million of project costs with the remaincer
being financed by Government and possible grants from United Nations Children's
Fund and American Friends Service Committee.  Contributions by the latter
agencies are not likely to exceed 5% of total project costs. Retroactive
financing of K 321,000 (US$500,000) for detailed engineering and initial
Project Unit operating costs is recommended.
i;.      \About K 4.9 (US$7.6) million worth of civil works and K 4.4 (US'6.8)
ialii.in worth of -materials and equipment will be procured by international
competitive bidding.  Civil works and materials valued at K 3.0 (US4.7) mnl-
lion and X 3.7 (US$5.8) million respectively would be procured on the bas:s
of locallv advertised competitive bidding. Civil works worth K 2.5 (US$3.9)
would be executed through self-help.
x.        Major project works would be executed over 3-1/2 years with the
disI)ursem.i't for building materials for self-help housing continuing for a
further yoar.  The Lusaka City Council would create a Project Unit to executo
tnie project.  IJowever, primary schools would be executed by the Banks Third
i.ducation Project UInit in the Ministry of IWorks, Power and Communications.
.i.       The Borrower would be the Government of Zambia which would on-lend
; 23.2 (US$36.1) million of the total project funds to the Lusaka City Council,
43.52, at z;ank terms and the remainder at terms reflecting average costs of
Governinent's domestic borrowing.



- iii -
xii.      Lusaka City Council would recover the full costs of on-site services
from project participants.  In accordance with Governrent policy there would
be no charge for land. Project participants would also pay recurrent charges
for water and sewerage, property taxes, administration during and after con-
struction. In addition there would be a building materials charge for those
taking loans. Monthly charges would range from K 2.75 (US$4.30) in upgraded
areas to K 19.90 (US$30.95) in the most expensive plots. Upgraded and over-
spill areas will be affordable to over 90% of the squatter households and
site and services plots would be within the means of up to 86% of all low-
income households.
xiii.     Government and the City Council are taking positive steps to streng-
then collection and defaults are not expected-to-exceed 20%. Such a rate
would result in a small project deficit in 1978 which would turn into a
surplus in 1981. Lower default rates would produce a surplus. Thus Lusaka
City Council will be able to meet project debt service and operating costs.
xiv.      The project has an acceptable economic rate of return ranging from
12,. for upgraded squatter areas to 28% for minimally serviced plots.
xv.       Subject to conditions set forth in paras. 7.01 to 7.03, the project
is suitable for a Bank loan of US$20.0 million equivalent for a term of 25
years including a grace period of 4.5 years.

LUSAKA SQUATTER UPGRADING AND SITE AND SERVICES PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The housing policy of the Government of the Republic of Zambia (GRZ)
is to encourage the provision and improvement of urban shelter through self-
ilelp.  The Lusaka Squatter Upgrading and Site and Services Project would be
,n important step in the accomplishment of Zambia's Second National Develop-
i;ent Plan (1972-1976) goal of upgrading all improvable squatter areas in the
-ountry and providing some 70,000 site and services plots. The project was
rrepared by GRZ and the Lusaka City Council (LCC) with consultant assistaace
from Zambia's National- housing Authority (NHA) and Doxiadis Associates Inrer-
aational (Greece). The American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) and the
United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) have assisted in the preparation of
a training program for community development workers to be undertaken as oart
of the project and both agencies may assist in the financing of the program.
1.02      Project discussions began with a reconnaissance mission in Nove'nber
1972, followed by a project preparation mission in February 1973. It was
:hen agreed that the Bank could best assist the national site and services
mnd squatter upgrading program by focusing initially on Lusaka where squatter
roblems are most acute and preparation for a project was most advanced.
Project preparation has, however, dealt with issues affecting the site and
services and squatter upgrading program throughout the country.
1.03      This report is based on findings of an appraisal mission consisting
of Messrs. C. E. Madavo (Chief of Mission), R. Woodford and Ms. D. Haldane
(Transportation and Urban Projects Department), D. Jordan (Programs, East
Africa Region) and Messrs. W. Doebele, R. Saunders and H. S. Mangat (Consult-
ants) which visited Zambia in August/September 1973 and a smaller follow-uo
mission in January/February 1974 in which Ms. C. Long (Development Economics
Department) and Mr. C. Gilpin (Consultant) participated.
II. BACKGROUND
A. Urbanization in Zambia
2.01      Zambia is tile most urbanized country in Africa south of the Sahara
except the Republic of South Africa. In 1971, over 30% of its population
was urban compared to about 12% in the rest of the continent.



-2-
2.02      Although most of Zambia's urban areas were founded at the time
of the discovery of copper in the early 1900's, rapid urbanization is
essentially a post independence (1964) phenomenon. Urban population rose
from 747,000 in 1963 to more than 1.5 million a decade later, an annual
growth rate of about 7.5%. By 1978, Zambia is expected to have another
half million urban dwellers and will be 40% urban.
2.03      Over 50% of Zambia's total population and 95% of its urban popula-
tion are concentrated in the Copperbelt and line of rail provinces where
some 84% of the total national wage employment is found (Map f0781). How-
ever, there is no one dominant city. Lusaka, though Zambia's largest urban
center, is not a primate city like so many other African capitals.
2.04      The search for better income opportunities has been an important
factor underlying rural-urban migration. Rural per capita income is about
US$100. Subsistence agriculture has remained stagnant for many years and
commercial agriculture is just recovering from the near collapse at inde-
pendence when white farmers left the country. Incomes of urban dwellers in
contrast average about US$500 and have been rising rapidly.
2.(5      Urban unemployment in Zambia has been low.  Even among squatter
hotseholds, over 90% have one or more persons in employment. The Second
National Development Plan (1972-1976) anticipates that urban wage employment
will grow by about 5.5% per annum, compared to an expected annual expansion
of 6% in male labor force in the major urban areas.  With continued urban
grcwth and greater female participation in the labor force, however, unem-
plcyment is likely to become a problem with increasing reliance on self and
ca*ual employment.
2.(6      The rapid influx of population into Zambian cities has given rise
to spontaneous squatter settlement. Two separate urban environments have
emerged: one modern, well equipped, expanding gradually and in an orderly
fashion; the other poor, unserviced and proliferating rapidly. Over 300,000
people or one-fifth of the total urban population live in these unserviced
settlements.
B.  Urban Development and Housing Policy
2.07      Zambia has emphasized agricultural productivity and improvement in
ruril living standards to slow urban migration. The First National Develop-
ment Plan (1966-1970) allocated 64% of total capital investment to rural
areas. At the end of the Plan period rural social services (schools, health
facilities, etc.) had dramatically improved but agricultural production re-
mained stagnant, and rural-urban migration continued unabated. The Second
National Development Plan (SNDP) emphasizes market oriented commercial farm-
ing and Intensive Development Zones for small farmers as additional means of
retarding rural/urban migration.



-3-
2.08      The Government recognizes that urban growth will continue at a
significant level. The SNDP urban development program is designed to meet
the outstanding infrastructure and servicing backlogs in squatter areas, and
to provide for new growth and expansion of both mining and manufacturing
thereby helping to create jobs.
2.09      Regarding shelter, GRZ has developed 25,000 site and services plots
for self-help housing construction since 1965 (Annex 1). The SNDP estimated
that some 85,000 site and services plots were needed to accommodate urban
growth during the 1972-1976 period, an average annual requirement of 17,000
units. In addition, improvements and services (security of tenure, piped
-wate-r-to-communal standpipes, gravel roads, etc.) were required for the
majoritv of Zambia's 50,000 squatter dwellings.
2.10      Due to the anticipated lack of foreign exchange during the Plan
period, the SNDP targets were scaled down to 70,000 site and services plots
or 14,000 plots per annum. Only a modest start was planned in the squatter
upgrading program. In both squatter upgrading and site and services, emphasis
,:as olaced on low-cost development through self-help.  SNDP planned expendi-
cure for site and services, upgrading and supporting services (primary infrast-
ructure and community facilities) was K 90 million or K 18 (US$28) million per
annum. As a result of the severe financial constraints during the past two
vears resulting from the Southern Rhodesian border closure and low copper
prices, the SNDP is considerably behind schedule even on these reduced targets.
Lii1      Although Zambia's squatter upgrading and site and services program
is unique among African countries and is a potential model for dealing with
,helter needs of low-income urban dwellers, it has experienced a number of
3roblems. First, plot output has lagged behind targets generally due to the
',eak implementation capacity of most local authorities responsible for ex-
2cuting site and services projects, especially at the housing construction
stage. Other problems include frequent neglect of timely provision of
conmunity facilities (schools, public health centers and markets), rising
standards and costs. Land tenure and collection arrangements have also been
imnsatisfactory.
2.12      Sank assistance, starting with the project in Lusaka and later
projects in other cities and towns, would promote changes in national urban
shelter investment, initiate squatter upgrading, and accelerate the SNDP site
and services program. The project encourages GRZ to (a) make early provision
of adequate community facilities in site and services; (b) create greater
variety of on-plot service levels ranging from communal services for lowest
income households to individual water and sewage connections; (c) strengthen
tenure and payments collection through enactment of legislation and application
of appropriate policies; and (d) train community development staff to expedite
;elf-help housing construction throughout the country.  An urban sector survey
to assist Zambia in defining a broad framework for future investments has been
-arried out by Bank staff and funds for technical assistance to prepare addi-
tional Projects outside of Lusaka are included in the project.

C. Lusaka
2.13      Founded as a railway siding in 1905, Lusaka became the capital of
Zambia (then Northern Rhodesia) in 1931. The city sprawls over a 360 km2
municipal area and divides into five major districts (Map 10772): the central
commercial/industrial area; the northwestern sector consisting of mostly high
density areas including some of the major squatter areas in the city; the
southwest containing middle-class and squatter housing; the southeast consist-
ing of high-income housing areas and government offices; and finally, the
northeast, consisting of the high-class townships of Chelston and Roma, the
National Assembly, the University, and the airport.
2.14      Lusaka is the fastest growing city and has the most pressing squatter
problem. The population more than tripled in the past decade to some 381,000
in 1973, an annual growth rate of over 13%. During this period LCC developed
an average of 1,000 site and services plots per annum compared to 5,000 new
households formed annually. As a result the proportion of the city's popula-
tion living in unserviced squatter areas rose from 16% to 42%. An additional
17,000 households will be formed during the construction of the Lusaka proj-
ect, mostly among the low-income groups. Lusaka's shelter needs are there-
fore twofold: bringing infrastructure and services to squatter areas to
consolidate existing self-help housing investment, and providing sufficient
planned serviced areas to reduce emergence of new squatter settlements.
2.15      The proposed project would service about 17,000 dwellings housing
roughly two-thirds of the existing squatter population. About 7,600 new plots
will be provided in overspill areas 1/, nearly 1,000 of which would be for
essential relocation and up to 6,600 for new growth. The latter, together
with the 4,400 plots to be developed in areas designated for site and services
under the Lusaka Master Plan, would accommodate the equivalent of 65% of
households formed during project construction. While not meeting Lusaka's
total shelter needs, the project would service all improvable squatter settle-
ments in the city. No less important, it will more than triple the site and
services output, thereby strengthening LCC's planning and execution capability
for similar projects in the future. The experience gained in Lusaka should
also help other local authorities.
1/   Overspill areas ate located adjacent to major upgraded squatter settle-
ments and serviced to the same standard. Their layouts approximate the
typical land use patterns and anticipated densities of upgraded areas
as contrasted with the generally higher standards of site and services
areas.



-5-
III. THE PROJECT
A.  Project Description
3.01      The project would consist of:
(a) Squatter Upgrading: servicing of 17,000 dwellings in four
major squatter settlements and preparation and servicing of
7,600 residential plots in three overspill areas:
(b) Site and Services: preparation and servicing of 4,400 "basic"
and "normal" plots (para. 3.05) in six sites designated for site
and services under the Master Plan,
(c) Building Materials Loans: financing of materials loans for
house improvement/construction;
(d) Primary Infrastructure: installation of water distribution
mains, a modification of pumpsets at the Lumumba Road reservoir,
trunk and secondary sewers, pumping stations and stabilization
ponds; construction of access roads; and purchase of garbage
trucks and related equipment;
(e) Community Facilities: construction of primary schools, multi-
purpose community centers, health clinics, demonstration
houses and markets;
(f) Technical Assistance: Project Unit operations: detailed engin-
eering and construction supervision; organization and management
studv of LCC; project preparation for future squatter upgrading
and site and services; and training of community development
workers; and
(g)  Land:  acquisition of 800 ha of land.
3.02      Squatter Upgrading:  Minimum stanidardt servicing in areas to be
upgraded includes installation of piped water with communal standpipes,
roads and security lighting costing about K 130 (US$200) per property.
The 7,600  ver?i   plots would be the least expensive now provided in Zambia
and would se aoriable by about 90% of existing squatters.  The service
standards in overspill areas are the same as those to be provided in upgraded
squatter areas. About 1,000 of these plots would be required for households
displaced by project works in existing squatter areas. The remaining 6,600
plots would provide for growth.
3.03      The principal selection criteria for project upgrading areas (Map
10772) were: (i) proximity to existing jobs, public facilities and existing
or committed utility services; (ii) suitability of sub-soil conditions for



-6-
eventual sewer installation; and (iii) conformity with Lusaka's Master Plan.
Preliminary engineering, including draft site plans and servicing layouts for
eacl area, has been prepared by NHA. Detailed engineering will be done by
the Project Unit.
3.04      Installation of water and roads in existing squatter areas would
be preceded by a program to promote understanding of upgrading and to mobilize
community support and participation essential to progressive improvement.
Residents would initially be consulted regarding servicing layouts and would
later be assisted in organizing group self-help labor for water pipe excavation
and standpipe construction.
3.05      Site -and Serv:ces-:-- The 4,400  ]6itinsite and services areas
include 1,200 "basic"' plots (conmunal water supply and pit latrines) and
3,200  "normal" plots (individual water and sewer connections). The Govern-
ment had discontinued preparation of "basic" plots under the SNDP because
the standards were considered too low. The basic plots are being reintro-
duced after Bank discussions with Government regarding'the need to extend
service levels in site and services in order to reach lower income groups
amongst whom the need is greatest.  Government views basic plots as an iai-
tial stage of phased servicing which, depending on occupant demand, could
lead to eventual normal servicing standards. On-site servicing costs of
basic plots are about K 470 (US$730) compared to K 850 (US$1,320) for normal
plots with average sub-soil conditions and K 1,325 (US$2,060) for normal
plots with rocky soil conditions (Annex 9). Project sites were selected
on the basis of accessibility and off-site infrastructure costs. Detailed
engineering for three of the six sites has been prepared by NHA and for the
remainder by Doxiadis Associates International (Greece).
3.06      Building Materials: LCC would make building materials loans to Project
participants on request in accordance with current practice to supplemert other
sources of building finance available to them, including personal savings and
borrowin,-s, employers loans and National Provident Fund withdrawals. Project
fundinig for building materials loans would be provided at the level of K 100
(US$155) in upgraded areas and K 250 (US$400) in overspill and basic site and
.,ervices areas, and K 525 (US$815) per plot in normal site and services areas--
amounts eqtual to the costs of at least a basic two room expandable dwelling on
the new plots.
3.07      Primary Infrastructure:  The project would include essential extensions
of Lusaka's water, sewerage, road and garbage removal systems consistent with
a phased development program to serve project areas and adjacent sites to be
cdevelooed under the SNDP. These include portions of a new water distribution
grid and related works, a local distribution main from the Lusaka Water Works,
sewers and stabilization ponds, road extensions and garbage removal equipment
(!tnnex 3). Preliminary engineering of water and sewerage facilities has been
prepared by Doxiadis Associates International on the basis of standards derived
from existing consumption surveys of low-income areas. Designs and prelimin-
ary cnilinieering for roads have been prepared by the City Engineer's Department
(Annex 6). Detailed engineering for the respective components will be carried
miut by tiie same entities.



-7 -
3.08      Commun ity Facilities:  The project would construct and equip primary
schools, multipurpose comunity centers, health clinics, markets and demonstra-
tion (louses and would reserve small industrial sites. The criteria used in
determining the provision of community facilities are shown in Annex 6. Pri-
marY school and community center designs prepared by NRA, provide for con-
tractor execution of site and structural works and self-help completion of
non-structural building elements. Designs for health clinics, markets and
demonstrati.on houses have been prepared by LCC and provide for complete con-
tractor works.
3.09      Primary schools, accounting for about 70% of the investment in com-
munity facilities (Annex 5), would provide 9,600 student places requiring abouL
250 additional teachers. The projected 1971-1976 primary school expansion in
Zambia including the project requires approximately 3,000 new teachers, less
than the anticipated output from primary teacher training colleges of abcut
5,000 over the same period.  The total annual recurrent cost resulting from
the project would be K 0.6 million, representing 2% of national 1973 expen-
ditures and an even lower proportion in 1978. The school component is in
accordance with the educational sector goal of correcting the relati-re over-
supply of school places in rural compared to urban areas.  Each school wh"11
have a classroom for practical subjects which should encourage the implemen-
tation of a more practically oriented curriculum, another important SNDP goai.
School buildings would also be available for adult education and similar comr-
munity purposes during evening hours.
3.10      Technical Assistance:  The project would finance the staffing and
operating costs of a Project Unit within LCC (paras. 4.02-4.10) for the
execution period of 3-1/2 years. Costs not exceeding US$250,000 would be
retroactively financed. Detailed engineering of primary infrastructure and
community facilities and construction supervision would also be financed in-
cluding costs, not exceeding US$250,000, to be financed retroactively. Basic
and in-service training of community development workers would be assisted oy
UN'CEF and AFSC as part of the project in accordance with agreements oetween
these agencies and Government (para. 3.14).
3.11      Land:  Project areas comprise about 1,400 ha of land:  300 'ha in
state ownership, about 300 ha transferred to GRZ from a tribal reserve, and
800 hia to De acquired with fair compensation by GRZ from private owners.
Project costs include only compensation for the latter (para. 3.13) againist
whichi the Bank will not disburse.
is. Design Standards
3.l'1     Standards of utility servicing in squatter upgrading and site and
services areas are shomn in Annex 6 and unit costs in Annex 10. The wide
range of servicing standards is consistent with tihe broad spectrum of aousin_
neeis in Lusaka and facilitates consumer choice.  Typical layouts for squattcr
urn.r;oding including overspill. areas and site and services areas are sl1wn ir.
MLap.- 110329 and 11007 respectively.  The size of oversrill nlots would ibe :;.:hn;1



2                                                  2             2
210 m  compared with site and services plots of 324 m . The 324 m  plot for
site and services is the standard size (plus or minus 10%) that local
authorities are required to develop under a Ministry of Local Government and
Housing (MOLGH) directive. Although the space provided will allow families
to grow vegetables and to construct larger homes including rental rooms, the
plot size is still considered large. The effects of these relatively large
plot sizes on servicing costs have been studied by NHA and Doxiadis Associates
International. At negotiations it was agreed that GRZ would from time to time
review the experience in overspill areas# where plots would be substantially
smaller than in site and services areas. The results of this experience would
be brought to the attention of Local Authorities with a view towards further
consideration of developing smaller plots in future site and services schemes.
C. Cost Estimates
3.13      Total project costs, including purchased land (para. 3.11), is estima-
ted at K 26.5 (US$41.2) million, of which K 8.7 (US$13.5) million or 33% is
foreign exchange (June 1973 prices).  Estimates are based on preliminary
engineering for upgrading, primary infrastructure and community facilities
and detailed engineering for site and services. Facilities which may be con-
structed in part with self-help labor (para. 3.17) are valued at the full
estimated cost of construction by contractors to allow for use of contractors
as and if required.  Physical contingencies include 8% for community facili-
ties, 10% for site and services, and 15% for primary infrastructure and up-
grading. Prics escalation contingencies amount to 32%. 1/ Project costs by
disbursement category are shown in detail in Annex 5 and are summarized by
major project component below:
1/ Price escalation has been calculated on the basis of the February 1974
CPS guidelines.

D. Financing
3.14      The financing of the project costs would be shared as follows:
K              US$
(millions)       (millions)   __X
Bank                     12.85            20.0        48.5
GRZ*                     13.65            21.2        51.5
Total                   26.50             41.2       100.0
*    Includes the cont-ributions to be made by APSC and UNICEF not exceeding
5% of total project costs. Letters of agreement between the Government aad
the agencies to this effect are being finalized.
The proposed Bank loan would finance the foreign exchange costs, estimated
at 33% of total costs, and about 23% of local costs. The level of local cost
financing is justified by the project's innovative and comprehensive approach
to urban shelter improvement and its potential for becoming an example for
other African countries. Government would finance 77% of local costs includ-
ing 100% of land acquisition.
E. Execution
3.15      The Project Unit would commence upgrading works in mid-1974 and
would expect to complete all public works by the end of 1977. GRZ would
initiate land acquisition in mid-1974 with anticipated completion in mid-1975.
House improvement and construction by participants is expected to occur
through 1978, during which time the distribution and financing of building
materials would continue. The detailed execution schedule is shown as Chart
8634.
F. Procurement and Disbursement
Procurement
^.16      LCC, through the Project Unit, would act as the primary procurement
agent. The Bank's Tnird Education Project Unit (Loan 900ZA) would contract for
primary schools and oversee the self-help construction components of these
facilities.
3.17      Major civil works components of the project totalling K 4.9 (US$7.6)
million would be contracted by international competitive bidding in accordance
with Bank guidelines (Annex 7). Because of the relatively small size, and
staging of the contracts, they will be advertised locally with notifications
to embassies. Lesser works totalling K 3.0 (US$4.7) million consisting of



- 11 -
small infrastructure works, structural elements of primary schools and other
conmnunity facilities would be procured on the basis of locally advertised
competitive bidding. Excavation for water pipes in squatter areas and the
completion of non-structural elements of community facilities totalling
K 2.5 (US$3.9) million will be constructed by self-help labor. The alter-
native use of contractors for some or all of these works may, however, be
ultimately necessary to maintain progress in project execution. Should the
execution of these parts of the project through self-help labor interfere with
the progress and timely execution of the project, the Government shall employ
contractors after appropriate consultation with the Bank.
3.18      Materials and equipment valued at K 4.4 (US$6.8) million would be
procured by LCC on the basis of international competitive bidding in accord-
ance with 3ank guidelines (Annex 7). Domestic manufacturers would be accorded
a nreferential margin equal to 15% of the c.i.f. costs of competing imports
or tde existing rate of duty, whichever is less.  About K 3.7 (US$5.8) million
wortil of materials including: (i) concrete blocks, cement, sand/aggregate,
bricks, and concrete sewer pipe; (ii) miscellaneous equipment and furniture
of small quantities; and (iii) Project Unit vehicles, would be procured on.
tnle . asis of locally advertised competitive bidding in accordance with exist-
inc. LCC procurement procedures (Annex 7).  Consultants for detailed engineering
and construction supervision of the site and services and primary infra-
structure works would be engaged under terms and conditions acceptable tc tile
Bank.
Disbursement
3.1)      The Bank would disburse against (i) 60% of the total costs of civil
works by contractors; (ii) 100% of foreign costs or 60% of local expenditures
for equipment building materials, and vehicles; (iii)    60% of total expendi-
tures for consultant services and Project Unit operations. Disbursements
would be fully documented with the exception of the 60% of local expenditures
for Project Unit operations, for which disbursements would be made on the basis
of a statement of expenditure certified by the Director of the Project, the
documentation for which is not submitted for review, but is retained by tne
borrower and available for inspection by the Bank during the course of a proj-
ect supervision mission. The estimated disbursement schedule is shown in
Annex 15. Any surplus arising from the completion at lower than estimated
cost (including contingencies) of the project would be used, with prior appro--
al of the Bank, to provide additional "basic" site and services plots.
G. Monitoring and Supervision
l. 20     Duringi negotiations, it was agreedc that tiee Lusak: project wou3u
)et ninit,ored and evaluated (Annex 13).  Tthe Lusaka City Council would r:uni,3
tne project through the Project Unit.  Such moni-oring includes:
(a) a baseline survey of project participants and Dossibly
non-project participants to be carried out as part of the
initial phase of project implementation;



- 12 -
(b)  available data on existing physical conditions of the city
to be provided during implementation;
(c)  periodic reports based on the progress of essential infra-
structure and services in accordance with an outline pre-
sented to the Project Unit by the Bank (Annex 13);
3.21      With regard to evaluation, it was agreed that the Government would
allow the Bank to evaluate the project subject to the Bank and other interested
agencies providing the funding for such an effort.
Bank Supervision
3.22      Because of the large number of discrete, but inter-related project
elements and the complexity of self-help participation, an estimated 120
man-weeks of Bank staff time should be allocated for supervision during
project implementation (Annex 14).
IV. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
4.01      A Project Unit within the Lusaka City Council (LCC) would execute
the major components of the project. During negotiations, it was agreed that
the Bank's Third Education Project Unit (Loan 900ZA) would supervise the con-
struction of primary schools for the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of
Labor and Social Services would train community development workers. Local Ward
Development Committees, composed of community representatives and chaired by
the local city councillor, would participate in overspill plot allocation and
help mobilize self-help labor for the construction of certain community facili-
ties and would also be responsible for shaping long-range development programs
promoting continuing improvement to dwellings, infrastructure and community
services.
A. The Project Unit
4.02      The Project Unit would be a department of the LCC with the Project
Director assuming the status of a departmental Chief Officer (Chart 8633).
The Unit would have sufficient technical expertise to implement the project
but would liaise closely with existing departments. The Unit would, inter
alia:
(a)  supervise engineering design, tendering, and construction;
(b)  procure equipment and materials for civil works;
(c)  organize self-help labor for water main excavation, develop-
ment of community facilities, and house construction and
improvement;



- 13 -
(d) vet applications and prepare lists for plot allocation;
(e) assist in the granting of house title and occupancy licenses
and explain the conditions and obligations of occupancy to
participants;
(f) administer building materials loans;
(g) coordinate the activities of other Ministries involved in
project execution.
A formal Council resolution establishing and defining the Project Unit's func-
tions has been passed.
Organization and Staffing
4.03      The LCC Finance and General Purposes Committee will deal with all
matters relating to the project at the city level, and an Interagency Steer-
ing Committee representing MDLGH, LCC, NHA and other Ministries will be es-
tablished to facilitate coordination of project execution at the national
level. The membership of the Committee has already been designated. Policy
formulation will remain the responsibility of the respective ministries.
Copies of the Project Director's periodic reports to these two committees will
be routinely forwarded to the Bank.
4.04      The Unit would containrthree sections:  finance and procurement,
engineering, and community development (Chart 8632). The latter would com-
prise field teams of community development staff and construction artisans
responsible for mobilizing and supervising self-help building activities.
The finance and procurement division would, inter alia, prepare quarterly
accounts and would contain an internal audit section. During negotiations,
it was agreed that LCC shall have its accounts and financial statements for
each fiscal year audited with appropriate auditing principles consistently
applied by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, and that such audited
accounts would be furnished to the Bank no later than 6 months after the end
of each fiscal year.  It was also agreed that LCC would furnish to the Bank
unaudited project financial statements quarterly.
Recruitment and Training
4.05      LCC has already appointed the Deputy Project Director, some of the
Section Chiefs and senior staff for the Unit.  During negotiations it was
agreed that LCC shall appoint the Project Director no later than August 31,
1974 and appoint all Section Chiefs no later than December 31, 1974.  Comr-
mTli ty developmtent staff would be either seconded from existing LCC staff or
recruited. Two types of training will be carried out under the project:
basic conmmunity development training in existing institutions to meet project
requirements-and those of similar schemes elsewhere and a reorientation of
seconded LCC community development staff for squatter upgrading. UNICEF and
AFSC are prepared to assist Government in the training program and plans are
being finalized to this effect (para. 3.13). During negotiations, it was
agreed that the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank for its comments a detailed



- 14 -
sclhedule for the implementation of this program for trainting coirmunity develop-
ment workers not later than October 31, 1974. Details on training are des-
cribed in Annex 8. Artisans for supervising self-help housing construction
twould be furnished through volunteer agencies such as the German and Danish
Volunteers who have participated in similar schemes in Zambia. Their avail-
ability was confirmed during appraisal.
B3.  IaIor Execution Tasks
Plot Allocation
4.06      The Project Unit would advertise site and services plots in advance
0f com-aletion- receive applications, check eligibility and prepare a list
of qualified applicants for approval by the LCC Plot Allocation Committee
consisting of the tIayor, Town Clerk, and Project Director. Allocations will
be ratified by the Finance and General Purposes Committee. Eligibility
criteria are: (a) residency in Lusaka; (b) self- or wage-employment with a
monthly income of at least K 20 (US$30); and (c) intention to live in the
'nouse. No less than fifty percent of the plots will be reserved for house-
nolds with incomes less than K 70 per month or such otier amount as shall be
agreed with the Bank. Priority would be assigned essentially on a first-come-
first-served basis but recognition will be given to special housing need.
Approved allottees would be required- to rcake a deposit of three months basic
payment plus an amount equivalent to 5% of the loan ceiling for recipients of
building materials loans.
4.07      Allocation in overspill areas would be handled by the Project Unit
whicii would screen prospective residents, and Ward Development Committees,
who would give final approval.  Plots would be offered first to residents
of upgraded settlements who are displaced by essential services, and thereafter
to other applicants on the basis of need. Appeals would be lodged with the
LCC's Plot Allocation Committee.
Administration of Building 'Materials Loans
4.(")8    IlTe Project Unit would establish on-site stores, distribute
materials and maintain accounts for the operation. Loans would be given in
Kind but caslh sales would be allowed. All participants would be eligible
for a basic loan (para. 3.06); loan ceilings would be established by the
Unit for each plotholder on the basis of his ability to pay.
Granting of Title and Occupancy Licenses
4.09      During project implementation, the Unit will assist the GRZ Depart-
ment of Lands in the registration of titles -to dwellings and licensing of
land occupancy in upgraded and overspill areas, and in the issuance of leases
in site and services areas.
4.1i1     The legal basis of registration and tenure are contained within the
pendinig housing (statutory and improvement areas) legislation and accompanying



- 15 -
administrative orders. The legislation would (a) enable the establishment of
tenure of at least 25 years in upgraded areas where none existed before and
increase the length of serviced plot leases from the current 10 to 30 years;
(b) simplify registration of land title and regularize plot transfers and
inheritance; and (c) enable MOLGH to administer by regulation specific terms
of tenure and sale, building standards, and commercial plot uses in both types
of areas. Passage of the legislation now scheduled for consideration during
the July 1974 session of the National Assembly is a condition of loan
effectiveness.
C. Operation and Maintenance
Collection
4.11      Monthly charges would be deducted at the source of employment where
possible. Other payments would be made at on-site LCC offices. Zambia's
site and services schemes have experienced continuing problems witn payment
arrears, though more recent projects appear to be achieving better results.
Although data on defaults is difficult to obtain, the mission analysed field
records at Kaunda Square (Lusaka) Site and Services Scheme which showed a
default rate (over 12 months in arrears) of 25%. Several steps are being
taken by Government to improve collection. First, it has recently amended t.he
Rent Act of 1972 which made eviction of tenants for any reason difficult and
legally cumbersome, with the result that rent revenues dropped throughout the
country. The amendment restores local Councils' authority to evict tenants
for default.
4.12      Tne second measure involves the use of the United National Inde-
pendence Party (UNIP), the sole political party in Zambia, which has proven
remarkably effective in informally administering squatter areas. Each UNIP
section leader would be informed about and be responsible for the payment
record for about 25 households but all payments will be made directly by the
occupant to the City Treasury representative.
Maintenance
4.13      The maintenance of water, sewerage, and roads will be undertaken
by the City Engineer's Department. A water management study to be undertaken
outside the Project with German assistance is expected to recommend, inter
alia, a program for recruitment and training of the City's technical staff
for the water undertaking (para. 5.13). Primary schools would be staffed,
operated and maintained by the Ministry of Education (Annex 4), and health
clinics by the Ministry of Health.
4.14      LCC has encountered problems in maintaining an adequate profes-
sional staff and relies heavily on expatriate contract personnel. However,
before a training and staffing program can be formulated, a systematic re-
view of the city's needs is required. Moreover, this project will signi-
ficantly increase LCC's administrative responsibilities by providing services



- 16 -
to about two-thirds of Lusaka's squatter population, requiring a review of
organization and administrative capability. An organization and management
study would be undertaken as part of the project, which would be the first
step towards the required training and staffing.
Development Regulations by LCC
4.15      Business activities compatible with a residential environment would
be permitted in homes; those LCC deems inappropriate would be restricted to
markets or small industrial sites. In accordance with existing LCC regula-
tions, sub-division of plots would be prohibited, as will rental of entire
houses by absentee landlords, but sub-letting of rooms by a resident family
will be permitted. Minimum construction standards would be achieved througn
simple building performance standards and the provision of house designs which
have been prepared by LCC. Construction advisors will assist homeowners in
developing acceptable structures. Temporary shelters are to be permitted
during construction until a habitable dwelling has been completed.
V. COST RECOVERY AND PRICING
On-Lendin Arrangements
5.01      The total project cost of K 26.5 million would be financed by K 12.85
million from the proceeds of the Bank loan and K 13.65 million from GRZ's own
resources including small contributions from AFSC and UNICEF (para. 3.14).
GRZ, as borrower, would treat about K 23.2 million of total project costs as
loans to LCC and bear the costs of schools, health clinics and training
amounting to K 3.3 million in accordance with current practice.. About 48.5%
of on-lent funds would be at Bank terms and the remaining 51.5% at 6.25% over
30 years, reflecting the average cost of GRZ's domestic borrowing. These
on-lending terms were agreed at negotiations.
XRZ Land PolicY
5.02      Project participants would not be charged for land based on recent
cabinet directives establishing a new land policy: (a) land has no value
except that of the services on it; (b) no charge is to be made over and above
development costs; and (c) freehold title to urban land will be gradually
replac ed by leasehold. As Government is now the only buyer of urban land
and already has substantial holdings through outright ownership or control
,of tie mdning companies, land acouisition costs are not likely to constitute
a inajor item in future upgrading/serviced plot projects.  The value of land
is, however, included in the costs for purposes of economic analysis (para.
6. l2).
i.ecovervof Costs by LCC
5.03      GRZ loans to LCC would be charged to the Councilts accounts and
paicd by individual project beneficiaries or the General Rate Fund (property
taxes and local income tax):

Collections from Individual Beneficiaries
5.04        Housing Account:  Project participants would be charged for on-site
development cOsts including engineering fees and interest during construction
(Annex 9, Table 2). Repayment would be at 7.5% over 30 years. Thee interest
rate is equal to the mortgage rate being charged by the Zambia National
Building Society.  The 30 year repayment period generally  coincides with the
proposed tenure periods. LCC should confirm these repayment terms at negotia-
tions.
5.05        Building Materials:  Building materials loan charges would cover
the purchase costs of materials and the operating costs of materials depots



- 18 -
5.06      Water and Sewerage Accounts:  Households drawing water from stand-
pipes and those with individual connections would pay existing tariffs of
K 1.25 and K 1.65 per month respectively (Annex 10). Plots with waterborne
sewerage would be charged an additional K 1.50. LCC utility tariffs are
intended to cover debt service, operating costs, and generate a surplus for
small capital expansion. In practice, however, tariffs have lagged behind
costs (Annex 10).
5.07      General Rate Fund Account:  LCC considers most items charged to
this account as benefitting the city as a whole and payable through property
and local income taxes.  The property rate schedules are set annually to
meet anticipated expenditure. Project participants already paying the local
income tax (Annex 11) would also begin to pay nominal property rates to be
revised-within five years of project comencement when houses would have
been coupleted. In addition, project participants would pay for dustbins
and management of project areas after plot lease.
5.08      User charges would be levied for market stalls at the rate of?
K 0.15 and K 0.25 per day for vegetable and other dealers respectively,
making markets self-financing. Households with children attending day-care
sessions in the multi-purpose community centers would be charged K 1.00 per
mouth per child, covering essential operating costs of these sessions.
5.09      Total Monthly Charges:  The total monthly household charges would
be as follows (for details see Annex 9):

The basic charge in all areas includes a 10% surcharge for possible defaults.
Site and services occupants would also make a deposit equivalent to a 3-month
basic charge plus 5% of the loan coiling for recipients of building materials
loans which would be held by LCC and applied to the lest 3 months of the
mortgage.



- 19 -
5.10      Based on the above schedule of charges adjusted for price escalation
(Annex 9, para. 11), and assuming monthly payments should not exceed 25%. of
income, the upgrading component of the project would be affordable by 921' of
households in squatter areas and the new plots would be within the means of
up to 86% of all households living in low-income housing areas.
Proiect and LCC Finances
5.11      The project would generate a net surplus, measured in terms of annual
debt service and operating costs minus revenues collected from participants
of about K 190,000 in 1978 rising to about K 420,000 in 1981, assuning a 10%
default rate. 1/ Defaults of as much as 20% would produce a small deficit of
about K 55,000 in 1978 which would turn into a surplus of KX155,000 in 1981.
Even under the extreme assunption of 30%, the resulting annual project net
deficit would be only 9% and 3% of estimated LCC net revenue surpluses with-
out the project in 1978 and 1981 respectively. The project is therefore not
likely to strain LCC finances.
5.12      Eventual project viability is also dependent on the soundness of
future LCC financial management, in particular the rate and terms of additional
borrowing. GRZ controls LCC borrowing and terms at which additional capital
investments and debts are incurred. During negotiations it was agreed that
GRZ will vet LCC proposals for capital investment and additional borrowing
through 1980 in accordance with criteria discussed with the Bank. Further-
m-ore, it was agreed that LCC accounts will be audited by an independent
auditor acceptable to the Bank and furnished to the Bank within 6 months of
the end of each fiscal year. The auditors would be requested to conment on
the success of collections from project participants.
5.13      Steps should be taken to strengthen LCC utility operations (Annex
10). LCC has engaged Nicholas O'Dwyer and Partners (Ireland) to undertake
a detailed study of water distribution and wastage to be completed by June
1974. LCC is also negotiating for German bilateral aid to finance a water
source, management and tariff study. The study would examirne the feasibilitv
of further exploitation of Lusaka underground water sources, and review
the accounting system, management and tariffs of the water operation (Annex 3).
During negotiations it was agreed that LCC would (a) undertake the above studv,
tlhrough German bilateral aid, in accordance with terms of reference acceptable
to thae hank; (h) consult the Bank after the study referred to above, before
constructing the third stage of the Kafue tJater supply scheme; and (c) on the
ih-s   u of the above studies, review tariffs in consultation with the Bank, and
ijstitute a water management program including metering and staff training,
n; .7tter than June 30, 1976.
I/   Project debt service has been calculated on the basis of 27 years and
6. 35%. interest.  Ile terms reflect a rough average resulting from tile
relatively lharder terms (25 years, 7-1/4%) of.48.5% of LCC debt resulting
from the Dank, loan and the softer terms (30 years, 6-1/4%) of that re-
sulting from Governments' own resources.



- 20 -
5.14      LCC plans to put into effect a new sewerage tariff effective
Julv 1, 1974.  The tariff increase ranges from 20-30%.  A further review is
anticinated in another 2-3 years.
5.15      Finally, there is substantial scope for additional revenue from
:,roperty taxes in Lusaka where property rates are the lowest in Zambia.
:-ro?erty in the city has not been revalued since 1965 and indications are
t:.at land has appreciated by about 75% and improvements by over 150%. A
revaluation is planned in 1975. Agreement was reached during negotiations
on the application of a new valuation roll no later than January 1, 1977.
VI. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
6.01      The project would generate a wide range of benefits including im-
proverments in living conditions and health standards of a significant propor-
tion of Lusaka's squatter population, savines to the Government due to in-
creased use of self-help construction and more efficient planning of urban
settlement patterns in the city. The project would also strengthen the
institutional arrangements for site and services in the country as a whole.
The more easily quantifiable economic benefits have been measured in terms
of imputed market rental values for the dwelling units to be constructed
or improved under the project.  All sites show internal rates of return
ranging from about 12%' in upgraded squatter areas to 28% in new plots
adjacent to upgraded squatter settlements.  The rate of return for upgraded
areas is more dependent on the assumed net change in rents than on costs.
6.02      For tne purposes of economic analysis but not for charging, total
residential costs include a cost for the use of land entered as a cost in
the first year and a benefit in the 30th year. Also included in the costs
are that portion of off-site infrastructure costs attributable exclusively
to this project, on-site servicing costs and thie costs of dwellings, both
*aatorials and labor. Operating costs have been estimated at 2% of initial
c:lv, txil value and include maintenance of off-site sewer and water facilities
al L.il as maintenance of dwellings theniselves. LCC expenses associated
witft the imanaging of the construction phase (Project Unit operations) are
also included (Annex 12).
6.).03    Project benefits include an estimate of the imputed rental value
(excludinf utilities) of the units to be built on the serviced lots, the value
of utilities to households, and the net change in rents for,housing units in
squatter areas to be upgraded. Imputed rental values have been derived from
survevs of actual market rentals for site and services houses or rooms in
Lusa'ka.  A conservative estimate of the value of utility services is used
based otl the water and sewerage charges being made by Lusaka City Council.
T!Pe expected changes in rents in squatter areas, estimated at 30% are based
on spot checks in one of the squatter areas in Lusaka in which improvements
were made .- few vears ago.
0).04     The ranking in the rates of return in overspill and site and ser-
vices is generally consistent with the economy of co!mmunal and basic servic-
Lng compared with hiigher standard individual servicing, i.e. beyond a certain



- 21 -
minimun servicing level little premium is placed on additional amenities.
The lowier rate in upgraded squatter areas is in part a reflection of tne
likely stickiness of room rents in upgraded areas due to institutional
rigidities (strong conmunity and other social networks already exist in
these areas, making the functioning of market forces more restrained).
VII. RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations, the principal agreements were that GRZ:
a   shall cause LCC to gran-t occc; I-ncy licences for a period of
twenty-five years to the holders of residentiai plots in up-
graded and overspill areas and leases for a period of not less
than thirty years to occupants of site and services areas
(para. 4.10);
(b)  lend to LCC an amount eauivalent to US$17.5 million from thle
proceeds of the Bank loan and LjS$18.6 million out of its own
funds;  the proceeds of the Bank loan to be onlent at Bank terms
and those of Government's own resources at 30 years and 6.25%
(para. 5.01).
7 .C2     Further agreements were that LCC;
(a)  may execute the excavation for water pipes in squatter areas
to be upgraded and the constrlction of ccmmunity facilities .;
and self-help labor.  However, should this interfere with the proper
and timely execution of the project, contractors may be used
after appropriate consultation with the Bank (para. 3017);
(5)  shpll not later than August 31, 1974 appoint a Project D.rectcr

ZAMBIA
LUSAKA SQUIATTER UPGRADING AND SITE AND SERVICES PROJECT
Site and Services Experience in Zambia
1.        The Government of Zambia (GRZ) has terminated support of conven-
tional low-cost rental housing units in favor of site and services development
by local authorities. Serviced plot schemes were initially funded by GRZ
primarily as a means of resettling squatters.  However, it is now C-overnment
policy to upgrade squatter settlements and the national site and services- -_
program is intended to-expand the supply of low-cost housing and promote
home ownership. Whereas the First National Development Plan (FNDP, 1966-1970)
allocated only 30% of all housing investment for site and services, the Second
National Development Plan (SNDP, 1972-1976), established it and squatter
upgrading as the sole vehicles for Government housing investment.
2.        Between 1965 and mid-1973 almost 24,000 serviced plots have been
complcted, with the cities of Lusaka (10,000), Ndola (5,200), Kitwe (3,500)
and Chingola (1,800) accounting for nearly 85%.
3.        Location:  Many initial site and services schemes were located too
far from the city center. As the city expanded, some of those developed in
earlier years in Lusaka such as Chibolya (1950) and New Kanyama (1963) are
today in fairly attractive locations. Difficulties of attracting participants
to the relatively remote locations of early schemes were sometimes interpreted
as a lack of response to the site and services concept itself. Experience,
however, has demonstrated that schemes developed within reasonable distances
to work places do not lack applicants.
4.        Plot Characteristics:  The SNDP eliminated basic plots (see para.
3.05 of main report) because of a growing concern over plot standards and
directed that all plots have waterborne sewerage and individual water taps.
This introduced a restriction in the range of income groups in the site and
services orogram particularly at the lower end of the income scale. Simul-
taneously, medium- and high-cost plots were introduced for 10%e of site and
services development, extending the upper range of income groups served.
5.        Costs and Monthlv Charges:  Plot development costs and service
charges (water, sewerage, rent collection, rates, etc.) which together with
building n,aterials loans make up the monthly charges show a range reflecting
differetices in certain design standards among local authorities, though
minimum standards iffecting plot size, water and sewerage arrangements have
been established by Government.

6.        Except for building materials loans participants have not in the
past been charged full development costs by any local authority. Government
grants of K 215 toward the cost of normal plot development, 50% of basic plot
development, and K 1.25 of all monthly service (standing) charges have reduced
the basic monthly cost to beneficiaries by about 60% on basic plots and between
36-55% on normal ones.
7.        Under the SNDP, however, subsidies to all types of Government and
Council housing programs, including site and services, are to be phased out.
Local authorities are being encouraged to sell their rental units at market
rates and to charge economic rents (full recovery of development costs).



ANNEX 1
Page 3
Toward this end, Government announced in January 1974 the termination of
all housing subsidies to local authorities effective immediately. Lusaka has
proposed a 30% rent increase for both serviced site schemes and council owned
rental housing.  The proposal is awaiting 1'inisterial approval.
8.        Allocation:  Allocation procedures vary widely between local authori-
ties. In Lusaka and Kitwe the Project Management Team (PMT) -- comprising
a group of Council Officers representing the various departments of Council --
is vested with responsibility for allocation, subject to ratification by the
llousing Committee and eventually full Council. Successful candidates are
notified by post to pay their deposit of K 20 which is refunded when the.
house reaches wall plate level.  This procedure-has-resulted in significant-
delay with a period of three months between application and notification
considered minimal. (A revised allocation procedure is outlined in paras.
4.06 and 4.07 of the main report). In Ndola, however, plot allocation is
left to the discretion of the Site Officer who, having satisfied himself as
to the qualifications of each applicant, can sanction the start of immediate
construction.
9.        Eligibility has been established by government circular and is
relatively uniform. All participants should be: (a) resident within the
town or city in question; (b) employed earning at least K 20 per month;
(c) on the Council's housing waiting list; and (d) prepared to live on site.
10.       Plot Development:  Provision was first made in the 1966-1969 period
for materials loans to participants for house-construction.  Most loans were
made up of K 144 (US$216) from government and-K 72 (US$108) from the local
council, at 5% over four years. Recent policy changes have altered the loan
terms to a standard 7-1/2% over 15 years which more closely reflects the current
mortgage rates of the Zambian Building Society.
11.       Although many early schemes were initiated with the intention of
self-help group construction of homes, over 60% of households in Lusaka
schemes have utilized contract labor, thereby generating considerable paid
employment in the informal sector. Technical assistance has been provided
in the form of artisans skilled in masonry, bricklaying and carpentry, and
a variety of building plans are available to participants who may also build
to their own approved design. Periodic inspections ensure that participants
develop sound structures which conform to minimum regulations. Community
development staff are present throughout the development period to assist
participants in completing their homes and effectively organizing for con-
tinuing improvement over the longer term.
12.       Community Facilities:  Problems have been encountered on certain
schemes due to the slow development of community facilities. While space is
generally reserved for a variety of facilities, their realization has not been
considered an essential part of site development with the result that key



ANNEX 1
Page 4
facilities, such as markets and schools may not appear for several years.
Particularly where schemes are located in relatively inaccessible areas as
was Kaunda Square in Lusaka, such delays represent a serious deterrent to
potential participants.
13.       Collections:  With the exception of a few schemes, repayments have
been poor. In light of the subsidized monthly charges and minimum income
criteria it seems that a more than adequate capacity to pay of the occupant
population does not guarantee adequate collections. The method of collection
and general attitude of participants toward government debits appear to be
the more crucial elements, both of which are addressed in the main report,
paras. 4.11 and 4.12.
14.       Tenure:  Site and services leases have stipulated a tenure period
of ten years, renewable for further periods of ten years provided the terms
and conditions of the lease are adhered to. However, the legal validity of
this lease has been questioned. The Government now plans to establish
legislation securing and extending tenure to between 20 - 30 years
(para. 4.10 in main report).
15.       Regulations:  (a) resales of developed plots may occur only after
all monthly charges have been paid up to the date of sale and the new purchaser
must meet critiera outlined in para. 9; (b) lodgers are permitted only if
approved by the local authority, though in fact informal subletting is fairly
widespread; and (c) local authorities may repossess and sell a property if
the owner is in arrears by an amount exceeding that prescribed by the local
authority, if the house is sold or sublet without the prior consent of the
Council, or if the participant fails to erect a house within the period pre-
scribed by the local authority. Abandoned properties, along with any building
on them, revert to the local authority.

Lusaka: Population, Shelter, and Income
1.        Municipal Government in Lusaka dates back to 1913 when a Village

small railway settlement.  The settlement, which eventually became t'e ca:)Uaa
of Independent Zambia in 1954, celebrated 60 years of local government tL.

grown from 55,000 in 1964 to an estimated population of 381,000 in 1973 a-
is projected to rise to over 600,000 by 1980.

3.        The initial focus of the city lay predominantly along the north-
south railway axis, developing a parallel business section somewhat divorced
from the administrative center a short distance to the east. Residential
high-cost housing spread along the periphery of the latter and institutions
gradually developed to the north, thereby establishing three of the city's
five geographically distinct areas. In the six years following independence
rapid population influx brought significant growth to the northwestern and
southeastern sections, and entranched a growing urban sprawl. The creation
of Greater Lusaka in 1970 nearly quadrupled the city's area and increased
its population by 50%.
4.        Shelter and Services:  The most striking feature of growth patterns
in Lusaka lies in the vigorous expansion of squatter and site and services
housing which provided 72% of all dwellings built over the past ten years.



ANNEX 2
Page 2
7r-ee-Quarters of these dwellings appeared in squatter settlements which now
house 42% of the population compared to 16% in 1963.  Conventional Municipal
Ih,ousing has been phased out in favor of site and services (Annex 1), and the
rate of growth in high-income housing areas has remained low, providing
shelter for the elite few.
5.        Lusaka squatter areas occupy 15 unique sites encircling the commercial
and industrial area, the majority of which may be grouped into four major
complexes: George, Chaisa, Chipata and Chawama. These four complexes have
distinct locational advantages and good bus services and the majority of
residents either walk to work or rely on public transportation.
6.        Apart from one area which has been provided with piped water and
an access road, the remaining settlements are unserviced. Water is obtained
from shallow wells shared by ten or more families, which are heavily contami-
nated by seepage from pit latrines, the sole form of sanitation. Drainage,
especially during the rains, is a problem, making penetration by emergency
vehicles difficult.
7.        Squatter housing ranges from traditional mud and thatch to quite
substantial stone dwellings, well-spaced in planned and controlled areas.
The United Independence Party (UNIP) is generally responsible for internal
planning and administration of these areas -- a role far beyond the normal
responsibilities of a political party. Newcomers are recuired to register
and must receive approval before starting to build. Although construction
standards are not normally controlled, certain areas have been "zoned" for
stone or concrete construction only.
3.        Despite inadequate services, the vast majority of residents in
squatter areas are generally satisfied with their settlements. Almost 90%
indtcatec their satisfaction with the social environment, lowq costs and
location.  Piped water dominated the list of desired improvements, followed
by roads and drainage.
9.        Employment and Income:  Unemployment has not beer, the problem in
rLusoka that it is in other African capitals, even after independence, in part
because female employment has never been a major factor, accounting for
only about 13%.; of 1969 total employment. Today overall household employment
in squatter areas is put at 92%, of whom 77% are wage-employed and 15%
self-employed. However, projections indicate a growing discrepancy between
population and employment growth rates; with unemployment therefore likely
to become nore acute.
10.       There are no income distribution data for Lusaka as a whole, although
several surveys have been made of low-income areas which comprise over 80%
of Lusaka's population. The 1973 income structure in these areas in shown
in Chart 1, Annex 9. It is apparent from Chart 1, Annex 9 that squatter



ANNEX 2
Page 3
areas and site and services schemes are strikingly comparable at the lower
in:ome levels, with 16% in each case below K 30. Both peak at about K 30-50
but thereafter it is apparent that the site and services areas have more
income groups in the higher range.
11.       The modal monthly income of all low-cost housing areas is K 40-49,
with substantial proportions of the total households having incomes over K 160
and under K 9. The former group contains people who would be eligible for
medium- or high-cost housing, but prefer to remain in the low-cost areas, parti-
cularly site and services or previously subsidized official low-cost housing.
The under K 9 group includes many individuals with quasi-legal or very
irregular income; and in practice the average expenditure noted in budget
surveys of those below K 40 is_generally considerably in excess- of their---
stated- income,. e.g., K 39 for those with incomes between K 20 and K 30, and
K 63 for those with incomes under K 10. If one were to take expenditures
as the more reliable indication of income, the number of families with real
incomes below K 30 would constitute substantially less than 16% in both
squatter and site and services areas.
12.       Estimates of. the proportion of income spent on housing are complicateo
bv the fact that many employers provide subsidized housing; and employees w;th
incomes under K 40 receive housing allowances of K 5.50. Rental figures taken
from major squatter and serviced site areas indicate housing expenditures up
to 50% of monthly income in squatter areas, and 16% in site and services areas.
W4ith the removal of all Government housing subsidies, the percentage should
range up to 25% in serviced site areas.

Primary Infrastructure
1.        Wiater supply, sewerage, road and drainage systems, and garbage
disposal services in Lusaka are maintained by the LCC. Electricity is
produced, transmitted and distributed by the State-owned Zambian Electricity
Supply Corporation (ZESCO). Public transport services (buses and taxis) are
provided by the State-owned United Bus Company (UBZ) and by private taxi
operators.
Infras  ructure-Studies and Plans
2.        Mlajor extensions of LCC's infrastructure have been programmed
;ithin the SNDP (1972-1976) to meet population growth and to extend coverage
to existing unserviced areas.  The development of these facilities is being
program=ed with the support of a number of recent plans and studies including:

3.        No major studies of management and operations of the LCC infrast-
nicture have yet been made. However, a report "The Water Supply and Sanita-
tion Sector on Zambia" (including Lusaka) prepared in December 1973 by the
Pre-Jnvestment Planning Unit, Division of Environmental Health, World Health
Organization recommends a comprehensive study on water supply and sewerage
operations in Lusaka. In parallel development, GRZ has reached a tentative
agreement with the German Government on the terms of reference of a compre-
hensive study of water supply sources and operations in Lusaka, including a
detailed study of the Lusaka aquifer (para. 5). It is anticipated that the
study can be undertaken in early 1975.
wlater SupDly
4.        The LCC water supply system now serves the 200,000 of Lusaka's
380,000 population, living in authorized development areas. Squatters have
traditionally drawn water from shallow wells. The systems total production
capacity will be 177,000 m3/d (39 imid) or about 880 lpcd (195 igpcd) for the
serviced population.  About 68,000 m /d (15 imgd) is produced from boreholes
within Lusaka and 109,000 m3/d (24 imgd) from the Kafue River, 48 km from
the city.
5.        Sources:  Until 1970, the LCC relied exclusively on underground
water. Groundwater production costs are low, about K 0.02 per m3 (US$0.15
per 1,000 ig) and the water's quality are within acceptable limits. In 1966,
GRZ and LCC decided to extract water from the Kafue River. The decision
was taken without detailed knowledge of the potential of the existing
aquifer or of other potential groundwater sources in or around Lusaka.
6.        Phase I of the Kafue scheme of the Kafue Works was constructed in
the period 1969/71 to supply 54,000 m3/d (12 imgd); extended in 1972/73 to
supply an additional 82,000 m3/d (12 imgd) and further extensions are envi-
sioned to increase the supply to an ultimate capacity of about 182,000 m3/d
(40 mgd).  Kafue water production costs have been high, about K 0.08 per m3
(US$0.60 per 1,000 g) and there have been considerable operating difficulties
which have limited actual production to about 46,000 m3/d (10 imgd).
7.        Distribution:  The LCC water distribution systems comprise six
zones supplied by five sets of reservoirs with a total capacity of about
147,000 m3 (about 32 ing) or about 82% of the daily water supply. Flat
topography precludes gravity supply to all areas directly from the main
distribution point at the Lusaka Water Works.  The main reservoirs are at
State House/Woodlands and subsidiary reservoirs are sited near High Court
(eastcentral), Lumumba Road (city center), Matero (northwest) (see Map 10772).
The present main trunk system has insufficient capacity to distribute the
150,000 m3/d available at the Lusaka Water Works to the subsidiary reservoirs.
The current study by O'Dwyer and Partners (para. 2) will include proposals
for the development of the water grid up to the year 2000 which take into
account -resent operating difficulties and the need for system expansion
consistent with Lusaka's draft Master Plan.



ANNEX 3
Page 3
3.        Consump tion:  Although all individual water connections and key
distribution points are metered, water consumption has not been systematically
measured until the current O'Dwyer and Partners study. Available data indi-
cate that demand has increased by about 20% per annum througnout the past
decade. Gross per capita consumption is very high, more than 800 lpd for the
population served. Preliminary results of the O'Dwyer study reveal several
contributory factors including wastage by institutional and industrial
consumers., excessive use by high-income residential users and leakage within
the LCC system. Wastage and excessive use are encouraged by water rates
which decline with volume, by poor meter maintenance and reading and by
insensitivity of institutional and high-income consumers to water charges.
The preliminary survey results also reveal wide variations in household con-
sumption rates with many high-income households in low density-areas consuming
more than 1,000 lpd and most low/moderate income households in medium
density areas consuming between 100 to 150 lpcd.
9.        Future Improvements and Expansion:  Lusaka's present water produc-
tionI capacitv is adequate to cater for about five years' growth in existing
demand at prevailing rates of increase and with resolution of problems
mentioned above, adequacy of the present source could be extended for a
further five vears.  The major focus of improvements in the Lusaka system
for the next ten years should be in the extension of distribution facilities
and development of operational and managerial capabilities. Studies mentioned
in paras. 2 and 3 are intended to address these issues.
10.       Distribution system expansion in the next ten years will take
place largely in northwest Lusaka which includes most project areas. The
configuration and design of the northwest grid will be recommended by Doxiadis
Associates International on the basis of studies by O'Dwyer and Partners.
11.       Project Works: The distribution of project works by project areas
is shown below:
Project Areas                          Project Works (Off-site)

Sewerage
12.       LCC's main waterborne system serves about 150,000 of Lusaka's
380,000 population living largely in medium and high income residential areas.
Low density high-income developments in the northeast Lusaka are served by
septic tanks. Squatter areas and several of the early site and services
areas rely on soakage pits and pit latrines. The main network of the water-
borne system comprises 230 km of sewers which feed two major treatment works
(G!anchichi Road near the city center and Western in the northwest) and one
group of stabilization ponds (Matero in the northwest) with a combined treat-
ment capacity of 40,000 m3/d. LCC also operates two small local sewer systems
serving a2-site and services area and a low-cost rental-housing scheme iwna----
eastern-Lusaka which feed small stabilization ponds.
13.       Future Improvements and Expansion.  Recently completed expansions
of the Nlanchichi Road and Western Treatment Works have created sufficient
treatment capacity for continued development over the next few years in
existing sewered portions of the city. However, the main trunk sewer feeding
the Manchichi Road works is running near capacity and a relief sewer is being
investigated. Other sewerage expansion is geared to urban development in
unsewered areas which in the near future will be concentrated in the "northern"
sewerage zone.
14.       Project Works:  The distribution of project works by project areas
is shown below:
Project Areas                         Project Works (Off-site)
Site and Services:              Laying of 4 km of secondary sewers,
Site 1                     10 km of trunk sewer, construction of
Site 3                     4,500 m3 stabilization ponds.
Site 4
Site and Services:              Construction of two small pumping
Site 6                     stations with rising mains.
Site 8
'Ihl,e trunk sewer in the northern treatment zone is a first stage facility, the
upper (smaller) portions of which are designed for the year 2000 whereas the
lowqer (larger) portions, which can be practically staged at closer intervals,
are designed for the year 1985. The stabilization ponds are designed at the
minimum economical size, 4,500 m3%
Roads
15.       The extensive LCC local road network includes two national routes:
thi! Great North Road which passes through the city center and the Great East
Road which extends from the city center to the National Assembly, University



ANNEX 3
Page 5
an.1 towards the airport. All city roads are constructed to a permanent
standard, most with bitumen surfacing. The high standard city road system
does not, however, exist within squatter areas.
16.       Future Improvements and Expansion:  Due to the high standards of
earlier construction most roads have considerable remaining capacity and
network priorities are to initiate extensions in conjunction with urban
expansion schemes, to install bus lay-bys and bicycle-pedestrian paths, to
improve the utilization of existing road capacity by traffic engineering
measures and to improve standards of maintenance.
17.       Project Works:  The off-site road works in the project include
the following:
Project Area                        Prolect Works (Off-site)
Site and Services:                Construction of 2.25 km extension of
Site 1                      Lumumba Road bisecting Site 1.
Site and Services:                Construction of 2.28 km extension of
Site 3                      local road serving Sites 3 and 4.
Site 4
Site and Services:                Construction of 3.90 km connector to
Site 5                      Great North Road to serve Site 5,
and existing site and services areas.
Squatter upgrading:               Construction of 1,000 km of local
Chaisa ("Ngulue" section   access road to Ngulue section east
only)               of railway line.
Squatter upgrading:               Construction of 0.65 km local access
Chawama ("Jack" section    road to Jack section east of railway
only)              line.
T!he project also includes the bitumen surfacing of the 16 km of roads desig-
nated as bus routes within project areas.
t'a rhage Disposal
1i.       The collection and disposal of refuse is presently provided to all
iutiuvrL;.ed development areas.  Squatters have traditionally disposed of :r
hu burning or burying.
1'.       The LCC maintains the followin,' equipment for garbage collection
and disposal:

Refuse is disposed of at a single site in eastern Lusaka.
.The maintenance facilities operated under the City Engineer's
r)epartment are understaffed and are not capable of servicing the city's vehicle
fleet including those used for garbage collection and disposal. However,
erivate garages are utilized as required to expedite maintenance.
21.       Project Equipment:  The project would include those items of equip-
ment required to serve project areas:

Bulldozer (D4 type)                                -               1
Electricity
22.       ZESCO is responsible for electricity generation, transmission and
distribution.  Power generation capacity is adequate to meet the demands of
proposed development in the immediate future. The main Lusaka sub-station is
connected to Kariba-Kitwe 330 KV transmission line. The city is served by
33/71 1KV feeders. The distribution voltage is 220 volt single-phase and
three-phase supply is provided where required.  Roughly 30% of dwellings in
low-cost residential areas and less than 4% in squatter areas are served by
electricity. Due to the inability of residents to pay electricity charges,
tlhere is limited demand for electric supply in new residential areas and in
some cases residents have had existing supplies disconnected.

23.       Project Works:  The project would provide for the installation of
(i) security lighting in project areas at the standard of two single lamp
standards per ha in squatter upgrading areas and five per ha in site and
services areas; and (ii) street lighting on major access roads.
Public Transport
24.       Lusaka is presently served by buses and taxis operated by the
United Bus Company of Zambia (UBZ), a State Corporation and by private taxis.
In the last ten years-,- bus services in the city have been substantially
improved and expanded-.-- The- bus fleet is about 250 vehicles and the passengers
carried have increased from 15,309 per day in 1965 to an estimated 37,236 per
day in 1973. Over 600 taxis operate in Lusaka, approximately 80 run by UBZ.
Nearly 500 taxis are of the fixed fare type which tend to serve as a mini-bus
between fixed destinations.
25.       A 1973 survey of squatter settlements revealed the following modal
split for journeys to work:

ZAMBIA
LUSAKA SQUATTER UPGRADING AND SITE AND SERVICES PROJECT
Primary Education
The Primary School System mi Zambia
1.        The organization and planning of Zambia's primary education system
is the responsibility of the Ministry of Education (MOE). However, the
administration of the system is highly decentralized under the Regional Chief
Education Officers and Regional Inspectorates.  MOE allocates recurrent
expenditures and teachers to the regions and the specific use of these re-
sources are decided upon by the regions. However, teachers' salaries are
paid directly from a computerized unit in Ministry Headquarters.                           -
2.        Provincial Permanent Secretaries control primary school capital
Eunds, although the MOE has some say over the capital allocation by regions.
The school building program remains under the technical supervision of the
Building Section of the Planning and Development Unit of the Ministry which
encourages and supervises self-help construction wherever feasible.
3.        The primary school cycle is seven years and progression from Grade I
to Grade VII is better in urban than rural areas. In 1971-72 the lower to
upper primary (Grade 4 to 5) progression rate was 72.3% for the country as
a whole, varying from 50% in the eastern region to over 90% in the urban
regions of Lusaka and the Copperbelt. The principal aim of the Second
National Development Plan (SNDP) is to increase the national progression rate
to 30% by 1976.
Curriculum Development
4.        The SNDP emphasizes the importance of preparing primary school
leavers for self-employment by proposing a more practically-orineted primary
school curriculum as well as the strengthening of out-of-school educational
services. To implement this SNDP objective, the recently established Science,
Homecraft, and Manual Crafts Departments of the Curriculum Development Center
(CDC), together with the Social Studies Department, are developing a program
for the upper primary school which will focus particularly on the needs of
school leavers.
National Primary School Enrollment
5.        Of the 777,900 pupils enrolled in Zambian primary schools in 1972,
93Z were between the ages of seven and fourteen, representing 88.5% of all
children in that age group. Although the national enrollment ratio is among
the highest in Africa, it conceals great regional imbalances which have resulted
from high rates of urban migration.



ANNEX 4
Page 2
6.        As noted in the Third Education Project, the primary aims of the
SNDP are to:
(a)  correct the mismatch of enrollment and school places by
distributing new Grade I classes in accordance with regional
population growth rates, with the major investment in urban
or other areas with populations swollen by migration;
(b) provide sufficient new Grade I classes to keep pace with the
growth in school-age population; and
_ (c) concentrate the provision of new Grade V classes in rural
______  areas to-equalize the lower to upper primary progression
rate between urban and rural areas.
Based on these aims, the SNDP proposed the following expansion of primary
school classes:
1971        1976         Percent Increase
Grade 1                       3,343        3,893              16.5%
Grade V                       2,048        2,794              36.4%
Grades I - VII               18,730       22,942              22.5%
New classes opened in 1971-72 have therefore been concentrated in the Copper-
belt and Lusaka Regions, and new Grade V classes in predominantly rural
regions.
7.        Considerable variations in enrollment ratios exist between urban
areas, Lusaka having the lowest ratio of all major towns (Table 1). Although
Lusaka had experienced the most rapid growth of all urban areas in the pre-
vious six years (81.5%), the primary school enrollment ratio increased from
52% to only 65% which was well below the national average.  Great inequalities
also exist within the city itself (Table 2). Of the 48 schools only one is
located in a squatter settlement.
8.        In October 1973 MOE conducted a survey of primary school enrollment
in Lusaka, which indicated that 65% of the school-age population (aged 7 to
14) was in school -- a proportion much lower than MOE had expected. It also
placed attendance ratios for high, medium and official low-cost housing areas
at 97%, whereas the average enrollment from the squatter areas, representing
nearly half Lusaka's population was only 36% (Table 2).
9.        There is great demand for primary education among squatter families
in Lusaka, evidenced by the self-help efforts of squatter communities to
provide a basic education for their children. While these schools are a
commendable example of self-reliance, they provide a very poor substitute
for the city schools.



.ANNTEX 4
Page 3
10.       Lusaka primary schools are over-enrolled by almost 40%.  The lack
of school provision in squatter areas has been an important factor in over-
crowding in the city's schools. Enrollment from squatter areas accounts for
23% of total city enrollment. More significantly, the number of classes in
many schools has been increased without a commensurate increase in the number
of classrooms, requiring the introduction of triple sessions in the lower
grades and double sessions in the upper grades. Based on the applications
of double and single sessions only, there is an overall shortage of 196
classrooms to cater for present enrollment.
Proposed Provision in the Project
11.       The project would provide six two-stream and twelve three-stream
schools with a total of 240 classrooms. Based on MOE policy of double session
in lower primary and single session upper primary schools, this would provide
9,600 student places, with a total enrollment of 13,440 (Table 3). The
provision of 48 primary streams in the project would increase the enrollment
ratio for the estimated school-age population in project areas from 38% to
78' (the present average enrollment ratio for Lusaka excluding project areas),
and provide for 78% of the school-age population in the site and services
areas.
12.       Each two stream school would be provided with a multi-purpose
practical room for the teaching of homecraft, environmental science and
other practical subjects, mainly in the upper primary grades. New curricula
are being develbped for practical subjects as outlined in para. 4.
Primary Teaching Staff
13.       At present, Zambia's Teacher Training Colleges are able to keep
pace with the expansion of primary school enrollments, although the number
of non-Zambian teachers has been sharply reduced. However, as the estimated
annual output from Primary TTCs is to be increased from 925 in 1974 to 1,440
in 1978.
14.       The projected primary school expansion 1971-76 will require approxi-
matr-ly 2,800 additional teachers, based on 1 teacher per 2 classes in grades
1-4, and the project will require an additional 240. About 5,000 teachers
ar! expected to graduate from training colleges during the SNDP.  Assuming
that the double session policy in lower primary grades continues and allowing
for an annual wastage of 1% in the teaching force and the replacement of the
remaining non-Zambian teachers, about half of the present number of untrained
teachers can-be replaced by 1976. Lusaka like many urban areas in Zambia,
is in a favored position with regard to teaching staff. In particular, many
wives of Lusaka employees are trained teachers, and in 1972 and 1973 there
was a slight over-supply of teachers in Lusaka primary schools.



ANNEX 4

Primary Education Recurrent Expenditures
15.       on the basis of a 1973 recurrent cost per primary student in Lusaka
of K 45, the total annual recurrent cost of project schools would be K 0.6
million. This represents a 2.1% of national recurrent expenditures on primary
education in 1973 and would be an even smaller percentage in 1978 when the
project comes into operation. Thus the Government should not have difficulty
meeting the project's recurrent expenditures.

LUSAKA SQUATTER UPGRADING AND SITE AND SERVICES PROJECr
Training for Community Development
1.        The training program for community development workers to be carried
out under this project is intended to meet the personnel requirements of the
project and to ensure an adequate supply of trained staff for similar projects
tlrougilout Zambia. Two types of training would be undertaken: basic and in-
service training for community development work--and an orientation of existing
communitv development staff to be seconded to the project. The latter would
be tiie responsibility of the Project Unit and would take place in the first
improvement area at Chawama. The former will be implemented by the Community
Development Department of the Ministry of Labor and Social Services utilizing
existing training staff and facilities at the Kabwe Training Center, and would
consist of a period of classroom instruction followed by field work in upgraded
areas under the Lusaka project.
Implementing Agency
2.        Community development training was a function of the Ministry of
Rural Development until January 1974 when it was transferred to the Ministry
of Labor and Social Services. Government-wide budget restraints over the
past two years, however, substantially reduced community development training
resulting in a shortage of trained personnel. With the recent improvements
in the Government's financial position, normal operations are being resumed.
Curriculum
3.        Tlhe curriculum for the basic training program will focus on familiar-
Lzing trainees with the characteristics of squatter settlements, the objectives
of squatter improvement, community organization, group work, and methods of
stimulating maximum self-help efforts. Emphasis will be placed on practical
skills required for such tasks as the design, construction, and improvement
of homes.
4.        Participants in the basic training program would receive about four
months field experience. The program will ensure that trainees have an oppor-
tunity to apply their academic instruction to practical situations and that
training staff themsleves are able to refine and adjust their approach .,
greater experience is gained. A community involvement specialist attached -o
the Project Unit would be responsible for coordinating field work in coopera-
Lionl with, the staff of government training institutions. He would, in addition,
inave specific responsibility for orientation of seconded staff to the Project
Un1-it.



ANNEX 8
Page 2
5.        Orientation of staff seconded to the project would follow essentially
a condensed version of the preceeding syllabus. Participants' previous work
experiences will be assessed, in order to tailor the orientation to individual
needs.  Emphasis will be placed on field work involving specific problems
encountered during project execution, as well as a mastery of practical skills.
o5.       The basic training program would be based at the Kabwe Training
Center, some 20 km from Lusaka. The mission was informed that Kabwe also
offers adequate equipment and accommodation for all participants and an exis-
ting core staff.  All government training personnel are Zambian citizens,
though expatriate assistance is sometimes provided in the form of consult-
ants-or-advisors.
7.        Due to diminished training activities over the past two years,
however, a training officer and assistant would be required to initiate the
proposed program. In addition, an individual is required to assist in pre-
paring trainers themselves to teach on the new syllabus, and to understand
the basic dynamics of an upgrading exercise with which there is little previous
experience in Zambia. Staff assignments would be to the Ministry of Labor
and Social Services. The American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) and UNICEF
appear prepared to undertake assistance along the lines described above and
agreements to this effect are being finalized.
Selection of Trainees
8.        Training institutions in Zambia have experienced a fairly high rate
of attrition in the past of between 25-30%, due in some measure to poorly
motivated candidates. Selection procedures will therefore be more stringent
in the future in order to improve this situation. Candidates will submit their
applications to the Chief Community Development Officer who will draw up a
short-list of qualified applicants. Candidates would. then be tested and the
results tabled before a Selection Panel. This Panel would call appropriate
candidates for interview, leading to the final selection of 40 trainees in
each session. Mature candidates will be given preference; a period of prac-
tical experience will be provided to the younger applicants to allow them to
determine whether their interest is genuine.
9.        The three-year time frame within which the above orogram will take
place conforms to that of the project. Over this period, three basic commu-
nitv deelopment training courses of 40 students each will be completed along
with a series of in-service sessions. Orientation of staff seconded to the
ProJect [,nit will require about two months.

Monthly Charges and Target Population
1.        Individual project beneficiaries would be expected to make monthly
payments covering the following:
-    plot development costs including contingencies, engineering
fees and interest during construction (Table 2);
-    recurrent "standing" charges for water and sewerage, property
taxes, dustbin fee and management after construction;
-    building materials (debt service on loan and management).
Plot Development Costs and Charges
2.        For purposes of calculating monthly charges, servicing costs have
been grouped into four categories: squatter and overspill areas; Site 5;
Sites 1, 3 and 4; and Sites 6 and 8 (Table 1). Government does not feel it
practical to further differentiate project areas, i.e. site by site calcula-
tion of per plot cost and therefore monthly payment.
3.        The development cost per house in the squatter and overspill areas
is a simple cost/house ratio. The per plot costs in site and services areas
have been calculated on the basis of assignable area, namely total area minim
roads and open space.
4.        The per plot development cost for Site 5, for example was caLculai-
as follows:
Total cost K 713,650
Total area 77.3 ha
Assignable area (minus roads, open space) 64% or 49.47 ha
Cost per assignable m2 = K 1.44
Plot size 324m2
Cost per plot - K 467
5.        The terms for repayment of plot development costs would be:  7.5%
over 30 years. The interest rate is comparable to the mortgage rates on
residential development charged by the Zambia National Building Society.
The repayment period is linked to the expected tenure period.

as follows:

S'tanding Charges
7.        Monthly charges for water and sewerage are based on existing LCC
tariff schedules shown in Annex 10. Residents of upgraded areas and Site 5
would pay a minimum of K 1.25 per month-for water and those for Sites 1, 3, 4,
6 and 8 K 1.65 per month. The first two groups will not be serviced with
waterborne sewerage while the latter two groups would pay K 1.20 per household
per month. Each household in all project areas would pay property rates
ranging from K 0.10 per month in squatter areas to K 0.50 in Sites 6 and 8.
The proposed rates are nominal and will be reviewed five years after project
completion at which time households may have built substantial houses. A
dustbin charge of K 0.14 per month would cover the costs of dustbins to be
replaced every four years. The management fee is calculated at 5% of the
total development and standing charges.
S.        The standing charge for a Site 5 plot will be as follows:
Item                      Charge

12.       The 1973 income distribution among all low-income areas is shown
irt Table 1. Assuming monthly payments should not exceed 25% of income,
squatter improvements would be within the means of about 92% of all upgraded
households. The 7,600 minimally serviced plots adjacent to upgraded areas
and 1,200 "basic" plots in Site 5 would be affordable to 85% of all low-income
households, the 1,200 "normal" plots in Sites 1, 3 and 4 to about 70% and
Sites 6 and 8 (2,000 plots) to about 45%.

ANNEX 10

ZAMBIA
LUSAKA SQUATTER UPGRADING AND SITE AND SERVICES PROJECT
Lusaka City Council Water Supply and Sewerage Operations
1.        The water supply and sewerage systems of the Lusaka City Council
(described in Annex 3) are jointly managed by the City Treasurer's Department
responsible for meter reading, billing, collecting and financial management
and--the City Engineer's Departmenit, responsible for planning, operation and
maintenance (including meter installation).
A. Water Supply
2.        Water Tariffs:  The present LCC water tariff schedule and the
schedule it superseded on July 1, 1973 are shown in Table 1. The structure
of LCC residential water charges is based roughly on the relative costs and
quality of service provided. Public standpipe users pay the lowest fixed
and variable charges (K 1.25 and SOn per 1,000 gallons respectively) and low
density residential consumers pay the highest (K 2.00 and 60n respectively).
The differential is meant to account for capacity and distribution costs due
to differences in average consumption (Annex 3, para. 8). No accurate esti-
mates of average costs of serving the different user groups exist, but it is
believed that the tariff changes have reduced but not eliminated the relative
overcharging of low volume (low-income) users because the existing minimum
charge is based on a relatively high consumption of 5,000 gallons per month.
This figure was set partially to minimize the clerical burden of the City
Treasurer's Office which is able to apply standardized billing to the high
density residential users.
3.        Billing Procedures:  Water meters are read monthly and water bills
are distributed by mail or messenger.  All consumers except cotncil house
tenants who pay water charges in rents, are required to pay a water deposit
of K 50 for industrial consumers, K 10 for low-density residential areas and
K 50 for all other consumers. The billing procedure appears to be ineffectivc
for example, in 1971 about 37% of the 6,500 million gallons produced were not
billed. In 1972, approximately 32% of the water produced was not billed.
The high percentage of unbilled water was due mainly to maintenance problems,
an inadequate staff and a division of authority between the City Treasurer's
and City Engineer's Departments, and a shortage of meters and parts. Addi-
tionally, there are cases of illegal connections, particularly in squatter
settlements bordering on serviced areas. The current study by O'Dwyer and
Partners (Ireland) will contain recommendations regarding these problems
(Annex 3).



ANNEX 1 0
Page 2
4.        Water Account Financial Position:  The LCC is estimated to have
generated a substantial deficit in 1972 and 1973 on the basis of preliminary
accounts and a deficit is also forecast for 1974 even after the effects of
the recent tariff increase. The continuing deficit is largely due to rapidly
rising cost of: (a) water production etc., the increased use of high cost
water from the Kafue River instead of cheaper groundwater sources; (b) debt
service arising from recent Kafue expansion works and rising interest rates;
(c) chemicals, fuel, electricity, and labor; and (d) lower than anticipated
revenues due to a shortage of meters and operating staff. Future reviews
including one planned for 1976 immediately after completion of current and
planned studies- of underground-water resources, water tariffs and management
(Annex 3) are expected to considerably strengthen the finance and operations
of the water undertaking.
B. Sewerage
5.        Sewerage Tariff Schedule and Collections:  The present sewerage
tariff schedule is shown in Table 2. Residential sewerage tariffs incorporate
a single step progression based on valuation which is meant to roughly correlate
with use. Collection procedures are similar to those followed for water.
Bills are mailed monthly. Occupants of council houses pay a sewerage charge
in their monthly rent. No sewerage deposits are, however, required.
6.        Sewerage Account Financial Position:  The sewerage account has been
in deficit since 1971 and is expected to generate a deficit of K 325,000 in
1974 because of increased debt charges due to capital expenditures on treat-
ment works, interest rates on new debt, and chemical costs and salaries, as
well as delays in revising tariffs in line with rising costs and lack of
effective financial control. The tariff revisions effective July 1, 1974
should substantially improve the financial position of this account.

1.        The Ninistry of Local Government and Housing, to a considerable
extent, controls both the revenue sources and the expenditure levels of
local governments. LCC cannot alter property rates or the tariff schedules
on any revenue source without obtaining prior approval from the Ministry and
annual accounts must be audited by a Government approved auditor. Central
control has been particularly pronounced in recent years: 1972 estimates
were limited to 1971 levels minus 5%, 1973 estimates to 1972 plus 5%, and
1974 to 1973 plus 5%.
Projections without the Project
2.        Projections of LCC revenues and expenditures without the project

ANNEX 11
Page 3
(a) diousing Account
Revenues: Significant revenue is generated from rents charged on
tne city's 14,600 units of low-cost housing. However, rents on these units,
which range from K 3 to over K 29 per month, do not generate sufficient revenue
to cover the financial costs of providing the housing. Site and services
schemes have also been priced at subsidized levels. Government grants were
eliminated as of January 1974, and all council housing including serviced
sites are expected to be financially self-supporting by 1975. It is assumed
that there will be a 30% increase in rents at the end of 1974, now awaiting
Ministerial approval, and another 20% increase before 1978.
Expenditures: It is assumed that there will be no new construction
in housing beyond the site and services plots already under preparation.
A 3% per year increase in costs is assumed from 1975 onwards. This figure
allows for a sliglit decrease (1%) in the rise of expenditures as rental uniDts
are sold oy Council and is consistent with past trends in the absence of new
debt financing.
(b)  Water Account
Revenues: The water and sewerage operations are described in detail
in Annrex 10. A tariff increase of approximately 20% is assumed at the end of
1977, with a 3 to 5% annual revenue growth for expansion from 1975-1981.
dxpenditures: It is assumed that tnere will be a moderate expansion
of the Lusaka distribution system, a reduction in wastage, and an increased
use of the cheaper local ground water sources so that the Kafue scheme does
not nave to be expanded by 1981. As a result, expenditures are assumed to
inicrease at approximately 10% up to 1975 and then 5% thereafter.
(c) Sewerage Account
Revenues: It is assumed that there will be a 10% tariff increase
at tlhe e.ud of 1974 and 8% p.a. revenue growth for expansion in 1975 and thlere-
:after up to 1981. This would reduce and stabilize but not eliminate the
leficit position.
Expenditures:  Approximately half as marny households in Lusaica are
served with sewerage as are currently served with water, and there seems to be
a fairly signiificant demand for additional sewerage services. however, Gover:n
ment restrictions are expected to reduce growth in this account with the result
that sewerage expenditures are assumed to increase by approximately 6% from
1975.
(d) General Rate Fund Account
Revenues: Leneral Rate Fund revenues come from essentially three
sources: personal levy, property taxes, and Government grants.



ANNEX 11
Page 4
(i)  The personal levey is a local income tax on all persons whose
annual income exceeds K 120.  It is collected at source by the
Council from all Lusaka residents of or above the age of 18.
There was a growth of approximately 950% between 1966 and 1972
when the population increased by approximately 90%. The proj-
ected levy yields from 1975 to 1981 assume an average annual
increase of about 8 to 10% which is not unreasonable in view
of past trends.
(ii) Rates (property tax) are levied oa nearly all titled real prop-
erty; land at 3% of valuation and improvements at 8.5%. A major
revenue leakage occurs in squatter areas since no form of title
has been issued in the past, thereby excluding about 42% of the
city's population from paying property tax. Property tax reven-
ue grew by about 20% annually between 1966 and 1972. For the
purpose of formulating projections, it is assumed that a city-
wide property revaluation will take place in 1975 and improve-
ments will be revalued upward by an average of 150% and land
by 75%.  A conservative estimate has been made that only 25%
of the revaluation will be passed on to taxpayers in 1978,
which assumes a significant decrease in the rates schedule.
As Lusaka already has the lowest rates in the country, this
step would significantly increase the scope for additional
revenue from this account.
(iii) Miscellaneous fees and fines are assumed to grow at approximately
5% per annum. This figure is somewhat below previous growth
rates in order to adjust for the expansion resulting from the
creation of Greater Lusaka in 1970.
(iv) Government grants have been provided in the past to Councils
for specific purposes, such as housing, consultancy services,
and preventative health. As of January 1974 all Government
grants were discontinued with the exception of those for
preventative health.
Expenditures: In view of the growth trend in General Rate Fund
expenditures between 1966 and 1972 wiiicli was at an annual rate of about 16%,
due only in part to the city's physical expansion, the recent restriction by
Government limiting Council to an annual overall 5% rise in expenditure is
lot expected to be achieved in this account.  Expenditures are projected to
increase by at least 7% over the 1972-75 period, and 8% from 1975 to 1981.
(e) Liquor Undertaking Account
Revenues: The City Council liquor undertaking, which is responsible
for producing and selling a heavy opaque beer, consists of a brewery, a bottling
plant, and 15 city-owned taverns. The taverns sell a regular private-brand
clear bottled beer, spirits, minerals, cigarettes, and peanuts as well as the
opaque beer which is sold from the tap. The bottling plant bottles opaque
beer to be sold in private licensed taverns in the city.



ANNEX 11
Page 5
The account is currently running a deficit which has been attributed
primarily to bad management. A management review initiated in July 1973
resulted in some major changes in November 1973 with the result that between
November and January 1974 revenues picked up by 20%.  Revenue projections for
this account anticipate continuing improvements in management resulting in
recovery of revenues lost in recent years. The major jump occurs between 1972
and 1975 when income is expected to rise by about 12% per annum, stabilizing
at 8% from 1975 to 1982.
Expenditures: Expenditures have risen by between 8-11% per annum
over the seven years from 1966 to 1973. Government imposed restrictions have
cut projected expenditures back to 7% in 1973 and 5% thereafter.
Projections with the Project
3.        The annual flow of funds to and from Lusaka City Council arising
from the project as of the first five years of project operations are as

4.        The above table is based on the following assumptions:
(a)  Expenditures include debt service and operating costs.  Revenues
include income from residential, commercial and other monthly



ANNEX 11
Page 6
payments based on current or proposed tariffs described in
para. 2, and in the case of the General Rate Fund, user
charges and fees.
(b) The sewerage investment, e.g., for the northeast main trunk
sewer, will serve a larger population than the project
beneficiaries and therefore not all debt servicing is attri-
butable to project participants. Revenues thereby generated
would create a surplus on this account.
(c) Revenues from the General Rate Fund are based on nominal rate
charges to site and services plotholders and residents in squatter
--and overspill areas from 1976-1978.  This charge will be reviewed
in about 1979. Based on the value of serviced land and an average
house vlaue of K 200 in squatter and overspill areas and K 750 in
site and services areas, the estimated yield thereafter would be
about K 281,000 per annum compared to K 48,000 shown in the above
table (1978).
5.        The ability of Lusaka City Council to carry the burden of the
project is demonstrated in the following table which shows the results of
superimposing the above flow of funds (assuming up to 10% of plotholders
default) on the projected city finances:

The pro Jct would not exert a significant strain on LCC finances in 1978
and assuming normal growth in both income and expenditures, it should not
in the following years.
Risk
7.        Even in the event that up to 30% of project households defaulted,
the city would still be able to meet its obligations comfortably.  The
resulting project deficit represnts only 8.8% of LCC's net annual surplus
without the project in 1978, dropping to 3.4% in 1981. Thereafter, revenues
generated from the increasing usage of the primary sewerage facilities provided
under the project will continue to reduce this percentage.

ZAMBIA
LUSAKA SQUAITER UPGRADING AND SITE AND SERVICES PROJECT
Project Monitoring and Evaluation
1.        Monitoring is a recording and analysis of information on a periodic
basis for feedback into project implementation. It is essentially a manage-
ment tool for effective control and execution of the project. Evaluation is
an analysis of anticipated as well as unexpected effects of the project on the
individual household and on urban and regional social and economic patterns.
2.        It is currently anticipated that all site and services projects
financed by the Bank will be monitored as defined above, and at least three,
including Lusaka, may be evaluated. The Lusaka project is considered appro-
priate for evaluation for the following reasons:
(a) the diversity of project components;
(b) the existence of a strong data base;
(c) the scale of the project and its potential impact
on the city and the region; and
(d) the possibility of utilizing the evaluation results in
the review of an on-going national urban shelter program
which has strong Government support.
Procedures for Monitoring and Evaluation
3.        Monitoring would include:
(a)  a baseline census of project participants and of central
groups in other areas of Lusaka to be carried out before
project implementation;
(b) a physical survey of the city involving aerial photographs,
to be carried out before implementation. A census of housing
conditions should be part of this survey;
(c) period reports based on the progress of essential infrastruc-
ture and services.



ANNEX 13
Page 2
4.        Evaluation would include surveys and analyses of points such as:
(a) the amount and nature of self-help activities generated by
the project;
(b) the nature and amount of housing investment in project areas;
(c)  changes in household income, consumption and savings patterns;.
(d) growth of employment and income opportunities;
(e) improvements in health and nutrition;
(f)  rates of and reasons for default in payments;
(g) impact of the project on central and local government
finances; and
(h) effect of the project on the general housing situation
in Lusaka.
5.        The final research design would be formulated by representatives
of Government, the Bank, and other participating agencies before major
project activities begin.
6.        It is considered that evaluation would require a full-time primary
field researcher familiar with Lusaka and a secondary researcher. The eval-
uation team would be closely linked with the Project Unit in order to facili-
tate the exchange and flow of information. It is expected that a formal
affiliation with a local institution--preferably a national one--would pro-
vide the potential basis for extending evaluation activities beyond the two
years envisaged under the Bank research program.
