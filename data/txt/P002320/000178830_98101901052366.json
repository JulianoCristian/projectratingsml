Dakar's\n            position as a port of transfer for neighboring countries by\n            provision of additional facilities and rehabilitation of\n            existing ones and by strengthening the Port's\n            management and operations. The project provides for: (i)\n            construction of new infrastructure for container handling,\n            including construction of a 430 m long quay wall, reclaiming\n            of an 8.2 ha area for container handling, paving and\n            installation of some port facilities; (iii) consultant\n            services and technical assistance for project supervision,\n            financial management and operations, information systems and\n            procedures, and tariff and port management studies; and (iv)\n            training of port staff in operations, management and finance."}, "docdt": "1984-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
