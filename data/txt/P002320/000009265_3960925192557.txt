Dakar Container Port Prolect (Credit 1459-SE/SF 14 SE)
Attached is the "Project Completion Report on Senegal Dakar Container
Port Project 'Credit 1459-SE/SF 14-SE)" prepared by the Africa Regional Office.
The PCR was prepared with the Borrower's full collaboration, and Parts I and It
have been combined.
The Credit (US$7.5 million of April 1984) was to finance portions of
an upgrading program (cofinanced by the Caisas Centrale de Cooperation Economique
and the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development) intended to increase the
port's container handling capacity, and to strengthen the port's organizational
and commercial operations. The Credit was closed, with a 3-year delay largely
due to conversion of the Port Authority into a quasi-independent company, and
was fully disbursed.
Civil works have been completed and the first steps taken for the
eventual commercialization of port operations. The PCR substantiates project
success by noting that re-evaluation of physical improvements shows an economic
rate of return of 25, as against 23S estimated at appraisal, even though
different benefit streams are associated in the two cases. The PCR describes
acceptably most aspects of project design and implementation.   Overall, the
project is rated as satisfactory, its sustainability as likely, and its
institutional impact as substantial.
The PCR leaves unanswered certain questions with a possible bearing
on Bank-financed port improvement projects in other parts of Africa -- what was
the role of the co-financiers in project supervision and how do they regard
project results; what is the impact of cumbersome customs procedures and of labor
unions on the productivity of a modern container port; if problematic land
transport access to the port area was known since years before appraisal, why did
the project contain no provision for their alleviationt over how long a period
should uncompleted components of one project be passed on to the following one.
Plans are underway to audit the Dakar Container Port Project together with the
1977 Dakar Fishing Port Project.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Dakar Container Port Project,
for which Credit 1459-SE/SF 14-SE in the amount of US$2.65 million equivalent from IDA and
US$4.85 million equivalent from the Special Fund administered by IMA was approved on April 17,
1984. The credit was closed on June 30, 1992. It was filly disbursed and the last disbursement was
on March 6, 1992.
The PCR was joindy prepared by IDA and Port Autonome de Dakar (PAD). It is
based on the Staff Appraisal Report; the Credit and Project Agreements; supervision reports;
correspondence between the IDA and the Borrower; and internal Bank memoranda.

(CREDIT 1459-SE/SP 14SE'
EVALI,A77ON SUMMARX
The objecdves of the project were: (a) to reduce freight costs by incrasg the port"'s
capacity to handle containers and through the rehabtiion and manan  of other
frstructures; and (b) to stengthen the organization of the port and its commercial operation as
an autonomous public enterprise.
mbpeinetain Easerience
Project execution was planned to etend through the end of 1988; nonetheless, the closing
date of the credit was extended three times to allow for implementation of the operating, technical
and financial plan designed to strengthen port organization following the port's conversion into a
Soci&t6 Nationale.
Reflult
The project was designed to enable the Port Autonome de Dakar (PAD) to meet the
expected growth of traffic over a period of 10 to 15 years, and to ensure that its operadons enable
users to lower their costs in terms of vessel service time and related charges.
Construction of the container terminal has now made it possible for larger vessels than
before to use the port and has increased the number of containers that can be handled, thereby
reducing unit freight and handling costs. The introduction of the terminal has improved port
operating conditions: container traffic formerly had only four-and-one-half hectares of storage
space and was dispersed between two different locations; the new terminal has expanded the area
for container storage by an additional five hectares.
As regards management, PAD bas a new organizational structure that incorporates all
functions required for port management on a commarcial basis.
The final result of the post-project economic evaluation is an economic rate of return of
25%, very close to the SAR's figure of 23%.
Despite these results, certain difficulties still hamper the optimal exploitation of port
facilities. In particular, customs procedures are still lengthy and complicated. The stevedores
employed by private operators are inefficient, being paid by the hour rather than at piece rates,
and congestion in the immediate port surroundings makes access for operators difficult.



While the project has contnbuted toward the rationalization of the port in spatial terms, it
has even more importandy been an essential factor for the conversion of PAD) Int an enterprise
furnished with modem management instruments and equipped to defend its position in the context
of heightened competition.
Findings and Lessons Learned
The implementation of the project has been characterized by Insistence on the balanced
treatment of two major aspects of the program; the physical investment and institutional and
management reforms were given equal importance with the latter having been pursued even after
execution of the works.
The conversion of PAD into a Societe Nationale and the capabilities developed in the
course of the project have enabled sound management of the port facilities which is continuing
with the new project; however, the inappropiiate interventions by the supervisory authority in the
uning of the port tend to limit its efficiency.
Eecution of the project made it possible to cre3te a framework for dialogue and
coordination between PAD and the other parties Involved in port activity and has servee to
prompt reforms in their method of operation, as is the case with the reorganization of customs
procedures.

PROJE(:I COMPLETION REPORT
A.           Project Identity
Project name:       Dakar Container Port Project
Project number:     Credit 1459-SE/SF 14 SE
Regional office:    Africa
Country:            Senegal
Sector:             Transport
Subsector:          Ports
B.           Background
1.           Sector development objectives: the Dakar Container Port Project prepared in 1982
was IDA's third operation in the maritime transport subsector. The World Bank Group had already
been very active in the transport sector in Senegal, having financed five highway, four r",road and
two civil aviation projects in addition to two port projects.
2.           At the beginning of the 1980s, the transport sector in Senegal was characterized by
major disparities between transport modes and a concentration of activities in Dakar and the
surrounding region. The growth of road transport, which is now the dominant mode, had led to the
deterioration of rail and river/maritime transport. The port of Dakar remained a major asset in light
of Senegal's role as transit country, and, a maritime transportation strategy was developed taking into
account the need of the inland transport corridors.
3.           The Sixth Economic and Social Development Plan (198148) established the following
guidelines for the transportation sector:
-     better coordination of transportation;
-     priority for maitenance and strengthening of existing infrastructures in order to
preserve transportation supply capacity and ensure enhanced productivity;
-     reduction in the capital costs and recurrent charges of projects.
4.           In the specific area of maritime transport, the policy adopted was to provide port
infrastructure to enable Dakar to become a major subregional port, capable of providing efficienly

for international tursit traffic for neighboring countries without access to the sea, or lacking
satisfactory port facilities.
In this context, the establishment of a container terminal was seen as appropriate,
along with the upgrading of port operating conditions.
C.           Project objectives and description
5.           The main project objectives were:
(a)   to reduce freight costs by increasing the port's capacity to handle containers and
through the rehabilitation and maintenance of other infrastructures; and
(b)   to strengthen the organization of the port and its commercial operation as an
autonomous public enterprise.
6.           The main project components were:
(a)    Civil works
(i)  construction of a 430-m quay wall to permit simultaneous berthing of two large
container vessels with a draught of 11.5 m;
(ii)  dredging of areas alongside the berth and from the port entrance to the terminal
area; hydraulic sand filling of the area behind the quay wall to reclaim a container
handling area of 8.2 ha;
(iii)  paving of the container handling area and installation of access roaL and various
services;
(iv) rehabilitation and deferred maintenance of certain port facilities;
(v)   assistance to the Port Autonome de Dakar (PAD) to supervise container terminal
construction and train personnel to supervise this work;
(b)    Strengthening port organization and operations:
(i) a study of the management of the container terminal and training of PAD
persomnnel in the management and operation of a container terminal;
(ii)  technical assistance and training to (a) improve port management and operations,
(b) improve the accounting system and financial management procedures, (c) carry
out a financial and management audit, (d) make a study of tariff structures,
(e) evaluate information processing needs and introduce a new  mnement
information system, and (t) improve the management of information and control
systems.

D.           ProJect concept and organization
7.           As part of the fuiancing of the Fishing Port Project (Loan 1405-SE) a feasibility study
was conducted to assess the port's needs in tenns of improving its container handling facilities by the
mid-1980s, it being evident by the end of the 1970s that containerization was developing very rapidly.
Consultants for Port of Marseille (PAM) executed the technica! and economic feasibility studies; the
project developed from the review of the consultants' recommendations. Preparation, pre-appraisal
and appraisal missions were organized by the Bank in 1982 and 1983, with the active participation of
the CCCE and the Kuwait Fund, which participated in project financing. After a careful review of
the alternatives identified by the feasibility studies and of port operations, which left no doubt thct, the
port's performance could be substantially improved, the definitive configuration of the project was
prepared. Negotiat ons took place in February 1984 in Paris and the project was presented to the
Bank's Board in April 1984; the Credit became effective in January 1985.
8.           The estinated cost of the project at appraisal was CFAF 7,694 million excluding
taxes; it was to be financed as follows:
(In CFAF million)
IDA            2,931
CCCE           2,607
KF             1,604
PAD
7,694
The contributions from the three donors financed construction of the container
terminal and the technical assistance component; the, leferred maintenance component was financed by
the IDA credit and PAD.
9.           PAD was responsible for projet execution, with the assistance of consultants. An
action plan to improve PAD management and operations was approved during the negotiadons. The
terminal construction works were to be carried out on contract and supervised by consultants, who
were to train PAD personnel in this activity. The PAD infrastructure department was responsible for
supervising the other work done under the deferred maintenance program component.
The civil works were to be phased over 27 months, with start-up planned for October
1984; the technical assistance program was to continue until 1988.
E.           Project execution
10.          Project execution was planned to extend through the end of 1988, by which date the
container terminal construction works were completed. The Credit was nonetheless ex dten   three
times (1988, 1989 and 1990) to allow for hiplemention of the operating, technical and fiacial
plan designed to strengthen port organization and opeaions following the port's conversion into a
SocWtW Nadonale. 1Te execution of each project component is discsed below.



- 4 -
11.          lhe works for the cottlUtIucon of the container terminal were executed in three
separate lots, as follows: (i) construction of the quays and breakwater, (ii) dredging and filling works
and (iii) access roads and services. Despite a six-month delay in the start-up and execution of the
works in lots 2 and 3, attributable to contract award procedures, overall the works were executed
within the timeframe envisaged to enable the container terminal to become operational at the end of
1987. lbere was an overrun of CFAF 628 million on these works as a result of the high cost of the
contract for lot 3 and also because of the fact that a significant part of their execution was
subcontracted. The terminal was brought into operation In January 1988.
12.          The port rehablUtation works consisted of: (i) repairs to gutters, (ii) paving of mole 8
and renovation of the water supply, and finally (iii) provision of quay defenses and accessories. These
works, which were put up for local bidding and sup.rvised by PAD, were seriously delayed (12
months) as a result of inefficient supervision and the poor performance of the companies selected; these
could not be replaced because of the complexities of the regulations governing procurement and public
contracts applicable to PAD before its change of status. Finally, IDA and PAD agreed that the work
should be performed by port personnel, with the assistance of selected contractors; PAD financed all
the works, with IDA covering the cost only of the quay defenses and accessories. These works were
poorly executed at high cost, the final cost of CFAF 652 million being double the initial estimate
because of the additional work made necessary by the unsatisfactory performance of the companies
initially selected.
13.          The preparation of the operating, technia and financial plan established the need
for changing the status of PAD from that of an EPIC (Etablissement I Caractere Industriel et
Commercial) into a SocWid Natlonate with autonomous management and operating on a commercial
basis. A charter acceptable to IDA was prepared and PAD became a Socite Natdonale on August 18,
1987. A new management structure, with a new organization, was introduced and an operating and
technical plan was prepared, with the technical assistance of Port de Havre and Bossard Consultants,
to support the new organization.
14.          The srngthednig of port organization and operations was achieved through the
implementation of this operating and technical plan which was executed in two phases, as follows:
0     The frst phase consisted of the intuction of the new organizational structure,
involving the institutionalization of the functions identified as necessary for good port
facilites management: operations, finance and administration, human resources,
programming and management control. This change of structmue was complemented
by the planning and introducdon of instruments for cost accounting and budgetary
control, management indicators for technical functions, finances, operations and
pesonnel, the creation and introduction of a reliable and appropriate statistical system
and, finally, the introduction of software for these functions to be computerized. The
greater part of this work was completed in 1989.
*     During the second phase, for which the Credit was extended, the work of the previous
phase was consolidated. This phase saw a change in the utilizaion of the technical
assistance, which was employed only occasionally, to support the intoducton of
various acvities by PAD personnel. The following tasks were undetaken in the
second phase:



-5 -
introduction of a new tariff structure and of a system for forecasting receipts;
-     establishment of an investment programming and monitoring unit;
-     creation of a maintenance management division with a system for scheduling tasks and
organizing the management of maintenance operations: however, this unit did not
become operational since it was decided to carry out 80% of maintenance works by
contracts;
-     adjustment of the master plan for computerization and implementation of the new
approaches adopted;
-     evaluation of personnel needs; the adjustment of personnel numbers and preparation of
a training plan are under way. It is now time to proceed to a qualitative phase to
improve the match of employee skills and positions;
-     promotion of the commercial and development function which monitors inter-port
competition, and is responsible for meeting shipowners' and shippers' requirements in
terms of the quality, speed and cost of PAD services;
-     the organization of operations, through the reorganization and rationalization of space
use of the port to prevent its active areas from being paralyzed;
-     finally, the definition and gradual implementation of a program for the technical
rehabilitation of port facilities, which is currenty being pursued as part of the port
component of the new transportation sector adjustment project (ISAP-Credit 2266
SE).
In general terms the Transport Sector Adjustment Project (TSAP) is continuing to
consolidate the measures and actions initiated as part of this operating plan.
15.          Total expenditure at project completion was CFAF 8.9 billion as against the appraisal
estimate of CFAF 7.7 billion; this overrumn of some 16% was borne entirely by PAD, whose
contribution increased from CFAF 552 million to CFAF 1,756 million. The overrun was essentially
attributable to the additional work needed in the context of rehabilitation, to price increases for the
works in lot No. 3 and exchange rate losses between the SDR and the CFAF.
16.          Apart from the delays in awarding works contacts and the personnel changes that
occurred at the start of the supervision phase, the project was implemented satisfactorily. The poor
quality of the rehabilitation work was due to poor performance by the companies selected; it was
difficult for PAD, as an EPIC, to rescind their contract. The reorganization of the port as a Soct4
Natonale went smoothly, as did the "oduction of the efficiency measures included in the operating
and technical plan.



F.           Project results
17.          Execution of the container terminal project has enhanced the PAD's operating
efficiency by increasing the port's physical capacity in the form of a container terminal with 430 m of
quay, a handling area of 8 ha and a draught of 11.6 m; and through the institutional reforms which
have given PAD, as a Soc!td Nationale, the kind of management autonomy that in many ways can be
comparod with that of a private company.
18.          The project was designed to enable PAD to meet the expected growth of traffic over a
period of 10 to 15 years, and to ensure that its opcrations enable users to lower their costs in terms of
vessel service time and related charges.
19.          Construction of the container terminal now makes it possible for larger vessels than
before to use the Port of Dakar and has increased the number of containers that can be handled,
thereby reducing unit freight costs and handling costs.
20.          The new terminal enables the port to handle container ships in optimum conditions,
with almost no waiting time. The introduction of the terminal has inproved port operating
conditions: container traffic formerly had only 4.5 ha of storage space and was dispersed in two
different locations; the new terminal has expanded the area for container storage by an additional
5 ha.
21.          As regards the traffic in the principal products recorded at the Port of Dakar, in 1988
actua movements were higher than the projections, but in 1992 this trend was reversed and actual
traffic is slightly below projections. The detailed port statistics for the project period are analyzed in
section G. The number of containers increased from 78,000 in 1988 to 84,000 in 1992, a rate
slightly higher than projected. However, actual receipts in 1988 represented 88% of projections and
only 77% in 1991.
22.          As regards management, PAD has a new organizational structure that incorporates all
the functions required for port management on a commercial basis. The new functions in the area of
management control, technical and commercial operations, budget planning and human resource
management are all operational.
23.          Despite these results, certain difficulties are still hampering the optimal exploitation of
port facilities. Specifically:
*     some areas of the port are under-utilized because they are reserved for Price
Equalization and Stabilization Fund (CPSP) rice imports and for the Entrep6ts du Mali
(EMASE) for traffic for Ma:.;
*     customs procedures are still lengthy and complicated;
*     the stevedores employed by private operators are inefficient, being paid by the hour
rather than at piece rates;
*     congestion in the immediate port surrourdings makes access for operators difficult;



*     the new tariff structure was only belatedly adopted on JanuarY 15, 1993.
G.           Economic re-evaluation
Recall of pro}ect objectives
24.          The basic objective of the project was to enable the PAD to respond effectively and at
a reasonable cost to the predictable increase in containerized traffic. The project was also intended to
strengthen Dakar's role as transit port for Malian and Mauritanian traffic, on the one hand, and
transshipments to or from other West African ports, on the other.
25.           The institutional component of the project, following on from previous port projects,
was designed to enable the port of Dakar to increasingly take botn commercial and financial control
of its operations. It was expected that this would improve the operating and financial performance of
the port and lead to the effective utilization of new infrastructures, with a satisfactory level of cost
recovery.
Economic rate of return
26.           The economic analysis of the project at appraiW  was based on a qomparison between
a reference (without project) situation, which consisted of continuing utilization of the old port despite
the increase in congestion due to traffic growth, with a with-project situation in which a new terminal
was constructed and put into service by mid-1987. The life of the facility was established at 25
years. The cost/benefit analysis, contained in Annex 5.8 of the Staff Appraisal Report, sets out the
hypotheses used; on the basis of these hypotheses the internal rate of return for the project was
calculated at 23%. The sensitivity analysis, which tested various hypotheses for cost Increases and a
reduction in, or delays of up to two years in the readization of, project benefits, concluded that the
economic rate of return would not be lower than 17%. Given the uncertainty regarding the benefits
from container traffic in transit or transshipment, the analysis excluded this possible additional gain.
27.           The rate of return on the project has been recalculated in light of the actual data
available through 1992 and revised projections for future years. The data are set out in detail in
Annex 1. The same methodology was used as in the appraisal, but incorporating the new figures
referred to above. The final result of the post-project economic evaluation is an economic rate of
return of 25%, very close to the SAR figure, but for different reasons.
28.           As compared to the initial plans, project effectiveness and start-up were six months
behind schedule; work started in 1985 rather than 1984 and the new terminal was put into service in
January 1988 rather than mid-1987. The breakdown of project benefits is summarized in the table
below, from which it is evident that: (i) the gains in ship service time were larger than expected for
the Ro-Ro vessels and in particular for conventional ships in the old port, (ii) the reduction in
handling costs was generally of the same order of size of magnitude initially projected, with a more
significant contribution from the conventional ships in the old pott, and (iii) the gains from ending the
double transport of containers were less than initially anticipated.



Conclusions from the economic re-evaluation
29.           Proected/Actual Comparison: Overall, the traffic projections in the SAR turned out
to be optimistic. Nonetheless, the wrafflc with a direct impact on the rate of return from the project
(traditional traffic, containers and merchandise in bags) increased more than was expected in 1984.
The growth of activity at the new terminal, although one year behind schedule in relation to the
projections, greatly exceeded those projections both in terms of the level of traffic and its rate of
owth. This trend is gradually weakening and projected traffic in 1995 is close to the low hypothesis
:ontained in the SAR. Except for Ro-Ro vessel traffic, the gains in ship service time have been
smaller than expected. Savings on handling costs have been far below the projections,2 as have
savings deriving from ending the double transport of containers in the old port. It should be stressed
that the basic economic reevaluation excluded containers in transshipment, since this activity was
entirely the result of bringing the new tertninal into service.
30.            Sensitivity analysis of the results: The model used for the economic calcuations for
the project enabled sensitivity tests to be made to indicate the economic benefits associated with
operational performance. Hence a 10% improvement in container handling performance from 1995
increases the rate of return on the project by 1.50%. Redistributing part of the performance gains to
the stevedores by increasing the hourly cost of teams by 10% still increases the rate of return
(+0.49%). This ought to lead the port authorities to encourage the stevedoring companies to
negotiate minimum handling rates for the teams of dockers, and not to hesitate to link remuneration to
actual performance. Finally, if all containerized traffic at the Port of Dakar is included in the
economic reevaluation (impact of ending the double transport of containers on cost reduction), the
rate of return increases from 25.05% to 29.88%. In practice the real effective rate of return on the
project lies somewhere within this range.

31.          The Summary table above merits the following comments: the lower gain for
container ships in the new terminal (16% as against 39% in the SAR) is a result of the actual handling
rate for this kind of ship (30% below the projections), pardy attributable to the reduction of time in
port (generally a few hours) which entails a relative reduction in the time required for stuffing and
unloading operations as compared to ship movement. On the other hand, the performance of the Ro-
Ro ships was better than expected.
32.          The model indicates the project's impact on the conventional port, both in terms of
ship service time and handling costs, as a result of the improvement in operating conditions at that
port, where increasing congestion was hampering operations. This improvement has been confirmed
by port users and authorities.
33.          Finally, the gains relating to double transport of containers in the old port are lower
than anticipated because of the less favorable trend in container traffic growth after 1995, despite its
faster than expected growth between 1988 and 1992.
H.           Financial Re-evaluation
34.          Overview: The objective to increase revenues and improve financial profitability was
fully achieved until FY88, but PAD's financial performance deteriorated in later years due to a
reduction in tariff increases at a time of mounting labor costs and accumulation of bad debt. PAD
warned only a token profit of about CFAF 200 million in FY91. Tbe ongoing Transport Sector
Adjustment/Investment Program CrAIP) provides a comprehensive technical assistance package
designed to solve problems experienced under the Dakar Container Port Project.
35.          Diaenosis made at appraisal: Tariff levels were deemed too low. Ihe Port received
no subsidy from Government, and even earned a nominal profit, but only becae assets and
corresponding depreciation were undervalued, and maintenance was deferred. The cash generation,
already short of asset renewal needs was furtier curtiled by the ca-h pooling arrangements applicable
to public enterprises in Senegal: funds in excess of current port requirements would be siphoned off
to support other deficit making activities. Government agencies were increasingly in arrears for
payment of port bills, and net receivables represented a disturbing 3540% of annual revenues in the
early eighties; arrears connected to the Dakar-Gotee ferry and the natioa beacons and buoys service
were felt especially worrisome.
36.          Stateg   pursued under the Project: Restored profitability would be sought through
increased financial autonomy and full-cost recovery. Arrangements would be made to ensure that
PAD would retain 70-80% of its anmnal cash flow. Strengthened internal Controls would be developed
under the project to contain costs and substtute the a-priori controls by Goverament. The tariff
system was to be changed to improve cash generation ad ear a minimum 6% return on port
investments starting FY88. Arrangements wold be made for timely payment of their bills by
Government agencies.
37.          Major risks perceiyed: Failure to achieve the institonal development toward
improvement of financial management was considered a major risk for potential failure of the heavy



- 10-
invesument in a container terminal. he traffic forecast was not deemed critical to achieving a healthy
fuiancial stats.
38.          riecLfinauiialOSOM    Summary financial statements are in Annex 2 and
commented upon in the following paragraphs.
39.          With traffic materializing slightly higher than forecast, operating revenues rose from
Cfaf 3.6 billion in FY82 to CFAF 7.5 billion in FY90 at an annual rate of 9.6% on average.
Following their up-front 13% increase in FY84, port tariffs were to be adjutd each year for
inflation of about 10% to generate the larger cash flows needed to fnace the project. Increases of
about 7% annually proved to be sufficient; but concern that the international competitivity of the
port of Dakar was endangered led to a decrease of some tariffs in FY90. As a result, the actual FY90
revenue was 17% below target. As traffic stagnated in the following years, cash generation was
fiurher reduced.
40.          At the same time, working expenses grew faster than anticipated (13% anually on
average). Labor costs significandy increased following the establishment of the port of Dakar as a
Socleti Natonale, doubling from CFAF 1.3 billion in FY86 to CFAF 2.6 billion in FY90. But they
remained in constant proportion (52%) to total working expenses over FY83-90 which indicates that
problems were also experienced in containing other costs (fuel and ener, materials, maintenance,
third-party services). The working ratio remained close to forecast undl FY88, and deteriorated
thereafter to reach 0.7 in FY90 (difference of more than 50%). The gap between the forecast and
actual operating ratios is lower because depreciation was smaller than expected late in the period.
41.          The exoneration of income taxes graned by the Government, a depamre from the
strategy envisaged at appraisal, had a major Impact on cash accmulation. Statg FY87, the port of
Dakar was entitled to deduct taxes due from a credit equivaent to its investment in the coniner
terminal. Until the end of the period, tax payments by the port were limited to annual minimum of
CFAF 400,000 whereas the forecast provided for cumulative payment of taxes to a total of CFAF 1.9
billion over the period. As the problem of casb diversion to the Treasury had be  eliminated cash
accumulated rapidly to some CFAF 8.5 billion in FY89 which was expeced to financ the tird
periodic maintenance works. The cash glut led PAD to seek bank that would pay iert on
deposits, and over FY88-90, close to CFAF 500 milion In intert was eaned annually. But the port
of Dakar got caught in the Bank crisis in Senegal, eventually losing a su tal portion (close to
CFAF 3 billion) of its deposits. The cash acumdation may also have contributed to departng fom
targeted tariff increases, which will make it more difficult to catch up under conditions of st_ang
traffi:.
42.          Collection of bills and arrears was found weak and worrisome at appraisal, but the
lending conditionality and other provisions under the project proved ineffective. lbe setement of
crossed debts with the public sector finally took place in FY91 under SAL IV conditlonalities. The
gross account receivables grew from CFAF 4 billion in FY84 to CFAF 6.5 billion in FY90. 'ho
economic downtun in Senegal caused financial difficulties to many port customern. Improved
management of the clients accounts was one of the msu   taken to slow down the accumulation of 
arrears, but efforts were often thwated by Govenmen backing of delinquent public enterprises and
foreign agencies (EMASE). Large portions of the account receivables had to be wrten off (the
provision for bad debt had gone from CFAF 0.7 billion in FY85 to more d    CFAF 4 billion in
FY91). This most critical issue is being tcked under the TSAIP, and the average collection period



which remained around 200 days over FY85-89 went down to 100 days in FY91 but has recently
increased again.
43.          One of the Project's main achievements has been setting up of new financW
management systems. All financial accounting in the past was done outside the port, contained errors
and produced late statements. It is now handled by PAD itself, and annual statements are being
produced regularly, if with considerable delay, within three months after the end of the financial year.
Audits have been produced regularly, but with considerable delay-due mainly to the fact that one of
the three auditors (commissaires aux conptes) Imposed on PAD has performed very poorly. These
improvements are being supported and expanded under the ongoing TSAIP.
1.           SustainabilHty of the Project Impacts
44.          The establishment of TAC has made it possible to increase the total area reserved for
storing containers, thereby developing the potential for handling this type of traffic. However, in
1991 TAC received 70% of the port's container traffic, with the result that the terminal's container-
handling areas are nearing saturation (over 54,000 TEU against the 50,000 TEU envisioned when the
project was first designed).
45.          This saturation is due to the congestion of the southern part of the port by urban road
±a3iC, which has led to container traffic suddenly shifting to the northern part where the three largest
operators are located. The first phase of the establishment of a container terminal quicldy reached its
limit and the second phase is blocked by the presence of the Compagnie de Phosphate's insallations
in the terminal's expansion area; a temporary remedy has been provided by construction of about 6 ha
of container-handling space in the area adjoining it. A fuure solution for implementtion of the
second phase is to provide storage capacity outside of the present port area so as to avoid the space
reserved for containers becoming satuated quicker tn expected.
46.          The container traffic, which reprsents less than 10% by volume of the port's total
traffic, generates on average 37% of its total revenues; consequeny, an increase in container traffic
can only be favorable for improving port revenues.
47.          While the project has contrbuted toward rationalization of operadon of the port in
spatial terms, it has even more importandy been an essental factor for the conversion of PAD into an
enterprise furnished with modem management instrumens and equipped to defend its position in a
context of heightened competition.
J.           Bank Performace
48.          The Bank has been very active in the asport sector in Senegal and in a maridme
transport in particular; the TAC project, the third port project, has enabled the Bank to deepen the
dialogue with the borrower in the implementation of the istional reorn. This dialogue was
developed in the course of the regulasupervision missons s by the Bank durng the execution of
the project. This facilkeed the preparation of the port compont of the TSAIP, which focuse on
consolidation of the measures undertaken in the context of the TAC project.



- 12 -
49.          The different Bank supervision missions were composed of multidisciplinary teams
and made up for the long intervals between the missions of the Kuwait Fund, the cofinancier of the
project. Moreover, the Bank facilitated the bringing together of the different sector operators in the
preparation and implementation of measures affecting them (forwarding agents, stevedoring
companies, customs and the railway company, etc.). Finally, the Bank and the Caisse Centrale de
Cooperation Economique have ensured that the technical assistance provided to the port resulted in a
transfer of knowhow in the implementation of the investments through development of PAD's
capability in works supervision, and in the sphere of port operation; while at the start of the project
PAD did not have qualified personnel, it now has a competent management team in place for the
different port functions.
K.           Borrower Peorumace
50.          Despite the considerable time taken over adoption of the legislation converting PAD
into a Socit Nationale, the borrower has carried out all the actions specified in the credit agreement;
in particular, the financial resources and the technical assistance have been properly used. Moreover,
the cost overruns in the execution of the project have all been covered by PAD without major
difficulties. The port and government authorities involved in the implementation of the reforms
successfully performed the different task within their areas of responsibility during the reorganization
of PAD.
51.          At the start of the project the PAD-EPIC services showed weaknesses in the
supervision of the rebabilitation works due to the inexperience of their technical staff, although this
was foreseeable at the time the project was prepared and was taken care of during its execution by the
assistance furnished by the consultant engaged for the purpose. A competent team was progressively
built up with this assistance. PAD, once reorganized as a SocWtt Natonale has been able to hire
qualified personnel, as a result of which management has improved and the port is today being run by
a highly motivated team.
52.          However, despite the supervisory authority's declared intent to give PAD the
autonomy consistent with its status as a SocWt Nadonale, it is still continuing to intervene in the
running of the company: for instance in decisions on approval of certain port works projects, the
blocking of tariff adjustments and intervention in favor of users in arrears with payments. The
services responsible for urban security have still not dealt with the problems connected with the
congestion of the areas immediately adjoining the port, which renders port access difficult, although
on this point there seems to be tacit complicity on the part of the port in that it has been sufficiently
forceful to discourage development of the surrounding matket.
L            Lason Learned
53.          The implementation of the project has been characterized by insistence on the
balanced treatment of two major aspecs of the program: the physical investment and institional and
management reforms were given equal impoce with the latter having even been pursued after
execution of the works.



- 13 -
54.          The conversio. of PAD into a SociEti Nadonate and the capabilities developed in the
course of the project have enabled sound management of the port facilities which is continuing with
the new project; however, the inappropriate interventions by the supervisory authority in the running
of the port tend to limit its efficiency.
55.          Execution of the project has made it possible to create a framework for dialogue and
coordination between PAD and the other parties involved in port activity and has served to prompt
reforms in their method of operation, as is the case with the reorganization of customs procedures.
M.           ProJect Relations
56;          As noted above, the project has provided a framework for coordination among the
different parties involved in maritime transport, with a view to having the port of Dakar play its
proper role in order to improve the competitiveness of this sector and of Senegal in general; for
instance, regular contacts are now organized between the railway company and PAD in the interests
of improving transit conditions for goods for Mali. The same applies in the case of the customs, with
the aim of preventing customs procedures from becoming obstacles to the port's activities in the
import-export sphere. In a strictly operational context, PAD now meets weekly, in the Harbor
Master's office, with the TAC users in order to remove any constraints observed on optimal operation
of the terminal.
57.          The collaboration with the different cofinanciers has developed as a result of the good
quality of the data provided by the port thanks to the information system put in place by the project,
which has facilitated the formulation, within the framework of PAST (Projet d'Ajustement Sectoriel
des Transports), of PAD's investment operations leading to the significant rehabilitation program for
its water, electricity and telephone and road systems. The port authorities nevertheless regretted the
communication difficulties with the Kuwait Fund in mobilizing their financing, which meant that the
port was in fact never able to mobilize a portion of this financing in an amount of about CFAF 900
million.
N.           Consultant Serices
58.          The project provided for 206 man-months of consultant services and technical
assistance: of which 60 for long-term technical assistance in operation and financial management, 50
for construction works supervision, 30 for the tariff study and other studies on management of the
container terminal, 42 for upgrading of operation and, finally, 24 for development of the daabase and
traffic statistics. ITese resources were effectvely mobilized with the asistance of the Port of
Marseile for technical assistance and works supervision, preparation of the operag plan with the
Port of Hmavre and the Bossard firm and, finally, financial and acon  assistance from the firms of
Helios, Coopers and Lybrand, and Aziz Dieye. These services extended over three yeas longer than
originally scheduled, as a result of the decision to bring in the technical assistance only imermitteny
in the last years of project execution.

0.            Documentation
59.           The project appraisal report and subsequently the operating and technical plan were
valuable reference documents in the implementation of the port activities. They provided a good
basis for the preparation of this completion report. The Bank's supervision reports brought out the
essential elements of the execution of the project. The database created with the implementation of
the project has enabled the regular publication of progress reports thanks to which it has been possible
to detail the project's results.

Tr^Ei foreasts
The initial traffic forecasts taken into account in the project were prepared by the Port
Autonome de Marseille anc approved by PAD. The tables in Annexes 1 and 2 compare the forecasts
and the actual figures.
1.           Total traffc
Graph I presents the SAR forecasts and the actua figures, revealing that:
-     the estimated and real values were basically similar in 1985 (5.25 million tons), but
diverge increasingly between then and 1995;
-     total traffic grew steadily between 1985 and 1989, rising from 5.24 mil'ion tons to
5.67 million tons, i.e. average annual growth of 2%, but then progressively declines
to a forecast total figure of 5.5 million tons in 1995, hence an annual drop of 0.5%;
-     the development of total traffic is correlated with that of export traffic, because the
actual figures for imports are close to the forecasts made at the time the project was
prepared (1984): an actual 2.9 million tons for imports, compared with 2.7 million
tons estimated in 1985 and 3.3 million tons (1993 estimate) against 3.2 million tons
forecast in 1995;
*the share of export traffic posted a distinct improvement between 1985 and 1990, but
fell off thereafter: 44% in 1985 (forecast 49%), 49% in 1990 (forecast 50%) and
finally 46% in 1992 (forecast 51%) with an estimated 40% in 1995 (initial forecast
52%).
1.1          Import traffic
Import traffic is analyzed for six categories based on method of preparation aud
packaging for shipment: conventional traffic, bagged goods, dry bulk, petroleum products, crude oil
and other bulk liquids.
Conventional b-ifc: the SAR forecast regular growth between 1985 and 1995 from
675,000 tons to 865,000 tons, i.e. average annual growth of 3%. In actual fact the
traffic observed exceeded these forecaus quite considerably right from 1985 (1,284,000
tons actual as against 675,000 toDs forecast, i.e. +90%), and also in 1990
notwithstanding an appreciable falling-off In conventional traffic (1,043,000 tons against
a projected 802,000 tons, i.e. +30%) and probably in 1995 as well, for which 2
million tons is now forewt compared with the initial forecast of 1,535,000 tons
+37%).

Page 2
-  Basegodgs: the forecast and actual figures line up well, bagged goods traffic has
fluctuated around 400,000 tons/year, but the decline expected as of 19'0 has not
materialized.
Dry bulk: dry bulk goods traffic exceeded the forecasts as of 1988 (400,000 tons/year
compared with the 300,000 tons/year initially forecast). The increase in this type of
traffic which the SAR expected to see as of 1990 in fact occurred earlier (1988) and has
been more marked (29% above initial forecasts likely by 1995). It should be noted that
the PAD statistics do not distinguish between dry bulk imports and dry bulk goods for
ICS, which goes a long way toward explaining the phenomenon observed (20%).
- PetoleujM  roducts: the SAR forecasts have not materialized, traffic was expected to
rise steadily between 1985 and 1995, moving up from 640,000 tons/year to 750,00
tons/year. The actual average level has fluctuated around 400,000 tons/year and the
new forecasts for 1995 put it at 600,000 tons, i.e. 20% less than the initial forecasts.
-Crudeoil: as with petroleum products, crude oil traffic has tumed out to be much
lower than forecast: 200,000 against 600,000 tons in 1985 (-67%), 650,000 tons
against 800,000 tons in 1990 (-19%) and probably 600,000 tons as compared with
800,000 tons in 1995 (-25%).
-Other bulk goods: the traffic that was to be generated by ICS activity has not been
recorded separately in the PAD statistics (see comment above).
1.2          Export traMc
The export traffic is also analyzed into six categories based on method of preparation
and packaging: conventional traffic, bagged goods, dry bulk, petroleum products, stores and other
liquid bulk goods.
Cvi onaltic: the SAR forecast regular growth between 1985 and 1995 (from
325,000 tons to 665,000 tons), i.e. relatively vigorous annual average growth of 7%.
In reality, actual traffic has done the opposite, failing steadily between 1985 and 1992
from about 400,000 tons in 1985/86 to 245,000 tons in 1992, i.e. an average drop of
7% . The estimate for 1995 is now 250,000 tons, or 62% less than the initial
production.
Baggdga: despite some marked fluctato  fom one year to another, the
foecasts have matched the actal figures quite well wit baged goods traffic rising
from 175,000 tons to 250,000 tons between 1985/86 and 1992 and expected to exceed
the forcst by 199S (Z0,OW to  ompaed With 190,000 tons, i.e. +32%).
Pbia1k: dry bulk tiffic (essentially pios*e) has not developed as antiipated.
Whereas it was forecast to ris steadily between 1985 and 1995 (from 1.7 million tons
in 1985 to 2 mfllion tons in 1995), this traffic aounted oo 1.6 million tons in 1985,
peaked at 2 million tons in 1988, then fell back to 1.2 mallion tons in 1992. This
level should be maitained between now and 1995.

Petroleum producu: the SAR forecasts saw this traffic rising regularly between 1985
and 1995, from 100,000 tons/year to 200,000 tons/year. The PAD statistics do not
show this traffic separately.
Bunkering: a steady decline in this traffic between 1985 and 1995 was forecast (from
150,000 tons/year to 100,000 tons/year). In actual fact this traffic was posted in the
1989 statistics at 20,000 tons and rose steadily thereafter, reaching 100,U0 tons in
1992.
Othr bulk ggod: the traffic recorded, 200,000 tons in 1985 and 327,000 tons in
1992, is lower than forecast; if petroleum products and other liquid bulk goods are
added, the figures become 295,000 tons for 1985 and 470,000 tons for 1992.
Summing up, with the exception of bagged goods and bunkering, the forecasts have
proven distinctly optimistic, especially as regards dry bulk goods which accounts for the majority of
export traffic (57% in 1992).
2.            1_           traffc
Graph 2 shows the SAR forecasts as compared with actual traffic. The SAR had
taken two scenarios into account, one low and one high. The total containerized traffic figures point
up a significant difference between actual traffic and forecasts in 1985 (67,000 containers as compared
with a forecast of 46,500, i.e. +44%). The trends subsequently converge and the estimate for 1995
(89,000 containers) is we;l above the low scenario (78,600 containers). In conclusion, container
traffic has grown faster than forecast but is expected to match the forecasts by 1995.
2.1           Full containers
Although well above the forecast initially (48,000 containers as of 1985, compared
with a forecast of 31,000), actual traffic since then has fallen within the range forecast by the SAR
(64,000 actual containers in 1992, i.e. between the 54,400 low scenario and the 69,600 high scenario.
By 1995 the forecasts near the lower limit of the range, i.e. 65,600 containers as compared with
63,700 in the low scenario.
2.2          Empty containers
The high and low hypotheses for this traffic are virtually the same. On average,
actual traffic has proven to be systematically around 40% higher than forecast.
23           Divion of traffic beween TAC and the old port
Graph 3 represents the development of the division of container traffic between the
new terminal and the old port. Since entering into service in 1988, TAC has captured more than
60% of the port of Dakar's container traffic. Between 1988 and 1992 this percentage rose further,
reaching nearly 75% in 1992, and analysis of the trends indicates that the limit of the breakdown
between TAC and the old port wIll be at around 80%. It is interesting to note that the reidual traffic
in the old port amounts to 20,000 containers in 1992 (18,000/year by 1995) and serves to verify the



23
ADXI
Page 4
assumption used in making the economic calculations of the project's return (44,000 containers/year
as the maximum in the old port). This also indicates that PAD has a residual potential capacity of
about 24,000 containers in the old port.
Benefits expected from the project
0      Shorter ship service times
Forecasts: The construction of the new terminal was intended essentially to-enable container and Ro-
Ro ships to benefit from quicker service times than they could expect in the old port. Moreover, Ro-
Ro ships with fixed ramps and multipurpose ships (carrying a part of their cargo in containers) were
expected to benefit from the easing of congestion in the old port following the entry into service of
the new terminal. The appraisal of the savings in ship service time distinguished between those
deriving from use of the new terminal and those resulting from the improvement of operating
conditions in the old port. For the old port, the analysis also distinguished between multipurpose
ships and conventional traffic. In the same way, the costs per ship-day were determined for each type
of vessel. The project estimated a saving of 256 ship-days with 205 container ships calling at the port
of Dakar. The analysis assumed that only 50% of the ship service time savings would be retained by
the Senegalese economy. The expected growth of traffic volume carried by the Senegalese flag fleet
was taken into account in the analysis by raising this percentage to 60% as of 1992, at which level it
was expected to remain through the end of the period considered for the project (year 2011).
Actual savin=s: The table below compares the SAR forecasts with the actual savings achieved.
Clearly, the hypotheses adopted in the appraisal of the project were too optimistic for container ship
service time +30%) but particularly pessimistic for Ro-Ro ships 33%). It should be noted that the
fleet served by TAC is made up of 75-80% container ships equipped with cargo booms and 20-25%
Ro-Ro ships. For the old port, the savings estimated at the time of the appraisal are close to those
observed today.

*      Cargo handling savings
Forecast: The project was also expected to bring about an appreciable improvement in handling costs
in both the new terminal and the old port. The analysis took the different types of ships concerned
(container ships, Ro-Ro ships, multipurpose ships and conventional ships) by applying handling costs
on the basis of with or without the project scenarios. Shadow prices were only used for conventional
traffic because container handling entails using highly qualified equipment operators who are in high
demand in the market.
Actual savingS: The table below compares the SAR hypotheses with the actual figures. It appears
that the hypotheses adopted in the appraisal were somewhat optimistic as regards container handling
rates but very pessimistic regarding general cargo bandling especially in the case of multipurpose
ships. As regards gang costs per hour, the projections were exaggerated (from 100% to 200% out).

of the project was intended to avert this problem, together with the additional investments it would
have entailed (supplementary storage areas, handling equipment and operating costs).
Actual savings: Tbe old port's maximum container capacity, without recourse to double transport,
was estimated at 44,000/year. When the new terminal was brought into service in 1988, container
traffic in the old port dropped from 75,000 to 30,000 in one year. Thereafter, container activity in
the old port continued to decline, falling to 25,000 in 1990 and then, more recently, to 22,500 in
1992. The projections put container traffic in the old port at around 20,000 by 1995.

The initial traffic forecasts taken into account in the project were prepared by the Port
Autonome de Marseille and approved by PAD. Ibe tables in Annexes 1 and 2 compare the forecasts
and the actual figures.
1.           Total traffic
Graph I presents the SAR forecasts and the actual figures, revealing that:
-     the estimated and real values were basically similar in 1985 (5.25 million tons), but
diverge increasingly between then and 1995;
-     total traffic grew steadily between 1985 and 1989, rising from 5.24 million tons to
5.67 million tons, i.e. average annual growth of 2%, but then progressively declines
to a forecast total figure of 5.5 million tons in 1995, hence an annual drop of 0.5%;
-     the development of total traffic is correlated with that of export traffic, because the
acual figures for imports are close to the forecasts made at the time the project was
prepared (1984): an actual 2.9 million tons for imports, compared with 2.7 million
tons estimated in 1985 and 3.3 million tons (1993 estimae) against 3.2 million tons
forecast in 1995;
the share of export traffic posted a distinct improvement between 1985 and 1990, but
fell off thereafter: 44% in 1985 (forecast 49%), 49% in 1990 (forecast 50%) and
fnally 46% in 1992 (forecast 51%) with an estimated 40% in 1995 (initial forecast
52%).
1.1          Import tfmc
Import traffic is analyzed for six categories based on method of preparation and
packaging for shipment: convennal trau c, bagged goods, dry bulk, peroleum products, crude oil
and other bulk liquids.
Conventioaltffic: the SAR forecast regular growth between 1985 and 1995 from
675,000 tons to 865,000 tons, i.e. average anmnal growth of 3%. In actual fact the
traffic observed exceeded these forecasts quite considerably right *om 1985 (1,284,000
tons actual as against 675,000 tons forecast, i.e. +90%), and also in 1990
notwithstanding an appreciable falling-off in convenonal traffic (1,043,000 tons agait
a projected 802,000 tons, i.e. +30%) and probably in 1995 as wel, for which 2
million tons is now forecast compared with the initial Ibrecast of 1,535,000 tons
+37%).

Bagged . : the forecast and actual figures line up well, bagged goods traffic has
fluctuated around 400,000 tons/year, but the decline expected as of 1990 has not
materialized.
-Dra bulk: dry bulk goods traffic exceeded the forecasts as of 1988 (400,000 tons/year
compared with the 300,000 tons/year initially forecast). The increase in this type of
traffic which the SAR expected to see as of 1990 in fact occurred earlier (1988) and has
been more marked (29% above initial forecasts likely by 1995). It should be noted that
the PAD statistics do not distinguish between dry bulk imports and dry bulk goods for
ICS, which goes a long way toward explaining the phenomenon observed (20%).
- Petroleum products: the SAR forecasts have not materWized, traffic was expected to
rise steadily between 1985 and 1995, movlng up from 640,000 tons/year to 750,000
tons/year. The actal average level has fluctuated around 400,000 tons/year and the
new forecasts for 1995 put it at 600,000 tons, 1.e. 20% less than the initial forecasts.
Cde oil: as with petroleum products, crude oil traffic has turned out to be much
lower than forecast: 200,000 against 600,M00 tons in 1985 (-67%), 650,000 tons
against 800,000 tons in 1990 (-19%) and probably 600,000 tons as compared with
800,000 tons in 1995 (-25%).
- Other bulk gog: the afflc that was to be generated by ICS activity has not been
recorded separaty in the PAD statistics (see comment above).
1.2          Export taffic
The export traffic is also analyzed into six categories based on method of preparation
and packaging: conventional traffic, bagged goods, dry bulk, potoleum products, stores and other
liquid bulk goods.
Conventonal traffic: the SAR forecast reglar growth between 1985 and 1995 (from
325,000 tons to 665,000 tons), i.e. relatively vigorous annual average growth of 7%.
In reality, actual traffic bas done the opposite, falling steadily between 1985 and 1992
from about 400,000 tons in 198S/86 to 245,000 tons it 19, i.e. an aveae drop of
7%. The esdmate for 1995 is now S20,000 tons, or 62% less than the int
production.
Bggods ggg&despite some marked fluctuaons from one yer to another, the
forecasts have matched the actual figures quWte we with bagged goods traffic risig
from 175,000 tons to 250,000 tons between 1985/86 and 1992 and expected to exceed
the forecasts by 1995 (250,000 tons compaed with 190,000 tons, i.e. +32%).
DrU bulk: dry bulk taffic (esentlaly posa) has not developed as anticipated.
Whereas It was forecst to rise stoadily betwee 1985 and 1995 (from 1.7 million tons
in 1985 to 2 milion tons in 1995), this trafic amouned to 1.6 million tons in 1985,
peaked at 2 mitlion tons in 1988, then fell back to 1.2 million tonsia 1992. Ihis
level should be maintained between now and 1995.

-  PealeuM pro ucts: the SAR forecasts saw this traffic rising regularly between 1985
and 1995, from 100,000 tons/year to 200,000 tons/year. The PAD statistics do not
show this traffic separately.
-     Bunkering: a steady decline in this traffic between 1985 and 1995 was forecast (from
150,000 tons/year to 100,000 tons/year). In actual fact this traffic was posted in the
1989 statistics at 20,000 tons and rose steadily thereafter, reaching 100,000 tons in
1992.
- Othe bulk goods: the traffic recorded, 200,000 tons in 1985 and 327,000 tons in
1992, is lower than forecast; if petroleum products and other liquid bulk goods are
added, the figures become 295,000 tons for 1985 and 470,000 tons for 1992.
Summing up, with the exception of bagged goods and bunkering, the forecasts have
proven distinctly optimistic, especially as regards dry bulk goods which accounts for the majority of
export traffic (57% in 1992).
2.           Containerized traMc
Graph 2 shows the SAR forecasts as compared with actual traffic. The SAR had
taken two scenarios into account, one low and one high. The total containerized traffic figures point
up a significant difference between actual traffic and forecasts in 1985 (67,000 containers as compared
with a forecast of 46,500, i.e. +44%). The trends subsequendy converge and the estimate for 1995
(89,000 containers) is well above the low scenario (78,600 containers). In conclusion, container
traffic has grown faster than forecast but is expected to match the forecasts by 1995.
2.1           Full containers
Although well above the forecast initia1ly (48,000 containers as of 1985, compared
with a forecast of 31,000), actual traffic since then has fallen within the range forecast by the SAR
(64,000 actual containers in 1992, i.e. between the 54,400 low scenario and the 69,600 high scenario.
By 1995 the forecasts near the lower limit of the range, i.e. 65,600 containers as compared with
63,700 in the low scenario.
2.2          Empty containers
The high and low hypotheses for this traffic are virtually the same. On average,
actual traffic has proven to be systematically around 40% higher than forecast.
23           Division of traffc between TAC and the old port
Graph 3 represents the development of the division of container traffic between the
new terminal and the old port. Since entering into seavice In 1988, TAC has captured more than
60% of the port of Dakar's container traffic. Between 1988 and 1992 this percentage rose further,
reaching nearly 75% in 1992, and analysis of the trends indicates that the limit of the breadown
between TAC and the old port will be at around 80%. It is interesting to note thatthe residual traffic
in the old port amounts to 20,000 containers in 1992 (18,000/year by 1995) and saves to verify the



29
Page 4
assumption used in making the economic calculations of the project's return (44,000 containers/year
as the maximum in the old port). This also indicates that PAD has a residual potential capacity of
about 24.000 containers in the old port.
Benerits exuected froM the orolect
*      Shorter ship service times
Forecast: The construction of the new terminal was intended essentially to enable container and Ro-
Ro ships to benefit from quicker service times than they could expect in the old port. Moreover, Ro-
Ro ships with fixed ramps and multipurpose ships (carrying a part of their cargo in containers) were
expected to benefit from the easing of congestion in the old port following the entry into service of
the new terminal. The appraisal of the savings in ship service time distinguished between those
deriving from use of the new terminal and those resulting from the improvement of operating
conditions in the old port. For the old port, the analysis also distinguished between multipurpose
ships and conventional traffic. In the same way, the costs per ship-day were determined for each type
of vessel. The project estimated a saving of 256 ship-days with 205 container ships calling at the port
of Dakar. The analysis assumed that only 50% of the ship service time savings would be retained by
the Senegalese economy. The expected growth of traffic volume carried by the Senegalese flag fleet
was taken into account in the analysis by raising this percentage to 60% as of 1992, at which lvel it
was expected to remain through the end of the period considered for the project (year 2011).
Actui savinga: Tle table below compares the SAR forecasts with the actual savings achieved.
Clearly, the hypotheses adopted in the appraisal of the project were too optimistic for container ship
service time +30%) but particularly pessimistic for Ro-Ro ships 33%). It should be noted that the
fleet served by TAC is made up of 75.80% container ships equipped with cargo booms and 20-25%
Ro-Ro ships. For the old port, the savings estimated at the time of the appraisal are close to those
observed today.

*      Cargo handling savings
Forecast: The project was also expected to bring about an appreciable improvement in handling costs
in both the new terminal and the old port. The analysis took the different types of ships concerned
(container ships, Ro-Ro ships, multipurpose ships and conventional ships) by applying handling costs
on the basis of with or without the project scenarios. Shadow prices were only used for conventional
traffic because container handling entails using highly qualified equipment operators who are in high
demand in the market.
Actual savin: The table below compares the SAR hypotheses with the actual figures. It appears
that the hypotheses adopted in the appraisal were somewhat optimistic as regards container handling
rates but very pessimistic regarding general cargo handling especially in the case of multipurpose
ships. As regards gang costs per hour, the projections were exaggerated (from 100% to 200% out).

of the project was intended to avert this problem, together with the additional investments it would
have entailed (supplementary storage areas, handling equipment and operating costs).
Actual savings: The old port's maximum container capacity, without recourse to double transport,
was estimated at 44,000/year. When the new terminal was brought into service in 1988, container
traffic in the old port dropped from 75,000 to 30,000 in one year. Ibereafter, container activity in
the old port continued to decline, falling to 25,000 in 1990 and then, more recently, to 22,500 in
1992. The projections put container traffic in the old port at around 20,000 by 1995.
