follows: outcomes\n            were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some of the key\n            lessons learned include: strategic plans need to be\n            translated into clear action plans, which include\n            monitorable output indicators to track progress. Governments\n            might be reluctant to invest the needed time to develop such\n            action plans, particularly given the short time-frame that\n            most governments in the Latin American region face due to\n            election laws. However, experience has repeatedly shown that\n            the lack of coordination and prioritization leads to\n            inefficiencies in implementation, and slows down reform\n            implementation. Several government agencies expressed regret\n            of not having invested more time and energy into developing\n            a solid monitoring and evaluation framework. In the absence\n            of such information, there is only limited evidence to argue\n            for sustained funding and support, which makes agencies more\n            vulnerable to political shifts. Additionally, the government\n            loses an opportunity to 'market' achieved results,\n            and use the data to convince other stakeholders and involved\n            agencies of the need for reform. Available BB funds can\n            provide the needed flexibility to react to government\n            request, and maintain a close dialogue with the government\n            on selected areas of interest. While funding through a\n            technical assistance loan was available to help implement\n            some of the reforms, those funds usually are not flexible\n            enough to cover \"quick turnaround\" analysis, and\n            ongoing knowledge building support. The provision of\n            additional Bank budget funds did allow several Bank experts\n            to maintain a close contact with the government and to\n            provide targeted short-term support."}, "docdt": "2010-03-24T00:00:00Z"}
