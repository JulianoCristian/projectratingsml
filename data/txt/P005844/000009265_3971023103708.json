The key\n            lessons learned were as follows: (1) there should be\n            specific plan of coordination between Project Management\n            Unit (PMU) and Project Implementation Units (PIU) especially\n            in a multi sector project like ERP; (ii) to award the PIU\u2019s\n            the complete facilities as an independent unit, to enable\n            the proper execution of its tasks rather than attaching the\n            PIU's under direct dealings with the Ministers as it\n            happened in ERP; (iii) provision of adequate counterpart\n            budget without any delay for smooth execution of the\n            projects activities (iv) pre co-ordination with water,\n            Drainage services sector before the commencement of any\n            housing complex, to facilitate its proper execution; (v)\n            good project preparation and strong support from the\n            concerned authorities in the government; and (vi) continuous\n            monitoring to ensure proper execution of project."}, "docdt": "1997-05-30T00:00:00Z"}
