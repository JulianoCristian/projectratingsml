The\n            findings and implications indicate that the development of\n            sector management information systems permits a gradual\n            shift away from milestones towards performance indicators.\n            Survey data reveals significant gender inequalities in\n            development indicators and access to public services. The\n            Transition Support Program (TSP) has built on the\n            Government's planning process, by incorporating\n            priority actions identified in agencies' annual action\n            plans. The scope and detail of the TSP and its annual matrix\n            are, in part, a consequence of the TSP assuming a\n            coordinating role across a wide range of sectors. There has\n            been much debate regarding the appropriate scope and detail\n            required in the TSP program and action matrix. The\n            Government has argued that the TSP progress and appraisal\n            missions have placed a considerable burden on the\n            administration, with the counterpart teams fully engaged in\n            the program process during missions. The TSP has supported\n            capacity building through its dialogue on policy design and\n            policy implementation. The TSP has provided a key forum for\n            policy dialogue between the Government and its external partners."}, "docdt": "2005-02-14T00:00:00Z"}
