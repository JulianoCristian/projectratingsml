"versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the First, Second, and Third\n            Transition Support Program (TSP) of Timor-Leste are as\n            follows: outcome was moderately unsatisfactory; risk to\n            development outcome was significant; Bank performance was\n            moderately unsatisfactory; and also the performance of the\n            borrower was rated moderately unsatisfactory. The main\n            lessons learned from the experience under the three TSP\n            operations are: 1) In cases like Timor-Leste where there is\n            high political risk, due in large measure to high\n            unemployment among disgruntled youth, efforts should be\n            directed at creating jobs and achieving \"quick\n            wins\" in poverty-related services, and through work\n            programs; rather than dissipating efforts across a wide\n            range of areas and measures, with little explicit\n            priorities. 2) Where capacity limitations are severe and\n            technical assistance (TA) is normally required to do the\n            work itself, as well as to train a large number of\n            personnel, it is probably more effective to provide TA which\n            is dedicated entirely to training, in parallel to advisors\n            who actually do part of the work. Combining both functions\n            in the same individual, though attractive in principle,\n            often leads to situations where the advisors devote hardly\n            any time to training, and therefore, building local capacity\n            suffers. 3) Quite often, but particularly in countries with\n            limited qualified personnel, success is highly correlated\n            with working with the more competent and committed\n            counterparts. Therefore, where possible, it would be\n            desirable for the Bank to focus its support around proven\n            achievers, while seeking to develop institutional capacity.\n            4) Despite its costs to the Government and its development\n            partners, which can be high at times, the benefits of active\n            donor coordination are often worthwhile and outweigh its\n            costs, as demonstrated by the experience under the TSP program."}, "docdt": "2008-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
