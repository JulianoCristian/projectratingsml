as a multi-donor, medium-term program of balance of payments and budgetary support to
assist the implementation of Timor-Leste's post-independence program as laid out in its
National Development Plan (NDP). The program was designed to present a unified
agenda across donors based on the NDP, backed by financing commitments for the three
years ending in FY2005 and monitored on the basis of a single agreed framework and
reporting mechanism.

  The Third Transition Support Program (FY2005) was a multi-donor program of budget
support to the implementation on the Government of Timor-Leste's National
Development Plan (NDP). In addition to providing financial resources in the form of
budget support, TSP III assisted the Government in policy prioritization and monitoring,
helps build capacity, and acts as a prime tool of donor coordination.

  TSP III focused on three thematic areas, reflecting NDP and Stability Program
priorities:(a) Good Governance, including strengthening State institutions, public sector
management and public expenditure management; strengthening administrative capacity
in the justice sector; and, possibly, capacity building in the police; (b) Service Delivery
for Poverty Reduction, particularly improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness in
the health and education sectors; and (c) Job Creation, especially through private sector
development and agriculture. Building on the experience of previous TSP exercises and
the Government's policy and planning initiatives, TSP III (FY2005) sought to focus on
systems performance by making greater use of quantitative performance indicators;
introduce a medium-term perspective; place a greater focus on integrated capacity
building efforts; mainstream gender issues throughout the program; and strengthen
stakeholder dialogue on TSP design and process.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

This Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) covers the implementation and results
of a series of three programmatic operations (First Transition Support Program, Second
Transition Support Program, and Third Transition Support Program). The contribution of First
Transition Support Program was a Post Conflict Grant, which does not require its own ICR. This
full ICR accordingly rates the contributions of Third Transition Support Program (TSP III).

A simplified ICR was completed for TSP II with the following ratings:

Outcome: S
Sustainability: L
Institutional Development Impact: S
Bank Performance: S
Borrower Performance: S
Quality at Entry: S
Operation at Risk at Any Time: N

The principal objective of the TSP was to help mobilize bridge financing to allow the
Government of Timor-Leste to implement a modest development program in the lean years
before substantial oil and gas revenues came on stream. At the time, the Government faced a
projected fiscal deficit of over US$90 million during the first three years of its mandate. With
capital markets undeveloped and a statutory prohibition on borrowing from the Banking and
Payments Authority (central bank equivalent), the Government was not expected to be able to
raise sufficient revenues to finance its annual budget of about US$75 million. In response, the
TSP provided about US$30 million each year in single-tranche, grant-financed budget support to
address both external and fiscal gaps, allowing Timor-Leste to sustain a level of imports and
public expenditures that would not otherwise be possible. By channeling funds through the
Government's budget and providing support and substantial monitoring focus on its public
finance management system, the program served to strengthen in-country capacity to manage
future revenue streams. In addition, the program sought to support the Government's effort to put
in place the basic institutional framework for an open and democratic state. As government and
market institutions were incipient and expectations on the ground were high, the program sought
to strike a balance between supporting long-term institutional development and delivering short-
term results on the ground.

Total financing for the three years of TSP amounted to US$99.4 million,1 of which US$14.1
million was financed by the International Development Association (IDA) as balance of
payments support, US$76.2 million financed bilaterally by nine co-financing development
partners through IDA-administered Trust Funds,2 and US$9 million provided through parallel
financing. The World Bank provided US$5 million for TSP I in FY2003, as a grant from



1 On a gross basis using exchange rates from SDR to US$ on September 23, 2004 (leading up to the
presentation of TSP III to the World Bank's Executive Board).

2 These bilateral partners included Australia, Canada, Finland, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, the
United Kingdom, and the United States. Portugal provided parallel budgetary support financing amounting
to US$9 million.

earmarked FY2003 Development Grant Facility allocations for the Post Conflict Fund; SDR 2.9
million as an IDA grant for TSP II in FY2004; and SDR 3.4 million as an IDA grant for TSP III
in FY2005.

Financing for each TSP has been agreed on the basis of an annual program laid out in the
Government's Letter of Development Policy and Action Matrix. These actions have largely been
drawn from the Government's strategic planning instruments, beginning with the NDP and
including, as they were developed, sector policies, Sector Investment Programs (SIPs), and the
Annual Action Plans (AAPs) prepared by all agencies as part of the annual planning and budget
process. Additional actions agreed between the Government and donors during program
negotiations have increasingly been introduced into AAPs to ensure proper implementation and
monitoring. As a result, the program reflects both the Government's and development partners'
appreciation of policy and operational priorities for the year ahead. Actions have been
increasingly supplemented by outcomes targeted as program objectives.

Like in other budget support operations, TSP conditionality was based on actions completed
before grant approval. Namely, each program would establish a program monitoring matrix for
the year ahead. The policy actions identified in the Action Matrix were broken down by quarter to
mirror the structure of the Government's annual action plans and hence assist the Government in
monitoring their accomplishment. The program would also identify a sub-set of prior actions for
the following operation that included those measures considered most critical to the achievement
of the program's development objectives. Intensive dialogue with the Government through
biannual multi-donor supervision missions was used to review progress against program actions,
discuss and reevaluate priorities, and work together to improve implementation where progress
had slowed. Approval of each new program was based on the evaluation of progress against
agreed prior actions as well as the overall assessment of progress made in the context of the
broader political and economic climate to determine the extent of Government commitment and
the degree of preparation for the subsequent program.

The TSP operations were designed to be wide-ranging in order to support the Government's
efforts at overall program monitoring. This whole-of-Government multi-donor approach has also
provided the donor community with a consolidated framework for high-level monitoring and
donor harmonization. TSP operations were intentionally ambitious ­not only in the range of areas
covered but also in the number, objectives and timing of policies envisaged. This ambition
reflected the combination of the often inordinately high expectations of the donor community
with the desires of a committed government with weak capacity. It was also the reflection of a
view that moderate progress along a broad number of fronts had the best chances of building
long-term institutional capacity and producing sustainable results. The outcome of this ambitious
approach has been mixed, as will be detailed below. Arguably, TSP operations could have
accomplished more in a number of critical areas if they had been more prioritized, helping the
government use its still scarce capacity in a more focused manner to deliver short-term results in
income-generation and service delivery.

1.1 Context at Appraisal
The TSP was developed in the wake of Timor-Leste's restoration to independence on May 20,
2002, which followed 25 years of conflict, a violent transition from Indonesian rule, and over two
years of United Nations Administration. In this context, priority was initially given to creating the
institutions, legislative framework, and management systems needed for core government
functions. Program design was anchored in the Transitional Support Strategy (TSS), presented to
the Board in November 2000. The key elements of the strategy were: basic poverty alleviation
and reconstruction over the short term; and analytical and advisory assistance on post-


                                                  2

independence policy and governance issues. The TSP's role as a tool for policy dialogue, policy
prioritization, results monitoring, and donor coordination has in turn formed the backbone of the
partnership approach adopted in the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FY2006 to FY2008.

In October 2004, the Government announced revised oil and gas revenue projections. These point
to a significant increase in revenues in FY2005 and subsequent years, largely owing to changes in
oil prices. Nevertheless, the rationale for continued budgetary support through the Transition
Support Program remained. It was consistently argued that the bulk of the oil and gas revenues
should be saved until a Petroleum Fund and long-term savings policy was put in place. These
actions figure prominently in the program for FY2005. The Third Transition Support Program
would provide the necessary budgetary support whilst institutional and policy instruments for
effective, transparent and sustainable management of oil and gas revenues were finalized.

Five years after the international community stepped in to assist Timor-Leste in the aftermath of
post-referendum violence, the country was successfully transitioning from post-conflict status.
Security was broadly restored and macroeconomic stability re-established and maintained through
the adoption of the US dollar as legal tender and cautious fiscal management. However, the
economy remained fragile. Cumulative growth was negative, mainly reflecting the drawdown in
the international presence. Unemployment was high and 40 percent of the population lived below
the poverty line, and social indicators were poor. At the same time, human capital remained
scarce, and physical infrastructure inadequate and financing opportunities were limited.
Administrative capacity was weak in the public and private sectors. The winding down of
international support at a time when domestic capacity was still weak and the coming on stream
of large oil/gas revenue in 2004 presented Timor-Leste with new challenges.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
The Third Transition Support Program (FY2005) was a multi-donor program of budget support to
the implementation on the Government of Timor-Leste's National Development Plan (NDP). In
addition to providing financial resources in the form of budget support, TSP III assisted the
Government in policy prioritization and monitoring, helped build capacity, and acted as a prime
tool of donor coordination.

The principal benefit of the TSP III was that it provided additional resources to support the
Government's core governance and development programs in the lean years before substantial oil
and gas revenues came on stream. The TSP III provides these resources through a coordinated
framework for external partners providing budgetary support to Timor-Leste. This reduced
transaction costs, focuses attention on development priorities and allows Timor-Leste to mobilize
external financing that would not otherwise be available.

Objectives by component are described below.

Good Governance

Oversight Institutions. Programmed actions and outputs focused on the establishment (a)
Appointment of the Provedor, and establishment of the Provedor's office. (b) Submission of the
Provedor's annual report to Parliament.

Core Govemment Functions. Programmed actions and outputs focused on the establishment of
the institutional arrangements for: a transparent policy and legislative process, offering
opportunities for public consultation; regulatory framework to address risks of corruption and



                                                  3

nepotism; ensuring adequate oversight over public funds through independent audit; effectively
managing oil and gas revenues and savings; and nurturing responsible and effective media.

Public Sector Management. Programmed actions and outputs sought to apply the
recommendations of the local government options study, to develop the legal and regulatory
framework for the civil service, and to establish an effective human resources management
system.

Justice Sector. Programmed actions and outputs focused on the finalization of the oversight
framework for the judiciary, establishment of basic management systems and improvements in
system performance, as indicated by reductions in the backlog of cases.

Planning and Public Expenditure Management. Programmed actions focused on capacity
building in financial management, improvements in procurement and expenditure performance,
transparency and accountability to the legislature, and promotion of gender equality through the
planning system.

Service Delivery

Health. Programmed actions and outputs sought to define key policies and strategies for public
health priorities, strengthen planning and resource allocation to improve service delivery, and
improve the performance of health services.

Education. Programmed actions and outputs focused on the development of the education policy
and legislative framework, building on the recommendations of the 2003 National Education
Congress; improvements in the access, efficiency, and quality of basic education; and the
strengthening of capacity in financial and administrative management, including measures to
deconcentrate spending to the field level.

Vulnerable Groups (Veterans). Programmed actions and outputs focused on development of the
policy and legal framework to recognize veterans of the resistance.

Job Creation

Private Sector Development. Programmed actions and outputs focused on finalization of the key
private-sector regulatory instruments, development of programs for emigrant workers and
entrepreneurship, promotion of investment and exports, and creation of employment through
community-based roads maintenance. The FY2005 program would give particular attention to
improvements in the efficiency of the regulatory environment, including the establishment of
mechanisms for consultation between Government departments and the private sector.

Agriculture. Programmed actions and outputs focused on the implementation of the policy
framework for the sector and launch of operational plans, development of sustainable marine
fisheries, and improvements in food production and food security.

1.3 Revised PDO (if any, as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and Reasons/Justification
The TSP's development objective did not change during the life of the program. However, the
rationale of providing bridge financing was adjusted as Timor-Leste's financial situation changed.
In TSP I and TSP II, there was a clear need for external financing to fill the gap between the core


                                                4

program of expenditures and government revenues. During preparations for the FY2005 budget
and the associated TSP III, revenue estimates were revised upward to take into account an
acceleration of the petroleum production schedule, an increase in the price of oil, and
improvements in domestic tax and customs administration. Given the considerable uncertainty
regarding medium-term estimates of petroleum revenues, however, the Government adopted a
prudent fiscal policy, with continued efforts to mobilize additional domestic revenues and a
modest expenditure program. The case for increased financing in FY2005 lay in the need to build
up adequate savings as a cushion against future petroleum price and volume shocks, to ensure the
integrity of the Government's prudent savings policy for petroleum revenues, to increase capital
development expenditures to facilitate an expansion in service delivery and needed infrastructure
programs, and to build capacity for management of petroleum revenues when they did come on
stream. Although the overall objectives of the program did not change, the size of the program
and its matrix increased significantly from TSP I to TSP III, particularly in the governance area.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved):
The TSP III (FY2005) focused on three thematic areas, reflecting NDP and Stability
Program priorities: a) Good Governance, including strengthening State institutions, public sector
management and public expenditure management; strengthening administrative capacity in the
justice sector; and, possibly, capacity building in the police; b) Service Delivery for Poverty
Reduction, particularly improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness in the health and
education sectors; and c) Job Creation, especially through private sector development and
agriculture. Building on the experience of previous TSP exercises and the Government's policy
and planning initiatives, TSP III (FY2005) sought to focus on systems performance by making
greater use of quantitative performance indicators; introduce a medium-term perspective; place a
greater focus on integrated capacity building efforts; mainstream gender issues throughout the
program; and strengthen stakeholder dialogue on TSP design and process.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas (if applicable)
Not applicable.

1.6 Other significant changes
Although the overall objectives of the program did not change, the size of the program and its
matrix increased significantly from TSP I to TSP III, particularly in the governance area.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:

2.1 Program Performance (supported by a table derived from a policy matrix)
The Government has consistently praised the contribution of the TSP to Government-owned
policy prioritization, capacity building, results orientation, and donor coordination in a post-
conflict environment. The TSP has supported strategic annual planning and high-level monitoring
with a whole-of-Government approach. By taking guidance from the NDP, sector strategies, and
AAPs, the program has cultivated Government ownership. It has promoted capacity building by
using the Government's own systems and processes for budget preparation and execution,
including mid-level managers in program elaboration and monitoring, and providing a forum for
discussion on prioritization, implementation, results, and monitoring. The preparation of a time-
bound matrix of policy and institutional measures, together with their expected outcomes, has
instilled discipline while internal disciplinary mechanisms are still weak and has fostered good
planning and enhanced agencies' results orientation. The TSP has strengthened donor
coordination by bringing together the majority of Timor-Leste's development partners in the



                                                 5

preparation and monitoring of the program, thus serving as an anchor for all donor-financed
activities. This coordination mechanism has allowed coverage of all critical issues, drawing upon
the comparative advantage of each development partner, and promoted mainstreaming of cross-
cutting issues such as gender.

The program's performance has been less strong in setting up basic institutions and supporting
job creation. By the end of the three-year program period, Timor-Leste still did not have one
qualified national judge and budget execution figures remained low. Performance was
particularly weak in the area of job creation and income generation. The private sector continued
to encounter important barriers to its operations, resulting in poor scores in the Doing Business
survey and anemic job creation. Short-term government-supported job creation measures
monitored under TSP, such as the emigrant workers and the community roads programs also did
not deliver the expected results. Finally, although results were more encouraging in the social
sectors, many of these results were in the area of sector planning rather than in final outcomes ­
especially in the education sector.

Outputs by components:
Broad progress has been made in the implementation of TSP programs. Performance has been
strong in the health sector, in the design of the petroleum revenue management regime, in budget
elaboration and accounting and reporting processes, and in the recognition of veterans of the
resistance. Agriculture, education, justice, public sector and public expenditure management, and
private sector development have performed reasonably well against program objectives, but
sector performance as a whole remains a concern. Finally, performance in the broad governance
areas has been mixed, with some notable achievements in the establishment of oversight
arrangements but slow progress in the development of a coherent process for policy and
legislative development.



                                                      7

Good Governance. Achievement of the governance component is rated satisfactory.

With regard to the establishment of oversight institutions, the Organic Law for the Office of the
Provedor (Ombudsman) was passed. The Provedor was appointed in March 2005, and he and two
deputies were sworn in by Parliament in July 2005. Though the office was not fully established
by the close of TSP III, it opened to the public in March 2006 following good process on
recruitment, high-quality training, production of information leaflets, and meetings in the districts
and Dili to raise awareness about the office and its purpose. The Government expressed its
intention to enhance the independence of external audit of Government accounts by transferring
management of the audit contract from MPF to the Court of Appeals, and the transfer was
included in the 2006 AAP for the Court.

Important steps were taken to strengthen core government functions, though progress was
limited in some areas. The development of an effective and transparent policy and legislative
process, including priorities and timetable, has been delayed by the ongoing harmonization of
Organic Laws for Ministries. Since the close of TSP III, the Secretary of State for the Council of
Ministers has produced a legislative program setting out the Government's legislative timetable.
Common technical drafting standards have been defined, and a draft Framework Organic Law for
Government has been prepared to guide the harmonization process. The Organic Law of the
Office of the Inspector General (OIG) has been submitted for approval by the Council of
Ministers, but is also awaiting the completion of the harmonization exercise. During the TSP
timeframe, OIG successfully completed 35 investigations at the request of the Prime Minister and
referred five cases to the prosecutor general. As of end-April 2006, the number of completed OIG
investigations has increased to 73, and one referred case is proceeding to trial. In September
2005, the OIG launched a high-quality website with information about the office and its activities,
including summary reports of investigations in Portuguese, with translation to English and Tetum
underway. The OIG has provided education and outreach services through the National Institute
of Public Administration (INAP). The Petroleum Fund Act mandates income and asset
declarations for Investment Advisory Board members. On March 11, 2005, the Prime Minister
sponsored a seminar on Integrity of the State to explore ideas of conflict of interest, codes of
conduct, income and asset declaration, and the anticorruption agenda of the Provedor. Similar
seminars have continued to be held following the close of TSP III for civil servants in a range of
ministries. In January 2006, the Prime Minister supported the launch of an Initiative on
Accountability and Transparency, with the goals of assessing the status of transparency,
accountability, and integrity in the public administration; providing recommendations on priority
areas for reform; identifying additional support required; and fostering a multi-sector dialogue
and partnership on these issues. Meetings have begun between the Government and members of
the media on the development of a freedom of information policy to provide guidelines on
arrangements for access to information and information dissemination.

The Government adopted a state-of-the-art policy and institutions for the prudent management of
oil and gas revenues based on the Norwegian model under which it has made a commitment to
maintain the real value of the petroleum wealth in perpetuity. The Petroleum Fund Law and
savings policy were developed on the basis of widespread consultation and approved in time for
the start of FY2006. After the close of TSP III, the Petroleum Fund was established in September
2005, with an initial balance of nearly US$250 million. The first quarterly report for the Fund was
published in a timely manner in December 2005, and information on petroleum sector legislation,
Petroleum Fund reports, overall revenue numbers, and Production Sharing Contracts are now
available on a publicly accessible website. Members of the Investment Advisory Board have been
appointed, and a number of appointments have been made to the Consultative Council.

In the area of public sector management, the Public Service Statute was promulgated in June
2004, including the ethics code and a section on disciplinary procedures, and INAP conducted
courses to educate public servants about its provisions. As of end-March 2006, 9 of 18
supplementary regulations have been drafted, but none has been subject to legal review or
submitted to the CoM, owing in part to limitations in legal drafting capacity across Government.
The foundations of a human resource management system were laid, with cleaning of personnel
data files completed in January 2005. However, the development of a Personnel Management
Information System (PMIS) was constrained by insufficient domestic capacity and lack of
external support; since the close of TSP III, funding for the PMIS has been secured, which will
form the basis for further work on pay reform and career development. Much remains to be done,
however, for the civil service of Timor-Leste to be established and function effectively to support
NDP implementation. The overall level of capacity in the civil service remains extremely low and
a large number of vacant positions have yet to be filled. Finalization of the study on the preferred
option for local administration was delayed to allow in-depth analysis and consensus-building.
The options study was completed after the close of TSP III, and following a model process of
wide consultation over a draft policy paper, an inter-ministerial technical working group was
formed to undertake the next steps. It is expected that legislation will be drafted in 2006.

In the justice sector, training of national judges, prosecutors, and public defenders advanced well,
but the absence of national actors created important gaps in staffing. The eventual appointment of
international judges led to some improvements in the efficiency of case resolution. Backlogs in
the Court of Appeals and the Office of the Prosecutor General were reviewed, and the number of
illegal detentions was reduced. However, a significant backlog still remains, particularly for civil
cases. District courts in Suai and Oecussi were reopened, but their operation remained heavily
dependent on support from the United Nations Mission in East Timor. In FY2005, the courts
assumed control of their own budgets from the Ministry of Justice. The Superior Council for the
Judiciary was established and meetings were held. The Public Prosecutor Organic Law was
submitted to Parliament, and the Public Defender Organic Law was submitted to the CoM. Since
the close of TSP III, the Public Prosecutor Organic Law was promulgated in September 2005, and
steps have been taken to create the Superior Council for the Public Prosecution. The Public
Registration Decree Law was submitted to the CoM, but its approval was awaiting harmonization
with the civil code. The draft law on domestic violence was delayed due to harmonization with
the penal code.

Performance in planning and public expenditure management varied across phases of the
budgeting process. The budget office has benefited from extensive support through technical
assistance and substantial improvements in the capacity of domestic staff. As a result, the budget
elaboration process progressed well, with progressively greater time allowed for budget
preparation by line ministries. The government's budget document itself is of particularly high
quality and includes an accompanying policy paper and three-year projections. Good progress has
also been made toward the development of a combined sources budget including information on
donor financing as well as Government's own resources. In FY2005, moreover, the budget
document included greater detail on outlays for capital expenditures with regional disaggregation
to allow for improved monitoring by Parliament, civil society, and other stakeholders. Planning
and budget documents also displayed an increasing focus on gender-sensitive planning. The
Procurement Decree Law was passed in 2005, including provisions for delegating procurement
authority for purchases of up to US$10,000 to line ministries. Pro-poor budget allocation targets
were met throughout the program, with the combined education and health budgets totalling over
35 percent of recurrent expenditures of the central Government budget, security spending under
25 percent of the recurrent central Government budget, allocations for primary education above
45 percent of the recurrent education budget, and hospital budget allocations under 40 percent of


                                                   9

the recurrent health budget. Expenditure management was significantly weaker, with low rates of
budget execution constraining service delivery and weakening Government legitimacy. Low
budget execution rates were the result of the combination of high standards of public financial
management and accountability with an overly-centralized expenditure approval process and
weak understanding of budget execution procedures by line ministries. Budget execution and
reporting procedures were strong. Quarterly budget execution reports, reviews of budget
execution, and final audited accounts were generally produced on time. Since the close of TSP
III, a video guide to the budget was produced to develop community awareness and
understanding of the budget planning process. However, this guide has not yet been distributed to
the districts nor discussed widely with the general public.

Service Delivery for Poverty Reduction. Achievement of the governance component is rated
satisfactory.

Substantial progress was made on most fronts of the health program. Early on, the Ministry of
Health developed a Health Policy Framework focusing on promotive and preventive services for
mother and child health. This framework was supplemented by the completion of micro-policies
in nine priority areas. A framework law for the Autonomous Medical Supply System was
approved. Annual District Health Plans were established as a routine tool with quarterly
monitoring, and a draft annual strategic activity plan was developed for Dili Hospital. MOH
consistently met its results targets for DPT3 and measles immunizations, skilled attendance at
birth, and annual outpatient visits per capita.

In education, progress on program actions was moderate. Enrollment increased quickly after the
restoration of independence, particularly among children in rural areas and girls, in part as a result
of the elimination of user fees for primary education. The policy and legislative framework for
the sector, consisting of the Basic Law, Organic Law, and education sector policy were awaiting
approval at the close of TSP III. Regulations on private schooling and tertiary education had been
drafted. An Education Management Information System (EMIS) was established and school data
were incorporated, but there is not enough staff to ensure its proper upkeep. Government delivery
of adequate education materials did not meet expectations and the only reading material available
to schools throughout the country is delivered by an NGO. A syllabus for primary education was
adopted and is in the process of being rolled out from grade to grade. A pilot program to
distribute block grants to schools to improve resource availability at the facility level was
implemented. The Government also committed to joining the Education for All Fast Track
Initiative. After the close of TSP III, the Ministry of Education and Culture adopted a Strategic
Plan for University Primary Completion by 2015. After the re-introduction of "voluntary"
contributions during the program period, they were subsequently abolished and a school finance
policy is being developed to improve the quality of education without limiting access to poor
families. The Ministry has made a concerted effort to improve budget execution capacity, but its
ability to meet expenditure targets has been constrained by procurement backlogs due to weak
capacity at the ministry and the limited number of central procurement staff.

Solid progress was made in the recognition of veterans of the resistance. Two commissions were
established for the registration of ex-combatants and veterans of the resistance, and the
registration process advanced considerably under TSP. At the close of the program, Parliament
was drafting a veterans law on the basis of recommendations put forth by the veterans
commissions. Construction of a memorial park for victims was nearly completed, and a study was
prepared to inform the construction of 100 houses for veterans with funding from the Chinese
Government. In March 2006, after the close of TSP III, the Estatuto dos Combatentes da
Libertação Nacional was approved by Parliament, and the Secretariat of State for Veterans and



                                                10

Former Combatants (SEAVAC) plans to carry out an information campaign about the new law.
Registration of veterans has been completed. Ceremonies to honor veterans of the armed and
civilian resistance were planned for August 2006, followed by ceremonies for the founders of the
resistance in November 2006 and for the deceased in December 2006. The Government has
begun providing pensions to 39 economically vulnerable veterans who served 24 years in the
armed struggle.

Job Creation. Achievement of the governance component is rated moderately satisfactory.

Overall, progress was satisfactory in developing the legal and regulatory environment for private
sector development, but unsatisfactory regarding job creation itself. Legislation on commercial
entities, insurance, cooperatives and the leasing of Government property was passed. A draft law
on bankruptcy was prepared, but is undergoing further revisions. The Government has held
several informal town hall-style meetings with business people from small-sized enterprises
around the country and the first formal Business-Government forum took place in June 2005.
Business Development Centers far exceeded targets in training a large number of existing and
would-be self-employed workers. The creation of the Investment and Export Promotion Agency
(IEPA) was delayed (though it was established shortly after the close of TSP III under the name
TradeInvest Timor-Leste, and along with the Instituto de Apoio do Desenvolvimento Empresarial
for domestic investment promotion). Little progress was made in simplifying business procedures
or transferring the business registration function to the Ministry of Justice, as required by the Law
on Commercial Societies. The progress outlined above in developing the legal and regulatory
environment for the private sector, however, did not result in significant job creation. Moreover,
the program's activities focused on direct job creation performed poorly. In the context of the
Emigrant Workers Program, a contract was signed with a South Korean company. Over the two-
year period of TSP II-III, twenty workers departed for South Korea, and another 100 were
scheduled to leave by July 2006. The community-based road maintenance program did not result
in the expected levels of job creation either due to weak program management by the ministry of
transport and budget cuts to the program by the MoF. Since the close of TSP III, the laws on
domestic and foreign investment were promulgated. TradeInvest Timor-Leste held its first major
investment conference in November 2005, and two investment projects were approved--one in
coffee and one in fishing, totaling US$19 million. It is expected that these investments will create
about 650 jobs for Timorese workers. A second Business Forum was held in March 2006. The
law on leasing between private parties was approved by Parliament.

The strategy and policy for the agriculture sector was approved and progress was made in
implementing the new regional structure of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forests, and Fisheries
(MAFF). The fisheries decree law and supporting regulations were approved, and a forestry and
watershed management policy and strategy were drafted. Good progress was made in testing and
distributing improved food crop varieties. The Sector Working Group for Agriculture and Rural
Development was established in November 2004, and for the first time, MAFF coordinated the
Joint Donors' Mission for the agriculture sector. However, many challenges remain in developing
national systems for service delivery, particularly in watershed and natural resource management.
Improving the profitability of irrigated farming systems continues to require attention, but has
lower priority than improved food security and sustainability in the uplands. Soon after the close
of TSP III, the CoM approved a national Food Security Policy, a draft Community Forests
Strategy was prepared and the CoM is now considering the Forests Policy and Strategy. A vessel
licensing and reporting system is now in place for all commercial fishing activities, with over 500
in-shore and two off-shore licenses issued and an estimated 250 jobs created for Timorese
workers. Triennial agricultural and fisheries surveys have been launched, targeting 4,000
households across the country.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:
Capacity constraints were and still are acute throughout the public sector in Timor-Leste, with a
shortage of qualified and experienced personnel suitable for senior and mid-level civil service
posts, particularly in areas such as financial management, macroeconomic and tax policy, and
judicial functions. In some cases, technical assistance provided by donor-financed advisers played
a critical role in ensuring the quality and timeliness of outputs and the smooth operation of
government functions. In other cases, the quality of technical support was poor. Frequently, the
expediency of output delivery concerns primed over long-term capacity building and the
substitution of indigenous capacity by international technical assistance prevailed over a focus on
knowledge transfer. Though the action matrices for TSP II and TSP III identified the short-term
technical assistance inputs required to support the implementation of actions, delays in
mobilization of this assistance occasionally resulted in implementation delays. Successive
reductions in the presence of United Nations advisers placed increasing pressure on the
Government's capacity to deliver services efficiently and accountably.

Many program activities centered on the passage of laws and appointment of prominent staff such
as the Ombudsman (Provedor). Yet, ultimately, these decisions fall outside the scope of the
executive, relying on the Parliament for completion. This led to an overload of the legislative
system and a slowdown and weak prioritization of the legislative agenda. Moreover, legislative
processing was hampered by the lack of a clearly defined policy and legislative process within the
executive, inadequate scheduling and work flow management tools, limited capacity and
experience of parliamentarians, and difficulties with regard to the varying levels of
comprehension of the Portuguese language. Recognizing the Government's incomplete control
over legislative matters, an effort was made to focus on the role of the Council of Ministers in
reviewing legislation and limit the program's legislative agenda to the laws deemed to be most
critical to the achievement of program objectives.

Factors generally subject to government control:
Progress in meeting service delivery targets was seriously affected by low rates of budget
execution, which reflected heavy centralization of expenditure management authority, tight
procurement controls, weak capacity, limited understanding of routine procedures, and poor
communication between the Ministry of Planning and Finance and line agencies. In response, the
Government established an inter-ministerial commission to address issues of budget execution
and oversight and launched studies on budget execution processes and causes of spending
bottlenecks, particularly for capital development spending. In some ministries, the Government
has assigned responsibility for execution of capital development budgets to staff and advisers
who have developed capacity for expenditure and procurement processing through
implementation of projects financed by the multi-donor Trust Fund for East Timor (TFET). This
has allowed for short-term improvements in budget execution while longer-term capacity in
planning and financial management is being developed. Operation of the community-based road
maintenance program was stalled following a reallocation of funds away from the program's
budget and implementation capacity constraints.

Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
Slow execution of the budget--of which TSP formed about a third--resulted in part from
excessive centralization of expenditure and procurement authority in the Ministry of Planning and
Finance. While this tight control is largely a response to limited capacity in line agencies and the
desire to prevent misuse of funds, it has placed a heavy burden on managers and staff in the
Ministry, particularly in the understaffed central procurement unit. Over the course of TSP, and in
the year following its closure, MPF has begun to implement important measures to strengthen



                                                 12

budget execution, including mechanisms for delegating greater spending authority to line
agencies and pilot programs to distribute block grants to districts.

Costs and financing:
The TSP was originally conceived as bridge financing totaling US$90 million to fill the annual
fiscal gap of about US$30 million projected over three years. Total financing for the three years
of TSP amounted to US$99 million, of which the World Bank contribution amounted to about
US$14 million. Adjustments in total financing responded to the uncertainty of ever-changing
revenue projections and corresponding modifications to the size of the Government budget. The
increase in financing from TSP II to TSP III was justified by a need for sufficient savings to
guard against volatility in oil production and prices and increased capital development spending
for expanded service delivery and infrastructure.

Financing sources did not change substantially, though some co-financing donors did phase out of
the program over time. These shifts did not result in funding constraints, as other co-financiers
were prepared to take up a greater share.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:
The Government and donors have expressed their appreciation for the role of the TSP action
matrix--and the processes behind its development and monitoring--as a tool for identifying the
"priorities of priorities" among national development goals and for bringing a discipline that
internal institutions could not yet impose. The experience of TSP implementation in Timor-Leste
demonstrated the crucial importance of laying out a critical path for the achievement of major
objectives, with quarterly benchmarks to facilitate sequencing, recognize areas of good progress,
and highlight areas where progress was lagging. Implementation of program actions improved as
the action matrix became better defined. The TSP matrix proved to be a particularly helpful
instrument for guiding early state-building efforts, as the new nation faced an overwhelming
agenda of institutional and legislative development actions needed to ensure the basic functioning
of Government. In some areas, however, the program may not have been sufficiently prioritized.
For example, the implementation record of the legislative agenda included in the TSP matrix was
particularly poor, in part as a result of inadequate consideration to the ­enormous-- amount of
work imposed by the overall legislative agenda on a legislature with weak capacity. Moreover, in
the governance area, inadequate prioritization resulted in a broad ­and growing-- front of reforms
advancing slowly rather than in prioritization and speedy implementation of critical reforms.

Table 1 lays out the prior actions identified as necessary for the successful launch of each
operation and the degree to which each was completed before the start of the operation.

While the program as a whole was designed to meet the objective of providing bridge financing
in anticipation of the influx of substantial petroleum revenues, the design of TSP I components
was clearly linked to the goal of establishing a functioning state focused on the implementation of
the country's National Development Plan. Policy actions placed a high priority on setting up the
building blocks of an independent government, including essential institutions, legislation, and
systems for planning, budgeting, and monitoring, while working to achieve "quick wins" in areas
where the Government felt it could achieve early results to maintain stability and provide critical
services. Creating an enabling environment for private sector development and strengthening cost
recovery in the power sector were identified as crucial elements in strengthening the non-
petroleum economy and ensuring an appropriate role for Government as public service provider.

In response to the low levels of local administrative capacity and the withdrawal of the United
Nations transitional administration, TSP I included several activities to improve skills in planning,


                                                 13

preparation, execution, and monitoring of the national budget and develop capacity for petroleum
revenue management in advance of the expected influx of funding from oil and gas production.
At the same time, it was recognized that international technical assistance would be required in
critical areas where capacity gaps persisted while domestic capacity was being developed.
Because of the uncertainties in government capacity to deliver and the fluidity of the overall
economic and political situation, the program was designed to be as flexible as possible, including
two intensive reviews of implementation progress and adjusting policy actions and timetables
where necessary. The single-tranche disbursement profile was adopted to support Government
efforts at sound public expenditure management.

The design of program components was well anchored in a comprehensive program of analytical
work, including a Country Economic Memorandum on Policy Challenges for a New Nation,
presented in May 2002, which covered economic policy and governance; a preliminary Poverty
Assessment based on a household survey and presented in February 2002; a Public Expenditure
Management and Accountability Note, delivered in May 2002, which assessed fiduciary risks and
informed the Government's strategy for strengthening public expenditure management systems,
and a draft Country Procurement Assessment Report presented to the Government for review in
May 2002.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

At the request of the Government, the TSP is being followed up by the Consolidation Support
Program (CSP) for three additional years. CSP financing will be smaller now that the financing
gap no longer exists as previously defined. The strength of the program is instead expected to be
its continuation of TSP's focus on developing the Government's mechanisms for planning,
budgeting, and monitoring, combined with intensive dialogue on priorities and progress.

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)
The TSP's development objective did not change during the life of the program. However, the
rationale of providing bridge financing was adjusted as Timor-Leste's financial situation changed.
In TSP I and TSP II, there was a clear need for external financing to fill the gap between the core
program of expenditures and government revenues. During preparations for the FY2005 budget
and the associated TSP III, revenue estimates were revised upward to take into account an
acceleration of the petroleum production schedule, an increase in the price of oil, and
improvements in domestic tax and customs administration. Given the considerable uncertainty
regarding medium-term estimates of petroleum revenues, however, the Government adopted a
prudent fiscal policy, with continued efforts to mobilize additional domestic revenues and a
modest expenditure program. The case for increased financing in FY2005 lay in the need to build
up adequate savings as a cushion against future petroleum price and volume shocks, to ensure the
integrity of the Government's prudent savings policy for petroleum revenues, to increase capital
development expenditures to facilitate an expansion in service delivery and needed infrastructure
programs, and to build capacity for management of petroleum revenues when they did come on
stream.

Original Components:



                                                14

In the immediate post-independence period, TSP I focused on the creation of institutions,
establishment of a legislative and regulatory framework, and strengthening of management
systems for core government functions. The program consisted of four components: continued
poverty reduction planning and quick wins in service delivery; governance and private sector
development; public expenditure policy and management; and power sector management.

Continued Poverty Reduction Planning and Quick Wins. This component sought to maintain the
momentum of poverty reduction planning initiatives launched by the National Development Plan
by establishing an institutional framework for updating and operationalizing the Government's
development strategy and providing an adequate policy framework for the education, health, and
social protection (veterans affairs) sectors, while at the same time implementing priority activities
that could bring immediate benefits. Particular attention was given to monitoring the impact of
policies on the poor and vulnerable to ensure that they benefited as much as the rest of the
population from public sector interventions.

Governance and Private Sector Development. This component aimed to establish the institutional
and legislative framework for an open, efficient state founded on the rule of law and an enabling
environment for private sector development and investment. Following the preparation of an
ambitious draft legislative program for FY2003, its swift adoption and consistent implementation
were seen to be critical to the successful prioritization and scheduling of several critical pieces of
legislation required in the first year of national independence. Among the most critical items on
the legislative agenda were the framework for the judiciary and oversight institutions, an enabling
environment for private sector development and investment, civil service regulations, and
decisions on the appropriate course of action for decentralization and management of the enclave
of Oecussi.

Public Expenditure Policy and Management. This component sought to ensure that resource
allocations and budget execution remained broadly in line with initial budget allocations and
forward estimates, supporting the development and implementation of poverty reduction
programs, while also strengthening public expenditure management systems to ensure
transparency and accountability in the use of public funds. Of particular concern was the
development of a transparent and accountable framework for management of petroleum revenues
before the expected influx of oil and gas revenues started to come in. Recognizing the limited
capacity for expenditure management in the newly independent Government, TSP I policy
actions focused on developing a financial management capacity building plan, contracting
international technical assistance where needed, and improving capacity for monitoring of basic
economic statistics and social indicators. TSP I established budget allocation parameters to
encourage a focus on pro-poor spending, particularly in education and health, and worked to
develop clear and transparent systems for public expenditure management.

Power Sector. This component sought to strengthen the management capacity of and institutional
framework for the power authority, thereby improving service quality and cost recovery. Under
the system of public provision of power services, TSP I aimed to ensure that services were
managed on a commercial, cost recovery basis, while working to establish an appropriate
institutional and regulatory framework for an autonomous public enterprise. World Bank
assessments indicated that the electricity authority would not be able to meet its ambitious targets
for cost recovery in FY2002 and FY2003, posing the risk of unsustainably high Government
spending on power sector subsidies.

The ambitious nature of TSP I policy actions was deliberate, as the Government wanted to make
early progress across a broad spectrum of NDP implementation priorities and this ambition was


                                                  15

consistently encouraged by the donor community. The priority focus on strengthening institutions,
legislative framework, and management systems was understandable given the operation's timing
in the first full fiscal year after the restoration of independence. This focus was complemented by
a number of actions in the health and education sectors where the Government intended to deliver
quick improvements in service delivery to citizens and to signal the performance orientation of
the public sector.

Revised Components
Though the TSP's overall objectives remained the same over the life of the program, there was a
shift in the conceptualization of program components between the first and the second operations.
The definition of policy actions moved from establishing the fundamentals of a functioning state
and achieving "quick wins" in the immediate post-independence period to longer-term
development priorities. The outbreak of riots in Dili in December 2002, following the shooting
and killing of two demonstrating students by police, had highlighted the critical importance of
security and job creation. In January 2003, the Government announced a Stability Program
calling for increased attention to the priority areas of the NDP, notably service delivery in the
social sectors, job creation, and improvements in governance arrangements and law and order.
These renewed priorities were reflected in the design of program components for TSP II and TSP
III, which covered three thematic areas: good governance, service delivery for poverty reduction,
and job creation.

Good Governance. This component supported the establishment and strengthening of core
government functions and oversight institutions, public sector management, development of
administrative capacity in the justice sector, planning and public expenditure management, and
establishment of the governance framework for Timor-Leste's petroleum revenues. The overall
TSP monitoring framework also included activities related to the strengthening of the national
police, which were supported and monitored by bilateral TSP partners.3

Service Delivery for Poverty Reduction. This component sought to improve the efficiency and
effectiveness of basic social services, including education, health, and recognition of the veterans
of the resistance. In the social sectors, focus was placed on service delivery in primary health and
primary education, in particular in rural areas. Work in the health sector focused on defining
sector policies and strategies, improving the coverage and performance of health services, and
strengthening planning and resource allocation in the sector. Education activities supported the
development of the sector policy and legislative framework; improving access, efficiency, and
quality of basic education; and strengthening capacity for financial and administrative
management. In support of social integration and political stability, TSP II and III supported the
development of a policy and legal framework to recognize veterans of the resistance.

Job Creation. This component sought to increase the availability of gainful employment for the
Timorese population, through the development of a robust private sector and expanded
agricultural opportunities. Private sector development activities focused on establishing the
regulatory framework and institutions to enable business development, promoting investment,
developing a framework for land and property rights, and generating short-term employment
through an emigrant workers program and community-based maintenance of roads. Work in the


3IDA provides support to and monitors only those activities that are within its mandate; activities related to
the strengthening of the national police force and associated judicial activities are supported and monitored
by co-financing partners, principally Australia and the United Kingdom.




                                                     16

agriculture sector supported the development and implementation of sector policies, pilot
development of sustainable marine fisheries, and improvements in food production and food
security.

The organization and design of components for TSP II and TSP III drew from the priorities set
out in the NDP and Stability Program, which highlighted the critical importance of measures to
strengthen governance, service delivery, and job creation. As such, program components were
closely linked with national and program objectives.

Design of revised program components was also based on an expanded body of analytical work
undertaken by the Bank. In addition to the analytical work that fed into the design of TSP I (see
above), subsequent operations were informed by the final Poverty Assessment, Poverty in a New
Nation: Analysis for Action, which was presented in 2003 and used as an input to the design of
sector programs; an education sector study based on the results of the Primary School
Achievement Survey and completed in 2003; the Country Procurement Assessment Report,
delivered in May 2003; and a full Public Expenditure Review, delivered in June 2004, which
analyzed expenditure choices and their correspondence with NDP priorities. The results of a
Demographic and Health Survey financed by TFET, completed in December 2004, shed light on
emerging concerns in the health sector, and analytical work on labor and veterans issues informed
the Bank's social sector programs.

As in TSP I, programmed actions for TSP II reflected the desire of Government and the donor
community for a comprehensive framework to coordinate and monitor the overall program in the
immediate post-independence period. It also reflected the dominant view that breadth of program
coverage was important to effectiveness and sustainability. This approach resulted in an
expansion of programmed activities across sectors and, in particular, in the governance area. In
addition, given the Stability Program's renewed emphasis on security and job creation, TSP II
added activities to enhance agricultural development and strengthen the police services. Because
support to the police lies outside the Bank's institutional mandate, design and monitoring of
related activities was undertaken by bilateral donors involved in the TSP. Following
improvements in power sector cost recovery, the strong emphasis placed on power sector reform
during TSP I was reduced in TSP II and TSP III.

The expansion in programmed activities raised concerns about the Government's capacity to
implement the program, particularly in light of the slow pace of budget execution and continued
reductions in the presence of United Nations advisers. Moreover, there were trade-offs to be made
between focusing scarce capacity on achieving results on the ground or on long-term institution
building, between focusing on critical institutions or covering the whole institutional spectrum,
between planning and implementing, and between the standards and accountability of public
institutions and public finance management and their short-term effectiveness in delivering
results. These trade-offs were resolved in favor of the first of these sets of choices, an approach
which set high standards and a long-term vision for the public sector but was less successful in
delivering short-term results to the population. As a balance of payments and budget support
operation, the TSP was not considered to be an appropriate vehicle for broader institutional
capacity building, though it did include specific measures for capacity building in the critical area
of public expenditure management. In response to this need and in parallel with TSP
implementation, development partners have worked with the Government to design capacity
building programs in key sectors--notably planning and financial management and justice.

By the time TSP III was under preparation, core Government planning systems were largely in
place--notably the preparation and routine monitoring of agency action plans and quarterly


                                                17

reporting matrices--and solid progress had been made in policy development and strategic
planning at the sector level. These advances allowed attention to turn from in-year scheduling to
medium-term program development. Building on the experience of previous programs, TSP III
sought to:

    a) Focus on systems performance by making greater use of performance indicators. The
        development of sector management information systems permitted a gradual shift from
        milestones to performance indicators, thereby reinforcing the service delivery and results
        orientation of TSP III. These indicators were increasingly quantitative where appropriate.

    b) Introduce a medium-term perspective. TSP I and TSP II were prepared and implemented
        as rolling annual programs, but subsequent work on sector policies, SIPs, and the
        formulation of national Millennium Development Goals allowed the Government to
        better define its objectives for the period to FY2007. Three-year objectives and outcomes
        were presented in TSP III to guide the design and monitoring of subsequent annual
        programs.

    c) Mainstream gender issues. Survey data revealed significant gender inequalities in
        development indicators and access to public services and there were growing concerns
        that gender issues were not given adequate attention in the policy agenda. To address
        these shortcomings, the Government asked TSP partners to collaborate with the Office
        for the Promotion of Equality in integrating gender-disaggregated performance indicators
        and specific issues critical to gender equality into the TSP process. Key issues addressed
        in the program include the treatment of domestic violence in the judiciary and police
        services and the integration of gender considerations in the annual planning process of
        key sectors, notably education, health and justice.


3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between policy actions supported by operations and
outcomes)
The objective of the TSP was twofold: to put in place the basic framework for an open and
democratic state in the years following the restoration of Timor-Leste's independence; and to
provide bridge financing that would allow the Government to implement a modest development
program in the lean years before substantial oil and gas revenues came on stream. Achievement
of these objectives and outputs is rated satisfactory for each of the three operations, and for the
program as a whole.

The Government of Timor-Leste faced immense challenges upon the restoration of independence,
including the need to build a new state from the ground up, with very limited human resources,
embryonic institutions, widespread destruction of physical infrastructure, a stagnant economy,
and high levels of poverty and unemployment--all of which contributed to social and political
tensions. Taking this starting point into account, the country's achievements are remarkable if not
yet consolidated. Under TSP I, the Government achieved a successful transition to independence,
with the delivery of basic public services such as schools and health centers restored and
fiduciary systems operating effectively. There has been significant progress in setting up the
architecture of governance and the associated legal frameworks. Advances in policy development
and strategic planning have guided the further prioritization of development goals. Capacity for
planning and budgeting has greatly improved with the development and implementation of AAPs
and SIPs, which feed into the preparation of an increasingly detailed combined sources budget.
Execution of the budget is not yet as strong, posing challenges for effective service delivery and


                                                 18

poverty reduction, but the growing emphasis on improving budget execution through careful
planning, streamlined procurement, and better understanding of systems and processes has begun
to yield results in the post-TSP budget for FY2006.

One of the Government's most impressive achievements under the TSP program has been the
development and adoption of a state-of-the-art legal and institutional framework for petroleum
revenue management, including a Petroleum Fund designed to safeguard public resources for the
benefit of both current and future generations. This has prepared the Government to respond to
higher than expected revenue inflows (owing to increased petroleum production, agreement with
Australia to share revenues emanating from the Greater Sunrise oil and gas field, and historically
high oil prices) with both a prudent savings policy and an expansion of the post-TSP budget in
line with needed spending on infrastructure and social services for poverty reduction. The
Government's conservative expenditure program and growing petroleum and domestic revenues
allowed the TSP to amply meet its objective of bridging the gap between revenues and
expenditures.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs)
Ratings: Satisfactory

Overall, TSP implementation has improved Timor-Leste's ability to make use of its human and
financial resources by providing financing to fill the fiscal gap that existed before petroleum
revenues came on stream, by assisting the development of systems for management of core
government functions, by supporting specific activities to build capacity for public financial
management, by working with and through country systems, and by engaging in continual
intensive dialogue with Governments staff at various levels to enhance program implementation
and monitoring. Despite these important achievements, however, institutional capacity remains
weak in Timor-Leste. The experience of TSP implementation identified the need for targeted
capacity building in public financial management, and the lessons learned have informed the
development of the multi-donor, Bank-managed Planning and Financial Management Capacity
Building Program (PFMCBP).

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

TSP had a positive impact on poverty through its activities on health, education, and veterans. In
health, Annual District Health Plans were established as a routine tool with quarterly monitoring,
and a draft annual strategic activity plan was developed for Dili Hospital. In education,
enrollment increased especially in rural areas and girls while two commissions for veterans made
considerable advance on registration of veterans and a law for veterans.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)
Over the course of TSP implementation, Timor-Leste has made impressive progress in setting up
the institutions of a functioning state. At the restoration of independence, the Executive,
Parliament, Judiciary, and Presidency existed notionally, but in some instances without the
appropriate legal framework, staff, or even offices and equipment. Since then, most of the
governance entities called for in the Constitution have been established and significant progress
has been made in passing critical legislation, notably the legal framework for the petroleum sector,



                                                19

the Public Service Statute, laws on investment and land leasing, and several agency organic laws.
Moreover, since the close of the TSP programmatic series, two major pieces of legislation
supported by TSP have been promulgated: the Procurement Decree Law and the law on veterans.
Elections for village (suco) leaders, which were launched during the implementation of TSP III,
concluded successfully in October 2005, paving the way for the country's first independent
Parliamentary and Presidential elections, scheduled for 2007.

Initially sound budget processes have been supported by increasingly sophisticated systems for
planning, budgeting, and monitoring of budget execution and results. TSP has supported the
implementation and the results-orientation of policy tools aimed at linking budgeting to NDP
objectives, including the preparation of agency AAPs and SIPs. This is no small accomplishment,
though AAPs are still at an early stage, and there is a need for improved integration with budget
preparation and, especially, budget execution and outcomes. A concern, however, is that effort at
developing institutions and planning processes may have come at the expense of implementation
and delivering results. Moreover, it is arguable that the level of sophistication of some of the
planning and public finance management systems and the design and standards of the institutions
established may be too high for the level of capacity of the domestic administration and may
come increasingly under strain as external technical assistance is withdrawn.

Institutional development has been less strong with respect to the judiciary and the private sector.
Proper functioning of the judiciary has been hampered by the lack of qualified local staff, the
long lag before national staff could acquire the needed skills, and difficulties in managing
disparities in familiarity with the Portuguese language. The interim appointment of international
judges has led to some improvements in the efficiency of case resolution. Development of the
private sector has faced formidable obstacles, including unclear and overlapping legislation,
cumbersome procedures for business registration, complicated tax and customs regimes, insecure
land and property rights, insufficient access to credit, and high factor costs. Though the domestic
and foreign investment promotion agencies supported by the TSP process were established just
after the close of the TSP series, more progress is needed in the legal and institutional framework
for private sector development.

Not applicable.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Ratings: Low or negligible

TSP had important risks to program sustainability. Most importantly, the low level of government
capacity and, especially of budget execution and service delivery, has called into question the
Government's ability to achieve program objectives. Since the vast majority of capital
expenditure has so far been executed through TFET projects in the education, health, agriculture
and private sector development sectors, the difficulty in delivering results on-the-ground was
likely to be exacerbated when these projects came to a close in 2007.

A hypothetical discontinuation of TSP monitoring and supervision could also exacerbate the risk
of non-sustainability. Low capacity for budget execution is of particular concern with regard to



                                                 20

the sustainability of TSP objectives. This concern was addressed through the continuation of
support under CSP, accompanied by the multi-donor, Bank-managed PFMCBP, which aims to
strengthen planning, budgeting, public expenditure management, and revenue administration for
growth and poverty reduction. The program, whose design draws heavily on the experience of
TSP implementation, will focus on providing national staff as needed and supporting a holistic
approach to capacity development, integrating skills and knowledge, systems and processes, and
attitudes and behaviors. The PFMCBP is expected to provide US$37 million over five years.
Capacity development has also been supported through small grants to support planning,
expenditure management and procurement; capacity for audit, investigation, and outreach in the
Office of the Inspector General; establishment and functioning of the Office of the Provedor
(Ombudsman); and capacity for the implementation of the National Development Plan.
Development partners are supporting a comprehensive program of capacity development for the
justice sector.

Although fiduciary assurances in Timor-Leste compared favorably with those of other low-
income countries, they were fragile in particular to the departure of international advisers and
potentially to the result of national elections in 2007. While commitment is quite strong in the
current administration, there is no guarantee that the next Government will place similar emphasis
on fiscal prudence and accountability. Timor-Leste's petroleum management regime and actual
petroleum revenue management to date meet international best practice standards, but the risk of
corruption as petroleum revenues increase remains. Moreover, corruption and poor governance in
some areas, such as customs, are also an important and growing concern. The first three years of
independence endowed Timor-Leste with the institutional basis to continue building the basic
structures of an accountable government. The risk to the sustainability of this achievement is to
be found in the absence of short-term benefits to the population in terms of income and job
creation and, to a lesser extent, service delivery, which could fuel social unrest and threaten
potential long-term achievements.

Finally, social and political instability are a concern, as unemployment remains high and job
creation slow. Surveys before the crises indicated that the population was not feeling the benefits
of independence, which is likely to have fuelled the social discontent that turned into violence in
April 2006. At the time of ICR preparation, stability in Timor-Leste is being tested by riots and
violent outbreaks surrounding the dismissal of soldiers comprising nearly one-third of the army.
Their complaints of discrimination between soldiers from the eastern and western portions of the
country have attracted the attention of the broader population, particularly among disaffected
youths and political interest groups, and fueled several disturbances including some violent
incidents. This episode highlights the fragility of Timor-Leste's security and stability, particularly
as national elections draw closer.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
Ratings: Satisfactory

Quality at entry is rated Satisfactory based on (a) the consistency of program objectives with the
Government's development priorities, as laid out in the National Development Plan and
prioritized in the Stability Program, and with the Bank's Transitional Support Strategy; (b)



                                                 21

program design, which fostered ownership by using the Government's own planning instruments
and financial systems and allowed for flexible adaptation to changing priorities within the broad
strategic framework; (c) progress in building capacity for management of core government
functions and petroleum revenues, while developing a parallel program of capacity building in
planning and financial management; and (d) successful incorporation of lessons learned in
subsequent operations. The breadth and depth of programmed activities reflected intensive
negotiations between Government and donors regarding development priorities and definition of
targets for monitoring progress in achieving those priorities. Although the balance of the
operations may have been excessively tilted toward long-term institution-building objectives, this
approach enjoyed broad support at the time and may yet prove adequate in providing a long-term
vision for institutional and policy development.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including M&E arrangements)
Ratings: Highly satisfactory

The dialogue surrounding the TSP has provided the only forum in Timor-Leste where
Government-wide policy issues are discussed and results monitored jointly by Government and
donors. Twice-yearly supervision missions have provided an opportunity for intensive monitoring
and policy dialogue among mission members, line ministries, the Ministry of Planning and
Finance, and the donor community--including Parliament and civil society. Missions began with
individual meetings with Government, civil society, Parliament, and development partners to
assess progress and priorities, and were followed by one week of back-to-back plenary sessions
on each program component to allow Government and donors to exchange views on priorities.
These plenary sessions have provided a time intensive, but highly appreciated forum for
discussion and agreement on the policies and results to be included in the new program (during an
appraisal mission) or the assessment of progress made (in the previous program during an
appraisal mission, and in the current program during a progress review mission). These meetings
were chaired by the Vice-Minister of Planning and Finance and presentations were made by the
ministry/Government agency responsible for each (sub-) component of the program. These
meetings have increasingly involved mid-level Government officials, which the Government
feels contributes to capacity building. In an attempt to minimize disruption to the Government's
regular course of business, TSP missions were scheduled in line with the Government's budget
preparation process to serve as an input into the review of the current year's budget and
development of programs for the following year. Scheduling missions according to the
Government's timetable supported the TSP's aim to work through country systems, though it
occasionally posed difficulties in ensuring the availability of team members from all sectors for
mission travel. Where possible, plans were made in advance and missing team members were
supported by qualified consultants and use of video-conferencing facilities.

In between missions, the Bank has effectively supported the Government's program through
continued dialogue with the authorities, review and assessment of the Quarterly Monitoring
Reports provided by the Government, timely responses to Government requests for technical and
implementation assistance, and close collaboration with other TSP development partners. This
high level of involvement, combined with the transaction-intensive monitoring of up to eight
individual grant agreements with co-financing partners, has at times stretched the capacity of the
Bank's supervision team, particularly as the core team did not include a field-based staff member.
Interim dialogue with Government and donors was supported by the country management team
and sector colleagues who sought to align their sector programs with the overall thrust and
direction of TSP.



                                                 22

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Lending:
The Bank's lending performance is rated satisfactory for TSP III. The design of TSP I was
undertaken quickly in the transition to independence, with careful attention to critical institutional
development needs to ensure smooth handover of core government functions to the nascent
Government of Timor-Leste. TSP I design also focused on the need for "quick wins" to deliver
results and build confidence in the government's willingness and capacity to meet the basic needs
of citizens, particularly in the health and education sectors. The design of TSP II responded to the
Government's redefinition of development priorities as laid out in the Stability Program,
reshaping program components to address objectives for good governance, service delivery, and
job creation. TSP III continued this focus, while drawing from the experience gained through
previous programs to place a greater focus on identifying and monitoring medium-term
performance indicators and encouraging progress on issues that cut across multiple Government
agencies, such as gender equality. TSP III also expanded the governance agenda. The TSP's
flexibility to guide and respond to the definition of new priorities from year to year, and to adjust
program activities and milestones within years, has allowed it to serve as a useful tool for
effective planning, monitoring, and dialogue regarding the Government's program, and for
providing development partners with a broad view of the context for their own assistance
programs.

Still, the ambitious nature of each TSP program and its partial accomplishment of program
objectives points to lack of strategic focus and insufficient prioritization on the part the Bank (as
well as other donors and Government), particularly given the low levels of institutional and
individual capacity in the country and its role in slowing down budget execution and stalling
progress on key items of the agenda. The insufficient prioritization was reflected in the growing
size of the TSP action matrix, which in some cases became unwieldy--particularly when the
increase in size did not correspond to greater clarity and specificity of actions but rather to
insufficient attention to priority-setting and the realism of targets set for each year. However, the
expansion of the TSP matrix ­especially in TSP III-- was also a byproduct of the success of the
operation, which led line ministries and donors to increasingly try to feature their preferred
objectives in it so as to increase high-level government and donor focus on them. Slow progress
with respect to program objectives in some areas, including governance, education (in the earlier
years), agriculture, and private sector development highlight some weaknesses in assessing
overall government capacity to deliver and, given those constraints, in defining the appropriate
focus within each area and the institutional and policy steps required to achieve results. Slow
progress in these areas also underscores the need to pay careful attention to the balance between
short-term service delivery and job creation and long-term institutional development. Within
institutional development, it sheds light on the need for strategic prioritization rather than slow
sequencing along a very broad number of areas. In some cases, however, the omission of a key
priority or misdirected emphasis on a particular action could only be identified in hindsight. For
example, it was not clear at the start of the TSP that the primary source for job creation in Timor-
Leste would most likely arise from improved implementation of the capital development budget
while longer-term initiatives in private sector development were underway.

The TSP is relatively unique in pursuing a results-based approach in the context of a post-conflict,
low capacity country. Both the Government and development partners have praised the process of
TSP preparation and supervision for its focus on building capacity, providing oversight in an
environment where the local oversight institutions are weak and emphasizing coordination with
development partners. The Bank's role in administering TSP has helped the Government
coordinate program design and implementation with other development partners. External


                                                  23

partners have played an active role, not just in program design and monitoring, but also in
ensuring that Government agencies have access to the technical support needed to implement the
program.

The Bank has undertaken significant analytical work to underpin the design and implementation
of TSP, including a Country Economic Memorandum, Poverty Assessment, Public Expenditure
Management and Accountability Note, Country Procurement Assessment Report, and Public
Expenditure Review, as well as sector analytical work in education and health, and technical
assistance to the preparation of sector policies and SIPs in agriculture, education, health, roads,
and power. The preparation of issues papers on salient topics, including public expenditure
systems, governance, and Sector Investment Programs, has improved the quality of dialogue by
helping to focus the attention of Government and development partners on key program design
and implementation issues.

Supervision:
The Bank's supervision performance is rated highly satisfactory for TSP III. The dialogue
surrounding the TSP has provided the only forum in Timor-Leste where Government-wide policy
issues are discussed and results monitored jointly by Government and donors. Twice-yearly
supervision missions have provided an opportunity for intensive monitoring and policy dialogue
among mission members, line ministries, the Ministry of Planning and Finance, and the donor
community--including Parliament and civil society. Missions began with individual meetings
with Government, civil society, Parliament, and development partners to assess progress and
priorities, and were followed by one week of back-to-back plenary sessions on each program
component to allow Government and donors to exchange views on priorities. These plenary
sessions have provided a time intensive, but highly appreciated forum for discussion and
agreement on the policies and results to be included in the new program (during an appraisal
mission) or the assessment of progress made (in the previous program during an appraisal mission,
and in the current program during a progress review mission). These meetings were chaired by
the Vice-Minister of Planning and Finance and presentations were made by the
ministry/Government agency responsible for each (sub-) component of the program. These
meetings have increasingly involved mid-level Government officials, which the Government
feels contributes to capacity building. In an attempt to minimize disruption to the Government's
regular course of business, TSP missions were scheduled in line with the Government's budget
preparation process to serve as an input into the review of the current year's budget and
development of programs for the following year. Scheduling missions according to the
Government's timetable supported the TSP's aim to work through country systems, though it
occasionally posed difficulties in ensuring the availability of team members from all sectors for
mission travel. Where possible, plans were made in advance and missing team members were

Overall Bank performance is rated satisfactory.


5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Ratings: Satisfactory.
Initially, the urgency required for the preparation of TSP I and the existence of a United Nations
Transitional Administration limited the Government's involvement in program design. Once in
place, the Government took the lead in preparing and supervising TSP II and TSP III. These
programs were based on NDP and Stability Program priorities and drew from activities identified
in the Government's AAPs and SIPs. In many cases, the ambitious objectives and outputs of the
program were defined by the Government as a means to guide progress on various development
priorities. The inclusion of program activities also reflected the desire of individual line agencies
and Government departments to include in the matrix their policy priorities in order to increase
their profile in the overall government and donor agendas and to enhance the chances of enlisting
technical assistance from donors for their implementation.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Ratings: Satisfactory.
Though the TSP is managed by the Ministry of Planning Finance, successful TSP implementation
depends on a wide variety of Government agencies and departments, as well as oversight
institutions and Parliament. Strengths and weaknesses in this area are captured above in the
assessment of Government implementation performance as satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Ratings:
Overall recipient commitment to program implementation was strong, owing to the program's
close alignment with national and ministry/agency goals. The Prime Minister was a strong
supporter of the program as he indicated it assisted him in high-level monitoring. The Ministry of
Planning and Finance, as the key implementing agency, exercised an increasingly strong and
effective coordination role in program development and implementation. Overall, the
Government of Timor-Leste achieved a great deal in its first three years of independence, from
establishing the building blocks of the state to developing legislative and policy frameworks for a
wide variety of sectors, and restoring and improving public services. In areas of the program that
required ownership and commitment across ministries, across different departments within
ministries, and between central and local government, implementation was at times affected by a
lack of communication and varying perceptions of the urgency of each task with relation to other
entities. This effect was particularly pronounced in the slow rates of budget execution across
Government, and particularly in sectors such as education and justice, where line agencies with
significant procurement needs were faced with a limited understanding of rules and procedures,
low staff skills in financial management, and tight expenditure controls in MPF.

The Government performed well in program monitoring, producing increasingly comprehensive
quarterly reports on program implementation as part of its Quarterly Reporting Matrix and
regular updates on budget execution. With the exception of occasional delays in distributing these
reports to donors, the Government proved generally to be highly responsive to the Bank's
requests for information on the progress of program activities.




                                                 25

The Government's performance on transparency and information sharing was comparatively
weak, both in terms of including Parliament, civil society, and the private sector in planning and
monitoring of annual programs and in achieving program actions that focused on encouraging
transparency and communications. For example, though the budget of Timor-Leste is published
and widely available in its original form, TSP activities focused on presenting the budget in a
format readily accessible to the public and distributing it widely in the districts have not yet been
achieved. Similarly, despite provisions to the contrary, the National Gazette is published in only
one of the two national languages, which restricts the access of citizens to this useful information
on Government activities and plans. Development of the TSP action matrix remains internal to
the Government, with presentations to Parliament and civil society after progress missions but no
effort to solicit the involvement of those parties in the design or monitoring of the matrix. A
notable exception to weaknesses in transparency is the highly consultative process adopted in the
preparation and finalization of the country's legal and institutional framework for petroleum
revenue management.

6. Lessons Learned
(both operation-specific and of wide general application)
Fostering ownership and supporting country systems. As a budget support operation, the TSP has
ensured that the use of funds from the operation responds to Government priorities, supporting
ownership. Moreover, by using the same broad priority areas as the National Development Plan
and the Road Map, it has supported country ownership. It has also built on the Government's own
planning process by incorporating priority actions identified in AAPs across sectors and, as they
became available, in SIPs. The importance of ensuring government ownership also became
obvious in areas where it was insufficient. In particular, policy actions that were included in the
program's policy matrix after hard negotiations, but were neither originally part of the
government's program nor subsequently included in its AAPs, rarely advanced.

The priority setting and detailed progress reviews that took place during TSP missions informed
the preparation of the Government's budget, which improved markedly in quality and level of
detail over the three years of TSP implementation. This positive development was facilitated by
the scheduling of TSP appraisal and supervision missions to coincide with critical points in the
budget planning and preparation process and by the translation of action matrices into Portuguese
and Tetum to ensure wide comprehension of activities and plans across areas and levels of
Government. By channeling funds through the Government's own budget, the TSP strengthened
the public finance management capacity of civil servants and their understanding of Government
procedures.

Building management capacity and results-orientation through program implementation. The
TSP has supported capacity building through its dialogue on policy design and implementation
and its monitoring of results. The Government's capacity is much stronger in these areas today
than it was at the restoration of independence. By having the Ministry of Planning and Finance as
the coordinator of such a results-based operation, it has made a significant contribution to its
results orientation and, to a lesser extent, to the public finance management capacity of line
ministries. Though the TSP process itself and the technical assistance programmed alongside the
implementation of specific TSP actions have made significant contributions to capacity building,
they were not able to address the fundamental shortage of skilled and experienced technicians and
managers. In addition, the overall approach to technical assistance and capacity building during
the transition was severely flawed, failing to ensure effective transfer of skills and build up a
cadre of staff with the core skills needed to fulfill essential public administration functions. As a
result, dependence on external assistance has persisted. As a budget support operation, the TSP



                                                 26

has not been able to tackle this problem directly, but over the course of implementation it became
clear that a parallel, project-based intervention was needed. The multi-donor PFMCBP has been
developed to address this concern and provide support to development of planning and financial
management skills in the context of the CSP.

Prioritizing for results in a capacity-constrained environment.

Balancing short-term results with long-term institution-building. Budget support operations such
as TSP play an important role in the long-term strengthening of Government systems and
processes and the development of institutional structures. However, they are less effective in
delivering short-term results, whether in terms of service delivery or job creation, especially if
Government systems are weak. This is an important tradeoff that needs to be taken into account
when designing country assistance strategies, particularly in post-conflict and/or low capacity
environments. That being said, these operations can be more or less focused on the achievement
of immediate results. A lesson from TSP implementation is that it is important not to sacrifice the
present for the sake of an uncertain future and to seek to prioritize a government's budget
execution capacity and service delivery on the ground as the critical safeguards to political and
social stability.

Supporting a whole-of-Government approach. In bringing the majority of Timor-Leste's
development partners together around a whole-of-Government framework for development, the
TSP has provided an anchor for all donor-financed activities in the country. This coordination
mechanism has allowed coverage of all critical issues, making effective use of the comparative
advantage of each partner within an overarching framework, without neglecting areas in which
some partners (including the Bank) are not active. The TSP's active involvement of non-
financing partners in policy discussions, progress reviews, and program design has helped to
ensure coordination beyond the confines of the program itself. This approach also promotes
mainstreaming of cross-sectoral issues such as promoting gender equality. Moreover, the TSP has
encouraged policy dialogue within and across ministries and between government, donors, and
civil society. By linking budgets with results, TSP has encouraged coordination between MPF
and line ministries and across line ministries. While nascent, TSP has been an increasingly
important vehicle for the expression of civil society's priorities and concerns. Moreover, TSP
missions have met with the public finance committee of Parliament. However, members of civil
society have expressed frustration with the limited opportunities for them to provide input to the
design and supervision of TSP objectives and activities. Though reaching out to actors within and
beyond Government is critical to building awareness of achievements, generating understanding
about obstacles to progress, and therefore maintaining stability, the Government has tended to
resist suggestions to this effect. As a result, the TSP has struggled to keep a delicate balance
between fostering civil society and Parliamentary involvement on the one hand, and respecting
the views of the Government on the other.

Providing timely analytical inputs for appropriate program design and fruitful dialogue. The TSP
has been built on detailed analytical work to guide the design of program objectives and activities.
Preparation of issues papers on specific topics of interest to the Government and donors has been
highly useful in laying the basis for understanding of each topic, sharing international experience,
and helping to focus attention on critical design and implementation issues just prior to the
fielding of progress and appraisal missions. The preparation of a Public Expenditure Management
Accountability Note helped demystify the Government's expenditure and procurement processes
for Government staff across agencies, and for development partners. An issues paper on
governance, strengthening the Institutions of Governance in Timor-Leste, was prepared and, after
broad consultation with Government, Parliament, the President, justice sector institutions, civil

society, and development partners, formed the foundation for a constructive dialogue over
critical--often sensitive--areas of the governance agenda. An issues paper on the Sector
Investment Programs explored aid delivery mechanisms appropriate for implementation of the
SIPs and paved the way for the setting up of sector working groups and the continuation of
budget support through CSP I. The impact of these issues papers was strengthened by timely
preparation and intensive dialogue with a broad set of stakeholders.

Balancing coverage and focus. The TSP brought to light the challenges of budget support in low-
income, low-capacity countries. Over the course of TSP implementation, there was much debate
over the appropriate scope and detail required in the TSP program and action matrix. Some
partners advocated a streamlined program, with a small number of key performance indicators
and milestones monitored through the TSP process. The Government opted for a broader program,
with a detailed action matrix incorporating quarterly milestones, largely in order to support its
internal scheduling and monitoring. The TSP team, following the recommendation of most
program partners, sought to adjust program design to meet the Government's needs, accepting
that the action matrix is much more detailed than seen in comparable Bank operations. The
program's broad scope and wide donor participation posed difficulties in balancing
representativeness with strategic focus. Including a large number of areas and actions within each
area accommodated the priorities of various Government agencies and development partners. It
also allowed the program to be representative of overall progress across and within each sector or
area, supporting Government planning and monitoring at various points of the results chain. At
the same time, however, program expansion led in some cases to unrealistic expectations about
what Government could deliver, diverting attention from the most strategic, achievable goals. The
implications of a detailed action matrix will need to be reassessed in light of the emerging sector
working groups, on the basis of a clear division of labor between the planning and coordination
instruments available to Government and TSP partners.

Minimizing the burden of preparation, appraisal, and monitoring. The Government and, in
particular, the Ministry of Planning and Finance as the main coordinating agency, has argued that
TSP progress and appraisal missions have placed a considerable burden on the administration,
with the counterpart teams fully engaged in the TSP process during missions. This has resulted in
part from the role of TSP missions as a mechanism for internal review of the Government's
program, facilitating discussions between the MPF as coordinating body and line agencies, and
between Government and its external partners. It is also a consequence of the program design,
with a detailed program matrix requiring missions to review a large number of program activities
and outputs to meet the Bank's due diligence requirements for project appraisal and monitoring.
The intensity of the mission schedule was exacerbated by the lack of task team representation in
the field, requiring all preparation, appraisal, and supervision tasks to take place during already
intensive missions. The TSP team made an effort to streamline the process by reducing the
number and duration of missions, but this did not prove to be a satisfactory solution: missions
were intense, with a huge workload crammed into a short period of time, and consultations with
external partners crowding out time for consultations between the MPF, line ministries, and the
TSP technical team. Another possible solution would be a two-stage preparation and appraisal
process, with a small preparation mission early in the budget process to highlight key policy and
program design issues and a larger appraisal mission, ideally of no longer than two weeks,
focusing on selection and scheduling of the key actions to be included in the matrix. During
appraisal, adequate time needs to be programmed for meetings between MPF, line ministries and
the TSP technical team to work on the draft matrix before consultations begin with external
partners.
