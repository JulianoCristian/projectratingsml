 IEGWB Mission:Enhancingdevelopmenteffectivenessthrough excellenceand independence in evaluation.


About this Report
       The Independent EvaluationGroup assesses the programs and activitiesof theWorld Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensurethe integrity of the Bank's self-evaluationprocessandto verify that the Bank's work is producing the
expected results,and second, to help develop improved directions,policies,and procedures through the
dissemination of lessonsdrawn from experience. As part of this work, IEGWBannually assesses about 25 percent of
the Bank's lendingoperations through fieldwork. Inselectingoperationsfor assessment, preference is givento those
that are innovative,large, or complex; thosethat are relevantto upcomingstudiesor country evaluations; those for
which ExecutiveDirectors or Bank managementhave requestedassessments; and those that are likelyto generate
important lessons.
       To preparea Project PerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR), IEGWBstaff examine projectfiles and other
documents, interview operationalstaff, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operationwith the government,
and other in-countrystakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquartersand
in local offices as appropriate.
       Each PPAR is subject to internal IEGWB peer review, Panel review, and managementapproval. Once cleared
internally,the PPAR is commentedon by the responsibleBank department. IEGWB incorporatesthe commentsas
relevant.The completed PPAR is then sent to the borrowerfor review; the borrowers'commentsare attached to
the document that is sent to the Bank's Boardof ExecutiveDirectors.After an assessment report has beensent to
the Board, it is disclosed to the public.

About the IEGWB RatingSystem
       IEGWB's use of multipleevaluation methodsoffers both rigor and a necessary levelof flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEGWBevaluators all apply the same basic methodto
arrive at their project ratings. Followingis the definitionand rating scale usedfor each evaluationcriterion
(additional information is available on the IEGWBwebsite: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
       Outcome: The extent to which the operation's major relevantobjectives were achieved,or are expectedto
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevanceincludes
relevanceof objectives and relevanceof design. Relevanceof objectives is the extentto which the project's
objectives are consistentwith the country's current development prioritiesand with current Bank country and
sectoral assistancestrategies and corporate goals (expressedin Poverty ReductionStrategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, OperationalPolicies). Relevanceof design is the extent to which
the project'sdesign is consistentwith the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project's objectives
were achieved, or are expectedto be achieved, taking into account their relative importance.Efficiencyis the
extent to which the projectachieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higherthan the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost comparedto alternatives.The efficiencydimension generally is not appliedto adjustment
operations. Possibleratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory,Satisfactory, ModeratelySatisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory,Highly Unsatisfactory.
       Risk to DevelopmentOutcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that developmentoutcomes (or
expected outcomes)will not be maintained(or realized). Possibleratings for Risk to DevelopmentOutcome: High
Significant, Moderate, Negligibleto Low, Not Evaluable.
       BankPerformance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effectiveimplementationthrough appropriatesupervision(includingensuring adequate
transitionarrangementsfor regularoperation of supported activities after loanlcreditclosing,toward the
achievementof developmentoutcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possibleratings for BankPerformance: HighlySatisfactory, Satisfactory,ModeratelySatisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory,Highly Unsatisfactory.
       BorrowerPerformance: The extent to which the borrower (including the governmentand implementing
agency or agencies)ensured quality of preparationand implementation,and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievementof development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions:government
performanceand implementingagency(ies) performance. Possibleratings for BorrowerPerformance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, ModeratelySatisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory,Highly
Unsatisfactory.

         This i s a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) on three operations in
Timor-Leste (TL): the First Transition Support Program for FY2003 (TSP I), Second
                                                                              the
Transition Support Program for FY2004 (TSP 11), andthe Third Transition Support
Program for FY2005 (TSP 111).

         The three projects inthe Transition Support Program series were chosen for a
PPAR following a strong recommendation contained inthe two ICRReviewscompleted
inSeptember2007 which suggestedthat amore detailed reviewwith afieldvisit would

         TSP Iwas supportedbya grant of$5.00 millionfrom the Development Grant
Facility (DGF). Co-financing by eight bilateral donors (the governments of: Australia,
Canada, Finland, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, the UnitedKingdom, and the United
States of America) totaled about $23 millionequivalent, andwas channeledthrough
Bank-administered Trust Funds.The Government o fPortugal provided its own support of
the program directly. TSP Iwas approved on July 22,2002.

         TSP I1was supportedby anIDA grant of SDR2.9 million ($4.16 million
equivalent). Co-financing bythe eight bilateral donors totaling $29 million equivalent
was channeledthrough Bank-administered Trust Funds. An additional $3 million
equivalent, also associatedwith this operation, was provided directly. The IDA grant was
approved on July 22,2003; became effective on October 10,2003; and closed on October
31,2004. Itwas disbursedinone tranche following effectiveness.

         TSP I11was supportedbyanother IDAgrant of SDR 3.4 million ($4.96 million
equivalent). Co-financingbybilateraldonors totaling $23.2 million equivalent was
channeledthrough Bank-administered Trust Funds.An additional $3 million equivalent,
also associatedwith this operation, was provided directly. The IDA grantwas approved
on October 28,2004; became effective on December 8,2004; and closed on October 31,
2005. It was disbursedinone tranche following effectiveness.

Summary

1.       This PPAR revieweda series o fthree inter-related operations inTimor-Leste over
the 2003-2005 period, insupport o f the country's Transition Support Program (TSP). The
first, TSP I(FY2003), was fundedby apost-conflictgrant from the Development Grant
Facility. TSP I1(FY2004) and TSP I11(FY 2005) were bothprovided as IDA grants.
These operations were part o f a muchbroader international effort involving the United
Nations, the IMF, the Asian Development Bank, and a group of about a dozenbilateral
donors insupport o f this new country's initialreconstruction and development efforts.
The IDA grants averaged around $5 million each, andtheir combined amount o f about
$15 million was part of an overall grant financing packageo f slightly over $90 million by
all the co-financing partners(eight bilateraldonors and IDA).The three IDA grants were
disbursedinsingle tranches at effectiveness, following corresponding sets o fcompleted
prior actions. No prior conditionalitywas involved. The main objective o f these fast-
disbursingfunds was to provide urgentlyneededbridge-financing to the budgetuntilthe
expectedincreasesrevenues from recently discovered and developed oil and gas became
available.

2.       Timor-Leste gained its independenceinMay 2002, following about four centuries
o f colonization by Portugal, and twenty five years o f Indonesian occupation. The
resistanceto the occupation andthe events leading to independencewitnessed severe
destruction o f economic structure and extreme violence and dislocation that left the
country at a very primitivesocio-economic state on the eve o f its independence.
Planning, policy and implementation capacity was among the poorest inthe world.

3.       The Government's TSP was basedon its National Development Plan(NDP) anda
numberofrelatedplanning,budgetingandmonitoringinstruments. The mainstrategic
objectives ofthe NDP, andof IDA'SCountry Assistance Strategy, were to promote
sustainableeconomic growth andto reducepoverty. To that end, eacho fthe three TSP
operations was basedon extensive, rather unwieldy, Action Matrices o f specific measures
inawiderangeofpolicy, institutional, regulatory, andlegislative areas. Measuresthatwere
not completed, or started, inone operationwere taken up inthe next operation. The broad
components andcoverage o f all three operationswere essentially the same (except for the
power sector component which was dropped after the first operation). The three main
componentsthat were common to the whole seriesbasically covered: (i)     governance;
(ii) delivery,mainlyinthehealthandeducationsectors,butincludingveterans'
    service
affairs; and(iii)
                job creation, through the private sector, work programs, andagriculture.

4.       Implementation experience and outcomes under the individual operations, and in
view oftheir interconnected nature, ofthe series as a group, was mixed. Goodprogress
was made inestablishing andrunningthe Petroleum Fund, intendedto safeguardthe bulk
o fpetroleumrevenues against abuse and for future generations. Inthe health sector, the
quantitative targets that were set were either met, or exceeded. Electricity meteringand
addedcapacity initially reduced the dependenceo fthe power authority on budgetary
transfers, but deteriorated following the 2006 politicaldisturbances. Inaddition, the
Government, the donor community, and the involvedBank staff all considered that
puttinginplace the processandculture ofplanning, budgeting, andmonitoringwas in

                                                X



itselfa major achievement; as was the excellent donor coordination inwhich the Bank
played a key role.

5.      Most o f the other areas coveredby the Policy Action Matrices associated with the
three TSP operations witnessed either partial, or poor, progress. The establishment,
staffing, and initial phases o f operation o fthe offices o f the Ombudsman and the
Inspector General was an achievement; although it is still too early to judge how effective
they will be, or whether they deserved the level o fpriority they were accorded inprogram
design and implementation. Budget execution has emerged as a major area o fweakness
andconcern, inview o fthe very weak implementation capacity. Progress inthe education
sector has beenmodest, at best; andthat inthe areas o fprivate sector development, the
judicial sector, and agriculture disappointing, though partial. Inaddition, it does not seem
like the three TSP operations funded by IDAhave had any impact on economic growth or
poverty reduction; nor on enhancing political stability.

6.      Inthe ultimate analysis, one shouldnot lose sight ofwhere the country started
from at the beginning o f this new century. The dire conditions that existed at the time
made it very difficult to make significant progress across a broad front. As such, the good
progress made ina few key areas, combined with the partial progress made across the
wider front, was certainly welcome. However, it must also be noted that a large portion o f
actions envisaged under the three TSP operations could not be completed by the
respective closing dates. Inthe case o f the third TSP, 41 percent o f actions have not been
completed and another 28 percent o f actions were re-scheduled for the subsequent series
of Bank operations (CSP). Based on that, this review gives a ranking o f moderately
unsatisfactory to overall outcome, andto Borrower andBank performance; and assigns a
rankingo fsignzpcant to the risk to development outcome, inview o fthe uncertain
political situation andthe very limited capacity.

7.      The main lessons learned from the experience under the three TSP operations are:

 e      Ininstances similarto those faced byTimor-Leste onthe eve ofits independence,
        and following a period o fprotracted conflict and devastation, the Bank should
        argue more strongly infavor o f more focused and simpler program design, with
        tight priorities, especially for grants disbursed inone tranche for generalized
        budget support. Ifthe Borrower feels strongly that it needs support for a broad-
        fronted program involving a large number o f time-consuming institutional
        measures with a hightechnical assistance content, it would be preferable to
        provide a specific TA operation with a more appropriate (Le. longer)
        implementation horizon.

 e      Incases likeTimor-Leste where there ishighpolitical risk, due inlargemeasure
        to highunemployment among disgruntled youth, efforts should be directed at
        creatingjobs and achieving "quick wins" inpoverty-related services, and through
        work programs; rather than dissipating efforts across a wide range o f areas and
        measures, with little explicit priorities.

 0      Where capacity limitations are severe and TA is normally required to do the work
        itself, as well as to train a large number o fpersonnel, it is probably more effective
        to provide TA which is dedicated entirely to training, inparallel to advisors who

                                         xi


   actually do part o fthe work. Combining both functions inthe same individual,
   though attractive inprinciple, often leads to situations where the advisors devote
  hardlyanytime to training, andtherefore, buildinglocalcapacity suffers.
   Quite often, but particularly incountries with limitedqualified personnel, success
   i s highly correlated with working with the more competent and committed
   counterparts. Therefore, where possible, it would be desirable for the Bank to
   focus its support aroundproven achievers, while seeking to develop institutional
   capacity.

0  Despiteits costs to the Government and its development partners, which canbe
  highat times, thebenefits ofactive donor coordinationareoftenworthwhile and
   outweigh its costs, as demonstrated by the experience under the TSP program.

1.      Background and Context

Political Background

1.1     Timor-Leste occupies about 15 thousand square kilometers inthe mountainous
easternhalfo f the islando fTimor. Originally, its populationevolved from waves o f
migrations that characterized the Australasia region, includingAustronesians andproto-
Malays. The mountainous topography meant that the various groups could remain
separate, andthat explains the large linguistic and ethnic diversity inthe country today.

1.2     Portugal colonized Timor-Leste inthe sixteenth century, and remained there for
about four centuries; imparting its language, initial institutional structures, and some
culturaltraits to the territory. After Portugal started its decolonization process in 1974,
Timor-Leste declared its independenceonNovember 28, 1975. Nine days later, it was
occupied by Indonesia and incorporated into that country, without the recognition o fthe
UnitedNations. The occupation faced stiffandpopular resistanceledby an armed
movement, Falintil, andincluded groups o f civilian supporters andrepresentativeso fthe
diaspora.The occupation was markedby extreme violence that wiped out about a third
ofthe population.

1.3     Following a UN-sponsoredagreement amongPortugal, Indonesia andthe United
States, and a surprisingoffer by IndonesianPresidentHabibie; a UN-supervised
referendumwas carried out onAugust 31,1999. It offeredthe population a choice between
independence, andan autonomous statuswithin Indonesia. An overwhelming majority
voted for independence.However, violent clashesbroke out immediately, instigated
primarilybythe IndonesianmilitaryandinvolvingTimorese pro-Indonesiamilitias. An
internationalpeacekeepingforce, ledbyAustralia, intervenedto helprestore order, and
subsequentlyevolved into the UnitedNations Transitional Administration inEastTimor
(UNTAET) which ruledfrom September 1999to May 20,2002. OnMay 20,2002, Timor
Leste becamea sovereign nation andinauguratedits first Government andjoined the UN
on September27,2002. But this independencewas bought at a veryheavyprice, following
more than 25 years o fturbulence: the brutalviolence surroundingthe 1999referendum
witnessed the deatho fmore than a thousandpeople, the displacement o fthe majority o fthe
population, andthe destructiono fmost o fthe physicalinfiastructure.

1.4     Compared to the turbulent years o fthe Indonesian occupation that culminated in
the markedviolence surrounding the 1999referendum, the short post-independence
period startedout with some signs o frelative stability, for a new country emerging from
serious conflicts. Unfortunately, the risks to this stability has continued to be felt due to
several factors: the continuedpresence ofthe hard-core pro-Indonesia militia inWest
Timor, fault lines among the country's internalfactions themselves, serious problems
withinthe security forces, andthe spreadofviolence bymartialarts youth groups.
Although these risks could conceivably be contained by a combination o finternal
diplomacy, security enforcement, and economic policies; they do represent a source o f
considerable uncertainty andpotentialupheaval. Recent examples of continued
turbulence andviolence includedthe aftermath o fthe riots that broke out inDiliinApril
2006, which were triggered bythe dismissal o f soldiers who were accused of desertion;

                                               2


the violence inconjunction with the presidential elections in2007; and attempts to
assassinatethe President andPrime Minister inFebruary 2008. Such incidents
themselves, as well as the atmosphere o f unresolved tensions and problems that breeds
them, can certainly become a major drag on economic development efforts inthe
immediate fbture.

EconomicBackground

1.5      Overall Economic Developments. Aside from some commercial coffee
plantations established by the Portuguese at the end ofthe nineteenthcentury; a rather
primitive, subsistence, mainly agrarian economy prevailed before and throughout the
colonization period. There were modest exports of coffee, sandalwood, wax, and honey.
Timor-Leste was the least developed o f all o f Portugal's colonies. It receivedmeager
subsidies from Lisbon, and as late as the 1970s, basic education was still being
generalized to cover the whole territory, and the first set o ftarmac roads was being built.

1.6     Unfortunately, whatever limitedprogress hadbeenmade close to the end o f the
twentieth century, was drastically set back duringthe 1999 violence. According to the
June, 2005 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), "An estimated 70 percent o fprivate
homes and public buildingswere burned to the ground. Bridges andpower lines were
demolished, and the telecommunications system was rendered inoperable. Valuable files,
including land andproperty titles, civil registry, and educationrecords were destroyed.
Following the 1999 referendum, most Indonesian citizens left the territory, resulting ina
severe shortage o f qualified and experienced professionals. The country was left with
only two power engineers, 20 percent o f its secondary school teachers, 23 medical
doctors including one surgeon, and not a single qualified pharmacist." It is very
importantthat this dire state of affairs that existedat the timewhen the country
starteditsdevelopmentdrive, be frontally keptinmindwhen evaluatingprogress
to-date, as well as assessingachievementsby the Governmentandits development
partners,includingtheBank.

1.7      Evaluating economic performance duringthe years leading up to, and
immediately following, independence is hamperedbythe absence, or poor quality o f
data. This has beenhighlighted by successive lMF Article IV Consultations missions,
including that o f 2007. With this general caveat inmind, the documents reviewedpaint a
broadpicture o f overall macroeconomic performanceduringthe 1999-2003 period, on
the eve o f the preparation and processingof TSP I,the first o f the three operations
reviewed inthis report (Table 1).

1.8     The output figures confirm that Timor-Leste was among the poorest countries o f
the world, with a per capita GNP o f around $375 in2003. Real non-oil output declined
precipitously in 1999 (by 35 percent) due to the heavy destruction caused by the severe
violence that year. Itreboundedby a significant 15 percent ineach o f 2000 and 2001, due
primarily to a large influx o f expatriates brought inunder UNauspices to help with
security and economic development. It declined sharply in2002, andbecame negative in
200 3, as the presence o f the expatriate community dwindled. Such severe fluctuations
reflect the extreme thinness and fragility ofthe country's economic base, and its acute
dependence on political stability.

1.9      The thinness and fragility are also reflected inthe public finances andthe balance
o fpayments. Both suffered from significant deficits due to meager levels o fpublic
revenues (inthe case o f the budget) and export earnings (inthe case o fthe external
account). Bothdeficits were essentially financed by grant funding from the donor
community.

1.10     Poverty. A Household Survey, a Village Survey, and a Participatory Poverty
Assessment were carried out in2001. Theyhelpedquantify the level andnature o f
poverty and social services. They also confirmedthe general beliefthat poverty was
among the highest inthe world, and social services among the lowest. About 40 percent
o fthe population was found to bepoor. The incidence o fpovertywas muchworse in
rural areas (nearly 46 percent) thaninurban locations (about 26 percent). It was worst in
the rural west and center o fthe country. About 85 percent o f the poor lived inrural areas.

1.11 Povertywas exacerbatedbythe 1999violence and destruction o fkey assets like
dwellingsand livestock, particularly inthe westernborder areas. Food security was
worsened as a result, leading to malnourishment o f about half o fthe child population. A
longhistory of under-investment inpublic serviceshad ledto very poor social indicators.
For example, almost half o fthe adult populationhadnever attended school, 46 percent

couldnot read, andvaccination rates for Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) were 41
percent inurban centers and only 27 percent inrural areas.

1.12     Despite some recovery inthe provision o fpublic services that were noted inthe
surveys, their coverage and quality remained very poor, andrepresented amajor
challenge for the years ahead. The most important improvements since 1999, according
to the participants inthe surveys, hadbeen inthe levels o f security andpolitical
participation; although subsequent events in2006 and2007 may prove this conclusion
premature, at least with regard to security.

1.13     Oil and Gas. Prior to independence, oil andgas fields were discoveredoffshore
betweenTimor-Leste andAustralia, inan area o f disputedsovereignty knownas the Timor
Gap. Commercial exploitation i s currently governedbythe Timor SeaTreaty betweenthe
two countries, which hasbeenineffect since April 2,2003. Underthis treaty, the Timor
Gap is dividedinto three areas: (a) the Joint PetroleumDevelopment Area (JPDA), (b) the
areaunder exclusive Australian jurisdiction, and(c) the area under exclusive Timor-Leste
jurisdiction. Also underthis treaty, Timor-Leste's revenue shareinthe JPDA was increased
significantly to 90 percent, fiom 50percent inthe previous treaty.

 1.14    Three fields have been discovered so far: EKKN, Bayu-Undan, and Greater
Sunrise. EKKNwas developed first, with production starting in 1998, and generating
modest revenues from royalties andtaxes. Bayu-Undan, which is located entirely inthe
JPDA, i s estimated to contain 370 million barrels o f condensate and LPG, and 2.7 trillion
cubic feet o f gas. Greater Sunrise is estimatedto contain about 7.6 trillion cubic feet of
gas; only 20 percent lies within the JPDA.

 1.15    Agreementwas reachedinMay 2003 on adevelopment planfor Bayu-Udan.
Underthis agreement, itwas estimatedthat Timor-Leste would earnabout $3 billionin
revenues over 20 years, startingwith 2004. This i s already proving to be an
underestimate, since the price assumption usedinthe projections has already been
significantly supersededbyrecent increasesinthe price o fpetroleum. According to the
December 2007 JMF Article IV Consultationreport, oil and gas revenuesincreasedfrom
$13 million in2003, to $168 million in2004, to an estimated $492 million in2006; and
were projected to reach close to $900 million in2007. Again, this projectionwill most
likely to be significantly surpassed. Theserevenueshave already dramatically improved
the budgetary andbalance ofpayments positions o fthe country; a major concern now is
to ensure that they are usedwisely to avoidthe Dutch disease.

TransitionalArrangements

1.16     Duringthe 1999troubles, the international community, ledbythe UN,intervened
to pacify and stabilize the situation. The Indonesian military, andmucho f the Indonesian
civilianpopulation, pulledout. They were replaced by the UNTAETwhich was
establishedinNovember o fthat year. Itwas endowed with large powers to act as a legal
stateto facilitate the transition to independenceand help create essentialnational
institutions. To that end, it was supportedby an international military force and a large
influx o f civilian expatriates to provide essential services ina wide range o f technical
areas, inview o fthe dire shortage o f qualified and experienced local staff.

                                              5


1.17    A Joint Assessment Mission(JAM) that also tookplace inNovember 1999
concluded that the situation inTimor-Leste was fundamentally different from the typical
situation normally encounteredinpost-conflictcountries. There seemed to be no
immediate needfor pacificationamong the differentethnic andreligious segments o f
society. Instead, the situation was more akinto one where "a vicious hurricane destroyed
all buildingsandmost crops andremoved all records and institutionalmemory." Timor-
Leste was considered to have been fortunate, since the situation hadnot brokendown into
a full-blown domestic conflict requiringcommensurately large security operations.
Nevertheless, the JAM concluded that the need for reconstruction was enormous because
the destruction was pre-meditated, thorough, andmassive.

1.18    To finance the requiredUNTAET operations, trust funds were establishedand
fundedby anumberofbilateralandmultilateraldonors. One such fund establishedon
September 30, 1999was the Trust Fundfor East Timor (TFET), administered by the
Bankandusedto channel grant financing from anumberofkeybilateraldonors in
support o fthe transition.

1.19    Meanwhile onthe domestic political front, the situation movedrelativelyrapidly,
inresponseto increasingpressurebythe Timorese, andculminatedinthe establishment
o fthe Constituent Assembly at the endo f August 2001. The elections were reportedly
virtually problem-free, a cabinet was subsequently formed, presidential elections held,
and independenceannouncedon May 20,2002.

1.20    Commenting on the adjustment process summarized inthe aboveparagraphs, the
March 2002 Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) bythe Bank concluded that: "The
transition from devastation to an elected Constituent Assembly intwo years, without
major internalconflict, canbe considered exemplary as an exercise inpolitical
management. From an economic perspective, however, the difficulties that were apparent
duringthe transition, especially interms o frecruitingTimorese candidates with the
technical and administrative skills required to runa government, remainan important
hurdleto beovercome bythe newnation."

ConcludingRemark

1.21    Following four centuries o fPortuguesecolonizationand a quarter century o f
Indonesian occupation, Timor-Leste suffered from additional devastating violence and
destruction in 1999. An economic structure andperformance that hadbeen very modest
to beginwith was drastically set back. With prompt and significant assistance from the
international community, the political transition to independenceinMay 2002 was
relatively impressive, although it may still bepre-mature to pronounce a finaljudgment
inthis area. Bycontrast, the economic "transition" is likely to bemoreprolonged and
demanding, inview o fthe direinitial conditions at independence, particularlythe
extremely limitednumber o f qualified and experienced personnel. The recent discovery
and development o f oil and gas i s already providing significant increasesinrevenue that
have already eliminated any financing constraint facing economic restructuring and
development. While avoiding the Dutch disease has now become a matter o f concern, it
i s nevertheless a welcome concern compared to what the situation might have been
without the addedoil revenues. The main focus o f this report, however, i s on evaluating

the performance o f the three Bank operations designed to support the post-independence
economic transition duringthe 2003-05 period. To that end, we will now turnto
reviewingthe Bank's assistance strategy insupport ofthe country's vision for the hture,
starting with its transition efforts.

2.      DevelopmentStrategy andthe Three TransitionSupport
        Programs

Timor-Leste's DevelopmentVision and Major PolicyAreas

2.1     Followingindependence, the Government, actively assistedbyits development
partners, includingthe Bank; movedpromptly to lay down its strategic vision for the future
ofthe country andeconomy inawidely distributedpamphletthat describedits "Vision for
the Year 2020". This vision statementconsistedo ftenpoints setting out rather generaland
ambitious goals for the country to strive towards. Byits nature, it didnot include any
discussiono fpriorities andtrade-offs. The desired visionwas thenelaboratedinthe
NationalDevelopment Plan (NDP) for the periodFY2002-07, againpreparedinclose
collaboration with the Bank and other donors. TheNDP was reportedly preparedthrough a
broad, consultative processinthe country. Itwas expectedto serve as a strategic reference
point for prioritizingand sequencingpolicymeasuresand actionsthat would beincluded in
agency-levelAnnual ActionPlans(AAPs). Monitoringofimplementationprogressunder
these planswould be carried out through the instrument o f Quarterly Reporting Matrices.
In addition, andinan attempt to dealwith the adverseeconomic effects ofdisturbancesin
December2002, a Stability Program was interjected into the FY 2004 planning process,
andthis programwas included inaRoadMap that attemptedto link the NDP to the AAPs.
In otherwords, arather elaborate set ofinstruments andprocesseswere set inplace to plan,
monitor, and evaluatethe performance of economic policy; andto make adjustments along
the way, as needed. It is not clear why such a seeminglycumbersomeandredundant
systemwas neededfor a small countrywithrelativelymodest endowmentsandoptions,
andsevere capacity constraints.

2.2     With regardto broadpolicy orientation, the two over-riding objectives ofthe
NDP and its accompanying instrumentswere to: (i)     promote rapid, equitable and
sustainable economic growth, and (ii)   reducepoverty. The mainpolicy areas aimed at
meetingthe growthobjective were:
        developing a lean, effective and transparent public sector,free o f corruption;
    0   implementingaprudentfiscal policyand a set of sound financialmanagement
       practices that would allow a transition to financial independencewithin three
       years o f independence (endo f FY05);
       managing oil and gas revenuesprudently;
        strengtheningeconomic managementinstitutions,notablythe Bankingand
       Payments authority;
       developing the economicinfrastructure,includingthe transport, power and
       telecommunications networks; and
       promoting an enabling environment for privatesector development,including
       legislative and codification measures, and dealing with the difficult landtenure
       problemthat hadbeen inherited from colonial days and the Indonesian occupation
       period, and exacerbatedby the destruction o f land ownership files and
       information.

                                              8


2.3     Inadditionto thepresumptionthat economic growthwas seen as aprecondition
for sustainedpoverty reduction, the mainpolicy areas aimed at meeting this objective
more directly were:

    0   promotingthe economic participation o fthe poor ,primarilythrough developing
        agricultural opportunities;
    0   deliveringbasic social services, particularly ineducation andhealth, and aiming
        at achieving some "quick wins";
    0   improving the security situation, including food security andprotectionagainst
        disasters;
    0   aiming to set up a social safety net for the vulnerable; and
    0   promotingempowerment o fthe citizenry through communityparticipation, local
        government development, and civic education.

2.4     Actions and specific measuresfalling underthe above broadpolicy areas were
includedinAction Matrices agreedbetween the Government, the Bank, and other donors
inthe context ofthe annualTransition Support Programs. These arediscussedbelow
under separateheadings ofthe three TSP operations.

World Bank Assistance Strategy for the Transition

2.5     A TransitionalSupportStrategy (TSS) was approvedbythe Bank's Executive
Directors inNovember 2000. Itprovidedthe strategic framework for assistanceto Timor-
Leste during the post-independenceperiod, pendingthe preparation o f a fill-fledged
CAS, thenexpected for FY03. The main elements o fthe TSS were: (i) for  support
poverty alleviation andreconstruction over the short-term, and (ii) analytical and
advisory assistancefor post-independencepolicy and governance issues.

2.6     As o fearly 2000, the primaryvehicle usedfor channeling Bank financial support
directed at poverty alleviationhadbeenthe multi-donor, Bank-administered TFET.
Specific projects financed by TFET covered a variety o f sectors: agriculture, education,
health, infrastructure, private sector development, micro-finance and community
empowerment; for a total o f $160 million. By early 2002, andinview o frising fiscal and
balance o fpayments difficulties, it was deemedappropriate for the Bank and the other
donors to provide some o f their financial assistanceinthe form o f direct balance of
payments andbudgetary support, hence the series of TSP operations starting inFY02.

2.7     Inthemeantime, andinlinewiththe secondstrategic element ofthe TSS, the
Bank carried out a number o f analytical and advisory services. The mainones included:
(i)preliminaryPovertyAssessmentinFebruary2002,usedinthepreparationofthe
   a
NDP; (ii)  a Country Economic Memorandum inMarch2002, that covered economic
policy and governance issues; (iii) technical support, inconjunctionwith the UK aid
program, for the preparation o fthe NDP; (iv) a Public Expenditure andManagement
Accountability (PEMA) note, that provided an assessmento f fiduciary risk andwas
designed to help the Ministryof Finance and Planning(MFP) instrengtheningits
financial management; and (v) a full-fledgedPublic Expenditure ReviewinJuly 2004
that was usedas an input inthe design andimplementationo f subsequentpublic
expenditure programs.

                                                 9


2.8     At the request ofthe Government, the CountryAssistanceStrategy (CAS) that
was being drafted inFY03, was delayed till the end ofFY05 to accommodate the
completion by the Government of a new set o f Sector Investment Programs (SIPS) to be
used as additional inputs inthe design and implementationof annual budgets. The CAS
ended up covering the FY06-08period and is, therefore, not directly relevant to this
review. Nevertheless, it i s still instructive to summarize its mainpoints.

2.9     Based o n an assessment o fresults and achievements under the TSS, the main
objective o f the CAS remained essentially as before: to help create the conditions for
sustainable growth and poverty reduction. T o that end, the Bank would continue to work
closely with the Government and the concerned group o f donors within a so-called
"whole-of-Government" approach in support o f the NDP and the Stability Program. The
combined efforts would be underpinned by three strategic pillars: (i)   delivering
sustainable services; (ii) creating productive employment; and (iii)  strengthening
governance; with due concern to matters of gender and youth. These areas are very
closely related to the main components of the three TSP operations being reviewed inthis
report, and as such, mean that the strategy andprogram for the FY06-08period covered
bythe CAS is expected to buildon achievements inthese areas, with the main aim of
consolidating gains andmovingforward along essentially the same path.

2.10    The CAS was very clearly written andquite comprehensive inits coverage,
perhaps to the point o fbeing unnecessarily lengthy (46 pages, and almost 50 pages of
annexes). Annex B 9 by itself, consists of a 15-page matrix attempting to linkNDP goals,
to challenges, to CAS outcomes, to milestones, to instruments o fBank support. It is
reminiscent o f the equally comprehensive, detailed and rather unwieldy Action Matrices
ofthe three TSP operations. As with those matrices, the items under the various headings
tended to range from the very general and qualitative to some specific and quantitative.

2.11 Since the Bank, and to varying extents some ofthe other donors, were very
closely involved inassisting the Government indrafting its NDP andmany of the related
planning,budgetingand monitoringdocuments and matrices; the Bank's assistance
strategy and program are naturally closely aligned with the Government's development
strategy and programs. Insome cases, this raises questions regarding country ownership
and commitment. InTimor-Leste, however, it seems that some key members o f the
Government had taken a leadrole and hadbeen filly committed and engaged. Others, in
some line agencies, felt that they simply had to go along.

The Three Transition SupportPrograms:OverallJustificationandBroadDesign
Features

2.12    The overalljustification and broad design features of the three operations are
basically identical; as is the general political and economic background, with a few
evolving developments, particularly regarding significant increases inoil and gas
revenues. Therefore, to avoid repetition, these are presented for the three operations
combined, rather than for each operation separately.

2.13    The ultimate goal of the assistance strategies of the Bank andother donors at the
turno fthe century was to support the Government's efforts to promote sustainable

                                             10


growth and reducepoverty. Inthe meantime, the immediate, practicalimperative
following independencewas to mobilize andprovidebridge grant financing duringthe
FY02-05period, untilsufficient revenues from oil and gas came on stream to finance the
budget andthe external account. The Government had, inany case, imposeda statutory
prohibitionon borrowing since it hadjudgedthat the prospects for raising loans hadbeen
nilandunaffordable. Accordingto anTSP Iinternal review, duringthe transition,
balance o fpayments support andbilateral budgetary support will addressboth external
and fiscal gaps, mobilizing donor funds andthus allowing East Timor to sustain a levelof
imports andpublic expenditures that would not otherwise bepossible. Channeling such
funds through the budget was also expectedto serve developmental goalsby
strengtheningthe Government's capacity to mange future revenue streams.

2.14    Total external grant financing requirements for the three-year period(FY02-05)
were estimated at about $91million, o fwhich the Bank's three operations provided a
total close to $15 million, roughly $5 million per operation. The first was inthe form o f a
Post-Conflict Grant from the Development Grant Fund, andthe last two inthe form of
IDAGrants. Co-financing bymanybilateraldonors (Australia, Canada, Finland, Ireland,
New Zealand, Norway, the UK,andthe USA)was channeledthroughBank-administered
trust funds, and additional bilateral andmultilateral fundingwas provided directly
(Portugal, Japan, andthe Asian Development Bank). The Bank grants were disbursedin
singletranches, following effectiveness, on the basis o f corresponding sets o fprior
actions agreedwith the Government. Simplifieddisbursement procedures were used. A
separateAction Matrix o fpolicy measuresand actions was agreedwith the Government
for each operation, although the three overlappedwith eachother, as they evolved.
Although the implementation of these matrices was monitoredclosely by the
Government andthe donors, they were not usedto condition disbursement during
implementation. Itwas presumedthat progress, or lack thereof, inthe implementation o f
an Action Matrix would be usedinjudgingwhether the Bank and other donors would
proceed with follow-up operations.

3.       The FirstTransition Support Program(TSPI)for FY2003

Background

3.1      The general political and economic background for the three operations as a group
has already beendiscussed above. At the turno f the century, Timor-Leste was coming
out o f four centuries o f colonization and twenty five years o f occupation. A very poor
territory to begin with, the wanton violence and destruction in 1999 led to a sharp decline
inoutput andwiped out largeportionsofthe country's physicalinfrastructureandcivil
records. Capacity inboththe public andprivate sectors was extremely weak, poverty was
high,andthe provisionofsocial services limited. Most Government institutionswere
embryonic andpoorly staffed, particularly after the pull-out o f Indonesian civil servants.

3.2      Following the cessation o f violence andthe establishment o fthe UNTAET,
economic activity and output rebounded. Keeping inmindthe generally poor quality o f
economic data, non-oil GDP was estimated to have grown by 15 percent in2000, and 17
percent in2001. Overall output and agricultural production were believed to have
regainedtheir pre-1999 levels. InJanuary 2000, UNTAET adopted the U S dollar as the
sole legal tender, eliminating the need to worry about the conduct o f foreign exchange
andmonetarypolicies, inview o fthe extremely limited capacity. Two foreign
commercial banks opened delegations inDili,but commercial credit remainednegligible
and the modest banking activities limitedto the capital. Exports were almost non-existent
(a mere $4 million), while imports increased substantially ($237 million) to support
public investment ininfrastructure and a markedly increased level o fprivate
consumption, due mainly to the influx o f a large number o f expatriates. The resulting
balance o fpayments, as well as the budget, deficits were financed by official grants. The
other halfwas financed by oil and gas revenues. An encouraging shift inthe structure o f
public spending took placebetween 2001 and 2002 infavor o f the social sectors (from 26
to 33 percent), and away from some core government functions.
ObjectivesandDesign

3.3      The overriding goal o f TSP Iwas to support the Government's post-independence
efforts to builda new nation, as laid out inthe NDP; focusing on the immediate measures
inthe FY2003 budget (the Timorese fiscal year isJuly 1to June 30). Priority was given
to the creation and early development o fkey institutions, a legislative framework, and
management systems needed for core government functions, and to promote private
initiatives. Inline with priority areas identified inthe NDP, the four components o f TSP I
consisted of: (i) for poverty reduction, and quick wins inservice delivery;
                 planning
(ii) governance andprivate sector development; (iii) expenditure policy and
                                                        public
management; and (iv) power sector management, inview o fthe need to reduce this
sector's heavy dependence on the budget at the time. Measures and actions included
under these components were based on an extensive Action Matrix bythe Government,
attached to its Letter o f Development Policy (LDP). Ten suchmeasures were singled out
andhighlightedbythe Bank andthe Government, andconstituted a list o fprior actions
that hadbeen completed before this operationwas approved (Annex C).

                                              12


3.4     Planningfor poverty reduction and quick wins were to be achieved through:
(a) updating andmaking operational the NDP and the Poverty Reduction Strategy;
(b) expanding access to primary andjunior secondary education, while improving
efficiency and quality, and creating incentives for partnerships with communities, NGOs,
and the private sector; (c) targeting health care on mothers andchildren; and (d) defining
and locating vulnerable groups, and assisting them through targeted training and finance.

3.5     Improved governance andprivate sector developmentwere to be achieved
through: (a) implementing an annual legislative program; (b) establishing an independent,
competent judiciary; (c) creating an enabling environment for the private sector;
(d) safeguardingthe rights o fcitizens; (e) creating an efficient and transparent civil
service; (f) providing the enclave of Oecussi with a special status, inview o f its particular
situation; and (g) decentralizing government.

3.6     Improvedpublic expenditurepolicy and management were to be achieved
through: (a) strengthening capacity incore financial management; (b) better monitoring
and evaluation of economic indicators and statistics; (c) implementing prudent, pro-poor
expenditure policies; (d) ensuring the transparency and accountability o fpublic
expenditure management to the legislature; (e) improvingpolicy consistency, efficiency
andeffectiveness o fpublic spending; (0ensuring compliance with expenditure policy
andlegislation; and (8) ensuring the proper use o foil and gas revenues to benefit present
and future generations.

3.7     Improvedperformance of thepower sector was to be achieved through:
(a) strengthening the management of East Timor Electricity; (b) improvingcost recovery;
(c) establishing an appropriate institutional structure for an independent power authority;
and (d) preparing long-term power development plans.

3.8     Individual actions and measures under the above sub-components were detailed in
the comprehensive Action Matrix. Most of those measures were of a qualitative,
procedural nature involvingthe establishment ofprocesses, institutional set-ups,
management systems, preparation of plans, publication of documents, adoption of
policies, or steps toward the enactment of legislation. Only a handful of measures
established quantitative targets. Those primarily concerned the delivery o f education and
health services. Inaddition, no priorities that focused on the most important measures
were articulated. The ten measures chosen as prior actions seem to have been chosen
because they had been completed, andnot because they were particularly more important,
or more urgent, than many ofthe others.

ImplementationExperience

3.9     The Grant Agreement for TSP Ihadprovided for the preparation by the Ministry
ofPlanningand Finance of quarterly progress reports on the implementationofthe
Action Matrix. Four reports were produced ina timely manner, andwere generally
accurate and candid intheir assessments. A 13-member Progress Mission by the Bank
and four bilateralpartners took place inNovember, 2002, andbased its findings on the
first quarterly progress report. It concluded that, six months after independence, the
systems and structures that hadbeen put inplace since 2000 remained fragile. It
highlighted a number of implementation issues, including: (a) international personnel

                                                           13


filling line functions at the expense o ftraining; (b) financing systems geared to control
rather thanto facilitate the delivery o f services; (c) a weak judiciary; (d) legislation put in
place by fiat, andnot based on policy and consultation; and (e) cost recovery inthe power
sector remained elusive, with unreliable supply and compliance by customers.

3.10     Duringplenary sessions, the Governmentandthe missioncollaboratedon
revising the Action Matrix on the basis o f experience to date. Some measures were
reformulatedto better reflect realities, some new ones were added, and a number were
pushedback to TSP I1for FY2004. An expanded 15-page Revised Action Matrix was
attached to the mission's aide-memoire.

3.11 A main conclusion that one draws from reviewing this aide-memoire, with its
comprehensive set o f annexes, is that overall progress midway through the
implementation o f this operation was uneven and generally behind schedule. The delay
was primarily due to continued capacity constraints and problems with the delivery o fthe
plannedtechnical assistance. The tone was overly diplomatic and optimistic, often stating
intentions and desirable outcomes insteado f ascertaining actual progress. Itwas not until
later, duringthe preparation of TSP 11, that Bank staff started emphasizing the
"intentionally ambitious" design o f all the three TSP operations.

3.12     Since TSP Iwas funded from the Development Grant Facility, it didnot require an
Implementation Completion Report (ICR). Instead, a simpler Grant Completion Report
(GCR) was prepared inSeptember 2003. Itwas basedinpart on the very candid, useful,
andwell-presented fourth quarter progress report, issuedbyMOPFinJuly, 2003. The
progress reportpresented a considerable amount o f statistics on implementationprogress of
the Action Matrix, duringeach o fthe four quarters o fFY2003. Table 2 gives a summary o f
some purely statistical findings. A listing o fthe completed, partially completed, not
completed, andrescheduled actions to beincluded under TSP I1is provided inAnnex B.

3.13     Strictly interms ofnumbers, Table 2 shows that 43 percent ofthe agreed actions
were completed, and only 9 percent were not completed. Almost half (48 percent) were

                                              14


partially completed and ongoing. Fromthe information summarized inAnnex By
appreciable progress was made inthe implementation o fthe first and third components
(poverty reduction planning, andpublic expenditure policy andmanagement). For the
second and fourth components (governance andprivate sector development, andthe
power sector), implementation was quite limited, particularly for the governanceand
PSD component. This i s not surprisingsince many o fthe actions included inthe first and
thirdcomponents fellprimarilywithinthejurisdiction ofMOPF, the direct implementing
agency for the operation. Most of those actions were also o f aprocess andplanning
nature. Exceptions that stood out were the successfulmeetingo f the quantitative targets
for increasing the number o fmid-wives,the rate o f DPT3 coverage, and increasesinthe
numberof secondaryschool students andteachers. Bycontrast, the governanceandPSD
components requiredthe passage of legislation(on companies, contracts, bankruptcy,
investment, civil service) and settingup an ombudsman's office to deal with corruption.

3.14    According to the Grant CompletionReport (which essentially reiterated verbatim
the assessment o fprogress under TSP Ifound inthe PAD for TSP 11), inaddition to
increases inthe delivery o f educational and health servicesnoted above, a numberof
other achievementswere worth noting. These included: the establishment o ftwo
commissions inthe President's office to start addressingthe sensitive veterans' issues; a
land law dealing with publicly owned landwas passed; a Judicial Magistrates Code was
approved by Parliament; severalprocedural measureshavingto do with the public
expenditure management framework were implemented; and emergency generators,
financed by the Norwegian Government, were installed and improvedthe reliability o f
service. Despite these improvements, however, many issues and challenges remained.
These included: delays inmoving aheadwith a numbero f laws to improve the regulatory
framework for privatebusiness; delays inthe establishment and staffingo f the office o f
the ombudsman; significant delays inthe establishment o f a regulatory framework for the
civil service; and a significant increasethe budgetary subsidy for the power sector to 11
percent o f total recurrent expenditures.

3.15    Onbalance, the implementation experience under TSP Iwas unevenandpartial.
This was inpart due to a very limitedimplementation capacity and delays inthe delivery
ofmuchneeded technical assistance. Itmust have also been due to the ambitious number
o fmeasurescalled for inthe Actions Matrix, without any apparent priorities. This
"intentionally ambitious" design that was carried through into the two follow-up
operations wasjustified by the Bank on the basis o fthe Government's insistent desire for
support from the donors on a broad front, inorder to make progress inthe
implementation o fthe NDP. However, giventhe wide experience o fthe Bank and other
donors inthe development business and their acute awareness o fthe extremely limited
capacity inthe country and the difficulties normally encountered inrecruitingtimely and
appropriate technical assistance, the Bank could have advised more strongly against
spreading efforts too thinly and argued for a smaller, but well-targeted, set o f actions,
with tighter priorities. Infact, it appearsthat some o fthe donors, particularlyNorway,
favored that position. It seems that Bank staff-members arguedamong themselves about
this central point, some favoring amore focused approach andothers feeling that the
Government argued would definitelyhave not gone along with anythingshort o fits broad
program. This point is addressedfurther below (paragraph 6.34).

3.16    Outcome of TSPI: While hlly acknowledging the significant progress made in
few important areas o fthe TSP Ioperation and the impact this have hadon the
improvement o fthe dire state o f affairs which prevailed inthe country following
independence, the fact remains that only partial results were achieved inmost o f the other
areas identified under the program. Therefore, the overall outcome o f the first TSP
operation is considered moderately unsatisfactory.

3.17    Risk to Development Outcome. At the end o fthe first TSP operation the country
was still at a precarious state o f the economic and social affairs, with highlevel of
unemployment among the youth and significant poverty issues. Quite serious political
risks; particularly across the deep divide along the domestic political fault-lines,
continued to be the cause o f serious friction and violence that could potentially spin out
o f control. Concerns over the unstable political and social situation were further
exacerbated bythe very low implementation capacity o f the government, and the risk of
corruption. Therefore, given widespread sources o fpotential risk and unfinished
institutional buildingagenda, the risks to development outcome o f TSP Iare considered
significant.

3.18    Bank Performance. Allowing for the realities inthe country andthe strong
client's desire for a broad, all-encompassing approach inthe program design, the fact
remains that the Bankdesigned a too complex program for a post-conflict country with
severely limitedimplementation capacity. Greater realism and a more careful risk
assessment at entry would have suggested a muchmore streamlinedand focused project
design, as a framework to convince other donors who preferred a broad over a narrow
approach. Furthermore, changes could have and should have beenmade during the
implementation o f the first operation to address clear implementation difficulties and
focus on the achievement o fpriority project objectives. Onthat basis the perfonnance o f
the Bank merits a rating o f moderately unsatisfactory.

3.19     Borrower Performance. The Government had a strong interest to obtain Bank
anddonor support for its entire national development program. Lack o ftrue ownership
andcommitment, distraction causedbythe oversupply o fdonor resources, andthe
absence o f clear feedback (from the Bank and donors alike), all contributed to
procrastination inrealizing own capacity constraints and selecting clear priorities.
Government limitedresources were spread too thinly across too many competing
development priorities leading to weak and partial implementation o f many
actions/components. Onthat basis the performance o f the Borrower merits a rating o f
moderately unsatisfactory.

4.      The SecondTransitionSupport Program(TSP11)for
        FY2004

Background

4.1     The overallpolitical and economic background andcontext for this operation did
not differ appreciably from the backgroundthat had existedprior to TSP I. was only
                                                                             This
natural and as would be expectedover a one-year period only. Infact, since the
Government and the Bankhadopted for a series o fthree separate, but very similar,
operations inthree successive years; the corresponding documentation byboth endedup
beingvery repetitive. Although such redundancy mayhavebeencalled for bythe
requirement that manyo f the documents hadto be self-standing, it didrepresent a
substantial drain on resources, particularly for the Government but also for the Bank and
other donors.

4.2     Onthe macroeconomic front, therewas amarkeddrop ineconomic activity in
general, with GDP growth dropping to 3 percent in2002, andto minus 3 percent in2003.
This was apparently due to the departure oflargesegments ofthe expatriate community.
Becauseo f changes inthe tax regime governing oil and gas production, increases in
revenue from this source were back-loaded, and couldnot be counted uponto
counterbalancethe drop due to the departure o f foreigners. Still, the signingo fthe Timor
Sea Treaty inMarch2003 promised significant increasesinrevenues over the long-run,
estimated in2003 at about $3 billion over the following two decades (quite likely to be an
under-estimate inview o f recent increases inthe price o fpetroleum). The budgetdeficit
declined by about 20 percent in2003, but that was due to a drop inexpenditures in
addition to an increaseinrevenues. Similarly, the deficit on the current account o fthe
balance o fpayments dropped by about 13 percent in2003, but that was entirely due to a
drop inimports, while exports remained at their very modest level.

4.3     In2003, there wasno significant privatesectorinvestment, withprivatecapital
still seeking external outlets. A third commercial bank was still expectedto start
operations, while the two-bank banking"system" remained essentially involvedwith
transactionsrather thanproviding credit for investment. The poverty situation remained
very serious. The political situation also remained fragile and tense, following the violent
riots inDiliinDecember 2002, and attacks on rural communities inearly 2003. Inother
words, despite the early efforts by the Government, with the support o fthe donor
communityinthe context o fthe NDP and TSP I,        the overall economic andpolitical
situation deteriorated in2003, admittedly due to difficult political and social factors.
Nevertheless, this was the situation that prevailed while TSP I1was beingprepared.

Objectivesand Design

4.4     Underthe circumstances, the Government, the Bank, and other donors decidedto
move aheadwith TSP 11, essentially along the same lines as its predecessor, with the
same objective of facilitating the transitiono f a post-conflict country toward greater
economic independence, growth andpoverty reduction. The implementation completion
report for this thirdoperation seemedto argue that there was amaterialdifference from

                                               18


the first operation. It stated that the TSP I"focused on the creation o fthe institutions,
establishment o f the legislative andregulatory framework and strengthening o f
management systems for core government functions"; and that TSP 11, while still
covering these areas, would cover the three "thematic" areas of: "(i)    Good Governance,
including: strengthening State institutions, public sector management and public
expenditure management; and strengthening administrative capacity inthe justice sector;
(ii) DeliveryforPovertyReduction,particularlyimprovementsintheefficiency
    Service
and effectiveness inthe health and education sectors; and (iii)  Job Creation, especially
through private sector development and agriculture." Infact, the broad design o f the two
operations was very similar, almost identical, except for dropping the fourth component
o f TSP Ithat had dealt with the power sector (It i s not clear why this was dropped at the
time), and focusing specifically on agriculture, inaddition to the private sector generally,
inTSP 11,underthejob creationcomponent. The difference was more insemantics than
incontent, andthis was reflectedinthe fact that several sections ofthe TSP I1appraisal
document were basically lifted from that for TSP I.    This is not to say that there was
anything necessarily wrong, initself, with staying with the same basic design throughout
the series o f operations, provided they werejudged appropriate for meeting the stated
objectives.

4.5      While TSP I1was being prepared, the Government was tryingto respondto the
December 2002 riots by announcing a Stability Program inJanuary 2004, focusing on
governance, service delivery for poverty reduction, andjob creation. This program was
expected to guide the prioritization and sequencing o f actions within the FY2004
budgetingprocess, andto be imbeddedina RoadMap which laid out the program for the
remaining four years o f the Government's mandate. But when stripped o f this added,
perhaps superfluous nomenclature, the essence o f the Government's efforts remained the
same; namely, to translate its broad development objectives into an annual budget and a
set o f specific policies, laws and regulations aimed at achieving those objectives. Again,
too much effort seems to have been spent on creating new "instruments" aimed at further
articulating intentions andprograms, probably at the expense o f faster andbetter
implementation.

4.6      The rationale for TSP I1remained the same as that for TSP I,    namely, to provide
grant bridge financing to help Timor-Leste implement its NDP untilenough oil and gas
revenues come on stream. Channeling the grants through the budget was seen as a means
to strengthen capacity to better manage future oil revenues. External financing
requirements for FY2004 were estimated at $28 million, o fwhich about $4.16 million
(corresponding at the time to SDR 2.9 million) was provided by IDA.

4.7      The three "thematic" components o f this operation consisted of a number o f sub-
components each, as follows:

    0    Good Governanceincluded: oversight institutions, local government, public
         sector management, poverty reductionplanning, public expenditure management,
         and thejudiciary.
    0    ServiceDeliveryfor Poverty Reduction consisted, inparticular, o f improvements
         inthe efficiency andeffectiveness ofservice delivery inthe healthand education
         sectors.

                                                19


        Job Creation mainly through private sector development and agriculture.
4.8     Individual measures under each sub-component were agreed with the Government
andincludedinan 11-page Action Matrix, attached to the Government's LDP, dated June
12,2003. As with TSP I,    a number o fmeasures (seven inthe case o f TSP 11)that had
already beenimplementedbefore the preparation o f this operation started, were used as
prior actions to justify the release o f the single tranche ofthis IDA grant (Annex D).

ImplementationExperience

4.9     As with the experience under TSP I,     implementation o f the wide range o f
measures included inthe TSP I1Actions Matrix was uneven, andmainlypartial. Some
progress was made regarding some specific actions. For example, inthe area o f
governance, an Organic law for the establishment o f the Provedor's Office and a Public
Service Statute were passed. However, less than halfo f the scheduled legislation was
passed, the development o f a policy andprocedures for the legislative process didnot
start, and the proposedlegislation governing private investment fell considerably short o f
internationalbest practice with regard to the treatment o f tax incentives and foreign
investors. The development o fpolicy frameworks for education and agriculture lagged
and were not completed bythe closing o f this operation. Ofparticular concern was the
very slow progress made inthe important areao f capacity buildingandinstitutional
development. The proposed design o f a human resources development strategy for the
Ministry o f Planning andFinance didnot take place and was deferredto TSP 111.

4.10    The preceding paragraph givesjust a small sample that illustrates the partial and
mixed progress ina few areas. Table 2 o f the Simplified ICR for TSP I1gives a more
complete listing o f implementation progress across the entire set o f measures. This table
is reproducedinits entirety as Annex D. A notable success story is the health sector
where all the proposedmeasures were implemented, with some o f them exceeding
expectations. This has been attributed to the strong and committed professional
leadership that the Ministry o f Health has enjoyed under the entire TSP series.

4.11 The Simplified ICR for this operation recounted the familiar issues that have
stood inthe way o fbetter implementation results. These included: severe capacity
constraints across the board; shortages, delays inrecruitment, and uneven quality o f
technical support from expatriate experts; management weakness and lack o f
understandingo fkey procedures insome line agencies; and an overly ambitious design to
begin with. Particularly hitby these deficiencies were such important matters like the rate
o fbudget execution, the very slow development o f legislation and thejudicial system,
and the community-based roadmaintenance program that was supposed to createjobs
andhelp deal with reducingunemployment andpoverty. As hadbeendone previously in
the transition from TSP Ito TSP 11, a number ofthe measures that were delayed under
TSP I1were slipped to TSP 111. Similarly, some o f the measures that were actually
completed under the second operation were used as prior actions for approving the third.

4.12    Outcome of TSP11: Insummary, although the second TSP operation contained a
range o f relevant objectives inthe areas o f governance, service delivery for poverty
reduction andjob creation, only a fraction was achieved. As more performance
indicators became available with a time lag, this patternwas confirmed ingovernance

                                             20


(withachievements inoversight institutions and some aspectso fpublic expenditure
management, comparedto a long list o f unresolved issues inimprovingcore government
functions, the justice system and general public sector management). Similar situation
emerges inthe areas o f service delivery andjob creation where notable achievements
were made inhealthbut other aspects o f service delivery lagbehind due to uneven, and
mostly partial and incomplete implementation o f actions envisaged under the TSP 11.
Most importantly, there is insufficient evidence onjob creation andpoverty reduction.
Therefore, the overall outcome o f the second TSP operation is considered moderately
unsatisfactory.

4.13    Risk to Development Outcome. Some o fthe most obvious political and
institutional risks have beenreduced duringthe second TSP. The country has moved
from a very unstable to unstable situation. Highlevels o f unemployment and significant
poverty issues remain. So do political divisions andrisks from instability. The project
ambitious agenda encompassing a large range o f issues and development objectives is
constrained by the continued lack o f institutional capacity and a chronicle shortage of
trained individuals to implement the program and, even more, sustain the achieved
results. Therefore, the risks to development outcome achieved under TSP I1are
considered significant.

4.14    Bunk Performance. The second TSP operation continuedto bebased on a broad
andambitious program which has beendesigned without due regardto government true
ownership and implementation capacity, and continuing harsh realities inthe country.
The design o f the second operation should have addressed clear implementation
difficulties faced inthe first TSP and focus on the achievement o f fewer priority project
objectives. Greater realism and a more careful risk assessment at entry would have
resulted inmore modest andbetter targeted actions. Furthermore, ifnot earlier, changes
could have and should have beenmade duringthe implementation o f the second
operation. Onthat basis the performance o f the Bank merits a rating o fmoderately
unsatisfactory.

4.15     Borrower Performance. The Government developed a much stronger ownership
o f the TSP I1program and took the lead indesigning and implementing the reforms
supported under the project. However, with limited administrative capacity and lack of
adequate expertise inthe country, the Government was not able to fully grasp, manage
andimplement the program o f suchbreadthandcomplexity. Despitethe fact that the
Government now fully owned the program, it fell short o f addressing the institutional and
policy coordinationproblems intended for a much more sophisticated and significantly
more developed economy operating under normal circumstances. This ledto weak and
partial implementation o f many actions/components. Onthat basis the performance o f the
Borrower merits a rating o f moderately unsatisfactory.

5.        The Third TransitionSupport Program(TSP111)for FY
          2005

Background

5.1      Again, the overall background and context on the eve o fthe preparation o f TSP
I11was quite similarto what hadexisted for the previous two operations. The overall
economic situation remained very fragile. Infact, the programdocument for TSP I11
reported that due to the continued departure of international staff, GDP declined by about
2 percent in2003. Imports byhumanitarian and UNagencies declined from 50 percent
o fthe total in2000, to 10percent in2003. Combined with amodest increaseincoffee
exports, although to a level still about two-thirds o fthe pre-1999 levels, this ledto a
decrease inthe balance o fpayments current deficit by about $200 million, to about 60
percent o f GDP. With the drop inoverall economic activity, private sector wages started
to drop inresponseto the lower demandfor labor, but remained higher than in
neighboring countries. Inflationwas inthe 8-10 percent rangedue inpart to a scarcity in
agricultural goods causedby a drought. Unemployment was assumedto have remained
high;the latest available figures from 2001hadindicatedthat aroundone fifthofthe
working age populationwas unemployed, but the rate was muchhigher for youth,
standing at around 43 percent for 15-24 year olds. Foreigninvestors continued to show
little interest, except insome natural resources like fisheries and forestry, for which the
Government deferred consideration pendinghrtherreview. Infact, the number o f larger
tax payers with turnover o f above $1 million declined. A thirdbank started operations in
August 2003 andpromised to extend some servicesbeyond Dili.Despite some increasing
interest inmicrofinance operations, financial intermediation remained very low by
international standards, with the bulk o f deposits invested abroad.

5.2      A significant development inFebruary 2004 was the start ofproductionof
petroleum liquids at the Bayu-Udanfield, followedby the production of dry gas later that
year. As a result, the part o f the oil and gas revenues that were made available for budget
financing were expectedto account for an increasing share o fthe consolidatedbudget
revenue, from about 60 percent inFY03 (they hadbeenabout 48 percent inFYOl), to
about 66 percent inFY05. This was expectedto still leave total budget revenues short o f
consolidatedexpenditures estimates, requiringexternal financingthrough grants; leaving
a financing gap ofjust over $30 million inFY05.

ObjectivesandDesign

5.3      Intermsofbroadobjectives anddesign, TSPI11was, byandlarge, acontinuation
and extension o f TSP 11. It still sought to provide bridge grant financing for the country's
development efforts by supporting a wide set o fpolicy and institutional development
measureso f an Actions Matrix, basedon the NDP, andreflected inthe annual budget and
other relatedplanninginstruments. Again, the three mainprogramcomponents consisted
of: (a) promoting good governance; (b) improving service delivery for povertyreduction;
and (c) job creation. As the TSP series matured, the expectation was that this third
operation would seek to introduce three principles into the design: (i) greater use
                                                                         making
of quantitative performance indicators, as hadbeendone already inthe health sector; (ii)

                                              22


using a three-year medium-term perspective through FY2007, as opposed to the rolling
annual programs o f the previous two operations; and (iii)  mainstreaming gender issues,
notably inthe policies andprograms o fthe Ministries o f Health, o f Education, ando f
Justice; as well as inthe National Police.

5.4       As with its predecessors, the complete set o fmeasures under the three program
components were captured inan updatedActions Matrix, attached to the Government's
Letter of Development Policy. Again, these measures were not policy conditions that
governed the disbursement o fthe IDA grant, but targets for the Government program
itself. As with the previous operations, a much smaller subset o f actions already
completed from the Actions Matrix o f TSP I1was selected as a set o fprior actions for the
approval o f TSP I11(Annex C). As before, progress inthe implementation o f the TSP I11
matrix would influence the donors' views regarding forthcoming support. Inany case, the
list o f twelve key outputs consisted primarily o f procedural and regulatory measures in
the areas o f governance, budgeting, andprivate business development; as well as
implementing a pilot grant mechanism inprimary schools.

5.5       Despite the intention o fthe three guidingdesignprinciples listed above (greater
use of quantitative targets, medium-term perspective, and mainstreaming gender), most
o f the specific measures inthe Actions Matrix itselfremained extremely similar to what
was included inthe correspondingmatrices for the two previous operations. They were
primarilyprocedural andrelatedto planning, budgeting, regulations, laws, licensing,
reporting andmonitoring; with a few concrete deliverables inthe health and education
sectors.'This is not to say that many o fthem were not needed, nor important. It simply
confirmed that the over-riding efforts remained on developing the institutional, policy,
and regulatory environment on a broad front, instead o f focusing on specific quick-wins
and some important tangible results.

ImplementationExperience

5.6       As with the two previous operations, TSP I11was intensively supervised by the
Bank, with active participation bysome o fthe other donors. As part o fthis effort, a
substantial fifteen-member mission ledby the Bank; and including participants from
ADB, AusAID, IrelandAid, UKDFID,andUSAID; visited Timor-Leste toward the end
o f the thirdquarter o f FY05 to review implementation progress and recommend
adjustment, as necessary. At the same time, the mission appraised the proposed CSP I.

5.7       Strictly interms o f numbers, the mission tabulated a breakdown o f all the actions
o f this operation's Action Matrix into three categories: (a) actions considered completed
by endMarch2005; (b) actions that remained inprogress with one quarter left inthe
fiscal year; and (c) actions re-scheduled to the proposed CSP I(Table 3). Ofa total o f 122
actions inall the three components o f the program, only 38 (3 1percent) hadbeen
completed inthe first three quarters; another 50 (41 percent) were considered inprogress,
some o f which probably slipped beyond the fiscal year; and 34 (28 percent) were re-
scheduled to CSP I.    The most delinquent component wasjob creation, with only 14
percent o f the programmed actions completedby end March, 2005; followed byservice
delivery with a 32 percent completion rate; and governance performedthe best interms
o fnumbers, with a completionrate o f 44 percent. It is interesting to note here that the

                                                 23


Action Matrix grew significantly insize betweenTSP Iwhen it totaled around 50 actions,
to TSP I11when it totaled more than 120 actions.

5.8      The aide-memoire o f the Supervision Missionwent on to highlightfour areas that
it considered o fcritical concern for the comingyear: education, petroleumrevenue
management, public finance management, andprivate sector development. It concluded
that ofthese areas, the management o fpetroleum revenueswas proceeding well, with
implementation perfectly on-track. Performance inthe public resource management area
wasjudgedto havebeenmixed, with the development o fplanning, evaluation and
monitoringmechanismsproceeding fairly well, but budget execution falling way short of
plans, due to implementation capacity constraints and lack of confidence bythe Ministry
o fFinance regarding the delegation o fprocurement decision to line agencies. The
performance o fthe education sector, which i s very important for the development o f the
economy, was alsojudgedto have beenvariable, but mainly disappointing. For example,
about 40 percent ofthe sector's budgethadnot been spent, while about 25 percent of
school-age children were not enrolled inprimaryschools, and textbooks andtrained
teachers remained indire shortage. Finally, with regard to thejob creation component,
although some notable progress hadbeenmade inthe critical area o f solving the land
registration problem and setting up some institutions for promoting investment and
exports; serious concerns remained regarding the improvement o fthe overall business
environment. The most serious problems citedby the business community includedthe
familiar litany of: delays incustoms procedures andregistration o fbusinesses, a heavy
tax burden, difficulties inobtaining work permits, andpervasivebureaucratic inertia
across all Government institutions, due to excessive paperwork and regulations combined
with poorly trained andmotivatedcivil servants.

5.9      A full Implementation CompletionReport was produced for TSP I11inJune 2007.
It gave anoverallassessment ofimplementation progress underthe three operations, but
with an emphasis on the third. The report was quite candid inplaces, but ultimately gave
quitea sympathetic andpositive overall evaluation, as the simplifiedICRhaddone for
TSP 11.

5.10     Nevertheless, two well-argued summary paragraphs from this ICR are worth
quoting intotal inthis review (Box 1); the first summarizedthe major achievements of
the TSP program as a whole, and the secondpointedout to some significant shortfalls
andweaknesses.

5.1 1 Outcome of TSP111: As already detailed inthe above paragraphs, the thirdTSP
operation had a number o fimportant achievements. However, almost 70percent o f all

                                             24


actions have not beencompleted by the closing date, or have been dropped and re-
scheduledfor a subsequentseries of operations. Implementation patterns noted inTSP I1
continue inthis operation ineachof the key areas (governance, service delivery for
poverty reduction andjob creation). Relatively few important andnotable achievements
ingovernanceandservice deliveryare followedby alonglist ofactions underslow
implementation or no progress at all due to uneven, partial and incomplete
implementation efforts. Therefore, the overall outcome o f TSP I11i s considered
moderately unsatisfactory.

5.12    Risk toDevelopment Outcome. Furtherprogress hasbeenmade inreducing
political andinstitutionalrisks duringthe last operation inthe TSP series. Economic
growth hasbeenrestored, andmodest progress hasbeenmade on some important fronts.
However, the overallrisks causedbythe overall volatility o fthe political situation,
limitedgovernment capacity (especially relative to the demanding complexity ofthe TSP
I11operation) andpoorratingof governance(i.e. vulnerabilities to possible corruption
problems) suggest continued significant risks to development outcomes. Therefore, the
risks to development outcome achieved under TSP I11are considered significant.

5.13    Bank Performance. The third and last operation inTSP series maintained a
broad andambitious program, way too complex for a countrywith such limited
implementation capacity, continuously exposedto harshrealities. The design o fTSP I11
should have addressedimplementation difficulties faced bythe previous operations, and
control of quality at entry should have identifiedand corrected this glaring discrepancy
between the complex and demandingproject design and limitedimplementation capacity,
especially after this hasbeen clearly noted inthe evaluation summary o f the TSP I1
operation. Lastly, ifnot earlier, changes could have and should have beenmade during
the implementation o fthe third operation. On that basis the performance o fthe Bank
merits a rating o fmoderately unsatisfactory.

5.14     Borrower Performance. Although the Government has movedto further
strengthen its ownership o f the TSP programinthe third operation, it was not able to
close the gap betweenits intent (nominal political ownership) and still quite limited
administrative capacity and expertise inthe country. Notable shortfall inaddressingthe
institutionalandpolicy coordination problems, coupled with inability to select clear
priorities and strengthen the implementation effort to achieve the majority o f
development results continued to limit Government's Performance under the last
operation inthe program. Onbalance this ledto weak andpartialimplementation o f
manyactions/components andBorrower performanceratingofmoderately
unsatisfactory.

Box 1. Summary Assessment of the TSP Series as Presented inthe ICR for TSP 111

            "The Government has consistently praised the contribution of the TSP to Government-owned
policy prioritization, capacity building, results orientation, and donor coordination in apost-conflict
 environment. The TSPhas supported strategic annual planning and high level monitoring with a whole-
 of-government approach. By taking guidancefiom the NDP, sector strategies and AAPs, theprogram has
 cultivated Government ownership. It haspromoted capacity building by promoting the Government's own
systems andprocessesfor budget preparation and execution, including mid-level managers in program
 elaboration and monitoring, andproviding aforum for discussion ofprioritization , implementation,
 results, and monitoring. Thepreparation of a time-bound matrix ofpolicy and institutional measures,
 together with their expected outcomes, has instilled discipline while internal disciplinary mechanisms are
still weak and hasfostered good planning and enhanced agencies 'results orientation. The TSP has
strengthened donor coordination by bringing together the majority of Timor-Leste's development
partners in thepreparation and monitoring of theprogram, thus serving as an anchorfor all donor-
financed activities. This coordination mechanism has allowed coverage of all critical issues, drawing
 upon the comparative advantage of each developmentpartner, andpromoting the mainstreaming of
 cross-cutting issues such as gender.

           Theprogram's performance has been less strong in setting up basic institutions and supporting
job creation. By the end of the three-yearprogram, Timor-Leste still did not have one qualified national
judge and budget executionfigures remained low. Performance wasparticularly weak in the areas ofjob
 creation and income generation. Theprivate sector continued to encounter important barriers to its
 operations, resulting in poor scores in the Doing Business survey and anemicjob creation. Short-term
 Government-supported job creation measures monitored under TSP, such as the emigrant workers and
 the community roads programs also did not deliver the expected results. Finally, although results were
 more encouraging in the social sectors, many of these results were in the area of sector planning rather
 than infinal outcomes - especially in the education sector.

6.      Overview ofthe Three Operations as a Group

6.1    As we have seen above, the three annual operations were very similar, and
essentially formed a unifiedseries, with the first operation flowing into the second, and
the secondinto the third. Most o fthe measuresincludedinthe Action Matricesthat
formed the core o fthe operations' content would arguably take several years to be
actually completed inmost countries, and especially ina country like Timor-Leste with
particularlysevere capacity constraints. As such, this reviewconcluded that it would be
more meaningfuland fair to look at the key areas o f achievements o f the three operations
taken together. Inother words, to focus on what didthe three-year effort by the
Government, closely supported by a significant and well-coordinated level o f assistance
from a sizeable community o f donors and development partners, amount to? What were
the main accomplishments, andwhat were the areas that fell short o f expectations? Was
the design appropriate to beginwith? How didthe Bank and the Borrower perform?
These are the main questions that this section will attempt to answer.

6.2     Beforeturning to this evaluation, however, the fact that we have chosento look at
the three operations as a group, begsthe question why were they, infact, three separate
operations?Why not a single operation, with three tranches over three years?Certainly,
the three separate operations involvedconsiderable redundancy indocumentation and
processing on the side o fboth the Government andthe various donor bureaucracies. Was
this wastehl duplication necessary?Interviewswith someofthe keypersonsinvolvedin
this aspect ofdesignrevealedthat this questionwas simplynot addressedexplicitly. It
seems to have been implicitly presumedthat, giventhe difficult initial environment inthe
country in2002 andthe considerable capacity constraints, a successivehorizon o f only
one year would be more manageablefor boththe Government and the donors.
Committing to a three-year horizonmighthave beentoo muchto ask for at that stage. In
addition, a three-year operation mighthave raisedthe question o f applying apriori
conditionalitywhich would not have been appropriate for apost-conflict, new country
usingofa grant from the Development Grant Facility, as was the case for the first
operation o fthe series. Inretrospect, it seems that despite the cost o fthe redundancy
involved, a series o fthree annual operations didmake sense underthe circumstances.

MainAchievements

6.3     BridgeFinancing and LeveragingIDA Grants.As arepresentative o fone o fthe
keydonor partners put it, "It is absolutely clear inmymindthat the bridgefinancing
providedby the donors throughthe TSP was essentialfor the economic survival o fthis
new country inthe early days. There was a strong politicalwill from several donors to
step ina help out, and the TSP providedthe right channel for their funds and efforts. The
central role playedby the Bank insupporting the Government manage the process was
valued bymy authorities, andbythe other donors, Ibelieve."

6.4     This i s probably a fair assessment despite the appreciable increase inoil and gas
revenues, starting with FY03, when TSP Iwas disbursed. The flow o f grants from the
donors allowedthe country to support a risinglevel o fneededexpenditures duringits
early formative years, by eliminating the need to borrow to finance the budget deficits.

                                             28


Duringthe three years ofthe TSP series (FY03-05), the amount ofannual grant financing
that helped finance the budget, about $33 millionon average, was close to halfthe
average levelo f consolidated expenditures. However, now that this country o f less than a
millionpeople i s sittingon about $2 billion inthe Petroleum Fund, projected to increase
significantly inthe coming years, the likelihood that it will continue to receive significant
amounts o f grant financing into the future will diminish.

6.5     Aid Coordination and its Benefits. Total donor financial support for the three
TSP operations came to about $99 million. O fthat, IDA grants were about $14 million
(14 percent). Nine bilateraldonors provided $76 (77 percent) million equivalent through
the IDA-administeredtrust fund, and another $9 million equivalent (9 percent) was
provideddirectly by other donors, but were associatedwith the program. Since the Bank
playedacentral role inassisting the Government, with the other donors, indesigningand
implementingthe TSP; it canbe arguedthat the influence ofthe IDA grantswas
leveragedby the additional andconsiderable (more than 6 times) donor co-financing.
This i s not to say that many o fthe other donors would not have participated ifthe Bank
were not involved.

6.6      The Government, some o fthe donors, andthe Bank all agreethat the TSP process
itselfwas a significant achievement, as summarized inthe first paragraph o fBox 1above.
The TSP provided a framework that was very much appreciated bythe Government to
help itplan, monitor the implementation, and adjust its development activities and
budgetaryoutlays. According to a senior Government official who was involvedwith the
process from the beginning, andhas since risen to a higherlevel o f authority within the
administration, "Isaw the mainbenefit ofthe entire three-year TSP inthe process itself
and as an instrument that allowedus to instill a new culture o fplanning, monitoring, and
rationalizingour activities. That, for me, was an endinitself at that stage. Specific
results and achievements, though important, were not what Iwas expecting from the
exercise at the beginning. Now, in2008, we needto start making the programmore
operational, andtarget for more concrete results." The TSP framework and process also
providedan appreciated vehicle for coordination among the donors, andbetweenthe
donors andthe Government. The costs o fthis coordination were considered bymost to be
more than offset by its benefits to all. Finally, the TSP process also helped establish
some communication channelsbetweenthe Government and civil society, through
various mechanisms, like leaflets, forums, press conferences, and seminars.

6.7      ThePetroleum Fund. There is general agreement among many Government
officials, donor representatives, andBank and IMF staffthat the establishment and
functioning o fthis fundhasbeen a major achievement; a real success story, so far. This
review agrees with this assessment.

6.8      In1999, the IMFandthe Bankworked closely withthe Government to look into
options for safeguarding the expectedincreases inpetroleum revenues, as production
increased. The concern was to protect future revenue streams from abuse and the political
pressure to spendmore liberally. A number o fmodels usedby differentcountries were
reviewedandit was decided to use avariant o fthe Norwegianmodel. The formula
adopted consisted ofputting an upper limit on any annual amount that canbe transferred
from petroleumrevenues ina particular year to finance budget expenditures. The

                                                29


remainder would be transferred to the Petroleum Fund(PF) to be invested inappropriate
financial instruments, to serve as savings for future generations. Goingbeyond such a
limitwouldrequire approval byParliament. This hasnotbeen done so far. The limit was
set at 3 percent of the present value o f the projectedrevenue stream (based on various
relevant assumptions), starting with the year inquestion. A s of early 2008, the PF stood
at around $2 billion; that is, more than $2000 per capita for Timor-Leste.

6.9     Many o fthe technical and legal measures employed inestablishing and operating
the fundwere included inthe Action Matrices ofthe TSP series, and serve as examples of
successful elements o f these matrices. The PF assets which are heldby the Banking and
Payments Authority (the country's "central bank") on behalfo f the Ministry o f Finance
have all been invested inU S Treasury bills so far. However, the authorities are currently
looking into diversification options, and considering asking the Bank's Treasury
Department for assistance inthis regard. The support given throughout by the Bank and
the IMF to the PF has been greatly appreciated by senior officials interviewed inthe
course of this review, including former Prime Minister Alkatiri, who has been credited by
manyobservers fromwithinand outside the country, withhavingbeena drivingforce
behind the establishment this fund. A main issue for the future is how to determine any
dynamic adjustment o f the ceiling placed on transfers to the budget; making sure to
carefully balance between the need to fund development expenditures, with the limited
absorptive capacity to implement such expenditures efficiently.

6.10     TheHealth Sector. There seems to be a general consensus among donors and
Government officials that the health sector sub-components of the three TSP operations
were well implemented. The credit has been uniformly given to the leadership inthe
Ministry o f Health, primarily inthe person of the Minister himself, at the time. All the
matrix actions called for were met. Inparticular, the quantitative target regarding
maintaining expenditures on hospitals below 40 percent (to safeguard enough resources
for primaryhealthcare) was consistently met; and those for DPT3 andmeasles
immunizations, attended deliveries, and outpatient visits, were exceeded. Ironically, the
minister concerned who i s generally viewed as technically andmanagerially very
competent, felt that the performance indicators chosen were second best; but as good as
was available, given difficulties with data collection and analysis. H e also felt that due to
severe staff constraints, the measures included inthe Actions Matrices in all sectors were
driven by consultants and donors, with insufficient consultation with Timorese. A s such,
they lacked full ownership by the civil servants. Many local counterparts, inhisview, just
went along even when they believed that the pace dictated by the matrices was
unrealistically fast. H e felt that the senior echelons of the Government at the time,
including the then Prime Minister, were keen on having the matrices as instruments of
dialogue with the donors (and channels for their funding), but were not themselves
involved with the details of the tool itself. This view was shared by other Timorese
officials inline agencies, and even some donor representatives and Bank staff
interviewed inthe course of this review.

6.11 Electricity Metering. This item is included here under main achievements
because it was successful for a short while, untilthe 2006 riots and disturbances, which
may be viewed as an unfortunate "external shock" from the standpoint of the power
sector.

                                              30


6.12    A separatepower sector component hadbeenincludedinTSP I, was dropped but
inthe subsequent two operations. Itwas includedinthe first operationbecausepower
subsidies at the time representeda significant drain on the budget. The component
introduced measuresinthe Actions Matrix for that operation designed to help remedy
this situation. According to the Grant CompletionReport, the implementation o fthis
component didnot proceed that well, ingeneral. Many significant challenges were not
properly addressed at the time and neededfurther attention. It is not clear, therefore, why
itwas not includedinthe secondandthirdoperations.

6.13    Despite this disappointing overall performance, the financial positiono fthe power
authority didimprove temporarily becauseoftwo technical factors: the installation of
emergencygeneratorswhich increasedcapacity, andtherefore, sales; andthe installation of
pre-paid metersinDiliin2002. Bothwere financed bygrants bythe NorwegianAgency
for Development Cooperation (NORAD). These measuresproved successfulandreceived
praise from the authorities and the donor community. Unfortunately, duringthe
disturbanceso f2006, many urbancustomersby-passedthe meters andconnected
themselvesillegally to the network. As a result, collections which hadaveragedaround
$6 million annually in2004 and2005, droppedbyhalfto around $3 million in2007. To
makemattersworse financially, the tariffwas reducedbyaround 25 percent in2007 to 12
centsperKWH, while production cost was around 37 centsper KWH(not including
transmission costs and losses). The power authority is now facedwith the challenge o fre-
installing metersandre-establishing more realistic tariffs. However, as a senior official o f
the authority stated, "The problemwe face now i sprimarilypolitical, andnot technical."
This official expressedsatisfaction with the quality ofthe cooperation with the Bank.

6.14     VeteransRecognition. TheVeterans Law was passedin2006, after closing ofTSP
111.As of2006, atotal of75,143 veteranswere registeredinaveteransdatabase. Though
the payment ofpensionshasbeen delayeddue to pendingapproval o frelevant decree laws,
US$lOmwere included inthe 2007 budget for veterans' pensions.

Main Areas of Partial, or Poor Progress

6.15    Among the measuresdesigned to improve governance and combat corruption, the
establishment and staffing o fthe Office ofthe Provedor (Ombudsman) was given
particular importance by the TSP series. Ittook the entire three-year period of the series
to finally have this office running, but despite this delay, it i s a good achievement (an
example o fhow some measureshadto berolled over untilthey were implemented). By
early 2008, a total o f 27 cases hadbeen considered; either inresponseto complaints
received, or at the initiative ofthe Office. Ofthose, 20 hadbeen investigated, o fwhich 8
hadbeenreferred to the Prosecutor General. None hadbeentaken to court, nor ledto any
disciplinary action as o fthat date. The cases involvedmatters like tax evasion, or misuse
o f funds. A number o fcases involved Government officials andwere reportedto the line
ministries involved, but no follow-up action hadbeentaken. The Provedor does not have
the authority to prosecute. H e can only try to persuadeline ministries to take action, or
refer criminal cases to the Prosecutor General. Line ministrieshave up to 60 days to act,
andifthey do not, the Provedor canreport the case to Parliament. IfParliament does not
act, the report canbepublicized. Inaddition, when a report i s referredto the Prosecutor
General the mediaare invitedto attend. The Provedor's Office has also been entrusted

                                               31


with overseeing the functioning o fthe PetroleumFund, andhas so far been satisfied with
its performance.

6.16     Duringaninterview with the Provedor, hehighlightedanumber o f additional
handicaps he faces which prevents him from carrying out his responsibilities more
effectively. For example, there is no law that protects witnesses, nor to force Government
officials to disclose assets. Thejudicial system is considered weak and subject to
corruption itself. The Office has plans to establish an "intelligence group" to gather
evidence against suspected individuals, andto devise mechanismsto encourage "whistle
blowers", but lacks funding. While the Office was generally content with the support it
hadreceived from the Bank, it felt that tying funds originating from the Bank to specific
line items inthe national budget hadproven inflexible at times. The Provedor also felt
that, due to cultural proximity, receiving technical assistance from neighboring countries
like the Philippines, Malaysia, HongKong, or Singapore is likely to be preferable than
from further places.

6.17     Onbalance, despite the initial delay inestablishing and staffing the Office, the
handicaps it is operating under, andits limited achievements so far; this review agrees
with the Bank's operational staffthat having a Provedor's Officewith competent staff is
a desirable achievement whose returns are likely to be forthcoming indue course. This
said, it is not clear whether it meritedthe priority it hadreceived throughout the TSP
series, given the relatively petty nature o f corruption inthe country so far, but with rising
oil revenues the challenge o f corruption may increase.

6.18     The experience o f the Office offhe Inspector General has beenquite similar to
that o f the Provedor's. Infact, there has been some overlap intheir functions, but they
have triedto coordinate to avoid duplication o f efforts.

6.19     This Office was established in2002 duringthe UNTAETperiod, within the Prime
Minister's staff, to conduct inspections, audits, and investigations o f corruption
exclusively within the civil service. Incase criminal actions are suspected, the Office
recommends to the Prime Minister to refer the case to the Prosecutor General.
Alternatively, insome cases, informal contacts are made with the line ministries involved
to try to resolve the situation more directly andrapidly.

6.20     As o fearly 2008, the Office hadinvestigated 87 cases concerning allegations o f
misconduct. Many o f those cases ended up revealing that the causes o f the alleged
misconduct were actually related to poor systems inplace, or shortages o f skills; and
recommendations were made accordingly to the line agencies concerned. Insome o f
those cases, the agencies acted on the recommendations. Inone case that was widely
publicized and involved using misuse o f Government vehicles, a law was passed
prohibiting the use o f such vehicles for private purposes. Out o f the 87 cases, 11were o f
a criminal nature, and their files were forwarded to the Prosecutor General. Some o f those
were dropped due to insufficient evidence, others investigated, but only one case
proceeded to court. The civil servant involved was convicted o f receiving a bribe o f
$3,000. He was simply asked to return it, but ultimately kept his position and sufferedno
other penalties. The interview with the Inspector General revealed that he hadheard o f
more significant cases o f corruption involving larger investors, but hadnot faced

                                               32


anything o fthis nature formally. Inhis view, it has beendifficult to measurethe extent
and level of corruption inthe country due to flimsy evidence. As with the Provedor, he
believedthat thejudicial systemremained very weak, andthat the elevenmagistrates
lacked the experience neededto deal with corruption, and needed trainingto upgrade
their skills The Office itselfstill suffered from the lack o f an Organic Law, which has not
been approved yet. Such a law would formalize its functions and give them more clout.
The Inspector General also complained that his Office suffered from a lack ofqualified
staff and office facilities.

6.21    As with the Provedor's Office, this review concluded that the support givento the
Inspector General's Office underthe TSP series was worthwhile and, onbalance, a
modest achievement, despite the very limitedresults so far. Indue course, it could prove
to have been a good investment to combat more openly serious cases of civil service
misconduct.

6.22    Budget execution hasbeenvery slow andhesitant, despiteimprovements in
budgetplanning,monitoringand evaluation. This hasbeenattributed to the severe
capacity constraints andto the reluctance o fthe MFP to delegate spendingauthority to
line ministries, or to lower echelonswithin the Ministry itself. Inview o fthe capacity
constraint, perhaps more effort should be directed to improving implementation than to
seeminglydevise endless andredundant planning andmonitoringinstruments.

6.23    Government officials and staff of donors, includingthe Bank, all admit that
progress inthe development o fthejudicial sector hasbeenvery limited and
disappointing, with the number o f competent magistrates still very limited, the backlogo f
adjudicated cases rising, and the suspicion that this sector itselfi s handicapped by
corruption.

6.24    Thepublic works program that was designed to bring about immediate
employment opportunities to generate income, promote growth, andreduce poverty;
produced very limitedresults. A mainreasonseems to have beenthe reluctance of the
fundingauthorities to disbursefunds, fearing that they would bemisused.

6.25    Despite its importance, particularly for poverty reduction, the performance o f the
education sector was partial, andbroadly disappointing, especially compared to that o f
the health sector. It seems that inhealth, the local capacity constraint was overcome by
contracting with a neighboring country to provide trained personnel. Apparently, this was
not easy to replicate ineducationbecauseo f the languagebarrier. Teachers would need to
be able to instruct inthe main local language, Tetum.

6.26    Progress achieved inprivate sector development was mixed. Some legislationthat
would facilitate business dealings was passed, and some other was still pending, or in
progress, as of early 2008. An export promotionagency (TradeInvest Timor-Leste) was
established, albeit after the closingo fTSP 111.Business Development Centers hadtrained
a large numbero fparticipants. However, business registration andprocedures ingeneral
were still cumbersome.More importantly, any administrative or legal achievementsthat
hadtaken place, hadnot ledto any significant job creation, and the private sector had
remained a far cry from serving as an engine o f growth. The Emigrant Workers'

                                               33


Program, designed to encourage employment abroad, had so far led to relatively
insignificant number o f migrant workers; at most a hundred, or so.

6.27     Most o f the other areas o f the Action Matrices had also witnessed partial, or
limited, progress comparedto expectations, as elaborated inthe I C R for TSP 111, which
also assessedachievements o f the entire TSP series.

Remarks

6.28     As elaborated earlier inthis report, creating the conditions for sustainablegrowth
andpoverty reduction has been the main pillars o f the country's NDP andthe Bank's
CAS from the days immediately after independence. As such, they have also served as
the main ultimate objectives o f the TSP series.

6.29     National accounts data inTimor-Leste remain rather approximate and, according
to the IMF, should be viewed as indicative trend figures rather than robust statistics. With
that inmind, the IMF used estimates produced by consultants working with the Ministry
o f Finance, and reported that non-oil real GDP growth was around 5 percent annually in
both 2004 and 2005, and dropped precipitously to almost minus 6 percent in2006,
presumably due to the serious disturbances inthat year (Recall that the TSP series
coveredthe FY03-05 period. So, 2004-2006 could be considered an appropriate period to
consider for assessingthe effect o f TSP on growth).

6.30     With the above caveats inmind, andrecognizing that attributing any direct impact
o f TSP measures to growth i s a very questionable methodological leap, one may simply
conclude that the economy's overall structure and performance remained quite fragile,
fluctuating considerably, dependingmore onpolitical events and other exogenous shocks
than on policy performance inthe short- to medium-run, inresponse to actions under the
TSP.

6.31     The impact o f the TSP series on unemployment andpoverty reduction is also
likely to have been insignificant, despite the lack o f data to substantiate such an assertion.
Inview ofthe very highpopulationgrowth ofaround4percent, andthe predominantly
young population, the growth o f employment opportunities could not possibly have been
catching upwith new entrants into the labor force. This is a very serious problemand a
major challenge facing the country. Combined with the troublesome domestic political
rifts, this makes pronouncements that Timor-Leste has already achievedpolitical stability
pre-mature, as evidenced bythe several civil disturbances that have occurred since
independence, including the riots that broke out as late as the summer o f 2007, in
connectionwith the presidential elections at that time; and the attempts on the lives o f the
President and the Prime Minister inFebruary 2008.

6.33                                    Outcome. Keepinginmindthe dire state o f affairs inthis new, post-conflict
country at the dawn o f its independence, and that the mainunderlyingobjective o fthe
donor community, including the Bank,was to provide urgentlyneededbridge, grant-
financing to help indeveloping the basic institutions andplanningframework o fthe state.
There were significant achievements ina few key areas. The establishment andproper
functioning ofthe Petroleum Fund, byitself, i s a major achievement and success story for
the country's governance structure, since it has managed to safeguardthe nation's new-
found wealth untilit develops the capacity to be able to use it better. Infact, the balance
ofthe Petroleum Fundhas tripledina year andhalfreaching US$ 1.8 billion in
Septemberof2007. The robust achievementsinthe health sector are also commendable.
Inaddition, there isbroadagreementbyacross-section ofGovernment officials,
membersofthe donor community, and operational staffofthe Bankthat havebeen
intimately involved; that the TSP series hasbeenvery helpfulto the Government in
establishing aprocess and framework for planning, monitoring and evaluation that has
enabledit to better link its economic development objectives to budget allocations, ina

                                             35


coordinated manner with the donor community. Despite clear remaining shortcomings of
this process andthe poor experience with budget execution so far, the Government has
unequivocally expressed its appreciation and gratitude for this achievement. After
factoring inthe realities on the groundinthis nascent, post-conflict country; based on the
views of the client (gained from extensive interviews with officials), donor
representatives, and Bank staff involved inthe operation, this PPAR was able to consider
infar more detail the significance ofpartialprogress madethus far.

6.34    However, notwithstanding significant progress made insome areas, the fact
remains that only partial results were achieved inmost of the other areas of the program.
are inline with ratings given by the IEGICR Review Evaluation Summary (ES) for TSP
I1and 111. The self-assessment ICR's rankingofsatisfactory for TSP I1and I11appears
too generous, given that many outcomes fell short of expectations, even if an allowance i s
made for the claim that the program design was intentionally ambitious to begin with.

6.35    Relevance ofprogram objectives and design. As indicated inthe ICRreviews
(for TSP I1and 111), the overall program objectives were very relevant given the acute
lack of capacity inthe country, the needto reform the budget and improve public
expenditure management, as well as achieve better service delivery. The main thrust of
the TSP series was highly relevant as IDAjoined forces with other major donors to
provide urgently neededbridge grant-financing. This prevented this new, poor country
from starting offby incurring debt, or cutting back on an already modest level ofpublic
expenditures that were, inany case, used mainly to runa basic public administration and
security forces during a period of political uncertainty. The series also aimed at
supporting the development ofbasic policies and institutions needed for the proper
functioning of this new state. Although a number of areas for this support were highly
relevant, such as health, education, job creation, the proper management o f petroleum
revenues, setting up and developing basic planning and administrative institutions; the
effort was diffused by including many other areas of lesser priority and relevance at that
early stage of the country's development. Those included several regulatory and
governance matters that are preferably addressed at later stages ina country's
development. Inshort, the resultingproject design was too complex for the country and
overwhelming for the government. It detracted from the limited capacity ofthe
government to clearly select priorities andperform its key functions. The relevance of
program design was, therefore, only modest - hence the overall relevance o f the program
was modest.

6.36    Efficacy -Achievement of Objectives. A s detailed inthe ICRReviews o f TSP I1
and 111, echoed and further elaborated inthe previous chapters devoted to individual TSP
operations, and summarized inthe paragraphs 6.1-6.32 and inparticular inTable 4, the
program had a number o f significant achievements insome areas o f improved
governance and better service delivery. However, inmany other areas envisaged under
the project appraisal documents (PADs) for the three operations there was only partial or
insufficient progress, especially inthe important area of creating newjobs. It is
significant to note that the PADs didnot contain specific sections that dealt directly and
clearly with explicit objectives ofthe program as a whole. They contained discussions of
program rationale (bridge-financing to help set upbasic institutions and functions ina
period of transition), andmoved directly to discussing program components, without an

                                              36


explicit statement o f clear, more specific objectives. The PAD for TSP Iincludeda
couple o f sentences stating that, "The program i s broadranging, seeking to put inplace
the basis framework for an open and democratic state apparatus inthe period
immediatelyafter independence.Givenlimitedcapacity, the creation o f fully functioning
institutions is likely to be a much longer process." This absenceo f a clear statemento f
specific objectives may explainthe "intentionally" broad, andtherefore diffuse, program
design; andmakes it difficult to assess the efficacy ofthe program as awhole. Overall,
the TSP program recorded modest achievement inthe areas o f good governance and
better service delivery, and negligible achievement increating newjobs.

6.37     To be fair to Bank staff (andmost likely to the staffo f other donors as well), there
was an intensive debate among those involvedinthe preparation and appraisal o f the
projects on this matter, with some arguingfor a more focused design targeted on a much
smaller numbero fbetter defined, more tangible objectives; and others feeling that the
Bank should beresponsive to the Government's desire to have the donors' support across
the whole rangeof its activities. As one Bank staffer from the second group put it, "had
we not gone along with the wishes o fthe most senior Government officials, we would
have most probably lost their interest." Inthe end, the positiono f this secondgroup
prevailed, andthe result was the set o f extensive, rather unwieldy, Action Matrices, with
an extremely wide range o f actions, the so-called "all-of-Government" approach. These
matrices seem to have developed a life o f their own, and grew inthe process. A
Government agency that wanted to have its work program includedinthe national budget
felt that it hadto have it includedinthe matrix. The problemwas a lack o f explicit
priorities to be imposed over the measures. The much smaller sub-sets o f "prior actions"
selected for the three operations seemto have been chosenbecausethey had already been
implementedprior to aparticular operation's approval, rather than for havingobvious
priority over many other measures.

6.38     Risk to Development Outcome. The simplifiedICR for TSP I1gave it a rating o f
likely for sustainability (which was the criterionusedbefore changing it to "risk to
development outcome"), andthe full ICR for TSP I11gave it aratingof low or negligible
for risk to development outcome. This review considers the secondrating inparticular to
betoo optimistic. Infact, it considers that thejustification for this secondratingpresented
inthe ICRitselfto beinconsistent withthe rating. The ICRdidexpressconcernsover the
unstablepolitical and social situation, the highlevel ofunemployment among the youth,
the very low implementation capacity, andthe risk o fcorruptionthat faces increased
petroleum revenuesover time (despite the good performance ofthe Petroleum Fundso
far); but still gave a rather optimistic "low or negligible" rating. Infact, the concerns
listed inthe ICR itself are quite serious; particularly the domestic, political fault-lines that
continue to be the cause of serious friction and violence that could spinout of control. As
such, this risk to development outcome may be considered increasing. Moreover, some
o fthe successfulresults achieved so far, as inhealth sector, have dependedso far on the
presenceo f specific individuals inkey positions, andmay not be rootedinsolid
institutionalcommitments. Inaddition, already inearly 2008, there were some concerns
beingvoiced by somewell-placed Timorese that considerable pressure is buildingupto
raise the ceiling on budgetary withdrawals from the Petroleum Fund, and also some
indications that expatriate advisors who have beenproponents o f caution within this
Fund, maybeaskedto leave. For all these reasons, thisreview agrees with the ratings in

                                                37


the ICRReviewso fTSP I1and I11and assesses the risk to development outcome as
signijkant.

6.39    Bank Performance. The evaluation o fthe Bank's performance recognizes the
realities inthe country and the strong desire by the client to follow a broad, all-
encompassingapproach inthe program design. It also takes into account that this matter
was seriously debatedwithinthe Bank, among the donor community, and with the
Government at the programdesign stage. The fact remains that the Bank gave inand
designed a very complex program for a post-conflict country with severely limited
capacity. Greaterrealism and a more careful risk assessmentat entry would have
suggested amuchmore streamlined and focused project design, o fwhich the Bankcould
have easily convinced the borrower. Furthermore, changes could have and should have
beenmade duringthe implementation ofthe first operation andinthe design of
subsequent operations (TSP I1and 111)to address clear implementation difficulties and
focus on the achievement ofpriority project objectives. Overall, Bank performance in
the TSP program i s rated moderatezy unsatisfactory.

6.40     Borrower Performance. Government clear interest inobtaining Bank and donor
financial and institutionalsupport for its national development programwas not
accompaniedby true ownership and commitment to achieve the wide-ranging and overly
ambitious development objectives set inthe TSP operations. Partially causedbythe
oversupply o f donor resources, and weak and unclear Bawdonor feedback, the
Government failed to select clear priorities and realize its own implementation capacity
constraints. Hence, with ambitious project design, Government limitedresourceswere
spreadtoo thinly across too many competing development priorities leading to weak
implementation o fmany actionshomponents. The defacto priorities were established
only through implementation leading to partial achievement o fproject objectives.
Unfortunately, little was learned from this experience as it was not usedto redesignthe
subsequentTSP operations or to boost implementation capacity. Overall, Borrower
performance inthe TSP program i s rated moderately unsatisfactory.

6.41     TheBank,the other donors andthe Government realizedfrom thebeginningthat
the programwas ambitious andrecognized implicitly that it would only achievepartial
success, as it did. To that end, boththe Bank and the Borrower devoted considerable,
serious andprofessional efforts indesigning, programmingand monitoringthe
implementation o fthe details o fthe wide range o fmeasures. The supervision and aid
coordination effort was intense andprofessional; and appreciated bythe Government,
despite the heavyburdenit placed on its limitedcapacity. For its part, the Borrower was
involvedinthe daunting task o fbuildinga new nation following a devastating two and a
half decades o f fightingan occupation; and it felt the imperative to do so on abroad front.
Giventhe severecapacity constraints that handicapped its abilities, itmanagedto achieve
a few notable successes andpartialprogress along the broader front, inline with its
expectations. The few, competent members o fthe small political elite and the civil
service were directly responsible for the few initial, but notable, achievements.Hadthe
parties involvedagreedfrom the beginningon a more focused approach with tighter
priorities, as some o fthem called for, it is likely that the rate o f success would havebeen
higher,andtheir performance mighthavebeenmoresatisfactory. Theratingof

                                              38


satisfactory givenbythe ICRs for TSP I1andI11does not sufficiently account for the fact
that the programs achievementswere only partial.

6.42    Monitoring and Evaluation: Monitoringwas made difficult duringthe first TSP
operation and, to a large extent, remained a problem inthe second TSP due to limited
capacity and excessive complexity o fthe project which imposed a large burdenon the
government. Although the government's TSP Action Matrix was an important resource
andanexhaustive organizing framework for acomprehensive M&Esystem, it didnot
allow for prioritizing andselecting where to proceed inthe absence o f adequateprogress
across the board. Evaluationappearsto havebeenmechanically focused on meeting
conditions (prior actions) with little attention to performance indicators and ensuringthat
the reforms were havinganimpact onthe population. Basedon continuous albeit slow
progress, a better system for monitoringthe implementationo fproject conditions was in
place only for TSP 111. The TSP action matrix played akey role intracking
implementation and inidentifyingpriorities for implementation. Quarterly benchmarks
helped identify areas o fprogress, those needingmore attention, and areas seriously
laggingbehind.Despite such clear signals coming out o fthe M&E systeminthe third
project, the follow-up was missing,especially when it came to selecting clear priorities
and following through on the implementation of critical reforms. Overall, the quality of
the M&E system for the TSP program is rated as modest.

7.      Lessons

7.1     The most important lesson from this TSP experience is for the Bankto argue
more strongly to try to convince borrowers to agree to morefocusedprogram design,
with tightpriorities, especially for grants or loans that are disbursedinone tranche upon
effectiveness, and are provided as generalized budget support. This would normally
increase the likelihood o f achieving program objectives ina timely and efficacious
manner. Iffaced with a similar situation to that which existed inTimor-Leste where the
Government feels strongly that it needs support for a broad-frontedprogram involving a
large number o f time-consuming institutional measures with a hightechnical assistance
(TA) content, itwould bepreferable to provide a specific TA operationwith an
appropriate implementation horizon, likely to take a few years.

7.2     Incaseslike Timor-Leste where there is arelativelyhigh,andpossiblyincreasing
political risk due inlarge measure to highunemployment among disgruntled youth, much
more attention and effort should be give to creatingjobs and achieving `quick wins" in
poverty related services and through work programs. Whereas this was indeed a major
objective o f this TSP series, the actual effort inthis regardwas diluted considerably by
the inclusion o fwide range o fmeasures, many o f which could have easily waited for a
later stage inthe development drive.

7.3     Where capacity limitations are severe, as inthe case of Timor-Leste, TA is
normally requiredto help do the work itself, and also to train a large number o f
personnel. Ideally, it is very attractive ifthe two can be combined. Inpractice, however, it
is normally inevitable insuch cases that, ifthe same technical advisor is requiredto do
both; the pressures o f delivering the work itself outweighs the training objective, and
capacity buildingis short-changed, or delayed. Therefore, consideration should be given
to the appropriateness o f providing TA which is dedicatedentirely to training, inparallel
to advisors who actually do part o fthe work.

7.4     Quite often, but particularly incountries with limitedqualified personnel, success
is highly correlated with working with the more competent and committed counterparts,
as this review has pointed out. This could be a delicate matter inpractice, but where
possible, it would be better for the Bank to try tofocus support aroundproven
achievers, while seeking to develop institutional capacity.

7.5     Despite its costs to the Government andits development partners, which can be
highat times, the benefits o factivedonor coordinationareworthwhile, as demonstrated
bythe experience under the TSP program.
