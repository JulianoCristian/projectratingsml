                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Program seeks to support the Government's efforts to improve the competitiveness of the Mexican economy by strengthening the innovative capacity of
                         the private sector, accelerating advanced human capital formation, and increasing the international integration of the innovation system. To achieve the
                         program's development objectives, a first phase operation is proposed with two major lines of investment, in addition to supporting the policy framework for
                         and internationalization of Mexico's innovation system. First, on the demand side, the program would increase support to business innovation; while, second,
                         on the supply side the program would accelerate the formation of human capital (through strategic and coordinated use of the scholarship fund); and finally it
                         would support the cohesion and effectiveness of Mexico's S,T& I system. Overall success of the program would be measured by the increase in private R&D
                         from the current level of US$ 730 million (0.1% of GDP) to at least 0.2% of GDP, in the understanding that project interventions will leverage increased private
                         sector R&D activity. More specifically, and in addition to trigger indicators, the following improvements are expected: (i) private investment into collaborative
                         R&D centers, start-up of technology-based firms, and employment of R&D personal would increase from US$ 2 million per year to US$ 30 million per year; (ii) a
                         sustained reform of the scholarship program would produce 30,000 graduates in areas with increased employability, of which a higher share will be employed in
                         private enterprises; and (iii) increased international visibility as measured by increase in co-authorships, an increase towards 1% of new global S&T knowledge,
                         and increased international participation in cooperative research.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The implementation of all the components was completed by December 31, 2010 closing date. The results in many components have exceeded initial targets, and most activities are
                         expected to be sustainable after the conclusion of the loan since they will continue functioning with national resources. In some cases, activities are continuing under different names
                         or formats given internal program restructurings.
