A\n            consortium of consultants known as CANAMBRA, working under a\n            United Nations Special Fund grant for which the Bank acts as\n            Executing Agency, have studied the market for power in the\n            region. These consultants have also prepared an emergency\n            program of expansion, with which the Government is in\n            accord, to meet power requirements through 1970. The\n            Estreito and Xavantes developments, which together will\n            provide additional generating capacity of almost 1 million\n            kilowatts, are of high priority within this program. The\n            Xavantes project has been under construction for several years."}, "docdt": "1965-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
