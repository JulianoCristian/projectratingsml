the Second Economic\n            Management Support Project for Guinea was satisfactory. The\n            project achieved some of its objectives, institutional\n            development was partially achieved, sustainability is\n            uncertain, and the performance of the Bank was satisfactory\n            while the Borrower's was less than satisfactory.\n            Several lessons can be learned from this project. First,\n            project design should be focused on a few key economic\n            management functions, supported by a few co-financing\n            partners, in order to minimize the additional burden on\n            local management capacities. Second, project sustainability\n            could be improved through a closer monitoring of the\n            transfer of skills and closer supervision of in-service\n            training. Finally, implementation could be improved through\n            more rigorous supervision of progress reports, prepared by\n            both the experts and local teams, and the definition of\n            performance targets to monitor progress."}, "docdt": "1994-02-02T00:00:00Z"}
