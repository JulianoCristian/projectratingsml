The project also seeks to improve the\n            management and monitoring of the Government's Economic\n            and Financial Recovery Program, particularly to facilitate\n            the implementation of economic and institutional reforms\n            within its structural adjustment program.  Furthermore, the\n            project aims to develop sound economic legislation and\n            strengthen the Government's civil service training\n            capacity as well as to develop professional skills of a\n            number of national cadres.  This project will achieve the\n            above through technical assistance operations, training\n            programs and fellowships as well as equipment and vehicle financing."}, "docdt": "1988-10-19T00:00:00Z"}
