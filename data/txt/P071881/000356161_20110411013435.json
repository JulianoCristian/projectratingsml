Learning\n            Center Project for Mauritania were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately unsatisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was high, the Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included: while\n            replicating projects is possible, project design requires\n            full cognizance of country-specific conditions. Strong\n            Government support is key to the success of a Global\n            Development Learning Network (GDLN) center: it promotes the\n            center, giving it recognition as a capacity building\n            facility. Consultative process during project design and\n            implementation is a prerequisite. Availability of public\n            sector funds for capacity building activities should be\n            secured ex-ante. Institutional utilization of existing\n            assets to develop capacity should be given top priority in\n            an environment of severe capacity shortages. Learning\n            incentives need to change."}, "docdt": "2011-02-22T00:00:00Z"}
