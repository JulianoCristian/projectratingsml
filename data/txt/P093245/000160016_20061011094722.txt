                                        September 25,2006



                                        I. OVERVIEW


1.      The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper Progress Report (PRSP Progress Report,
of August 2006) confirms the commitment of the government to the PRSP objectives,
describes key results of the implementation over the last 18 months, and highlights new
dimensions in the strategy. The PRSP Progress Report, or Economic Development and
Poverty Reduction ProgramProgress Report (EDPRP Progress Report) as it i s knownin
Georgia, i s the second Annual Progress Report (APR) on the poverty reduction strategy. This
Joint StaffAdvisory Note (JSAN) discusses the strategy's implementation to date, and
provides the staffs' advice on key priorities for strengthening the EDPRP further.

2.      Overall, the APR provides evidenceof continued strong economic performance,
as well as progress on structural reforms in 2005 and the first half of 2006. GDP growth
was 9.3 percent in2005 but is expected to slow in2006 to around 7.5 percent, partlyas a
result o f external shocks. Inflation remainedinsingle digits in2005 but accelerated during
2006, reaching 14.5 percent as o f end-July, before declining to 13.4percent at end-August. As
the government considers price stability a condition for sustained economic growth and
poverty reduction, measures are under way to reduce inflationary pressures, including
tighteningthe fiscal stancebytargeting adeficit o f2.5 percent o f GDP in2006, and
tighteningthe monetary stanceby reducingthe target 2006 growth rate o freserve money from
25 percent to 15 percent.

3.       The structuralreformstrategyis anchored on improvinggovernance, reducing
the burdenof the state on the economy,andimprovinglivingstandards. The results
achieved so far incurbing corruption and improvingthe business climate are impressive and
create the potential for broad based growth inthe future, which should reduce unemployment
and poverty over time. Buildingon these achievements, the challenge i s to implement the new
regulatory framework, develop the capacity to monitor andreport on outcomes o f the reforms,
and translate progress into lasting institutional improvements.

                                  11.     POVERTY    DIAGNOSIS

4.       The governmenthas significantlyimprovedthe statisticalframework for
measuringpoverty. The newmethodology onpoverty measurement, developedinclose
collaboration with World Bank staff, follows international standards and allows a more
accurate and reliable measurement o f poverty than the previous methodology.

5.       Despitestrong GDP growth, povertyincreasedduring2004-05, partlybecause,
unemploymentcontinuedto rise. Inpart because public sector reforms requiredthe layoff
o f civil servants, unemployment increased from the already highpre-reform level andreached
13.8 percent in2005. Together with weaknesses inthe social assistance system, this
contributed to an increase inthe overall poverty incidence from 35.7 in2004 to 39.4 percent
in2005. Inequality rose slightly, as reflected inanincrease inthe Ginicoefficient from 0.37
in2004to 0.39 in2005. While poverty declinedinthe first quarter o f2006 to 33.6 percent, a
solid trend towards poverty reduction i s yet to be established.

6.       Timely implementationof the measuresoutlinedintheAPR for improvingthe
effectivenessof Georgia's social assistancesystemis essentialto reducingextreme
poverty.The authorities recognize that, inaddition to solid growth, poverty reduction
requires an effective social assistance system. Despite delays, progress has been made: the
APR reports that the medical insuranceprogram for the extreme poor beganto be
implementedinJuly 2006. Similarly, the poverty benefit for the extreme poc~r-`las introduced
inTbilisi inAugust 2006 andwas expandednationwide inSeptember. However, further
progress i s needed to enhance the social assistance system's effe3tiveness while ensuring its
fiscal sustainability. Inaddition to addressing deficiencies due to fragmentation, the APR
notes that the authorities also intendto improve the targeting o fthe poverty reduction
program and to move from in-kindto financial benefits which will enhance the program's
efficiency and effectiveness.


7.       In order to buildan effectivepoverty monitoringsystem,it is essentialto create
an independent,technically competent publicstatisticalagency.TheDepartment o f
Statistics should continue strengtheningits technical capacities to allow a thorough
monitoring o fpoverty trends. Inparticular, it i s important to fwther improve the household
survey and poverty measurement methodology. The staffs recommendmaking the Georgian
Department of Statistics an independent institution, inline with best practices inthe region.

                    111.   MACROECONOMIC ANDFRAMEWORK
                                                  POLICIES

8.      The staffs of IDA andthe IMFsupportthe thrust of the macroeconomicpolicies
proposedinthe APR. While the report provides a comprehensive overview o f
macroeconomic developments in2005, an analysis o f the causes o f the upswingininflation
during2006 is missing.Inview o fthe sharp increase o finflation duringthe first halfo f2006,
whichinstaffs' view was mainly driven byrapid money growth, it would havebeenusefulto
spell out how the government andNBGwill limit money growth to non-inflationary levels.

9.      Lookingforward, the reportprovidesonly limitedinformationon the main
parametersof the macroeconomicframework.Besides the inflation target o f 5-6 percent,
the only medium-termmacroeconomic targets explicitly mentioned are the international
reserve coverage (equivalent to 2.5 months o fimports) and GDP growth o f 7.5 percent. In
order to integrate the PRSP's tasks into the government's macroeconomic policies, it would
have beenuseful to present a more comprehensive macroeconomic framework, including the
country's external position, inview o f the difficult relationswith its main trading partner,
uncertainties about future energyprices, and vulnerabilities arising from large private inflows.
Future APR's could also analyze the impact o f external vulnerabilities andpolitical shocks in
macroeconomic stress tests.

10.     While monetarypoliciesin support of the inflationtarget are spelledout in
principle,the NBG's balancingact betweenstabilizingthe exchange rateand controlling
inflationcouldhavebeen discussedin more detail. The report presents a strategy for
conducting monetary policy and a comprehensive proposal for strengthening the institutional
framework for the banking sector inthe future. However, it would have been useful to explain
inmore detailhow theNBGintendsto balance the tasks ofrestraininginflation with
appreciationpressures arising from private foreign inflows. Duringthe first halfo f 2006, the
focus o f the NBG's interventions was less on controlling inflation than on limiting
appreciation, which has negative income andwealth effects due to the highdollarization o f
savings and largeremittances from abroad.

11.     Althoughthe governmentprepareditsfirst Medium-termExpenditure
Framework(MTEF) since the last PRSP,the PRSPis notintegratedwith the MTEF.
The PRSP does not provide cost estimates for the government's plannednew initiatives.
Without these cost estimates which need to be integrated inthe MTEF, it remains unclear how
the government intends to fulfillits goals listed inthe PRSP while preserving a sustainable
fiscal position. Inaddition, staffs note that to improve the efficiency and effectiveness o f
public spending, the outcome o fpublic programs needs to be assessedthrough performance
indicators.

                         IV.     PUBLIC EXPENDITURE       MANAGEMENT

12.     Staffs encourage the authoritiesto make every effort to ensurea moresystematic
implementationof newly adoptedpublicexpendituremanagementsystems and
practices.The APRreports on several milestones intheprogress toward a modernpublic
expenditure management system, including advances toward program budgeting, a growing

                                                4



autonomy o f spending units indefining policies and directions, the MTEFwhich i s based on
the comprehensive Basic Data andDirections 2007-2010, and the introductionofthe
Treasury Single Account. However, further reforms are necessary, including improved
accountability and transparency o fpublic spending. Staffs recommend that, inthe short term,
priority should be givento expanding fiscal and transparency rules to the Legal Entities o f
Public Law (LEPLs). Inthe mediumterm, efforts should focus on the following priorities:

                  Strengtheningmedium-termbudgetplanning by fully integrating the MTEF
                  goals into the annual budget planning process;

            0     Developing a management structure for public investment;

            0     Move to international accounting standards based on GFS-2001.

Strengthening line ministries' capacity will be necessary for progress inthese areas.

13.     Inorder for the decentralizationeffort to succeed, capacitybuildingat the local
level should be accelerated.The APR reports on the decentralization reform which includes
a consolidation o f administrative units accompanied by delegating responsibilities, revenues,
and autonomy. In2005, the organic law on Local Self-Government was enacted which
consolidates 1,000 local government units into 70 unitswith new administrative structures. In
addition, the Law on Local Self-Government Budgetwas approved inthe summer o f2006
which, for the first time, establishes a clearly defined formula-based equalization systemfor
expenditure allocation. The latter also determines rules on the control, audit, evaluation and
execution o f local budgets. The APR notes that the authorities planto start implementing the
Law on Local Self-Government Budget with the 2007 budget. However, staffs note that major
efforts are needed to develop local capacity at the local level.


                                    V.     SECTORAL POLICIES

 14.    Significantadvances ineducationreformprovidea solidplatformfor improving
implementationof per studentfundingandcarryingthrough optimizationplans.The
APR reports onthe substantial progress that has beenmade toward the three maingoals o fthe
first stage o f its education system reform: (i)harmonizing the education system with
European standards; (ii)    eradicating corruption at all levels o f the education system; and
(iii)implementing a per-student financing system. The reforms aim at delegating
responsibilityto schools and institutions while increasing per capita financing at the general
education level. Inaddition, Georgiahas introduced transparent examinations for university
admission and is participating inthe Trends inInternational Mathematics and Science Study
and inthe Progress inInternational Reading Literacy Study which will for the first time allow
a comparisono f Georgia's education system with other countries. Important reforms needto
beimplementedover the medium term, including improving implementationofper student
financing andoptimization plans. Inorder to monitor performance inthe education sector,
performance indicators need to be introduced.

                                               5


15.     Inthe healthsector,the APR rightlyemphasizesthe importanceof revisingthe
basicbenefitpackage,while simultaneously addressingissuesof primaryhealthcare
needs,but the analysisof the fiscal implicationsofthe reformcouldbe strengthened.The
APRhighlightsthe importanceplacedbythe government onthe Basic Benefit Package (BBP)
for the whole population andthe Supplementary BenefitPackage (SBP) for the poor, as well
as onmaternal and child health. The APR reports on the advances that havebeen achieved in
the area o fprimary health care services, a core component o f the BBP and provides details on
investment needs ininfrastructure for primaryhealth care facilities andmaternal and child
health facilities, inparticular. While staffs welcome the government's activities inthe above-
mentioned areas, they urge the government to identify investment inthe hospital
infrastructure and the financing requirements o f the various packages. Also, future APRs
should provide information onhealthrelated indicators included inthe 2003 PRSP, such as
infantandunder-five mortality rates and advances onHIV/AIDSandother major diseases.

16.     The APR reflects continuedimprovementsinthe energy sector. Exceptfor an
interruption o f energy supplies from abroad inJanuary 2006, customers largely received24
hours' power supplythrough the winter o f 200906. This constitutes a substantial
improvement over earlier years. Financial flows were muchimproved through progress in
collections, while investments contributedto technical improvements. Financial flows to
domestic upstream service providers (power transmission andhydropower generation) are,
however, still inadequate. The government introduced largetariff increases inJune 2006 to
address this problem and believes privatizationwill provide further financial discipline. To
protect vulnerable groups insociety, the Government introduced a life line program. Staffs
commend these efforts but note that tariff increases andprivatization may not entirely solve
the problems inthe sector. To achieve andmaintain adequate quality o f service, it is important
that competent regulation o fpower distribution service standards be implemented, requiring
private operators to invest to meet such standards. The government and its remaining state-
owned companies will have to develop financing solutions for the still-substantial investment
needs inpower andnatural gas transmission and for developing domestic power production to
improve Georgia's energy security.

17.     Staffswelcome simplificationof the regulatoryand administrativeframeworksin
the transportation sector but notethat importantinstitutionalchallenges remain.Onthe
regulatory framework, the APR reports on the successful liberalization o ftransport
regulations, consolidation o fthree regulatory administrations into a unifiedinstitution, and the
results o f significantly increased spending on road rehabilitation and development. The new
regulatory framework needs to be closely monitored and revised, as appropriate. Furthermore,
the new institution needs to develop a monitoring andpublic reporting system. On the railway
system, the government completed a technical assessment o f the railways, including
investmentneeds and options for restructuring, andthe APR reports on investmentprograms
andpilots alreadyunder discussion. As next steps, staffs recommendpreparing amarket
demand analysis for rail transport and exploring private sector participation inrailway
operations. Inmotor transport, the APR reports that administrative transit procedures have
been simplified, including through the abolition o fthe roadtax and the reduction inthe
number o fpermits. However, the revisedregulations should ensure the sustainability and
safety inmotor transport. On air traffic, progress has been made inliberalizing airport

                                               6


management; Tbilisi and Batumi airports have undergone reconstruction and are runby
private management. Future reforms should focus on the civil aviation licensing law and on
how Air Traffic Control, bothregionally and at the airports, i s organized, priced and financed.
Onmaritime transport, progress has beenmade ininvolvingthe private sector through
concession contracts for the management o fBatumi andPoti ports.

18.     In the roadsector, significant increasesinspendingneedto be accompaniedby
improvedroadmanagementcapacity, andthe developmentof multi-yearinvestment
and maintenanceplans.The AF'R reports on the significant improvement inthe conditions
o froads andbridges as a result o f increased financing. However, priorities for future spending
need to be determinedon the basis o f robust technical and economic criteria within a long
term vision, and a plan for buildinglocal governments' capacity to maintain local roads
should be developed prior to any hrther decentralization o f road management.

19.     The deregulationof the agriculturalsector shouldbesupplementedby a licensing
and inspectionprocessthat meetsinternationalnormsandWTO requirementswhile
continuingto providea safe environmentfor consumers.The APR reports onprogress
made on recent legal andinstitutional reforms to deregulate the agricultural sector while
strengthening food safety measures. Implementation o f the regulatory framework will require
retraining o f government monitoring andregulatory staff and effective engagement o fprivate
sector service providers, while agri-business management and the broader community will
require training inmodern sanitary andphytosanitary protection, food safety, and quality
management. Furtherwork is also needed on the imgation and drainage sub-sector reform
strategy. The APR also reports on efforts to encourage the development o f rural credit unions
and to strengthen the fimctioning o f rural financing, which the staffs fully support.

20.     The APR describesthe progressin environmentalprotectionbut provideslimited
informationon monitoringindicators.Staffs welcome the establishment o f a governmental
commission, aimed at a stronger coordination across public entities inimplementing the
strategy for sustainable development. Staffs commend the government for developing solid
links betweenpriorities, budget allocations and outcomes inthe sectoral budget paper for the
MTEFin2005 and encourage the ministryto strengthen reportingo foutcome indicators.
While Georgia's policy and institutional framework for environmental protection compares
well with its peers, implementation and enforcement should be strengthened.

                           VI.     Transparency andAccountability

21.     Georgia's impressiveprogressinfightingcorruptionshouldbe turnedinto
lastinginstitutionalchanges.The APR does not fully report on the wide range o fbold
actions taken by the authorities to curb comption and improve the business climate, including
notably the prosecution o fhigh-profile former officials suspected o f corruption, andthe
retrenchment inthe civil service accompanied by a rise inremunerations. The latter has
resulted invisible improvements ingovernance, including a sharp reduction inthe extortion
o f bribesby the traffic police. The APR does report on various tax and customs reforms
including the approval o f a new tax code that significantly reduced the numbero f taxes, the
reorganization andre-staffing o f the tax and customs offices, andthe adoption o f a new law

                                                    7



on financial amnesty which havebeen effective inlimitingcorruption. The EBRD-World
BankBusiness Environment andEconomic Performance Survey o f2005 shows Georgiahad
the largest improvement incurbing corruption in2002-2005 among 27 countries inEurope
and Central Asia.' Staffs recommendthat the next steps include a focus on implementinglong
lasting institutional changes and on improving the functioning o fthe judiciary.

22.     Similarlythere hasbeensubstantialprogressinimprovingthe businessclimate.
The APR reports that, inaddition to adopting a new tax code, the regulatory and
administrative framework for businesses has beengreatly simplifiedandmodernizedinthe
areas o f standardization, metrology, accreditation, and certification. The minimumcapital
requirement for limitedliability companies has beenreduced from 2,000 to 200 Lari. In
addition, the new Law on Customs Tariffs, which became effective on September 1, reduced
the number o ftariff rates from 16 to 3 andhas avery low average weighted tariffrate o f
1.5 percent. Georgia recently adopted a new Labor Code, which i s one o f the most liberal in
Europe and Central Asia. According to the World Bank's Doing Business 2007 indicators,
these measures place Georgia as the number one reformer inthe world. The staffs agree with
the authorities that, to realize the benefit o fthese reforms, the next steps should focus on
implementation.

23.     While the increaseinfinancialintermediationstimulates economicgrowth, the
quality of commercialbanks' lendingportfolioneedsto be closely monitored.The APR
records rapid development o f the bankingsector. Credit to the private sector increased by
around 80 percent in2005, a pace that continuedinthe first half o f 2006. Staffs note that
these developments are not without risks and underline the urgency of implementingthe
NBG's structuralreform agenda, inparticular (i)        upgrading banking supervisory policy; (ii)
strengthening implementation ofBase1Core Principles, particularly for the Fit andProper
Criteria for bank administrators and large shareholders; (iii)   strengthening bankingsector
transparency; and (iv) continuing to close or merge commercial banks that do not comply
with prudentialregulations.

24.     While theAPR highlightsprogressinprivatization,more detailedinformation
would havebeenusefulon the transparency and fairness ofthe process.More extensive
advertising could have made the privatization more transparent. Staffs urge the authorities to
manage andplancarefully the use o f privatization receipts. The government should continue
to use part o f the proceeds to strengthen the weak international reserve position, while some
money could be invested for capital projects whose selection shouldbe guided by a
transparent public investment plan.



                  VII. PARTICIPATION, COORDINATION, AND MONITORING

25.     While the APR benefitedfrom consultationswith civil society, a moresystematic
approachwould havebeendesirable.The authorities camed out extensive consultations in


 See Anticorruption in Transition 3,2006, the World Bank.

                                               8



several areas including customs reform, reforms ineducation and decentralization. The
authorities are encouraged to adopt a more systematic approach toward such consultations.

26.     The poverty reductionstrategy hasbeen an importantvehicle for donor
coordination.The government consults regularlywith donors, bothbilaterally andinthe
context o f the Donors Framework Group, which has been established in support o fthe
preparation and monitoring o f the PRSP. However, staffs note that there i s scope for further
improving donor coordination.

27.     Monitoringand reportingof the results of the implementationof the PRSPcan
be strengthened.As mentioned above, the authorities made progress inadopting amodem
methodology for measurement o f poverty. Monitoring o f macroeconomic goals will be
facilitated by the decision to transfer the mainresponsibility for balance o f payments statistics
to the NBG. The credibility o f the Georgian Statistics Department would be strengthenedifit
became an independent technical body. The authorities are also encouraged to accelerate their
efforts to develop perfonname indicators inthe context o f the MTEF andto report regularly
to the public about the performance.



                                       VIII. CONCLUSION

28.     In sum, the implementationof Georgia'spoverty reductionstrategy over the past
18 monthshas proceededwell with impressiveachievementsin curbingcorruption,
improvingthe businessclimate,and continuedimprovementinpublic finances. Inthe
coming years, the challenge is to maintainreformmomentum and to translate recent
achievements into lasting institutional change. Particular emphasis should be givento the
following areas:

        Enhancing macroeconomic management: Conflicts between exchange rate andprice
         stability should be resolvedby a clear focus on inflation, limitingthe NBG's foreign
         exchange interventions to smoothing short-term fluctuations. Improvements inthe
        business climate should attract more foreign investment over the medium term and
         helpreduce external vulnerabilities. Inthe interim,prudent fiscal policies shouldlimit
        pressures on international reserves andkeep external debt on a declining path.

e       Implementing the new legislativeframework: Georgia i s inthe midst o f implementing
         major reforms inmany areas. To filly realize the benefits o fthese reforms, the new
         legislation needs to be implemented effectively. Developing implementation capacity
         at different levels o f government and across different public sector areas will require a
         more systematic approach to buildingan efficient and accountable public
         administration.

        Improving the effectiveness ofpublic expenditure policies: The MTEFneeds to be
         hrther developed and linkedmore closely with the Basic Data andDirections, the
         PRSP, andthe annual budget and supplements. With public consumption growing

                                             9



   rapidly thanks to strong tax collections, improving efficiency and effectiveness inthe
   use o fpublic resources has become a priority. This will requirestrengthening technical
    skills for the analysis o f public investment projects and developing comprehensive
   performance indicators for public spending.

0  Enhancing the efficiency of infrastructure spending: Inmeetinginfrastructure needs,
   priority should be determined on the basis o frobust technical and economic criteria
   within a long-term vision.


0  Supplementingpro-growthpolicies with an effective social safety net: This will require
    reforms to address the fragmentation o f the system and to enhance the targeting to
    ensure that resources reach those that need them the most.


0  Broadening improvements in governance byjudicial reform: Growth and investment
    requirestrengthening governance which will entailrestructuringthe legal andjudicial
    system, ensuringits professional competency, and strengthening its independence.

0  Fosteringparticipation of civil society in all dimensions of the reform strategy.

1. Preface

A Progress Report on Economic Development and Poverty ReductionProgram
(EDPRP) was discussed and adopted at the Government Meetingon February 23,
2005. The Report reflected implementation o f reforms by new Government o f
Georgia in2004 andplannedreforms for a forthcoming mediumterm o f 2005-2007.
This Report i s based on the abovementioned document and illustrates progress o f
2005 EDPRP reforms. It also highlights the status o f particular measures which were
intended for rapidand sustainable economic development inthe country through
further fine-tuning o f administrative mechanisms, increase o f transparency,
improvement o f business-climate, and liberalization of economy.
At the same time, this Report comprises the plano fmeasures to be implemented ina
forthcoming medium-termperiod. The referredplani s based on the "basic data and
directions document for 2007-2010" which was preparedby the Government o f
Georgia. This latter document represents a link with the medium-term expenditure
framework initiated by the Government in2004. Thus, it provides for an expediency
o f plannedmeasures through the link with the state budget.
The 2005 EDPRP Report was prepared incollaboration with ministries, state bodies
and various agencies. Besides, it shall be pointed out that duringthematic
seminars/workshops that took place inOctober last year, main trends o f the Report
where discussed together with representatives from the ministries, NGO's and
international organizations.

2.       MainTrends of Economic Development

Economic processes in2005 were developing positively that resulted inacceleration
o f economic growth rate inthe country. According to the State Department o f
Statistics, GDP in2005 prices amounted to GEL 11,591.9 million(USD 6,400.5
million) which, inreal terms, i s 9.3 percent higher than 2004 comparable
performance. The 2005 growth rate was also 2.9 percent higher than the average
growthrate in2000-2005. A per-capita GDP amounted to GEL 2,563.7 (USD
1,415.6). Consideration shall be given to the fact that highgrowth rates o fprevious
years were mainly attributed to investment injections from oil and gas pipeline
construction and implementation o f other large international projects inthe country
with consequent increase o f aggregate income, while growth in2005 i s achieved
mainly by expanding general economic activities.
I t shall be notedthat in2005 higheconomic growthrate was observed in such sectors
as financial intermediation (52.2 percent), communication (29.5 percent), construction
(22,3 percent) agriculture, hunting, forestry and fishery (12.0 percent), industry (9.5
percent), transport and auxiliary transport services (5.7 percent), hotels and
restaurants (5.7 percent), etc.
Financial intermediation still remains one o f the main factors o f economic growth,
where the increase vis-a-vis 2004 was 52.2 percent. It i s o f a particular interest, that
bank loans to the private sector have increased by 80 percent, while the average
lendingrates o f commercial banks have decreasedby 10 percentage points.
Commercial banks have traditionally been financing 3 sectors o f the economy: trade
(38.3 percent total lending), industry (25.5 percent) and construction (11.6percent).

                                              4


As a result, construction sector and the processing industryin2005 have grown,
respectively, by 22 percent and 14.3 percent. Growth inthese sectors was largely due
to the bank loans.
Vis-a-vis the previous years, in2005, the consolidated budget revenues o f the
country, including grants, have increased by 42.7 percent, out o f which tax revenues
have increasedby 33.1 and non-tax revenues by 17.3 percent. Foreigngrants have
decreasedby 16.0percent. Due to progressive privatization activities inthe country,
the consolidate budgethas collectedGEL419.4 million through privatization, which
i s 5.8 times higher than the previous year's performance.
In2005, due to successful fiscal andmonetary policies, increase ofCPIwas as low as
6.2 percent. Compare: the twelve month inflationin2004 was 7.5 percent, while in
2003 it was 7.0 percent.
One o f the most notable characteristics of the country's social and economic
tendencies i s the reduction o f the poverty level starting from 2006. While there was a
slight increase inpoverty in2005, the downward trendwas observedinquarter 1,
2006.
According to the official statistics, inQ1, 2006 poverty level inGeorgia comprised
33.6 percent, that i s 6.1 percentage point lower than the respective indicator for Q1,
2005 (39.7 percent). The poverty indicators reduced inthe urban as well as inthe
rural areas.
In2005 the FDIwas diversified and its structure was improved. A 10percent
decrease was recorded on FDI's inthe country and net inflows amounted to USD
449.8 million. However, it shall be noted hereby, that total investments in2004 (USD
499.1 million) included a 72 percent share o f BritishPetroleum, while in2005, BP
share has amountedto only 60 percent. The volume o f other investments increased by
USD44.5 million (i.e. by 32 percent comparedto the last year). In2006 we anticipate
sharp increase inFDI, so that the FDIwill comprise USD 1.160 million. This forecast
i s based on the realistic assumptions. Inparticular, in2006 the USD 195 million
investment i s expected from BP, USD 65 million for the airport construction, USD
579 millionfrom privatization (including USD 90 millionfrom the sales o f Georgian
United Telecom, USD 92 millionfrom Batumi Port, USD 317 million from energy
enterprises, USD 30 million from sales o f tourism enterprises and USD 50 million
from privatization other assets); USD 90 million from Blumpin-Limited-new
cellular connection operator (includingUSD 40 millionfor a license and USD 50
million for capital investment), USD 100 million o f Kazakhinvestments, USD 45
million for Kulevi terminal construction, USD 20 million o f other unidentified
investments and USD40 million o f reinvestment.
According to data o f integrated studies o f labor and households, unemployment rate
in2005 increasedby 1.2percentagepoints andreached 13.8percent, basedon strict
ILO criteria.
Georgia's foreign trade turnover in2005 amounted to USD 3,357.7 millionthat i s
34.6 percent higher than the 2004 level; Exports were USD 866.7 million(34.0
percent higher), and imports -USD2,490.9 million (34.8 percent higher).
Reforms and initiatives duringthe period have provided for positive results which
were acknowledged ininternational studies. Inthe 2005 IFC report on "Doing
Business 2006" awarded Georgia a second place out o f 12 most reformer countries for
improvingthe business climate. According to the Heritage Foundation's Economic

                                              5


FreedomIndex 2006 report, Georgia has advanced by 28 steps forward vis-a-vis the
2005 and moved from "mainly non-free" position to the 68`h place o f the "mainly
free" category.

3.      Poverty Level

Before concentrating onpoverty indicators itself, we shall point out those common
principles, which lay a foundation for definingpoverty level, as well as those
modifications that an applicable methodology has undergone inGeorgia. We will
discuss some modifications below, which have had significant impact on defining the
poverty indicators.
Basically, there are two components necessary to calculate poverty indicators -a
poverty line and a so called "welfare indicator". The welfare indicator i s compared to
the poverty line to define how "poor" the entity o f study is (usually a householdor an
individual). Ifthe entity i s poor, the welfare indicator also demonstrates how poor it
is: ifthe indicator i s below the poverty line, then the household or the individual will
be considered as poor. A welfare indicator could be linkedto income, expenses, or
other features of an entity under analysis.
Georgia uses a consumption expenditures o f one equivalent adult o f a household
(incorporating the aggregate demand effect) to calculate the poverty level. Such
indicator i s awarded to a household, as well as to each o f its member. For calculating
official poverty line, Georgian uses official indicator - so called "living minimum".
Three indicators o f poverty are beingemployed:
1. Poverty level: equals to the percentage o f entities below the poverty line, out o f
total number o f entities.
2. Poverty depth: Inaddition to the quantity o f poor, it considers how remote the
welfare indicator o f an entity is from the poverty line, on average.
3. Poverty Severity: i s an indicator, which awards more attentionto distant (poorer)
entities, when considering the remoteness o f poor from the poverty line: reduction in
this indicator suggests that life ofthe poorest has improved, or vise-versa.
Adjustmentswere made to the methodologies of determining both, officialpoverty
line and the welfare indicator. Before going into discussions on those changes
individually, one important modificationo f general approach shall be emphasized:
The previouspoverty indicator analyzed households, while the new ones analyze
individuals. For "poverty level" this means following: originally, the poverty level
was defined as a share of poor households in total number of households, while
the poverty levelwith the new approach is defined as a share of poor population
intotal number of population. It shall be notedthat such, rather accurate inessence
and internationally approved approach, slightly increases the overall poverty level.
The computation o f the officialpoverty line, i.e. the living minimum,i s governed by
the law of Georgia on "Rule of calculating the living minimum". It i s based on a
minimumconsumptionbasket for a healthy manestablished by the Ministryo fLabor,
Healthand Social Protectiono f Georgia. The previous methodology usedthe
minimumconsumptionbasket, adoptedin 1992.This basket was considering
consumption o f 2,500 kcal per day and was based on nutritionnorms o f the Soviet
period, which was completely non-adequate vis-a-vis the actual consumption o f
population.

                                              6


Changes inthe methodology o f calculating the officialpoverty line refer to two
aspects:
1. Minimumconsumptionbasket: The decree # 111/N o f the Minister o f Labor,
Health and Social Protectionfrom May 8, 2003, established a new recommended
consumptionbasket. The new basket i s based on consumption o f 2,300 kcal per day
and its composition i s more adequate to reflect the actual consumption o f population.
Such a change made it necessary to adjust official livingminimumin2004 and 2005.
Dueto the new composition ofthe basket, official poverty line has decreasedto some
extent.
2. "A bargainingeffect": cost of minimumconsumption basket inold methodology
was evaluated by the information obtained through a statistical survey o f prices. Due
to nature o f a price survey, which i s oriented at calculating the consumer price
indices, it doesn't consider a possibility to have prices discountedby bargaining,
whichplays significant role inthe Georgian reality. Due to above mentioned, and
considering the results o f household surveys, the households, on average, pay 13.5
percent less inproducts than it is recorded inthe statistical survey on prices. Taking
the bargaining effect into account, the cost o f consumptionbasket i s beingdiscounted
by 13.5 percent.
Changes in calculation of welfare indicator attend to two points:
1.In-kind (non-cash) consumptiono f households under the old methodology was
evaluated inso-called producer prices therefore the household survey prices for such
products was reducedby 20percent inorder to account for the price raise when these
products enter the market. In-kindconsumption i s mostly observed inrural
households, where consumption i s dominatedby own products and services. Such an
adjustment o f non-cash consumption i s necessary for estimating the national accounts;
however it gives a non-adequate picture when calculating the poverty indicators
because it artificiallyreduces the welfare level o f households where non-cash
consumption constitutes a certain share o f total consumption. New methodology has
abolished the 20percent discount. Such an approach has, on average, increased the
level o f welfare indicator and consequently decreasedthe poverty indicators.
2. Aggregate consumption,or so-called "scale" effect. For calculating the
consumption of one equivalent adult by considering the aggregate consumption effect,
total consumption o f a household i s dividednot by Nbut by = Ne,where N
represents number of equivalent adults ina household, and e i s the aggregate
consumption effect factor.
For example, let's assume that this factor equals 0.6; household consists of 5 members
and composition o f such household equals to 3.7 equivalent adults. To calculate
number ofequivalent adults by considering the aggregate consumption effect, 3.7
shall be brought inpower o f 0.6 and the product i s 2.19. Aggregate consumption
effect factor under the old methodology was established at 0.6, which was overstating
the aggregate consumption effect andwas artificiallyrising welfare level of large
families. By the new recommended methodology this factor i s set at 0.8. By applying
new methodology into the above example, number o f equivalent adults will become
2.85. Application o f new aggregate consumption effect factor significantly decreases
welfare indicator (inthe example it i s reducedby 1.3 times, i.e. 2.85/2.19) and
increases the poverty indicators, however it reflects the reality far better.

Based on the recalculations we can conclude that the poverty levelhas an increasing
tendency from 2004 to 2005. This indicator i s rising by 3.7 percentage points inthe
city and by 4.6 percentage points inrural community.
As it was noted above, poverty level decreasedinQ1,2006, while there was increase
inpoverty levelin2005.
InQ1, 2006 thepoverty levelinGeorgia was 33.6 percent, i.e. 6.1 percentage point
less than inQ1,2005 (39.7 percent). The poverty level decreased inurban as well as
inruralareas.
While 41.1 percent o f the ruralpopulation inGeorgia was below the poverty level in
2005, only 31.2 percent of the ruralpopulationi s poor in2005. Among the urban
population, the poverty level decreased from 38.1 percent inQ1,2005 to 36.0 percent
inQ1,2006.
                                                                                   Table 2.

To describe the level o f living, it i s interesting to observe and analyze poverty levelof
families with different number o f members. In2004 the poorest families consisted o f
6 or more members. More than 42.9 percent o f such families live below the poverty
line. Welfare level is highinthe families with single member, with only 26 percent o f
such families being poor. In2005, the families with 6 or more members were the

                                                      8


      poorest. 47.9 percent of such families live below the poverty line. The welfare level is
      high inthe families with two members, with only 28.8 percent o f such families being
      poor.

       For evaluating the level of living, it i s interesting to determine poverty level in
       households according to number o f children below 15. Based on such indicator, the
       poorest families are those with 3 or more children. 66.2 percent o f such families lived
       below the poverty line in2004, and 60.1 percent livedbelow the poverty line in2005.

          One of the main determinants of poverty is unemployment. The unemployment level
          in2005 increasedby 1.2 percentagepoints andreached 13.8 percentbyILO criteria.
          The positive tendency o f registering new taxpayers at the tax department was
          observed lately. Number of the newly registeredtaxpayers increasedby 76.1 percent
          compared to 2004. That means that a number of new jobs were created inthe country.

4.      MainEconomic and StructuralReforms

Within the economic and structuralreforms implementedby the Georgian
government, the most noteworthy measures have been: improvement o f
administration and combating corruption, reform o f business-licensing sector, reform
o f technical regulation system, simplification o f business legislation and the reform
towards trade liberalization. The reform o f the public register i s also an important
measure, which aims to create the flexible and transparent registration system inthe
country, simplify the procedures and offer the better service.

4.1.    Improvement of administrationand combatingcorruption

Purposeful and efficient implementation o f public administration reform represents an
important prerequisite for proper functioning o f the administration sphere ingeneral.
Therefore, public administration reform and combating the corruption were set as one
o f the mainbasics for social-economic development o f the country.
According to the implementation plan o f public administration reform, as outlined in
the EDPRP progress report o f last year, the following measures are inplace:
To implement unified policy inpublic servants' remuneration and improve the
remuneration system (2005-2006)' with the view o f establishing the unified state
policy inrespect to remuneration o f public servants, the PSB and MOF are working
on the remunerationrates for different service grades inpublic sector. At the same
time, during2006 it i s plannedto update the draft presidential decree on "registry o f
public service positions". The decree will unify the names o f subdivisions and
positions within the public sector and organize the grading system.
 Toprepare the draft long-term program on administration andpublic service
reform (2005-2006)' the "public sector management reform project" hasbeen
implemented inthe PSB under the grant from Japanese Government. The project was
completed inthe first half o f 2006. The following measures were activities were
implemented interms o f the abovementionedproject:

       0  Preparation o f the plan for public administration reform;

       0  Evaluation o f the number o f employees inthe public sector; analysis o f the
          remuneration system and current status o f training and capacity buildingfor
          public servants

       0  Preparation o f respective recommendations after reviewingbudgetary
          expenditures;

       0  Monitoringthe publicityand progress o f the reforms.
As a result, a long-term program o f Georgia's public service reform and the plan o f its
implementation is to be prepared during2006.


Toprepare and implement the Human ResourceManagement information system
(HRM) concept (2005-2006)' the PSB has beenworking on the preparation of
implementation program for the Human Resource Management InformationSystems
(HRMIS) since September 2005. Inparticular, existing conditions ofpublic services
sector inthe country was studied and comparable operating systems o f developed

                                              12


countries were analyzed. The report was prepared which describes indetails main
functions of HR MIS and gives recommendations on centralization or decentralization
o f certain function. The main function o f the system will be administration o f the
employment records, administration o f remuneration and evaluation system for
accomplished tasks; selectiodrecruitment; training and promotion.
Preparationo f the project i s inprogress. This will introduce trainings for the
respective specialists, who will administer the HRMIS system.
Toprepare thepublic servants' ethics code (2006)' preparatory works are inprogress
inthe PSB together withNGO's. The public service code, preparedbythe PSBwill
include the ethics code as a separate chapter.
At the same time, it is significant to underline the measures oriented at combating
corruption. Besidesthe concrete actions implementedby appropriate agencies, it shall
be notedthat Georgia's State Security Councilprepared "Georgia's National
Anticorruption Strategy", which was approvedby the President o f Georgia on 24 June
2005 by decree # 550. Goals of the strategy include establishment o f the effective
state management system, inspiration o f legal and social reaction against corruption
and prevention o f corruption.
Based on the strategy, the Government has adopted the "Operational Plan o f
Georgia's National Anticorruption Strategy" (Approved by the Governmental
resolution # 377 from September 12,2005). This plan i s being implemented in2005-
2006. It consists of three parts ((a) scaling up anticorruption measures, (b)
strengtheninganti-corruption mechanisms and (c) internationalresponsibilities).
Implementation of the operational plan will significantly reduce possibilities o f
corruption inthe public sector and increase transparency o f public service.
The strategy and the operational planwill be updated annually. Report on its
implementation will be presented to the President o f Georgia annually and will be
made public.The report will reflect implementation progress o f the operation plan.
Annual conference will be organized with the view o f discussing and updating the
plan. Suchpublicity will ensure political, state and social support to the Plan.
Interms ofthe administrationreform, the proper design ofregional policy hasa
leading role and importance. Effective reform has started inthe field o f administrative
system and territorial arrangement, which implies decentralization and de-
concentration o f management, distribution o f management authorities and resources
between national, regional and local authorities, strengthening and fine-tuningo f self-
governance system.
The "European treaty on self-governance" has been ratified. Basedon the main
provisions o f the treaty, we prepared key legislative acts with regards to regional
policy. Inparticular, organic law o f Georgia on "local self-governance" was adopted
(its basic stipulations will enter into force in2006 after local elections). It lays out the
legal ground for implementation o f legal, economic and financial functions o f a self-
governance, for creation and functions o f self-governance and for interaction with the
state bodies (under the principle o f division o f responsibilities).
Also, law on "property o f local self-governance units" was adopted, which determines
newprinciplesofproperty rights, property categories and property acquisition rights
o f self governing units.Besides, inrespect to property-related activities several other
legal acts were adopted which regulate land rights, relations and authorities o f local
and state governance.

                                              13


Draft law on "the budget o f self governing unit" i s currently inthe completion phase,
which, inline with the organic law and other legislative or normative acts, legally
regulates budget formation and spending aspects o f the self governing units.
As soon as the mentionedlaws enter into force, they will create a legal basis for
resolution o f financial and property issues o f the regions. This, on its side, is o f utmost
importance for realization o f the main function o f the self-governances    - to respond to
local needs by means o f own resources and abilities.
To improve effectiveness o fbudgetary processes, it is necessary to expand the
revenue basis for local governments and introduce principles of program budgeting.
This implies consideration o f social-economic development programs o f the
administrative-territorial unitsduringthe process o f formation o f local budgets. Such
programs, however, shall be based on realjudgments and evaluation o f locally
available resources andpotential.
Duringimplementation ofthe reform not only legalrelationships between central and
territorial unitswill be fine-tuned, but institutional, staffing, state supervision and
other issues too. These shall provide for complete realization o f the common interests'
principle for state and local authorities.

4.2.    Improvementof businessclimate and attractingprivate capital

   Reformof the licensingsystem
The new law o f Georgia on "licensing and permits" determines main principles of
licensing and permits. Inparticular:
            The list o fthe activities requiringlicensing or permits has beenreduced
            significantly. About 900 types of licenses/permits have decreased to 150.
            A number oflicenses andpermitshave beenabolished, since they were
            ineffective inregulating business activities and represented a source o f
            cormption.
            Procedure o f licensing and issuance of permits was fine-tuned and
            simplified.Inparticular, "one window principle" was adopted, were any
            additional licensing and certification requirements from other
            administrative agencies, can be handledby the licensing agency himself
            through the administrative order.
            The principle "silence means content" was adopted. A license (permit) i s
            considered to be automatically awarded ifthe granting agency does not
            refuse license and respectively inform the license-seeker inwriting.
            Use of natural resources i s regulated by an auctionprinciple. Besides,
            owner o f such license may partly or completely alienate or transfer the
            exploitation right to a thirdparty. Suchmeasures support the establishment
            o f long-term economic interests inexploitation o f resources and provide the
            prerequisites for stable exploitation o f natural resources.
Implemented changes significantly decreaseadministrative barriers inthe licensing
sphere and simplify licensing procedures. This represents an important factor for
improvement o f business-climate.

     Reform of technical regulation system

Major importance for business development and sustained economic growth is
attributed to the reform o f technical regulation system. According to the old system,
technical regulation inthe country was performed by "SakStandard." Itwas
performing functions o f metrology, standardization, accreditation, certification and
market supervision. This system could not ensure consumer safety and it was creating
additional barriers for business activity. Accordingly, the system was impeding the
economic and trade liberalization process, was hinderingintegration o f Georgia into
world-wide economic space and was obstructing export expansion.
Purposes o f technical regulation system reform inthe country are the following:
      --  Elimination o f technical barriers to international trade;
          increase o f possibilities for penetration o f Georgian products into foreign
      --  markets;
          transformation from mandatory standards towards optional (voluntary);
          Adequate protection of consumer interests, elimination of the old corruptive
           system andprovisiono ftransparency.
Withinthe framework of the reform, a legislative package has been prepared. The
new legislation will comply withcontemporary requirements and take into account
the implementation of international approach-based and experience-based technical
regulation system. Inparticular the following laws have been adopted in2005:
      --- On amendments and supplementsto the law on "Standardization";
          On amendments and supplements to the law on "unified measurements";
          On amendments and supplements to the law on "certification o fproducts
          and services".
Purpose o f amendments and supplements to the Law o f Georgia on "certification o f
products and services" i s to provide adequate consumer security and life and health
protection, which represents the most important function o f the State. Security o f
products at marketplaces is major direction inthis regard. The law will regulate
general issues o f security o fproducts which are presented at the Georgianmarket.
New law i s infull compliance with the requirements o f WTO and EUwith respect to
authenticity assessment and certification. These principles are based on the suggestion
that state regulating role inthe system shall be limitedto establishing such general
technical requirementsthat provide for consumer safety and life and health protection
as well as for environmentalprotection. Simultaneously, the stipulations o f the treaty
on "technical barriers to trade" that restricts imposing technical barriers to trade shall
be met.
Interms ofaccreditation, itaims atrecognition ofcompetency ofthose organizations
which performauthenticity assessmentregardless o ftheir organizational-legal form or
ownership status.
The National Agency for Accreditation, a legal entity o f public law was created
according to the legislation o f Georgia. The National Agency fro Accreditation united
the accreditationfunction that was disseminated among the line ministries. Its activity
will bebased on internationaland Europeanstandards which represent main
precondition for confidence-building towards authenticity assessment and
certification reliability. This will also contribute to increase o f competitiveness o f
locallyproduced commodities for internal and foreign markets. At this stage the

                                              15


"Accreditation Center" has already been established which works on preparation o f
technical regulations for authenticity assessmentlabs and calibration labs as well as
on rules and procedures o f authenticity assessment accreditation.
Law of Georgia on amendments and supplements to the law on "unified
measurements," sets out the legal basis for mandatory provisiono f unified
measurements inGeorgia. It also provides for creation and storage o f state etalons and
for the procedures o f approval, certification and trading with measurement means.
Purpose o f the law i s to protect the rights and legal interests o f the residents, legal
entities and the Georgian economy from unreliable measurements insuch daily social
interface areas as trade, health-care, environmental protection, production and
consumption safety, etc., prevention o f supply o f irregular measurement means to
consumer markets with consideration o f priority o f the measurement means for safety
o f technological processes, services, competitiveness and quality assurance.
Law of Georgia on amendments and supplements to the law on
"Standardization" sets out the proceduresfor conversion from mandatory standards
to voluntary standards. Currently, major priority o f the state is to eliminate
discrepancies inthe existing system and to establish contemporary market-based and
effective system. The law maintains and promotes all innovations which were already
introduced to the existing law. Besides, it inclusively establishes the voluntary
principle for standards. The law considers establishing the unifiednational agency for
standardizationand metrology on the bases o f old "SakStandard", which will fully
correspondto Europeananalogous structures. Accordingly, the agency will withdraw
from such functions as accreditation, certification or market supervision. Collection of
those functions within one state body was a basis for conflict o f interest and
corruption.
Drawn from abovementioned laws, legal entities o f public law - "National agency for
standardization, technical regulation and metrology" and "National center for
accreditation" were established. As for the market supervision, new effective system
shall be established for market supervision and control, were supervision and control
functions shall be strictly separated across the implementing agencies. By this,
overlapping occurrences will be eliminated and activity o f controlling bodies will
become more transparent.
Governmental decree on "approval o f operational plan for realization o f measures
under the laws whichregulate standardization, metrology and accreditation spheres''
has beenpreparedwhich determines the measures to be implementedinthe frame o f
the reform and their deadlines.
By a correspondingnormative act, only those parts ofthe EUand OECDtechnical
regulations were accepted, which refer to the parameters of products' safety and was
determined their operationalrule. At the same time, inthe transition phase, those
documents o f technical regulation field which are currently inforce accordingto CIS
international agreements (GOST, construction norms and rules, sanitary rules and
norms, etc.,) are fully inforce.


     Entrepreneurial Legislation

InJune 2005 the Parliamentadopted amendments to the entrepreneurial legislation.
The amendments are oriented at simplification o f set-up procedures for businesses

                                              16


and improvement o f legal means o f relationships between the partners. Minimum
charter capital for LLC's has decreased from GEL 2,000 to 200. This shall facilitate
the process o f creation o f new companies. It i s significant that today, it i s a timely
measure to promote legalization o f many small businesses, which were beyond the
official business register previously. Charter capital (except for minimumcharter
capital) can be now supplemented by non-cashassets. It i s also possible to build
charter capital inother currencies, although inthe company' books it will be recorded
innationalcurrency. When establishinga company, the law requireshaving only half
o f the charter capital built-up,while the other halfcan be added later.
Underthe old legislation, share ofpartners incompany profit was strictly limitedto a
corresponding share inthe charter capital, which was not always reflecting the reality.
Through the amendments it i s now possible to share profit betweenthe partners under
a separate contract.
Undernewlegislation, responsibleentity for registeringthe companies i s State Tax
Department which keeps the business register as well. Time required for registration
o f companies was significantly reduced. Ifall documents are submitted fully, time for
the registrationof an individualcompany is 1day, and for registration of all other
types o f legal entities - three days.


     Trade LiberalizationReform

The system o f Customs Taxes currently i s characterized by relatively highrates (0
percent, 4 percent, 5 percent, 6 percent, 7 percent, 8 percent, 10percent, 12 percent,
14 percent, 15 percent, 16 percent, 17 percent, 18 percent, 20 percent, 25 percent, 30
percent) and numerous bands (16 bands); It i s not competitive inthe region and
therefore is not supporting attractiveness o fbusiness climate inthe country. High
customs taxes increase prices on products o f the common consumption and imposes a
heavily burdenover the low-income population. Besides, the law on "customs tariffs
and taxes", which imposes 16 different rates, makes it difficult to properly carry out
customs procedures. Such a diversification o f tariffs creates more possibilities for
corruptive deals at the customs.
Considering the abovementioned, the Ministry o f Economic Development o f Georgia
has prepared a draft law "on Customs Tariffs" which i s intended to replace the
existing law "on Customs tariffs and taxes." It impliesfurther liberalization o f
Georgia's customs taxation system and synchronization with 2002 TARIC
harmonized system.
Following results will be achieved under the draft law:
      -    customs tariffs o f 14 percent, 15 percent, 16 percent, 17 percent, 18 percent,
      -    20 percent, 25 percent and 30 percentwill be reduced to 12 percent;
           customs tariffs o f 6 percent, 7 percent, 8 percent and 10percent will be
      ---- reducedto 5 percent;
           customs tariff o f 4 percent will be reduced to 0 percent;
           seasonal customs tariffs will be abolished;
           customs tariffs on agricultural raw material will be reduced to 0 percent;
           customs tariffs on non-agricultural products (goods from 25 to 97 groups o f
           foreign-economic activity nomenclature), excluding construction material

                                             17


          (goods from 25 to 68 groups o f foreign-economic activity nomenclature)

      -   will bereducedto 0 percent;
          goods originated innon-WTO member countries will be taxedat the same
          customs tariff level as identical goods originated inthe WTO member
          countries.

The purpose of adopting new law i s to improve investment climate and to protect
consumer rights via trade liberalization, inparticular:
          establish one o f the most simplifiedand competitive customs taxation
          system inthe region;
          draw interest o f investors and attract foreign capital by relatively cheap raw
          material and machinery;
          creation of equal market conditions for local and imported goods and
          improve consequently the competitive environment which will induce the
          localproduction to become more quality-oriented;
          reduce consumer prices on imported goods and import-based products and
          thus improve social-economic conditions for low-income consumers;
          simplify customs administration andpreventcorruption;
          expandtrade register coding system to eleven-digit 2002 unified customs
          codes for creation o f unifiedinter-state and international informational
          space.
The draft law o f Georgia "on customs tariffs" has already been submitted to the
Parliament for discussion.


    Reform of the PublicRegister

The Public Register development strategy centers on four main directions:
institutional, legislative, technological, and administrative. The public register is
administered by the national agency for public register, which i s a self-financed legal
entity o fpublic law, supervised by the Ministryo f Justice.

Institutional reform: the registration system is centralized and independent from the
local governments ina financial, functional and administrative sense. Thus any
chance o f the conflict o f interest inthe public administration i s excluded. The line was
drawn between the land management (rural and urbanplanning, definitiono f land
users, etc) and land administration (ownership rights). The regional services, creating
the additional unit o f state supervision were abolished. Technical registration offices
were abolished and all the information i s now centralized with the national agency.
NationalAgency also administers the register of the arrested property. Earlier the
chamber o f notaries was administering this register.

By unitingall the abovementionedfunctions, the National Agency o fPublic Register
offers the one-stop service. All property and ownership related informationcan be
obtained inthe same building.The centralization ensures safety o f the databases. The
NationalAgency o f the Public Register i s a self financing entity. All the users o f
informationneed to pay the service fee. Earlier the state registration fee would apply
to the similar services.

                                             18


All these changes were supported inthe amendments o f the respective legal
framework. The law o f Georgia on "The National Agency o f Public Register service
fees" provides all the information on the timeframe o f the services offered by the
agency. The law envisages the `fast service' options and thus, leaves no room for
corrupt deals. W e have presented to the parliament o f Georgia the draft law on
`registering the right on immovable assets'. At present the law on `registering the
right on movable assets" i s being drafted.

Administrative reform: The staff of the agency optimized and reduced from 2100to
610. The new members o f the staff were selected through the competitive
examinations. The agency has signed the memorandum with the Tbilisi State
University, where the latter agrees to send the outstanding students for the internship
at the agency. The average monthly salary increased from GEL 57 to GEL 452.

For the purposes o f delivering the improved service, the new concept o f "improved
registration service" was implemented inthe Agency. The new concept aims to
improve the security, transparency and service delivery by the agency. The premises
o f the agency were renovated to ensure delivery o f the service in more transparent and
comfortable manner.

One o f the important innovations include the physical and functional separation of the
front and back offices. This measure ensures that the citizens are not involved in the
registration process, and the person who i s responsible for the registration has the
descent working conditions. The innovated Agency offers legal consultations free o f
charge. Well places boards and arrows ensure that the citizens locate the needed
service easily.

Technological reform is an important innovation, which aims to create the united
database. The newly developed software i s being tested in Tbilisi registration service.
The program envisages simplification o f the registrationprocedures and replacement
o f the bureaucratic mechanism with the modern standards, where the steps inthe
registration process are reduced from 66 stages to 7 stages.

The territorial and central systems will be integrated and the united database will be
created for the country. This measure will enhance reliability o f the database, its
accessibility and publicity. The reliability o f the real estate related information will
facilitate to the development o f the real estate market.


5.      Macroeconomic Policy

5.1.     Monetary Policy

The National Bank o f Georgia's role inEDPRP implementation i s to maintain the
purchasing power o f national currency and provide price stability.
Exogenous supply factors (independent o f the monetary policy) have had considerable
impact on price dynamics during the accounting year. The twelve month inflation in
December 2005 was 6.2 percent. Yet, annual average inflationreached the higher-

                                             19


than-normal level of 8.2 percent (the annual average inflationin2005 excluding
tobacco and oil products was 5.4 percent).
                                                                                 Table 6.

        November     I         8.6                  4.1               7.9
        December     I         7.0                  7.5               6.2

Foreign exchange market was stable inGeorgia duringthe accounting period.
Supply-demando f U.S. dollars both at the Tbilisi Interbank Exchange and outside o f
it was not characterized by any significant disorder. The GEL exchange rate
fluctuations were minimal and the exchange rate was kept within the 1.785-1.840
range vs. the USD.
Foreign reserves o f NBGas o f 3lst    December 2005 have increased by USD 91.9
million(by 24 percent) vs. the 2004 respective value and amounted to USD 474.8
million.
The measures oriented at creation o f reliable and stable banking system are
noteworthy. At the end o f 2005 banking sector of the country was represented by 19
commercial banks two o f which are branches of Azerbaijani and Turkishbanks.
At the end o fthe year, total assets o fbanking sector have increased by GEL 851.4
million(by 50 percent) since the beginning o f year and amounted to GEL 2,548
million. Such growth was mainly attributed to increase o f deposits and borrowed

percent, and securities - 1 percent.
funds. Net loans represented 65 percent of total assets ofbanking sector; cash- 18


Loanportfolio o f commercial banks expanded significantly in2005. Ithas increased
by GEL 788.9 million(83.2 percent) and amounted to GEL 1.7 billion. Lending
activity o f the banks was concentrated onprivate sector, share o f which inthe loan
portfolio amounted to 97 percent. Together with the expansiono f loan portfolio,
banks have significantly promoted long-term lendingand consequently, share o f long-
term (over 1year) loans intotal lendinghas reached 65 percent.
During2005 total liabilities ofbanking sector increasedby 56 percent and amounted
to GEL 2,069 million. 74 percent o f total liabilities o fbanks are deposits, 22 percent -
borrowed funds, and 3 percent - other liabilities. Duringprevious years, share o f
deposits inthe structure o f liabilities was stable and it rangedinbetween 70-80
percent. Increase intotal liabilities was mainly causedby increase indeposits, which,
on its part, has increased by 57 percent and amounted to GEL 1,538 millionby the
end of2005. It i s noteworthy that 47 percent o fdeposits were individual deposits

                                                20


which increased by 46 percent. Such increase i s largely attributed to increase o f
confidence o f populationtowards the banks.
Majority o f deposits are still concentrated inforeign currency, although a decreasing
tendency can be observed. Inparticular, a dollarization coefficient has decreased
from 74.3 to 71.6 percent. The de-dollarization tendency i s a result o f positive
developments inthe fiscal sector o f the country, increase o f volume o f non-cash
transactions inbusiness activity due to measures that were implemented for reduction
o f a shadow economy and, most importantly - by appreciation o f the Lari exchange
rate. As a result, the de-dollarization inbank deposits was mostly reflected incurrent
deposits. Inparticular, duringthe accountingperiod, dollarization o f current deposits
reduced from 55 to 50 percent, dollarization o f time deposits reduced from 96 to 89
percent, which i s mainly caused by the fact that public still preferredhard currencies
as a store o f value, which is typical for transition economies.
During2005 charter capital ofbanking sector increased by 29 percent and amounted
to GEL 479 million. The mainreason for increase o f the charter capital is growth o f
profits o f the banks. Total net profit of the banks amounted to GEL 62 millionwhich
i s 2.2 times higher than the comparable figure of previous year.
87 percent o f total assets and 89 percent o f deposits o f the banking sector are
concentrated in6 largest banks. Inthe accountingperiod quantitative and qualitative
improvement inthe banking sector i s mainly attributed to large banks. The financial
health o f large banks has actually determinedoverall stability o f the banking sector.
In2005 activities continued for furtherimprovement ofnon-bank, deposit
organizations - credit unions. As a result, the respective indicators have improved
significantly.
NBGhas implementednumerousmeasures towards fine-tuning the foreign reserves'
management, o f which it adopted eight-index-based trend indicator for returns and
increased significantly maturity o f investment portfolio. Activities are ongoing for
incorporation o f long-term coupon-securities into the investmentportfolio and for
development o f securities trading at the secondary markets. With the view o f
diversification o f a part o f state securities, relationships were established with Central
Bank of Belgiumwhich shall act as mediumfor acquisition and storage o f Belgian
securities at primary securities market.
National Bank o f Georgia continued work on expansion o f the list o f participants at
the T-bills market, fine-tuningo f t-bills trading system, increase o f their maturity and
provision o f market instruments for discount rate decrease. The fiscal order
established in2004-2005 has affectedthe t-bills market. The processeswere reflected
inthe t-bills marketby arange ofpositive tendencies. A sharp declineinthe interest
rates i s of a particular importance. This was caused by increase o f confidence towards
the issuer and decline init the credit risk.
The NationalBank of Georgia will continue implementation of consistentand
prudent monetary and foreign exchange policy inthe mediumterm (2006-2008).
This means consistency ofmoney supply with the real rate ofeconomic growth and
with inflationtarget. Thus, money will be suppliedto the market only through non-
inflationary methods. This, inturn, will ensure the demonetization o f the economy in
the environment o fprice stability.
           Inview ofthe requirements ofthe StateProgram for Economic
           Development and Poverty Reduction, and for purposes o f ensuringthe

                                   21


 purchasingpower o f the national currency andprice stability, the main
 directions o f Georgia's monetary and exchange rate policies for 2006 shall
 be based onprojected annual inflationrate o f 5-6 percent. At the same time,
 taking into account the external influence on prices beyond the NBGcontrol,
 deviation from the projected inflation shall be possible
 The NationalBank shall ensure the supply o f money inline with the
 demand, inconsideration o f 7.5 percent real GDP growth, legalization o f
 shadow economy, expansion o f Lari usage area, significant foreign capital
 inflow due to large international projects and reduction o f dollarization rate
 o f the economy. The reserve money shall increase by 25-27 percent mainly
 by extending credit to the banking sector and accumulating the National
 Bank's international reserves.
 Taking into account the priority o f price stability, the monetization level
 shall increase. Broadmoney shall increase mainly through the improvement
 o f financial intermediation, includingintermediation usingnational
 currency.
 The net credit to the government shall not increase. By initiatives o f the
 government, the amendments to the organic law o f Georgia "on National
 Bank o f Georgia" will be adopted, which will prohibit the NBGto extend
 credit to the government. The government's debt to the NBGwill be
 securitized, which will develop the securities' market and the NBGwill
.acquire additional instruments for conducting monetary policy.
 The NBG shall create the portfolio o f governmental securities incase o f
 necessity, which shall be used inopen market operations (Repo) with
 commercial banks to control money supply. To regulate commercial banks'
 liquidity, overnight loans and deposits, inter-bank credit and deposit
 auctions shall be used. Swap operations with commercial banks shall
 commence ifneeded.
 Taking into account macroeconomic situation, the adjustments to the
 minimumreserve requirement shallbe exercised.
 The exchange rate policy shall be implemented under the floating exchange
 rate regime. To avoid severe short-term fluctuations o f the exchange rate and
 ensure stability on the foreign exchange market, two-sided foreign exchange
 interventions shall be exercised. Considering priority o f price stability the
 exchange rate policy shall ensure the dynamics of the real effective
 exchange rate such that facilitates maintenance of the country's
 competitiveness.
 The NBG shall implement the monetary policy so that volume o f the
 National Bank's international reserves amount to the equivalent o f at least
 2.5 months of import o f goods and services.
 For purposes o f further development o f the Georgianbanking system and
 improvement o f financial intermediation, the gradual increase o f minimum
 regulatory capital o f the commercial banks shall continue.
 To protect the depositors' rights, the preparationo f the legislative basis for
 deposit insurance system shall be completed. The preparatory works for
 creating the deposit insurance agency shall commence.

                                              22


           To improve o f the commercial bank's credit risk management systems and
           enhance credit culture inthe country, the legislative basis on credit
           information bureaus shall be prepared.
           To harmonize the Georgian legislationwith the EUlegislation, and to reflect
           Base1Core Principles o f Effective Banking Supervision, the NationalBank
           shall continue working on amendments to the legislation basis on Activities
           o f Commercial Banks.
           To improve the system o f storage and safe management o f valuables,
           meeting demand on cash and improving the commercial banks services in
           this area, activities on establishingthemodem cashcenter shall commence.
           Inthe medium-term (2006-2008) the majorattention will be awardedto
           ensuringtransparency o fbanking sector, its sustainable development and
           liquidityposition, increase of capitalization levelandpromotion of
           intermediation functions, also to encouragement o f favorable conditions for
           creation and development o fcompetitive financial markets.
For 2007-2008 it i s intended to maintain the average annual inflation inthe range of
5-6 percent; foreign reserves will gradually increase to 2.5 months o f imports o f
goods and services; broad money (M3) will expand'suchas, to support annual
increase of monetization coefficient by at least 0.5-1.O percentage point on average;
Lending to the Government through emissions will be limited; Foreignexchange
policy will be based on floating exchange rate regime; The NBGwill make two-sided
foreign exchange interventions which will support the increase o f foreign reserves on
the one hand and strengthening o f international competitiveness o f local production
on the other; development o f secondary market for securities and implementation of
new mechanism of state securities-based monetary regulation -the open market
operations, will be encouraged inpractice; consolidation o f banking sector will
continue by encouraging competition inthe sector and the rate o f minimumreserve
requirementswill be gradually adjusted.

5.2.     Fiscal Policy

5.2.1. Budgetary Reform
The budgetary reform impliesa core improvement o f budgetary measures. In
comparison to previous years, rationalization process o f budgetaryorganizations i s in
place; agencies and organizations are becoming more independent indefining their
policies and directions.
Withinthe framework of EDPRP a methodology of budgetary fundinghas changed
and it i s now designed as program financing that significantly increases the level o f
targeting and efficiency o f budgetary expenditures.
Works are ongoing on fine-tuningo f budgetary classification which considers
establishing of GFS-200 1 standards for classification of revenues, expenditures,
financial and non-financial assets and liabilities.
Monthly realistic forecast o f budgetary expenditures will be prepared. A medium-
term (4 years) state budget forecasting and planning will be implemented. The MOF
has prepared new forms o f budgetary application forms.

     Local Budget

At the end o f 2005 new organic law on "local self-governance" was adopted. The law
will enter into force inNovember 2006 after the elections o f new self-governance
units.
Furthermore, it has become essential to elaborate such legislative basis that would
support a real independence o f local self-governments and direct their authorities into
correct and targeted channel.
By the end o f2005 the Government of Georgia has submitted to the Parliament of
Georgia a draft law on "budget o f local self-governing body" which was prepared by
the Ministryo fFinance of Georgia.
Based on stipulations o f the organic law o f Georgia "on local self-governance" and
law of Georgia "on the state budget system" the draft aims at expansion and
concentration o f fiscal autonomy to local representative and executive bodies, as well
as at fine-tuningo f the formation and execution methods for budgets o f territorial
unitswhich, as oftoday, has never beenreflected comprehensively inthe active
legislation.
The daft law aims at elimination o f all abovementioned.deficiencies. It explicitly and
newly sets forth the rules for formation, discussion, approval, execution and control o f
the budgetso f territorial units.
The draft law takes into consideration transfers for local self-governing units under
the formula of proportionally calculated transfers. Such approach i s based on the
principle o f independence for budgetary regulation and exclusive authority o f local
government.
New rule o f formation o fthe budgets o f local self-governances, which is set forth in
the draft law submitted to the parliament of Georgia, for the first time inGeorgia's
reality, allows for determining such budgets, by the formula o f proportionally
calculated transfers, which provides for the low per-capita social-economic potential-
having local self-governances with the opportunity to be treated at the level o f
average Georgia's economic indicators.
The draft will specify the stipulations on control, audit, evaluation and execution o f
the budgets o f self-governing units.It will institute that the audit and execution
reports represent public information, which will be available to the public according
to establishedrules.

5.2.2. Customs Reform
One o f the main directions o f fiscal policy, as set forth by the EDPRP, is fine-tuning
o f customs legislation. For this purpose, a special team was set inthe MOF which
intensively worked onpreparation of new customs code. Because o f time limits, in
2005 it was not possible to submitthe draft code for review to interestedparties,
business circles, experts and a respective committee o f the Parliament o f Georgia.
Therefore, this process continued inthe first quarter o f 2006. As o f today, the draft
has been submitted to the Parliament.
Purpose o f new customs code i s to harmonize Georgia's customs legislation with the
EUlegislation, which will make Georgian customs administration consistent with the
Europeanrules. This will support strengthening o f trade relations with the EUas well

                                            24


as with the majority of countries which use harmonized customs system. New
customs code considers fundamental reviewingo f customs policy and has following
targets:
      -   To encourage economic growth-by increasing the volume o f foreign
trade, transit and processingon the basis of harmonized and simplifiedcustoms
legislation;
      -   To support legal businesses-by simplifiedcustoms procedures and
strengthening administrative measures against smuggling.
New customs code completely changes the structure o fthe existing one. Inparticular,
new structure is harmonizedwith the EU legislation; it includes litigation and customs
responsibility issues; it considers following directions:


       I. HarmonizationwiththeEUlegislation:
It is consistent with customs code of the EUunder provisions of 1992European
Council, decree # 2913192, and with the EUcustoms code implementationprovisions
o f 1993, decree # 2454193.

       11.     Fine-tuningand simplificationof customsprocedures:
       1. Clear definition o f rightsandresponsibilities of customs officials;
       2. Clear definition o f customs procedures from enteringthe customs territory to
          releasingthe goods;
       3. Introduction o f simplified customs procedures together with regular
          procedures (especially for transit regime);
       4. Possibility of prolongation o fperiod for customs dutiespayment to 1month;
       5. Customs control inthe customs zone will be preformed only by customs
          bodies;
       6. Fine-tuning and simplification o f customs regimes and o f relatedprocedures,
          inparticular:
                 a) 8 customs regimes out o f existing 15 will remain;
                 b) 5 customs regimes were transformed into customs processing
                    operations;
                 c) 2 customs regimes (temporary export and re-import) were
                    transferred to the customs preferencespart as returning goods.

       111.Customssafety
       1. Introductiono f a system to ensure meeting customs obligation - introduction
          o f the system o f guarantees;
       2. Introductiono f accounting and accrual scheme for customs levies;


The new code fine-tunes contents o f customs procedures which are relatedto
declaration and inspection o f goods for their admission into the customs regime.
Types o f customs declarations and methods o f their submissionto customs authorities
were determined(inwriting, inelectronic forms and oral declarations). Significant
changeswere introducedinto the procedures o f customs declaration for modification
or cancellation o f the declared data.
Inspectionprocedures for customs control over products, goods, passengers, personal
belongings, transports and post dispatches were fine-tunedand described in details.

                                               25


 The new customs code describes inmore details guarantees for implementation o f
 customs obligations and the related topics. Inparticular, types o f guarantees were
 definedfor customs submission (bank guarantee, financial risk insurance policy and
 deposits inthe state treasury), as well as the measures to be employed incase o f
 breacho f customs obligations. The code clearly defines those circumstances where
 customs obligations arise. Also, for meeting customs obligations, responsible persons,
 and incase o f several responsible persons -joint-responsibility issues were
 determined. One o f the important chapters inthe code i s about execution o f customs
 obligations. Inparticular, it comprises such topics as calculation and payment o f
 customs duties and accruing o f customs duties. Period o f accruing customs duties i s
 defined at 6 years. Herewith, notification responsibilities for accrued customs duties
 from the side of customs authorities and their execution deadlines were established
 and determined.
 The draft also determines general conditions for changing execution deadlines for
 accrued customs duties. Inparticular, the draft sets forth such provisionwhere the
 execution deadline for a payer o f customs duties under a declaration can be extended
 to 1month. The code proposedan innovative approach to addresses the issue o f
 customs disputes. Similar to tax disputes, resolution o f disputes i s carried out at the
 MOF, or by the court. Rulesfor initiationo f customs dispute procedures and the
I

 timeframe for dispute resolution deadlines has been determined.
 New customs code completely adopts the stipulations o f the Code o f Administrative
 Breaches inthe part o f violations o f customs rules (types o f breaches and
 responsibilities). It also defines types o f customs violations and the entities subject to
 customs violation, general principles o f responsibilities, customs sanctions, rules o f
 processing of customs cases and rules o f appealing the decisions taken by customs
 bodies.

 5.2.3. Treasury system reform
 Within the framework o f the reform o ftreasury service, for the increase o f
 effectiveness o f state funds' management, the treasury has closed down about 300
 transit accounts for budgetary revenues at the NationalBank o f Georgia; 9-digit
 treasury codes were introduced for revenues and, since April 4, 2005, budgetary
 revenues are accounted straight at the Treasury Single Revenue Account. As a next
 step for accounting reform, it was plannedto establish a single revenues and
 expenditures account from 1st January 2006. Accordingly, the preparatory works
 were implemented during2005 and the reform was successfully accomplished.
 Operating software was preparedand applied by local staff o f the treasury service. At
 the end o f 2005, the treasury single account was enacted. A full-scale operation o f the
 treasury single account was achieved. This implied accumulation o f budgetary
 revenues at one unified account and transfer of revenues to the beneficiaries, as well
 as execution o f all operations for the state budget expenditures.
 In2005 the Treasury Service prepared, andthe MinisterofFinance of Georgia
 approved, the instruction on "rule o f creating the financial plan for smooth (operative)
 financing o f budgetary organizations and the management o f funds". The instruction
 i s inforce fiom 1St January 2006 and the budgetary organizations will spend their
 budgetary allocations under the law on the state budget accordingto the monthly
 operative financial plans approvedby the minister o f finance o f Georgia.

                                             26


Inorder to introducethe internationalaccounting standards within the public sector,
the Treasury Service developedthe `accounting reform strategy', that was approved
by the order #101ofthe Minister of Finance ofGeorgia approved on February 1,
2006. This strategy i s a precondition for the accounting policy to be implementedby
the treasury and defines the basic directions o f the reform.
As a result o fthe reform, the accounting inthe public sector o f Georgia will be fully
compatible to the international standards. Inthe transitional periodthe accounting will
be based onthe cash methods and will be gradually replaced by the accrual method;
The Government Finance Statistics 2001 will be implemented and all the accounting
o f the government finance will be fully compatible to the international accounting
standards.

6.      Ongoing and PlanedReformsinthe SectoralSpectrum

6.1.    Education

Radical reforms o f the education system o f Georgia, launched in2004, have brought
some results interms o f legislative initiatives and, most importantly, were reflected in
integration with the European educational system. For the first stage o f restructuring
educational system following three main targets were set:
          harmonization o f Georgian education system with the European standards;
          eradication o f corruption sources at all levels o f educational system (initial,
          basic, secondary, high, specialized, etc.);
          transition to a new system o f education financing.
Despite the fact, that all three targets were relatedto challenges, significant
achievements have been already recorded. It i s noteworthy that from 2005 official
consultations started for inclusion o f Georgia inthe Europeanneighborhoodpolicy,
where the education and the science are the priorities
Currently, one of the most important tasks i s integration o f research and science into
educationalprocesses, optimization o f science financing and creation of relevant
legislative basis. Inparticular, following tasks shall be accomplished:
          evaluation and comparative analysis o f existing conditions inthe scientific
          sector;
          preparation o f the national concept on development o f science and
          technology and it synchronization with the European view;
          preparation o fprograms for commercialization o f science research results
          and its synchronization with the comparable Europeanprograms;
          preparation o f programs for encouragingthe scientists and attraction o f
          young specialists.
      Besides it i s important to:
          Establishprofessional education system inthe South Caucasus which will be
          similar to European system.
          Cooperate with Europeanstructures on the basis o f social partnership in
          Georgia, with the view o f developing professional education and lifelong
          learning, etc.
      0   Participate inthe Bologna process, which considers efficient and rapid
          implementation of priorities. Inthis regard following shall be accomplished:

                                            27


                - Europeansystem o f credit transfers and accumulation (ECTS) shall
                - Universities shall move to three stage system and integrate training
                  be implemented;

                  and research into higheducation;
                - Nationalunion o f students shall be established;
                - Mobility of students andtutors shall be encouraged, etc.

The most difficult and important task i s to increase level o f social understanding,
increase their participation andprovide relevant material-social conditions for this
purpose. To achieve this, the public and private partnership and support o f
international community with be essential.

6.1.1. High Education
On May 19,2005 ministers o f 40 participant countries to the Bologna process and
international organizationsjointly accepted Georgia as an authorized member. This is,
undoubtedly, a significant step forward, because Georgia has officially become
integral part European HighEducation Area (EHEA) and EuropeanResearch Area
(ERA).Sucha successwas preconditionedby significant legislative changes. On 21
December, 2004 Parliament o f Georgia adopted law on higheducation.
The law fundamentally changes the previous system o f higheducation and i s
consistent with international requirements.The law provides for full autonomy to high
education institutions and awards extraordinary rights to students as a partner and
interested group. The law stipulates that:
           Georgian higheducation institutions shall move to three stage system:
                - Bachelors degree (minimum3 years)
                - Masters degree (minimum2 years)
                - Doctoral degree (minimum3 years)
           Educational system should switch to European credit transfer and
           accumulation system before 2009-20 10;
           Basedon the same law and Decree o f Minister o f Education #149 high
           education institutions o f Georgia are required to distribute free o f charge the
           appendix for to a diploma which has been approvedby UNESCO-CEPES,
           Euro Council and Euro Commission.
Inthe beginning of2005 institutionalaccreditation ofhigheducationinstitutions was
performed. About 113, out of 237, (48 percent) high education institutions were
awarded the accreditation.
According to the law o f Georgia on higheducation inacademic year 2005-2006
unifiednational exams were set up inwhole Georgia. 17,34 1registeredapplicants out
o f 30,400 became students. 4,300 students were awarded state voucher (GEL 1,000 -
1,500). This means that the highly ranked students are able to use state funds towards
their tuitionfee to any preferredinstitution inside or outside Georgia. "Funding
following a student" model radically changes financing formula o f higheducation.
The process o f establishingthe system o f quality control i s also noteworthy.
According to the law on higheducation the system o f quality control implies
evaluation o f high education institutions and programs by student participation and
publication o f results on self-evaluation and external evaluation. Several universities
have already introduced the quality control units which are responsible to ensure a
highlevel ofeducationby application ofcontemporary methodsofevaluation. The

                                             28


quality control unitsinhigheducation institutions are required to establish and
maintain intense professional relationships with respective services abroad to provide
transparent criteria and establish contemporary methodologies inthe field o f quality
control.
List o f already implementedmeasures include establishment o f state management
school named after Mr.Zurab Zhvania. The purpose o f this institutioni s to offer
continuous educationto Georgian and other minority representatives employed (or
prospective employees of) inpublic sector. It aims at increasing their qualification,
information exposure and professionalism.

6.1.2. GeneralEducation
The situation ingeneral educationhas also significantly progressed towards

education on stho f April, 2005. Law regulates state approachtowards general
implementation o f European standards. Parliament o f Georgia adopted law on general

education, language o f education, lengtho f education, rights o f parents and teachers,
financing o f general education, management principles for general education
institutions, accreditation, property management issues, etc. Important part o f the law
i s move towards 12-year-long education that shall be gradually implemented in2006-
2007, establishing supervisoryboards, introduction of elections for directors and
introduction of pupils' self-governance. Starting from 2005 the schools are financed
through the budget o f the ministry o f science, rather than the local budgets.Besides,
the new financing system will be introduced. The new vouchers worth ofGEL 220-
390 will be allocated per each pupil. Basic education inGeorgia i s mandatory and the
state provides for the appropriate system and social-economic conditions for each
resident o f Georgia to have possibility to get highlevel basic education.
Inorder to facilitate the process ofintegrationofthe non-Georgianpopulationinto the
society, the ministryo f education and science implementedthe following programs:
"civic integrationprogram," "school partnershipprogram," and "Future Starts
Today." The program that subsidizes the provision o f Georgian textbooks to the non-
Georgian schools is also being implemented. Interms o f this program the Georgian
text book by the name "Tavtavi" was printedand distributed to the non-Georgian
schools.
It is noteworthy, that Georgiangovernment together with Estonianpartners has
launched a project called "a deer leap". State budget o f Georgia has allocated
significant amounts for the project: In2005 USD 3.3 millionwere allocated. The
project considers equipping all schools with computers and connecting them to the
internet network.
It is also important to note that the Ministry ofEducation and Science of Georgia
prepareda concept "on professional training and development o f tutors." Purpose o f
the concept is to define status o f a teacher, introduce relevant mechanisms for
improvement o f teachers' professional skills (e.g. credits, certification exams, etc),
and establish a transparent, merit-basedremuneration system.
State curriculum o f Georgia i s inthe process o f preparation. The curriculum will
include core and optional subjects, which would support development o f critical-
analytical thinking instudents. The curriculum will be consistent with main directions
o f social and state development and meets contemporary international requirements
for education.

                                              29


According to the law o f Georgia on General Education, first 6 years o f 12 year school
courses provides for initial education, from 7 to 9 years are for basis education and
from 10 to 12 years are secondary education courses. As o f today, there are 3,13 1
general education schools and 70,212 teachers inGeorgia.

6.1.3. Professional Education
Professional education o f Georgia i s inthe phase o f radical transformations. A new
concept of Georgia's professional education was prepared considering the existing
situation o f initial and secondary professional education system. It also relies on
analysis of the difficulties inlabor market and employment and considers prospects o f
integration o f Georgia's professional education into the European area.
New policy of professional education inGeorgia i s based on continues education
principles. The professional educationpolicy inGeorgia i s based on principles o f
skilled labor movements on the EUterritory and establishment o f such conditions in
Georgia, when the country develops the economy through its own specialists. At the
current stage, the most important target i s to give a professional opportunity to the
population, mostly to young generation, to reduce unemployment andpoverty. This
issue has beenawarded a political priority as well.
Ongoing changes inthe fields o f economy, education and employment, inthe process
o f modernization o f professional education, will promote social dialogue and the
necessity for increase o f cooperation level with market structures and the employers.
With this view o f this, by initiative o f Ministryo f Education and Science o f Georgia,
under the decree o f Government o f Georgia # 90 o f 27 May 2005 was established a
governmental commission for social partnership inthe field o f professional education.
The commission discussed the concept on professional education (which i s approved
by the governmental meeting on August 31, 2005) and draftedthe plano f its
implementation. The draft law on professional education, which is inthe process o f
preparation, i s based on the abovementioned concept.

6.1.4. Deinstitutionalization
The process o f deinstitutionalization for those children, who are currently inthe
institutions, i s a very important initiative. This is the first attempt inGeorgia to create
alternative, family-type, care for children inthe institutions or for those who are ina
highrisk ofbeing sent to the institutions. The sub-program onprevention and
deinstitutionalization has achieved significant results since the first year o f
implementation to-date.
The sub-program o f deinstitutionalizationhas created and developed a "Social
Service", which i s staffed with qualified personnel who take decisions and select the
best fitting care for any individualchild. 42 social workers have undergone a training
process all-over Georgia, who now carry out the process o f deinstitutionalization.
Long-term economic crisis, which continued since the restoration o f national
independence, has exposed traditional network o f family security to severe tests.
According to UNconvention on children rights, each childhas the right o f being
grown inthe family. The state i s responsible for employing all efforts for reduction o f
number o f children under state patronage inthe orphanages and for prevention o f
possibilities to take children under state patronage, by establishingalternative forms
o f social assistance.

                                             30


According to law o f Georgia "on orphans and adoption o f children which are left
without parent care", ,Ministryo f Education o f Georgia, together with donor
organizations (UNICEF, Everychild,World Vision International inGeorgia) has been
implementing programs in 5 regions o f Georgia: Tbilisi, Rustavi, Telavi, Batumi and
Kutaisi, since 1999. The programhas three directions: reintegration, prevention o f
risk-groups, adoption.
Extremely important is the program on "prevention o f infant rejection and
deinstitutionalization", which has been implemented by Georgian Ministries o f
Education and Healthcare, BritishEverychild and international World Vision since
December 2002. From 1'` January 2005, by decree o f the Minister o f Education and
Science # 396 o f 31" December 2004, the abovementionedprogram was transferred
into sub-programs o f the Ministryo f Education and Science.
In2003-2005 the deinstitutionalizationprogramhas assistedabout 850 children.
Among them, 400 children were assisted in2005. In2006, the number of adopted
children will be twice as much as inthe previous year. .

6.1.5. InclusiveEducation
 On 13 February 2004, Parliament o f Georgia adopted the document on "main
directions o f social policy for protection o f rights o f children with disabilities". The
Government o f Georgia was assigned to prepare concrete measures to ensure the
implementation of the document. Besides, the concept was prepared, which addresses
special educational service inthe schools for children with limited intellectual
abilities. Purpose of mentioned concept i s to provide such children with relevant
education; to meet highstandards o f educational services; to make available special
educational services to targeted children and their families.
The Ministry of Education and Science i s working on preparation and implementation
o f new methodologies and approaches, which will support the transformation o f
system to the requirements o f democratic society. Children with disabilities were
accounted across the general education schools inTbilisi. Ten pilot schools are
functioning where inclusive education process is successfully carried out. The
implementation o f the program has beenmonitored inthe beginningo f year and
progress of the process was evaluated.

6.2.     Health Care and Social Protection

Ongoing priorities o f the Ministry o f Labor, Health Care and Social Protection
represent the most important three social risks: poverty, health and age. Efforts are
oriented at creation o f risk regulation instruments and mechanisms. Accordingly,
three significant reforms are intended for forthcoming years, inparticular:
       -
       --  reform o f the system o f administration o f social assistance;
           reform o f the health care system;
           limitation to incorrect increase o f "privileges" (pensions and allowances) -
           (reform is oriented at limitation o f unjustifiedincrease of privileges for some
           groups o f pensioners).
The mainpoints o f the social assistance concept are as follows:
       - The law defines a number o f cases (reachingthe pensionage, lose o f the
          breadwinner, restriction o f capabilities) when the citizen i s entitled to receive

                                             31


          the adequate assistance from the state (adequate means that the assistance

      - The populationthat i s below the poverty level, and i unable to improve
          may be adequate to the economic situation inthe country).
                                                                  s                   its
          economic conditions will receive the adequately addressed social assistance.
      - For those poorpopulation who are unable to implement active preventive
          measures and who are at the edge o f the extreme poverty, the state creates
          the effective security net by offering different social services.

6.2.1. Reform of the system of administration of social assistance
Main objective o f the reform o f administration o f social assistance system which
started by the Government in2004 is to improve social economic conditions of
population through elimination ofpoverty. The mainprinciples o f the reform are:
      -    improving the targeting o f the poverty alleviation program, so that the
      -    program i s tied to those who need the assistance most.
           monetization o f benefits. As experience suggests monetized social
           assistance, inmost cases, i s more efficient for the improvement o f economic
           conditions o f families by optimizing their consumption.
Objective of the state program on identification, evaluation o f social-economic
condition and formation o f the database o f the families below the poverty margin i s
creation o f the database of socially vulnerable poor families based on their social-
economic status, which will allow us to plan and implement financial and other type
o f social assistanceprograms.
Most significant prerequisite for effective functioning o f social assistance program is
correct selection (targeting) o f assistancerecipients (beneficiaries), specifically in
such cases where available resources are scarce and share o f population below
poverty margin i s quite high.
State agency for employment and social assistancehas started work on the program
according to governmental decrees "on measures for poverty reduction and fine-
tuningof social safety" (17.03.05) and "on approval ofmethodology for evaluationof
social-economic conditions of socially vulnerable families (households)" (04.08.05).
Creation o f database considers following stages: submission o f application from an
applicant family, processing o f application, identification o f families according
residence area and their registration inthe database by assigning a rating score in
accordance to evaluation methodology o f their social-economic conditions.
At the communication booths the process ofacceptance o fapplications from the
families which are below the poverty margin (which initially i s based on self-
evaluation o f a family) has started inAugust 2005. As o f to date, within the frames o f
the program, inall regions o f Georgia about 1,100 communication centers have been
established for registration o f applicant families. Any family, which considers to be
leaving inextreme poverty and which requests assistance from the state can get
registeredinthe database.
As ofJanuary 1, 2006 basedonthe applications submitted to communication centers,
21 percent o f Georgia's families expressed their wish to receive assistance. In
comparisonto other regions share o f socially vulnerable families which expressed
willingness to receive social assistanceis highin Samtskhe-Djavakheti, Racha-
Lechkhumi and Mtskheta-Mtianeti regions. The figure remains lowest inTbilisi (10.4
percent) and Guria region (16 percent).

                                              32


As o fto date, the databasehas registeredinformationabout 218,384 families (88.5
percent o f submittedapplications) where 566,068 people live.
Large number of one member families inthe database as probably determinedby the
fact that such families are mostly represented by single pensioners who have very
highpoverty risk and feeling ofbeingunprotected. Inparticular, almost two third (65
percent) o f single member families who submitted applications are pensioners. I t shall
be noted that share o f pensioners i s quite higheven intwo member families. Share of
pensioners intotal applicants o f the database i s 27.1 percent.
Social agents are interviewing those families who are willing to receive targeted
social assistance. State agency for employment and social assistancehas authorized
the social agents to identify the families which are willing to register inthe database,
to interview the family members intheir houses, to evaluate social-economic
condition o f a family and to obtain other necessary informationaccording to the
methodology that was set forth by above mentioned governmental resolution.
Main characteristics o f the methodology are following:

          0    Calculation of the rating score (so called welfare index), which
               corresponds to welfare level of a family. The calculation i s implemented
              based on the established methodology.
          0    The index is calculatedbased on the assessment o f the questionnaire
              preparedby the social agent.
          0    Each indicator i s given corresponding weight    -digit, according to effect
               on welfare o f a family. Each digit affects the final index calculated for
              the family.
               Basedon welfare index families can be ranged according to the poverty
               level.
Effective implementation of the targeted social assistance program i s planned Autumn
2006. Presumably on the initial stage, program will be managedby a centralized
method, however infuture management shall be delegated to local governments.
InSummer2006, the medical insurance program for the poorest part ofthe population
has commenced. Interms o f the program the 600 thousand poorest people will receive
free healthcare service from the state. The health insurance program covers the
members o f the families whose score is below the 100001. The people falling inthis
category comprise 20.1 percent o f the population. The special cards will be distributed
to the beneficiaries. The cards will be used for identification and provision o f service
to the patients. The fact that the state will pay for the medical service will enable the
beneficiaries to save the money that they would have spent on the medical service.
The card holder i s entitled to receive the following services free o f charge:
ambulatory service at the medical center or clinic, consultation from the specialized
doctor, free medical tests, urgent ambulance service, pregnancy and baby delivery
services, hospital treatment or planned operations. The family doctor should certify
that this cardholder needs the abovementionedservice.

6.2.2. Reform of Health Care System
Most important component of health care reform is following:
      -   Investmentsin infrastructure
      --  Standards o f professional activity
          Investment inhumanresources

                                             33

       -- Adequate financing o f responsibilities (services)
          Reform and implementation of Basic Beneficiary Package (BBP) and
       -  Supplementary Beneficiary Package (SBP)
          New insurance product -mediproduct will be introduced and maintained at
          the Georgianmedical insurance market.
It is important that procurement and financing ofmedical services are determined
within the frames o f BBP. Healthcare financing package which was worked out by the
Ministrywith the support ofinternationalexperts determines social healthcare,
primary healthcare and ambulance services as components o f the BBP. It i s also
considered to supplement some hospital services to existing BBP. The SBP will be
oriented specific targeted groups. The government intends to hire a supplier o f
services both for BBP and SBP.
The ambulatory service, as a component of BBP will be set as one o f the priorities
and aims guaranteed availability o f free, comprehensive and effective ambulatory
assistanceto the population. The program intends for structural reorganization o f the
ambulatory service units, optimization o f personnel, improvement o f material-
technical basis and continuous harmonization o f standards and tariffs.
As a result of implementation o fprogramwell functioning and efficient ambulance
service will be formed which will be able to provide with timely and highly qualified
medical service and timely hospitalization o f the patients,
By implementationofthe reform followingwill be achieved:
       -  Expansiono f medical and social program for mothers and children and
       -  improvement o f their financing;
          Creation and activation o f optimized organizational model for programs o f
       -  medical and social assistance to mothers and children;
          Creation o f primary health care system and expansiono f supervisory system
       -  for mothers and children health care;
          Improvement availability o f information and services inrelation to
       -- reproduction health care;
          Improvement o f quality o freproduction health care service;
          Preparationof the evaluation plan for social welfare and health care
       -  condition o f mothers and children;
          Dialogue with NGOs and international organizations with the view o f
          fundingmeans for andby unified efforts to resolve Medicare and social
          problems o f mothers and children;
With the view o f successful implementation ofmedical care program implementation
o f financial and structural reforms are necessary inparallel regime. For creation o f
properly functioning primary and secondary health care systems 2005-2009 period
has been set.
Significant changes are planned as well inthe field of primary health care. In
particular:
       -  Inthree regions ofGeorgia (Kakheti, Imereti, Adjara) 78 medical
          institutions will be rehabilitated, equipped with medical apparatus and
       -  doctors and nurses will be trained.
          From 1June, 2006 inthe rehabilitatedcenters implementation o f program on
          family doctor model will start.

                                             34


          Byprovidingefficient, fair and equal distribution o fresources inthe health
          care sector, insteado f limitedpackage o f medical service, new system will
          offer to population highquality basic medical service, which will be
          available for all residents regardless o f age, sex or social status.
          Financing o f ambulatory service has increased, management and quality o f
          service has improved, which together with other arrangements inprimary
          health care will significantly improve access o f population to primary
          assistance.
          MinistryofLabor, HealthCare and Social Protectionhas got actively
          involvedinexpertise and fine-tuning o f the models which were worked out
          byNGOs and the field o fprimaryhealth care. It is essential to analyze such
          experience and to replicate them on the national level.

6.2.3. Healthcareof Mothersand Children
       -  With the view o f improvement o f alternative care o f expectants, state
          medical standard was supplementedby one free ultra-sonic research.
       -  With the view of improvingmaterial and technical basis o fmedical care
          institutions for mothers and children, under assistance o f the Japanese
          government all institutions for mothers and children inthe regional centers
       -- were equipped with ultra-sonic research equipment.

          A modemcentre for mothers and children was opened InKutaisi; the free
          gynecology department was set up inthe institute o f gynecology research
          after a full scale refurbishment. Also, a strong clinic-diagnostic laboratory
       -- was opened.

          A department for mucoviscidos was opened inthe children's "republican"
          hospital o f Tbilisi,
       -  Reproductive health survey was carried out across the country and results of
          the survey were analyzed. Work onthe draft law on reproductive healthcare
          i s ongoing.

       -  To promote a healthy lifestyle, a group o f trainers were trained inthe high
          medical educational institutions, with the aim to continue working for
          promotion o f healthy lifestyle, inmedical personnel and inthe population.
          The program was carried out under the auspices o fthe UN.

A commissionwas set up for prevention ofmortality inmothers and children under
the Ministry o f Labor, Health and Social Protection. Representatives of gynecologic
and pediatric clinics indepartments are unified. By assistance o f this commission and
relevant sectoral associations professional investigation o f documents o f died mothers
i s inthe process and the investigationreport will be submitted to healthcare Ministry
for further reaction.

6.2.4. Program of support of socialintegration and adaptation of personswith
disabilities
2005 program for supporting social adaptation o f Georgia's persons with disabilities
(PD) i s representinga mechanism which i s oriented at implementation o f PD social
policy.
PDs indeveloping countries represent socially vulnerable, poor societies; therefore
care on PDs by means o f social integration, prevention o f their transfer to institutions,
psycho and social rehabilitation andprovisiono f auxiliary means will be a step
forward to economic development and improvement o f social condition o f the
country.
The PD social adaptationprogram included the following sub-programs: PD social
integration, institutional protection expenditures, PD children rehabilitation, provision
o f assistancemeans, and other sub-programs.
In2006, the accent is places oncreation ofthe centers for independentlivingand
development o f network o f community organizations.
It shall benoted that legal status of institutional organizations was inthe form of
LLCs, which was significantly limitingrange o f innovations for improvement o f their
functioning, therefore state control on institutional organizations, which were referred
inthe first part ofthe PresidentialDecree # 585 of 12.07.05 "on restructuringof
pension houses for elderly, PDs and careless children, into legal entities o fpublic
law" was transferred to the Ministry o f Labor, Healthand Social Protection (these
institutions are "Tbilisi pension house for elderly and Kutaisipension house for
elderly, Dzevri pensionhouse for elderly).
As well important i s one more priority o f the Ministry,which envisages improvement
o f the capability assessmentmechanism, usingthe international classificator o f
functions (ICF) for disability and health assessment (2005-2007).
Main criterion for determining capability restriction level inGeorgia was partial or
complete loss of ability causedby illness or anatomic and mental disorders. On
opposite, ICF i s structured by considering following components: functions and
structure o fbody, participation and activity (related to tasks and actions o f an
individualplus involvement inlife) and additional informationabout factors o f the
surrounding. Purpose o f the program i s to apply the ICF as a tool for social
assessment so, that the decisions taken accordingly are fact-based and thus supporting
elimination o f corruption inthe system.
Inorder to be able to utilizethe ICF, a range ofmeasuresincludingthe legislative
changes mustbe implemented.

6.2.5 PensionReform
Current state pension system provides for fixed-rate pensions givento every person o f
pension age. Existingpension was increased from GEL 14 to 28 inJanuary 2005.
Building-upof pensionarrears was stopped and the debt was repaid, which was the
first step on way o f pension reform implementation.
The draft laws on "State Pensions" and "State Compensations and State Scholarships"
were prepared in2005. These laws will enter into force from 1'` January, 2006. Their
aim i s to create a common legislative basis for the existing pension system.

                                                36


  According to the law on State Pension, the pensions increased up to GEL 33 in
  Spring; the next increase up to 38 GELwill take place inAutumn, 2006.

  Program o f the Government o f Georgia "on economic development, long-term
  stability and Euro-integration for unifiedand strong Georgia" has clearly
  demonstrated readiness of the government to address development o f the country
  through improvement o f transport and communication infrastructure. Main goals are
  a) to increase transitory attractiveness o f the country and to support development of
  multi-function corridor with the view o f European integration. It includes
  development of key infrastructure; b) to support to increasing the level o f living by
  infrastructural development and improved accessibility; reduction o f welfare
  difference between city and rural areas/ various regions o f Georgia.
   With the view ofachieving these goals it is necessary:
        - Liberalization of the regulating environment and ensuringthe competitive
  market conditions, including the optimization o f the technical reliability system.
         - Creation o f the stabile and predictable business environment.
         To harmonize transport legislation basis and standards with the European
  legislation.
        - Furtherfine-tuningo ftransport sector regulationsand separation from
  functions of policy formation o f the Ministry o f Economic Development;
        -    Encouragement, initiation and support to Public-Private Partnerships (PPP)
  ininfrastructuralcomponents;
        -    Separation of responsibilities between central and local levels inrelation to
  infrastructuralmanagement;

                                             37

      -    Encouragemento f implementation o f international and regional projects
through introduction and development o f contemporary technologies;
      -    Further implementation o f TRACECA program as an important component
of regional cooperation and European integration;
       --  Rehabilitation and construction o f international, intrastate and rural roads
           Declaration and implementation o f the so called `open-air' policy inthe field
o f aviation;
       -   Encouragemento f further development inthe marine sector by supporting
management improvement (introduction o f corporate administration);
       --  Protection o f interests and rights o f users of Georgia's infrastructure;
           Guideline principle for further reformation o f state management system and
priorities of the government o f Georgia inthe transport sector i s the process o f
institutional deregulation o f the economy, which, among others, includes reduction o f
licensing and permits regulations by introducing principles o f "one board service" and
"the presumption o f silence".
 with the view o f optimization o f independent regulating bodies, itwas consideredto
establish the national transport regulating commission before December 2005 on the
basis o f reorganized transport administration (motor transport administration, civil
aviation administration, marine transport administration), which was postponed for
2006 by the decision o f the parliament of Georgia. The reform aims at setting-up the
unifiedtransport administrationbody (technical regulating body) insteado f currently
existing transport administration bodies. Draft law specifies frames o f control for
technical administration, which i s oriented at supervision and control o f licensing and
permits requirements. As a next stage o f the reform, a package o f changes to the laws
on motor road transport, law on normative acts and the conflict o f interests inthe state
service were prepared.

6.3.1. Railway Transport
Works on new railway project o f Karsi-Akahalkalaki-Tbilisi-Bakui s ongoing.
Turkishparty has launchedtender for marketingresearch and analysis of given
interval, which was completed in2005 and on the basis o f which further
implementation details o f the project will be specified; economic-technical basis for
the railway line will be developed and feasibility o fits construction will be
determined.
Works are ongoing for introduction o f modern informationtechnologies at the border-
customs passages, as well as for their inclusion inthe unified informationnetwork and
for relevant informationexchange.
In2005 "Georgian Railway" has significantly increased volume oftransported goods
and respective revenues. Dynamics for transportation o f crude oil and oil products
increased significantly comparedto the last two years: data o f 2005 i s the highest for
past 15 years. Revenues from passenger turnover increased too.
InJanuary 2005 the USAIDproject started, which aims at restructuringof"Georgian
Railway" and preparation o f its developmentprogram. Contractor o f the Railway,
consulting company Booz Allen Hamilton, i s working on the models o f railway
restructuring and their selection. Six versions o f restructuringmodel are under
discussion. American consultants will make initial conclusions after surveys,
according to which, if Georgia considers itself as a potential member inthe European
Union, the railway shall become functionally independent from the State. Latvian,

                                            38


Russianand Kazakh railway management models shall be taken into consideration for
Georgian Railway.
Followingmeasures were implemented inthe railway sector in2005:
       -   InJanuary 2005, agreement was signedondirect, internationalrailway-ferry
communication between Poti (Georgia) and Kavkaz (Russia), according to which
direct international railway-ferry transportation has started. Three trips were carried
out during 2005. Works are ongoing for fine-tuning o f technical and economic issues
o f this communication;
       -   On 24 December, 2005 inPoti a piloting-illustrative launch o f the container
train to Poti-Baku-Aktau-Almaata andbackwards was set up;
       - Amendments were introducedinto the "Railway Code o f Georgia" with the
view o f establishinga basis for railway tariffpolicy to be approved by "Georgian
Railways";
       Followingmeasures are planned inthe railway sectors in2006:
       -   With the aim to attract additional transportation volumes, issue o f
acceptance and transportation o f excise goods in"Kavkaz" (Russia) port to be solved
from the side of the RussianFederation;
       -   Works onpreparation of proposals for gradual restorationo f Sochi-Tbilisi
railway to be continued;
       -   Implementation o f measures for traffic intensively increase on Poti-Rize
direct motorway-ferry line from the side o f Turkey, and inclusion o f Georgianports
(Poti, Batumi) in Samsun-Novorosiisk, Trabzon-Sochi direct motorway-ferry
schedules, for participation o f Georgian companies. Also, discussion shall start on
direct railway-ferry communication between ports o f Samsun and Poti;
       -   Modernization o f Tbilisi Railway Central Station, Borjomi Station and the
transfer bridge;
       -   Separation o f administrative-economic functions inthe railway sector
(establishment o f regulating body and commencement o f its restructuring).

6.3.2. Motor Transport
Within the frames of the unifiedstatepolicy onmotor transport, administration of
motor transport considers implementation o f significant changes. Inparticular,
liberalization of existing legislation is inprocess aiming to increase attractiveness o f
transit corridor functionality and optimization o f tariffpolicy. In2005 new tax code
abolishedthe road tax, which significantly reduced a tax weight on foreign
transporters involved inmotor-transport sector. Inparticular, the following taxes has
been abolished: on automobile -USD20, on bus -USD40-130, on heavy motor
vehicle - USD 160- 300 (by cargo capacity)
According to the law o f Georgia on "Licensing and Permits" quantity o fpermits has
significantly reducedand relatedprocedures were simplified.
Interms ofliberalization ofmarketinthe country, draft inter-governmental agreement
on "International Motonvay Communication" was prepared, undergone local
legislative procedures and was signed with 11 countries (Czech Republic, Hungary,
Slovak Republic, Moldova, India, Austria, China, Poland, Estonia, Finland and
Russia). Start of negotiations with these countries i s planned for 2006.

                                              39


6.3.3. Airway Transport
Ongoing economic processes and globalization tendency inthe world has made it
rather outstanding to support free competition invarious sectors, including support to
expansion o f international airway network inthe frames o f bilateral and multilateral
international treaties and liberalization o f normative frameworks, which i s a
prerequisite for speeding-up o f Georgia's integration with the Europeanstructures.
In2005 Georgiabecame a member ofEuropeanCivilAviation Conference(ECAC),
which played a significant role inliberalizing the regulatory framework o f European
air transportation system and Europeanintegration. Membership inthis organization
i s an additional step forward towards Georgia's integration within the Europeanand
the World leading community.
With the view o f liberalizationofairway traffic, preparationo f relevant amendments
to international agreements with Georgia's partner countries is ongoing. Such clauses
o f inter-governmental agreements as: tariffs, frequency o f flights, capacity, number o f
appointed airlines and strict definitiono f places o f destination, is, to some extent,
restricting airway communication between the countries. Accordingly, the decision
was reached on abolishing such restrictions. Considering the abovementioned, and
according to the decree o f the Presidento f Georgia # 211o f 23.03.05 on "Measures to
be implementedfor liberalizationo f airway communication", new draft agreement on
"Airway Communication" with 19 countries was prepared, which has already
undergone internal legislative procedures and inthe near future it i s planned to start o f
negotiations with relevant competent bodies o f referred countries.
The so called "Horizontal Agreement" on airway communication between Georgian
and EuropeanUnion was preparedwhich will be signed inthe nearest future.
On May 24,2005, the executive authorities (government) o f Georgia and the
government of the UnitedKingdom o f Great Britainand NorthernIreland signed a
Memorandum o f Understanding. The memorandum enables the airlines o f the parties
to exploit the routes such as the capacities allow meetingcustomers' demand on the
routes.
On October 5,2005 the governments o f Georgia and the Republic o f Turkey signed a
new agreement on air transportation, which eliminates the restrictions existing inthe
previous agreement: regarding the number, capacity and frequency o f flights, tariffs
and destinationpoints. From the day o f the signature o f the agreement, the annex to
the agreement was enacted, which enables the airlines o f the parties to have regular
flightsbetweenfour points onthe territory o f Turkey (Ankara, Istanbul, Trabzon and
one to be determinedlater) and four points inGeorgia: Tbilisi, Batumi and two points
to be determinedlater. At the same time, these destinationpoints on the routes can be
changed at any time, according to the demands on the market and with the request o f
the agreement party.
To facilitate the regular air transportation between Georgia and Latvia, the agreement
between governments o f Georgia and Latvia on air transportation has been signed on
October 5, 2005 within the framework o f the official visit o f the president o f Latvia,
MsVaira Vike-Fraiberga. The Latviancompany "Air Baltic" plans to launcha direct
regular flight between Tbilisi-Riga.
According to the protocol, signed by the Ministero f Economic Development o f
Georgia and the Minister o f Transport and Communication o f Kazakhstan (Tbilisi,
October 3,2005), the annex to the agreement on air transportation between Georgia

                                                 40


and Kazakhstanhas been amended. Inparticular, the number o f destinationpoints has
increased by bothparties. Tbilisi, Batumi and Kutaisihave been determined as
destinationpoints inGeorgia. Astana, Alma-Ata and Aktau has bee determined as
destinationpoints inKazakhstan. Kazakhstanhas already nominated air company
"Scat" which will launchregular flights between Aktau-Tbilisi-Aktau and Aktau-
Batumi-Aktau. The flight Aktau-Tbilisi-Aktau has been operational since May 2006
and has been flying twice a week. According to the decree o f the President of Georgia
# 1115 of 27.12.04 on "Provision o f Transport for Population o f Mestia Region", and
by considering social conditions o fpopulation o fMestia and the neighboring regions
and by considering condition o f roads inthose regions, with the view o fproviding
concessional airway transport services for this population, on July 5, 2005 regular
flights Tbilisi-Mestia-Tbilisi were introducedtwice a week, with AN-28 type aircraft
of low capacity (17 seats). 51 flights were made and 1'141passengers were
transported during2005. Inparallel work i s ongoing for setting-up internal airway
flights (including Tbilisi-Akahalkalaki and Tbilisi-Chikhareshi).
During2005 Georgia prepareddraft agreement on"Joint utilizationo fBatumi
Airport" and the technological scheme o f operation o f Batumi international airport to
be endorsed by Georgianand Turkishgovernments. Bilateral meetings are plannedin
2006 for discussing, agreeing and signingo f this document.
One of the priority directions o f country's development for today i s development o f
airway-navigation and airport infrastructure:
          -    According to inter-governmental coordinative meetings inMoscow on the
               problems o f traffic inICAO easternpart o f Europe, Georgia has movedto
               the compressed system ofvertical scheduling for consistency of airway
               turnover and for compliance with internationalnorms.
               Air navigation systems were modernizedand reequipped, which is infull
               compliance with international requirements for today. These processes are
               continuing as to be inline with rapiddevelopment o f international civil
               aviation.
               By endof2006 Tbilisi internationalairport and auxiliary territories will be
               reconstructed, thus Georgia will have the international airport o f modem
               standards. The airport will be constructedby ajoint Turkishcompany o f Tav
               and Urban. The company invests USD 62 million from own capital. Along
               with the Tbilisi airport, the Batumiinternational airport will also be
               reconstructed, which is an additional o f USD 15 million investments from
               the Turkishcompanies. The Georgian side retains the right to request
               investment o f an additional USD 18 millionfor introduction o f additional
               technologies inthe airports.

During2005 turnover ofTbilisi internationalairport increased andreached547,160
passengers, which i s 36 percent higher than the 2004 turnover (402,399 passengers).
In2005 air-company "Lufthansa" has entered Georgian market with flights between
T b i l i s i and Munich and air-company "Center-Avia" has entered the market with
flights betweenBatumi and Moscow.

6.3.4. MarineTransport
With the view o f optimization of technical regulation o f the marine transport sector,
separation o f functions o f policy-making andregulationwas carried out. At the next
stage o f the reform it i s planned to establish exact frames o f technical regulation,

                                              41


which will not exceed control o f the licenses and permits. Tariffs for loading-
unloading services inthe ports were disconnectedfrom the state regulation sector.
With the view of supporting further development of the marine sector bymeans o f
management improvement, process o f privatization o f state marine companies i s in
progress.
The following measures implemented inthe marine transport sector during2005 are
notable:
       -   Preparationo f inter-agency memorandum inaccordance with the agreement

       -   on "Cooperation o f Black Sea countries inrescue operations" ;
           Preparationo f memorandum on "Recognition o f marine diplomas and

       -   certificates";
           Establishingcooperation between Turkey and Georgia in shipbuilding
       --  sector;

           With the view of attracting private investments, introduction o f
           contemporary technologies and management standards inPoti port;

       -   terminals # 9 and # 10 were rented out on a long-term lease basis.
           InDecember 2005 contract was entered with the Dutchcompany "Boscalis
           International BV", which will undertake rehabilitation o f Poti port protection
       -   chain. Project total cost i s 15.3 million Euros.
           Works are ongoing for long-term lease o f the terminals # 4 and 5 o f Batumi
       -   port and on development o f Poti port terminal # 16.
           Start o f negotiations on passenger boat communication betweenGeorgian
           and Turkishports (Batumi-Khopa-Rize-Trabzon).

6.3.5 Motorways
Inthe sector ofmotorways 2005 was very importantyear by considering the volume
o f works and number of implemented projects. For rehabilitation and development o f
the motorway network, the 2005 budgethas spent significantly more funds. Increase
o f financing has significantly improved overall condition o f motorways - damaged
intervals were repaired, bridgesand other constructions were rehabilitated, most o f
the international and interstate roads were renovated.
Total volume o f works on the motorway in2005, by all sources of financing,
amounted to GEL 133.8 million. This figure i s twice as highas the financing inthe
previous year. The financing sources including:
       --- from the state budget -GEL 26.1 million;
           World Bank- GEL 3.8 million;
           Kuwaiti Fund-GEL 3.9 million.
Due to increased financing very rapidrehabilitation process o f Georgia's motorway
network has started.
In2005 first phase ofconstruction ofthe motonvaytunnel onChakvi-Makhinjauri
interval was finished. In2006 will start second phase of the construction (parallel
tunnel) works.
Due to performed rehabilitation and renovation works, condition o f motorways and
bridges was significantly improved.
In2005, for restorationofdamagedparts ofthe motorways due to natural disasters
GEL 28.0 millionwas spent. Considerableamount ofworks were performed in

                                            42


Lentekhi, Cageri, Mestia, Ambrolauri, Oni, Chkhorotskhu, Martvili and Zugdidi
regions.
With the view ofrestricting the movement o f over-norm-loaded vehicles on
motonvays o f Georgia, the draft law on "amendments to law o f Georgia on
Motonvays" was prepared which regulates load norms for the vehicles.
  With the view o f further development and expansion ofmotonvay shipments
between Georgia and Turkey, within the Millennium Challenge Georgia program it i s
plannedto construct and reconstruct the motonvays inSamtskhe-Javakheti region. It
i s planned as well to complete works on transfer o f Rikoti Tunnel into long-term
private administration and exploitation.

6.4.    Communication

As a result of economic reforms market economy principles are well established in
communication sector: it i s liberalized and de-monopolized, new communication
means and services are beinginitiated. Communication sector is characterized by
growing competition, which positively affects its development and, more importantly,
quality o f services and affordability to the population.
Local fixed telephone network and intercity communication lines are being
transferred to modem digital systems. Inresult, as o f end-2005, installed capacity o f
localtelephone stations, equipped with digital technologies, reached64 percent, while
incities telephone densityreached24.2 per 100people.
In2005, only GeorgianUnitedTelecommunication Company has introducedmodern
telephone stations equipped with digital systems and technologies, with capacity o f 48
thousand numbers, including inTbilisi ( number:74, 3l),    Kutaisi, Rustavi, Ozurgeti,
Zestaphoni, Marneuli, Gardabani, Signagi and etc.
In2005 beelinemobile communication network continued development. Number of
customers increased from 909,000 in2004 to 1,174000 in2005, with the density of
26,09 per 100 people.
Informationtransfer and internet connection systems continue development. In2004
customers connected to internet network amounted to 100,000, while in2005 their
quantity reached 178,000.
Television network covers about 96 percent o f the population, while radio network -
90 percent. Noteworthy, that about 60 percent o f the population can receive signals o f
three and more radio stations.
In2005 privatizationoflarge scale state-owned communication companies was
initiated. State-owned shares o f Georgian Telecom company were privatized in2005,
while inMay 2006 GeorgianUnitedTelecommunication Company - the main local
operator, was sold for USD 90 million.
Trendof growth o f communication market continued in2005. Revenues o fthe sector
increased by 21,l percent compared to 2004 and if 2004 revenues were GEL 595,96
million, year 2005 revenues reached GEL71452 million.
For the last 5 years revenues from services incommunication as part of GDP has been
growing. In2000 it amounted to 3,52 percent, while in2005 share o f the sector
revenues as part o f GDP reached 6,2 1percent.

                                             43


Notwithstanding o f such rapid development o f the communication sector the cost of
service has not increased, due introduction o f modem technologies and new types of
services. Cost o f certain services has even decreased, e.g. international calls.
Changes inlegal framework, introduced in 2004-2005, significantly simplified
licensing procedures. Pursuant to the Law on Electric Communications, licensing
changed to authorization, which impliesregistration o f the entity carrying out
operation o f electronic communication network, means and/or services. Licensing i s
required only to receive the right o f use o f expandable resources.
In2006 Georgiajoined ConferenceofEuropeanPost and Telecommunication (CEPT)
administration. Membership o f this organizationhas an important political and
economic meaning for our country. Using this organization, Georgia i s lobbyingits
interest incommunication and postage sectors inEC and EU, as well as in
International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and United Post Union (UPU), UN
organizations o f major importance.
The government program for the years 2004-2009 identified development o f
informationcommunication as one o f the priority sectors inGeorgian economy, as
this sector should speedup the process o fbuildinginformationsociety. Based on this,
it is considered necessary to prepare a national strategy for development o f
informationand communication technologies, which will form basis for
implementation o f targeted programs. Firstpriority problemininformationand
communication sector i s intellectualization and globalization o f information,
communication and postage networks. Currently, draft laws on Postage services,
Electronic Signature and Electronic Commerce are being prepared and harmonized
with Europeanlegislation.
Based on the recommendationso f Radio Communication Bureau o f International
telecommunicationUnion, all countries should switch to digital broadcasting starting
from 2008. MOED actively cooperates with the NationalCommission for
Communications o f Georgia on this issue.
Certain steps have already beentaken to form informationsociety: By the initiative o f
the Government o f Georgian and the National Commission for Communication and
with support o f the World Bank and UNDP, work onthe Framework Program for
Development o f Informationand Telecommunication Technologies has been
completed. ICT business sector become more active; LAN systems were introduced in
public organizations; Government i s actively working on creation o f unified
government network, based on networks of government organizations; First regional
inter-departmental WAN was completed inImaret; 11internet-clubs were established
inImaret; it isplannedto create aregional computerized component inSamrtskhe-
Javakheti; ICT components were developed and used inmany international projects;
numberofpeople working on computers is increasing; NationalFederation o f
Electronic Sport was established; Optical-fiber cable line for the South Caucasus
countries (Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan) was put inplace inparallel to the railway
network; quantity o f customers o f modem digital telephone systems is increasing;
digital systems are increasingly used for inter-city communications lines and radio
channels. Mobile telephone network coverage and quantity o f its customers i s
increasing, etc. Techno Park - Innovative Fundo f the Georgian Technical University
was established inorder to develop information communicationtechnologies in
Georgia and increase scientific research work inthe sector.

6.5.    Construction

Construction sector represents one o f the largest growing and prospective sectors in
Georgia:
      --  Share o f construction inGDP is 8.8 percent;
          Growth rate o f the sector i s quite highand in2005 reached 22,3 percent in
      -   real terms;
          Construction share inthe commercial banks' total landing i s 11.6percent
          and thus the sector shares first three places together with trade (38.3 percent)
      -   and industry(25.5 percent);
          Number ofcompanies involvedinthe construction business increasedby 7.5
          percent.
Significant steps were made forward for integration o f normative-technical basis o f
the construction with the Europeanand world standards; 18 Georgian construction
norms and rules were introduced; inparallel to other technical norms o f Georgia,
those parts o f the technical norms o f the EUand OECD member countries, which are
mandatory, were introduced as well.
Resulting from the importance andpotential o f the construction sector, liberalization
policy o f the Government assigns specific priority to simplification and liberalization
o f procedures inthe construction business.
Our aim i s to simplifythe red-tape procedures related construction and to set the
construction activity free from excessive state involvement.
As a result of the first stage o f the reform which was implemented in2005,
procedures relatedwith commencement, progress and completion o f construction
works were significantly simplified and, consequently, time-losses for such
procedures were reduced. Results of the reform are following:
      -   "One boardprinciple" and "approved ifnot no responded" are applied in
      --  constructionlicensing and permits;
          Not all construction projects require license;
          Construction works will be put into specific ranges and on some categories
      -   licenses will be abolished;
          Inmostcases construction permits are simplifiedand only submissionofa

      -   construction project i s required;
          The Ministryo f Economic Development issues permits only for contraction
      -   projects o f extraordinary importance;
          For other construction projects permits are issued by local services, which
          means that all construction related issues are arranged locally, without
          involvement of state central bodies;
Further liberalization o f construction sector i s planned in2006, inparticular:
      -   works are ongoing on the construction code which will further simplify
          relations o f construction businesses and the state and will unifythe
      -   regulations o f construction sector into one document;
          acceptance o f completed buildingsinto the exploitation register will be
          simplified: creation o f special commissions for each construction project,
          which include representatives o f about 10agencies, will not be required any

                                            45


          more. Instead, acceptance will be carried out by same agency which has
          issued the permit, which means that the construction business will interact
      -   with only one agency;
          Construction inspectionprocedures will be simplified. This function will not
          be limitedto only one agency and competitive environment will be
      -   established;
          Norms relatedto location o f neighboring buildingswill be simplified and
          clearly determined, which currently i s so problematic that frequently causes
          interruptions o f works and disputesbetweenneighbors


6.6.    RecreatiodTourism

Georgia has considerable recreational and tourist potential. Currently, Georgian
cultural, ecological and adventurer tours at the international tourist markets are
considered to be pretty competitive tourist products. Foreign tourists and visitors in
2005 amounted to 542,000, which i s 49 percent higher than the 2004 figure.

    TourismInformationCenters
One o f the major instruments for development o f international and internal tourism in
Georgia i s establishment o f tourism information centers. This type o f centers can be
seen worldwide and their aim i s to provide tourists with all necessary information.
Functioningo f such centers i s especially important for economic development and
poverty reduction purposes. Peasant or farmers will have the opportunity to advertise
hisproduct (room for rent, food or transportation) free of charge and offer the
information to interestedparties, tourist or tourism agency.
Currently establishment o f informationcenters i s being completed inMtskheta-
Mtianeti, Kakheti and Imeteri. It i s plannedto create these centers inTbilisi. Their
sphere of activity will cover tourism, resorts and recreation. The centers will be also
usefulfor individualtourists.


    Establishmentof Schoolof TourismProfessions
Rapidgrowth o f tourism created the necessity o f establishment of special school or
educationcenter o f tourism. The school will train low level professions, such as chief-
cooks, cooks, waiterdwaitresses, barmen, porters, hotel personnel and etc.
It is animportant project, which will support the poverty reductionprocess inthe
country, giving all interestedpeople to get training, re-training and acquire new
processions, which are highly demanded on the labor market.
Issue o f establishment o f special schools was discussed betweenthe department o f
tourism and resorts and the Ministry o f Tourism of Greece. An agreement was
reached, based on which International Relations Department o f the Ministryo f
Tourism of Greece will manage establishment o f the School of Tourism Professions
and lead further negotiations with the Department o f Tourism and Resorts and
MinistryofEducation and Science (MOES) ofGeorgia. For the timebeing, MOES
has selected a buildingfor the school, while Greece counterparts provided inventory
for the school (computers, tables, chairs, restaurant and hotel inventory etc.) to the
Department o f Tourism and Resorts for temporal storage. Greece counterparts have
also developed the action plan for the school development. All the inventory will be

                                              46


transferredto the school as soon as it i s established as the Legal Entity o f Public Law.
MOEShas appointed the school director, nominated by the department o f Tourism
and Resorts. MOES will carry out the refurbishment o f the building. Greece
counterparts are planning to train the trainers o f the school and organize internships
for the first 5 best students to highlevel hotels and/or tourist agencies inGreece.


    Developmentof InternalTourism
Activities for development o f internal tourism inGeorgia are being carried out.
Special attention will be given to development o f rural tourism, as well as initiation o f
new types o f tourism -agri-tourism and wine tourism. it is sought to be important for
poverty reductionpurposes as well, as it given ruralpopulation opportunity to get
involvedintourism industry,receive alternative income, createsjob opportunities etc.
To support internal tourism special information posters inGeorgian and inforeign
languages are prepared for different Georgian regions and selected tourist and resort
centers, inparticular:

        0    Borjomi region council, incooperation with the Department o f Tourism
             and Resorts designed and printed an informationbrochure on Borjomi
             region, including Bakuariani;
        0    Centre for Resorts, Physiotherapy, rehabilitation and Treatment developed
             and preparedfor printinginformationmaterials about resorts o f Georgia;
        0    It is plannedto print digitalmap o f Kakhetiregioninnearest future. The
             map will include informationabout resorts, historical and cultural heritage
             o f the region, general infrastructure etc. Similar maps o f Mtskheta-
             Mtianeti and Imaret regions are being prepared;
        0    Establishment o f tourist information centers i s being completed in
             Mtskheta-Mtianeti, Kakheti and Imaret. It i s envisaged to established
             centers inTbilisi. the Centers will support development o f internal tourism
             and individualtourism inGeorgia.
             Informationdatabase will be updated systematically, which will ensure
             that the information is available to local and foreign tourists free o f charge.

    Creationof Image and ExternalSupport
Priority target before the Georgian tourism development i s creation o f the Georgia's
image and its popularization. The way to achieve it i s active participation in
international tourist exchanges and exhibitions and promotiono f Georgian tourism
program. It, inthe long run, should increase interest towards Georgia, flow o f tourists
and stimulate demand. For the purpose o f popularization o f Georgia as tourist
country, Georgia was presented to more than 15 international tourism exhibitions and
exchanges. Georgian tourist agencies have actively participated inthis process.
Moreover, Department of Tourism and Resorts developed and published image
brochures and tourist maps. Introduction and press-tours for journalists from
Germany, Estonia, Austria, Holland, Ukraine and Israel were organized.
    Works are inprogress for fine-tuningthe legislative basis for tourism and
recreation sector. As o f today, proposals are already submitted for abolition o f part o f
existing normative acts. At this stage work i s inprogress on amendments and
supplements to other laws and on development o f state regulation mechanisms. It
shall be notedthat new regulations inthe field intendto be based not on restrictive but
on encouraging, i.e. the incentive approach, where observation o f some o f the criteria

                                             47


established by the state will be profitable and beneficial for the private sector. Also,
work is inprogress together with the State Statistical Department on elaboration o f a
method for evaluation o f the economic efficiency o f tourism, which will be based on
international standards.
The Government o f Georgia prepared and the Parliament adopted inAugust 2005 law
o f Georgia on "amendments and supplements to the law o f Georgia on temporary
entrance to, residence inand leaving o f Georgia by foreigners." Based on this law cost
o f the visas will be reduced and visa issuance procedureswill be simplified. In
particular, foreigner visiting Georgia can obtain visa not only at the airport but at any
customs-border points o f Georgia.
Important steps were taken towards simplification o f visa procedures. Inparticular,
there i s no visa requirement for EU, USA, Canada, Japan, Israel citizens entering
Georgia. Bilateral agreement on visa free regime i s reached with Turkey.Passengers
o f cruises visa-free regime i s for 72 hours. Moreover, based on the tax code, 0 rated
VAT is imposed to organization of transportation andtourist services to foreign
tourists
In2006 UNWorld Tourism Organization (MTO) plansto prepare the master planfor
tourism development inGeorgia. The project will be financed by UNDP and other
donor organizations. Foreign and local experts will work on the project for 4 months.
The master plan will also include sub-master plans o f selected regions and territorial
entities. The document will form the basis the tourism policy o f Georgia and strategy
o f the sector development.
In2006 DepartmentofTourism andResorts plansto initiate voluntary self-evaluation
rating system o f hotels, which will support the competitive environment inthe private
sector.


     Planningand Development of recreation-resort zones
Works on legislative changes have continued. After enactment o f those changes
Georgia's resorts will be dividedby types: balnaeological, climatic, sky-resort, etc.
Works are inprogress on launching the tenders on preparationo f Tskaltubo and
Gudauri recreational zones development projects.
According to the decree o f the President o f Georgia # 968 o f 29 November 2005,
status o f recreational territory will be awarded to following resorts, recreational areas,
sky-resorts and Black-Sea coasts:
     1. Gudauri recreational territory;
     2. Bakuriani recreational territory;
     3. Bakhmaro recreational territory;
     4. Urekirecreational territory.


6.7.     EnvironmentProtection

According to the EDPRP objectives, the Ministryo f Environmental Protection and
Natural Resources has determined the following maintargets:
       -   Integration of environmental activity into the process o f social-economic
           development of the country;

                                             48

      --- Strengtheningthe legislative basis inthe environmental field;
          Improvement of ecological expertise;
          Expansion o f international relations and participation inglobal
      -   environmental issues;
          Improvement of quality o f clean and surface water and o f atmospheric air in
      -   the cities;
          Solution o f problems inthe field o f management o f hazardous chemical
      -   substances;
          Protection o f the Black Sea from pollution.
      Followingworks were completed or are inprogress for achieving the
abovementionedtargets:
       1.   As a result ofpolitical and governmental changes inthe country, the
decree o f the Government o f Georgia # 77 o f 22 April 2005, established a new
governmental commission on sustainable development of Georgia. The commission i s
chaired by the Prime Minister and aims at elaborating the strategy on sustainable
development o f the country and enhancing the social-economic planning system. The
strategy and the system should define detailed procedures o f preparation o f national,
regional and localprograms for environmental actions with consideration o f interests
o f involvedparties, publicityo f processes and monitoring o f implemented measures.
      2.    The decree o f the Government o f Georgia # 2 o f 20thJanuary 2005 set the
MinistryofEnvironmental Protection andNatural Resources as aresponsibleagency
for "Clean Development Mechanism" (CDM) inGeorgia. Currently, draft
governmental decree i s beingpreparedwhich will establish the CDMNational
Council, which will issue official confirmation on behalfo f the Government o f
Georgia for implementation of C D M project. As a result o f the confirmation, Georgia
will be given the opportunity to reduce emissiono fthermal gases together with a
party as identifiedinannex 1 o f Kyoto Protocol. As of today, preliminary approval
has been issued for preparation o f project idea notes on three projects. These are:
      -   Reduction o f azoth sub-oxides emission at JSC "Azot." According to
          preliminary estimates, annual reduction o f emissions will equal to about 160
          thousand tons o f carbon dioxide equivalent. Foreign partner o f the project is
      -   the Dutch Ministry for Environmental Protection.
          Reduction o f methane emission during distribution o f natural gas by JSC
          "TbilGas". By the preliminary estimations, annual reduction o f emissions
          will equal to about 280 thousand tons o f carbon dioxide equivalent. Foreign
      -   partner o f the project i s the Dutch Ministry for Environmental Protection.
          Reduction of methane emission from Georgia's central gas pipeline. By the
          preliminary estimations, annual reduction o f emissions will equal to about
          1,400 thousand tons o f carbon dioxide equivalent. Foreign partner o f the
          project i s the "Carbon Fund" o f International Bank for Reconstructionand
          Development.
Currently, the project on "utilization of renewable energy for local energy supply
purposes" i s inprogress, with the financial assistanceo f Global Environmental Fund
and German Reconstruction Credit Bank. The project considers building-up o f a
turnover fund for renewable energy, which will allow for financing o f concessional
loans via commercial banks for implementation o f renewable energy production
projects. Pilot projects consider rehabilitation o f 5 to 7 small hydro power stations
and the rehabilitation-strengthening of geothermal water supply system in Saburtalo
region o f Tbilisi.

                                            49


Law o f Georgia on "State Environmental Control" was adopted which aims at
execution o f real control over the fulfillment o f environmental legislation, revealing
and prevention of administrative violations, restoration o f confidence o f the society
towards the state.
The new law o f Georgia "On licenses and Permits" was adopted inMay o f 2005. In
accordance with this law, the procedures for licensing and permits were simplified,
terms and conditions for licensing were strictly defined and one boardprinciple came
into force. The above-mentionedlaw envisages granting o f right on exploitation of
natural resources by the rule o f auction. Currently the Ministry issues 6 types o f
licenses on use of natural resources, 7 types o f licenses on activities and 10 types o f
permits.
Works onpreparationo f the legislative basis for environmental monitoring are in
progress as there i s no law inGeorgia on environmental monitoring that would clearly
define what surveys shall be implemented inthe country, who shall be the
implementing authority, under what methodology and order, what indicators, what are
the responsibilities on data exchange, transfer and reporting. Legalprovisions on
environmental monitoringare scattered invarious environmental laws. Creation o f the
environmental database i s gradually inprogress, which will enable us in future to
make predictions on expectable environmental trends.
The Ministry carries onpreliminary negotiations with the Environmental Agency o f
UnitedStates ofAmerica andwith MillenniumChallenge Georgia onpreparationof
project proposals aiming at potable water supply to various cities and regions.
Project proposals from KFW on the pilot project for Kharagauli region community
forestry and the project on creation of Javakheti national recreation zone are in
discussionprocess.
Project proposal on the development o f environmental monitoring system inGeorgia
was preparedtogether with Finishenvironmental ministryand the Institute o f
Environmental Protection.
Hereby, projects inthe environmental sector financed by international organizations,
which directly relate to EDPRP shall be mentioned. Inparticular:


"Preparation of a national action plan for fulfillment of the Stockholm
convention on stable organic polluters".
Aim of the project is to increase the national potential for implementation o f
responsibilities under Stockholm convention and creation o f co-ownership
mechanisms inGeorgia including the preparation o f the action plan. The project will
assist Georgia to ratify the convention and to become its party.
As o ftoday, the registrationo f stable organic polluters is completed at the national
level. Within the frames o f the project, following works were carried out in2005:
      -  Registration o f stable organic polluters (pesticides, polychloride biphenyl,
      -  dioxins and furans) was carried out by the methodology o f UNEP;
          Several types and voltage electro transformers, electro condensers and high
         voltage switches were registeredwith the view o f identifyingpolychloride-

Operationalplanof reformsand measuresof the Ministry ofAgriculture for the
mediumterm perspective(2006-2008)
Mission o f the Ministry o f Agriculture o f Georgia i s creation o f favourable conditions
for effective agricultural sector and competitive food production, ensuring food
safety, epizootic and phitosanitary safety and acknowledgement o f Georgia as a good
trade partner. Agricultural development strategy for 2006-2008 was elaborated which
i s in consistency with priorities determined by the government and medium term
expenditures plan. Mid-term priority directions are as follows:
1.       Development o f agriculture infrastructure and reform o f meliorationsystem
management, with the aim to
         - increase production inprimary agriculture production;
         -- increase the irrigated and dry territories o f land;
            Effective system of management;
         - Rehabilitatedirrigationand drainage infrastructure;
         - Effective spendingpolicy, based onunifiedstate policy;
2.       Development o f winery and fight against falsification:
         - Reduce level o f falsification and ensureprotectiono f Georgian brands in
local and internationalmarkets;
         - Creation o f effective system o f Georgian wine quality, considering market

         - Protectionofhealth, life and economic interests ofthe population inrelated
with food;
         - Retain good epizootic andphyto-sanitary conditions;
         - Reduction o f food falsification.

6.9 Energy Sector

Strategic interest of Georgia's energy sector is development o f energy and energy
transport infrastructure interms o f East-West and North-South connection o f Europe

                                                58


and Asia. Energycomplex o f the country due to its geographic location has to
actually get involvedinthe joint processes o f electricity production inCaucasus
region, oil and gas transportation and consumption o f Caspian Sea basin. It shall play
the role o f catalyst for political stability o f the regionand shall become determinant o f
economic integration o f the region; Shall effectively involved intransportation and
functioning of energy carriers, electricity, oil and gas transportation inthe regional
and inter-regional corridor. Energy potential o f transitory electricity, oil and gas major
pipelines passing on the territory o f Georgia will have significant impact on economic
development o f the country.
Major priorities o f state deregulation reform inthe energy sector are the following:
      -   Harmonization of energy legislation o f the country with the European Union
      -    legislationby considering economic factors o f the country;
           Implementation o f legislative changes with the view o f introduction o f free
      -    access and free market principles inthe sector;
           Optimization o f licensing and permits inthe energy sector, fine-tuning and
           simplification o f licensing procedures;
Itshallbe notedherewith, that rationalpolicy ofthe accountingperiodallowed energy
sector o f the country to diversify supply with energy carrier resources. Inparticular,
damaged and difficult-to-access intervals o f 500 kV highvoltage transmission line
"Kavkasioni" were rehabilitated; Electricity transmission line "Dariali", which i s used
to import electricity from Turkish"Ezma HPP" inextreme conditions, was repaired.
Import-export scheme of barter type was arranged with Turkishelectricity system,
which allows for transfer and supply of about 100mw electricity. After rehabilitation
o f Kharadaghi-Tbilisi central gas pipeline, it has become possible to import gas from
Azerbaijan and Iran incritical situations. Agreements with Azerbaijan electro system
on parallel regime operations have been innovated.
Improvement o f consumed electricity registrationprocess i s successfully continuing
indistributioncompanies. Cable work andtransformers ofdistributionnetwork were
fully replacedwith new ones, significant number of computers and special equipment
was purchases. Through improvement o f consumed electricity registration, the
electricity supply of the national economy and population has significantly improved.
Fundamental rehabilitation works are inprogress on Vardnili cascade, Gumati
cascade and Shaori HPP units, where practically new and reliable hydro generator
unitswill be commissioned. Total capacity o frehabilitatedunitsamountedto 350-400
mW.
Interms ofimprovingcollection ofconsumed electricity price, major problemfor
distribution companies represent those consumers, which are not equipped with power
meters. Out o f distribution companies in Georgia, "Telasi" has equipped Tbilisi with
power meters based on own investments, while Adjara energy company was
supported with donor organizations. As a result these companies have achieved
satisfactory level o f collection o f consumed electricity price. Other regions o f Georgia
are still without electricity consumption registration system. This is why regional
distribution companies can not collect price o f suppliedelectricity, which causes
building-upo fthe arrears, which damages entire energy system.
The process o fmetering o f the UnitedDistribution Company is the most important
process currently inthe energy sector o f Georgia. Installation of wholesale, communal
and individualpower meters will create possibility to account for consumed

                                             59


electricity by the population to accrue exact costs o f consumed electricity and to fully
collect price o f consumed power. Non-payer consumers will be individually
disconnected from the network.
Construction o f new gas turbine o f 110mw capacity i s inthe completion phase. 220
kV electricity transmission lines o fKolkhida-Surami-Urbnisi-Aragviwere completely
renovated. 110 and 35 kV transmission lines were repairedinUtsera, Orbeli, Tsesi,
Gudauri, Variani, Dariali and Khudoni. Several substations o f State Electric System
were repaired.
Most critical intervals o f central gas pipeline o f Georgia were rehabilitated. Repair o f
Kharadagh-Tbilisi pipeline made it possible to transport natural gas from Iran to
Georgia. 205thkm interval o f North Caucasus-Transcaucasia central pipeline was also
repaired at river Khuro passage. The gas meter unit was installedat the Georgian-
Russianborder, which will give the possibility to the country to exactly account for
the volumes o f gas imports from Russia. It is important to underline effectiveness o f
those measureswhich were implemented with the view o f consumption accounting
improvement inthe distribution network o f Kazbegi region. 2,444 consumers o f the
region were equippedwith gas meters, which allowed reasonable accounting o f
consumed gas inthis very difficult region and consequently significant losses have
beenmitigated, which was proportionally reflectedinfinancial condition of natural
gas sector.
Firstrange priority for development o fregional cooperation inelectricity sector and
increase of transitory potential o f the country represents rehabilitation-re-equipment
of existing highvoltage transmission lines (500/330/220).
Recommencement o f constructionworks on 500 kV transmission lines Zestaponi-
Akhaltsikhe-Tbilsresi-Akhaltsikhe-Turkey, which has started inSoviet era, is
currently under preparation. Completion o f constructiono f these transmission lines
will allow exporting Georgia's excess electricity insummer to Turkey, Iran and
countries of Middle East. While inwinter it will become possible to diversify the
imports. Herewith financing o f the construction will be carried out through
participation o f interestedparties and private investments.
Total energy potential o f Georgia exceeds 80 billionkWh. Only about 12percent o f
this potential is currently applied. This clearly suggeststhat major direction of
Georgia's energy sector i s intensive application o f hydro-energy resources.
Priority direction of nearest future (3-5 years) is completion o f Khudoni HPP
construction. Construction will be financed by international financial institutions and
attracted private investments funds. Specific priority will be given to construction o f
small HPPs of local importance. Based on existing studies and geographical
evaluation analysis almost on all territories o f Georgia can be implemented
construction o f 8-10 MW capacity hydro power plants. Through construction o f small
HPPs Georgia's energy system will receive about 120 MW additional capacity by
2010.

6.9.1. Energy Security
Inparallelto already existing sources andwith the view ofprovidingfor energy
security o f the country (natural gas demand o f Georgia i s completely based on
suppliesfrom Russia), works continued for infrastructure improvement onthe
pipelines from Azerbaijan and Iran. The gas pipelineconstruction o f Iran-Armenia,

                                            60


which crosses Georgia, createspossibility to export Iranian gas to Europe, which will
further improve reliabilityofcountry's energy supply and will make the additional
source of revenues for the country.
Construction o f Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum gas pipeline, which goes inparallel to Baku-
Tbilisi-Jeyhan oil pipeline construction, shall be completedby 2007. Inthe form o f
gas transit price Georgia can receive natural gas, the maximum capacity o f which will
reach 0.85 billion cubic meters per year by 2011. Considering increased demand on
natural gas inthe country negotiation shall start with partners o f the project to
increase the gas volumes for Georgia. Full satisfaction o f Georgia's gas requirements
from Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum gas pipelinecan not be achieved even incase o f changes
o f contract conditions. Consequently it still remains active to settle the issue o f natural
gas supply from RussianFederation.

6.9.2. Privatizationof Energy Units
All energy unitsofthe country except the systemic operator ("Georgian State Electro
system" Ltd) are subject to privatization. Distributionand generation sector shall fully
become subject o f privatization. After transfer o f the distribution sector into private
ownership collection level of consumed electricity price will be significantly
increased and relevant budgetary revenues will be also increased. Success o f reforms
o f the energy sector as a whole will be significantly relying on the successful
completion o f the privatization process.
Privatization of gas distribution network o f capital o f Georgia i s a first range
objective. Simultaneously privatization list includes the nationalization o f following
important energy units: Rioni HPP, Gumati HPP cascade, Lajanuri HPP, Dzverula
HPP, Shaori HPP, Ats HPP, UnitedDistributionCompany of Georgia, Adjara
Distribution Company and Kakheti Distribution Company.

7.       Rehabilitationofpost-conflict zones, integrationof
refugeesand eco-migrants

Government o f Georgia pays extraordinary attention to the rehabilitation o fpost-
conflict zones and implementation o fjoint projects inthe zones, which represents
important prerequisite for political resolution o f the conflicts. Active participation o f
international community inthis process i s remarkable. Without significant
contribution from international communities it would have been difficult to
effectively implement the projects o f conflict zone rehabilitation.
Out o f ongoing measure inGeorgian-Osetianconflict zone, the EC financed Third
Rehabilitation Project shall be noted, which considers implementation o f works inthe
sectors o f energy, infrastructure and social issues inthe amount o f 2.5 million Euros.
The program i s progressing despite o f few difficulties, which i s explained by specific
conditions o f the zone. Coordination o f the program i s made by Georgian-Osetian
organizational committee established under the auspices o f OSCE. Most parts o f the
projects have been already implemented, while others are inthe phase o f completion.
Majority o f implemented and ongoing projects aim at benefitingboth Georgian and
Osetianpopulation. Third rehabilitation project i s planned to be completedby the end
o f July 2006.

                                               61


Besides GEL 700,000 were allocated from the state budget 2005 for implementation
o frehabilitation projects (35 projects) inTskhinvali region according to the relevant
governmental decree (# 214, of 10.06.05). Important role ininfrastructural
rehabilitation o f Tskhinvali region has the municipal development fund (total value o f
GEL 600 thousand). Inthis regardrehabilitationprojects inthe valleys of large and
small Liakhvi are to be underlined.
It shall be mentionedherewith, that active work is ongoing for increasing of volume
and borders o f rehabilitation projects o f this type. Inthe first range it shall be
mentioned that preparatory works are inprogress for the donor conference planned for
June 2006 under the auspices o f OSCE on "the issues o f economic rehabilitation o f
Georgian-Ossetian conflict zone and surrounding regions". Inparticular,
determination and adoption o f a long process o f so called "assessment o f requirements
mission" carried out by OSCE support and detemination and approval o f priority
directions out o f selected projects o f the parties byjoint monitoring commission. With
the view o f effective coordination o f the activities, the extraordinary organizational
committee was set up, which is represented by highlevel officials from EC, USA,
Netherlands, Belgiumand France.
Social-economic rehabilitation program is being implemented using financing (EURO
3,96 million) o f UNDP, UNOMIG and EuropeanCommission inAbkhazia, inand
adjacent to the conflict zone. The program covers social and economic rehabilitation
o f major sectors, such as power supply, agriculture development, health protection
and main services.
Inparallelthere are ongoing projects ofECHO (EURO 1.1 million), ECD-
DecentralizedCooperationprogram (OEUR0.95 million). European initiative for
democracy and human rights protectionhas been completed.
It shallbe notedherewith that refugees ofthe conflict zone represent one o fthe most
socially vulnerable groups of population. Therefore organization o f social-economic
assistance for refugees inside the country is of most critical importance.
MinistryofJustice ofGeorgia developeda draft onRestitutionandcompensationof
the property damaged duringthe conflict inthe Tskhinvali region.
Draft was prepared with participation o f localNGOs and international organizations,
includingVenetia commission ofEuropeanCouncil. Currently the draft is being
discussed at the Parliament.
The aim o f the draft law i s restitution o fproperty rights o f people who incurred
damage/loss during conflict inthe Tskhinvali region and protection o f their interests.
According to the data o f the Ministryfor Refugees by January 2005, number o f
refugees due to conflicts inthe country amounted to 241,449 out o f which 229,13 1 are
from Abkhazia and 12,3 18 from Tskhinvali region. These data are based on
verification results o f registration o f refugees, which was carried out through support
o f UNHCR. However, it shall be noted that due to non-compulsory type of
registrationprocess many refugees did not participate inthe registrationprocess. 42
percent o f IDPs still reside incollective centers, while other 58 percent stays with
their relatives or inrentedpremises. Number of eco-migrants presumably varies inthe
range o f 100-120 thousand, however due to non-existence o f database, exact number
can not be determined.

                                             62


Considering the above mentioned it still remains a priority direction to update the
existing database and to improve the registration system. Strategy o f the Ministryo f
refugees and settlement with respect to social aspects o f refugees i s to determine real
number o f refugees and to identify people below the poverty margin. It i s reasonable
to diversify state assistanceto refugees by employment inthe state and private
sectors.
With the view o f achieving improvement o f social issues o fthe refugees the Ministry
i s actively cooperating with various governmental andprivate organizations as well as
international organizations involved inimplementation programs, which address
problems o f the refugees.

           presidentZviad Gamsakhurdia, former judges o f supreme and constitutional
           courts) were financed by GEL 319,553.0 thousand, which is the GEL
           34,718.2 thousand higher (72.9percent) than 2004 figure. This is primarily
       -   causedby increase of pensions since 1January, 2005.

Based onparticular targeting o f expenditures, stable financing schedule was set up,

                                            63


which was accordingly reflected intimely financing o f healthcareprograms.
Significant part o f arrears was covered in2005.
Herewith, despite o f achievements o f 2005 it i s necessary to further enhance works
towards fine-tuningo f expenditure policy o f the Ministry and, first o f all,
improvement o f economic justification o f the programs and strengtheningo f control
(monitoring) o f program expenditures. These areas will be attended better inthe
forthcoming periods.

Science amounted to GEL 79,402.2 thousand. The cash expenditures amounted to
GEL 80,941.1 thousand. The following measures were implemented:

       -   Together with structural andpersonnel reorganization o f district educational
           departments andregional school departments, process o f settingup o f
           educational resource centers was launched on the whole territory of Georgia.
           Inparticular, contest ofmanagers ofresource centers was planned, training
           package for resource centers' personnel was prepared and prototype charter
       -   o f a resource centre was approved;
           State educational institutions and major part o f specialized schools were
       -   established inthe form o f legal entity o f public law;
           Financing o f 2005 semesters for general education schools was carried out
       --- by a voucher (per capita) principle;
           Remuneration o f teachers o f public school was put inorder;
           Accreditation higheducation institutions continued;
           Reform o f entrance examination system for higheducation institutions
       -   started;
           Firstunifiednational examinationwas successfully carried out, based on
           which 4,198 students were awarded state financing through state student
           grants.

Transport and Communication - 2005 state budget allocated GEL 125,920.0
thousand for this sector and cash expenditures amounted to GEL 125,896.1 thousand.
i.e. the expenditure plan was fulfilled by 100percent. This number i s twice as highas
the 2004 allocation and almost 150percent higher than 2003 allocation. These
expenditures were primarily directed towards rehabilitation and development o f
motorway network. Increase o f financing has significantly improved conditions o f
common motorways -damaged intervals were rehabilitated; Bridgesand other
auxiliary constructions were repaired.
Tourism 2005 state budget allocated GEL 981.4 thousand and cash expenditure
           -
amountedto GEL 898.2 thousand. Allocated funds were spent on two measures:
participation in "Expo-2005" world exhibition and for organization o f the "Promotion
and Branding o f tourist potential o f Georgia". This included measures for Georgia's
participation intourist exhibition fairs of Berlin, Milan, Finland, Netherlands and
Madrid.
Energy -Allocation of 2005 statebudget amounted to GEL 292,560.5 thousand and
cash expenditures amountedto GEL 230,349.1 thousand.

                                           64


Financing of the measures as determined by operational program o f Georgia's energy
sector was successfully progressing. As a result, an important step forward was made
inthe field of energy security and stable functioning ofthe sector.
Agriculture and Food Products -Allocation o f 2005 state budgetamounted to GEL
54,025.7 thousand and cash expenditure amounted to GEL 41,356.3 thousand.
Environmental Protection, Forest Resources and Land Management Allocation o f
                                                                         -
2005 state budget amountedto GEL 32,534.9 thousand and cash expenditures - GEL
24,478.3 thousand. During2005 activities o f the sector were directed at realization of
the priority reforms as determined by mediumterm strategy.

9. EDPRPmeasures in 2006 budget

Underthe law on 2006 statebudget financing ofEDPRP measures bymajor sectors is
determined as follows:
Social Protection and Pensions    - 2006 State budget allocations to the sector amounts
to GEL 591,323.0 thousand (which i s 10.8 percent higher than 2005 budgetary plan
and 11.8 percent higher than cash expenditures).
Healthcare 2006 Statebudget allocation for the sector amounts to GEL 180,606.5
             -
thousand (1.4 percent higher than 2005 budgetary plan and 9.3 percent higher than
cash expenditures).
Education - 2006 State budget allocation to the education sector amounts to GEL
329,747.7 thousand (315.3 percent higherthan 2005 budgetary plan and 307.4 percent
higher than cash expenditures).
Transport and Communication 2006 State budget allocation to the sector amounts
                                 -
at GEL 168,578.0 thousand (33.9 percent higher than budget plan and cash
expenditure in2005).
Energy 2006 State budget allocation to the sector amounts to GEL 229,749.9
        -
thousand (21.5 percent lower than 2005 budgetary plan and 0.3 percent lower than
cash expenditures).
Tourism 2006 State budget allocation to the sector amounts to GEL 505.8 thousand
          -
(48.5 percent lower than 2005 budgetary plan and 43.7 percent lower than cash
expenditures)
Agriculture and Food Industry 2006 State budget allocation to the sector amounts
                                 -
to GEL 67,950.3 thousand (25.8 percent higherthan 2005 budgetary plan and 64.3
percent higherthan cash expenditures).
Environmental Protection, Forest Resourcesand Land Management - 2006 State
budget allocation to the sector amounts to GEL 24,062.2 thousand (26.0 percent lower
than 2005 budgetaryplan and 1.7 percent lower than cash expenditures).

10. Mediumterm expenditureframework (MTEF)

Mediumterm expenditure planningwas integrated andinstitutionalized into the
budgetary processeso f 2005, which aimed at better targeting scarce state resources.

                                            65


At the same time it is very important, that expenditures are ina direct consistency
with the priorities as set forth by the government. Linkbetween strategic and
expenditure plans was maintained between annual budget and the medium term
planning. All o f these were reflected inthe document o f government o f Georgia on
basic data and directions.
Participation o f three pilot ministries was initially planned inpreparation o f medium
term expenditures program, however all ministries and agencies have got involved in
thisprocess andtheir budgets for 2005 were submittedinthe MTEFformat.
The EDPRP together with other documents have made basis for preparation o f the
"basic data and directions" (BDD) document. The elaboration o f the BDDis,
undoubtedly, a step forward, since, according to the Georgia Budget System Law, it
contains forecasts o f macroeconomic indicators, national fiscal policy, state sector
priorities and analysis o f macroeconomic and fiscal data o f previous years and the
mediumterm forecast (2006-2009). The BDDthe first fiscal document, which
provides for general, macroeconomic and fiscal framework, as well as national and
sector policy, which, consequently, create basis for the budget.This document
determines main directions o f social and economic policy o f the country, while
mediumterm expenditureframework converts those directions into sector budgets. It
createsthe possibility, that the annualbudgets be based on governmental strategic
objectives.
Inpreparation ofmediumterm expenditureframework, MinistryofFinance applies so
called "Up to Bottom" and "Bottom-Up" principles.
Based on "Bottom-Up" principle, the first stage o f 2006-2009 MTEF cycle considers
preparation the mediumterm action plan matrix. The matrix was disseminatedto
ministries and state agencies together with relevant instructions. Final version o f the
action plans are being submitted to the government.
It is very important to link governmental strategies with expenditures. Forecast of
current sector expenditures made it possible to determine ceilings for each agency,
under the budget system law.
According to the Georgia's budget system law, Ministry o f Finance o f Georgia
prepares budgetary circular includinginstructions, and disseminates it to line
ministriesand other recipient organizations. It comprises mediumterm expenditure
framework and represents its integral part. Major innovation for 2006-2009
instructions was the establishment o f multi-year expenditure ceilings for the line
ministries.
Next step would be further integration o f policy making departments o f line ministries
into the MTEFprocess. It is also important to increase capacity o f line ministries in
budget forecastingwith the view of allowing them to independently planand execute
priority reformprograms.
Fullintegrationand institutionalization ofMTEFinto the budgetary process is also
plannedfor forthcoming years.

11.Participation

As it was already mentionedinthe introduction, EDPRP document for the year 2005
was prepared ensuringco-participation principles. Discussion o f the document by the
government of Georgia was preceded by active consultation and discussions inthe
ministries, responsiblestate authorities and agencies. The process was coordinated by
MOED.
Special attention should be given to two-day seminar at Georgian Fundfor Strategic
and International Studies (GFSIS) held on October 17-18,2005, which was devoted to
development o fthe present report. The seminar was attended by all interestedparties:
NGOs and internationalorganizations, representatives o frespective government
organizations, independent experts. The seminar was heldwith support o f CBIE,
CIDA and UNDP.
The seminar was organizedby MOED, EDPRP implementation support project
consultants, representatives o f GFSIS, consultants o f CIDA. Duringthe preparation
periodthe team decided to hold two-day seminar, prepared detailed agenda, target
audience, as well as other details. Inresult a detailed action plan was developed, and
all organization activities (distribution o f invitations and materials, sendingo f the
seminar agenda usinge-mail) were carried out according to the schedule. Intensive
dialogue revealedthat the format o f the seminar and agenda was adequate.
representatives o fNGOs stated that the seminar was a step forward inpublic
discussions.
Duringthe seminar, experts o fthe UNDP supported EDPRP support project presented
materials preparedinconsultation with respective public organizations, on the
following sectors: Management and reform o f public administration, deregulation of
economy, transport and communications, energy sector, agriculture, environment
protection, health protection and social security, education. Presentations were
followed by discussions, which evaluated the ongoing/already implemented r e f o d i t c
component.
NGOspresented their written comments withinthe deadline established by MOED.
Received comments were officially transferred to relevant ministries o f state
organizations with the request to make relevant changes to the year 2005 EDPRP
report, based o f the seminar discussions/materials and NGO comments.
Reports received from the ministries were used for development o f consolidated draft
o f EDPRP document. The report also includes description o f important reforms and
activities, which were not discussed duringOctober meeting.At the same time, the
Government o f Georgia was working on the mid-termaction plan o f reforms in 2007-
2010. These reforms were outlined inBasic Data and Directions Document and
formed the basis for agreeing upon mid-term activities under the EDPRP. These
activities are given inthe annex 1.
