BACKGROUND:             Since the Peso devaluation in late December 1994, the
economic prospects for Mexico in 1995 are bleak, with negative
economic growth, high interest rates and the inflation rate for
1995 now  estimated  to  be about 42  percent.   Open
unemployment is already increasing and likely to increase
further, real wages will decline, and poverty rates will increase.
The Government of Mexico (GOM) is deeply concerned about
the dual impact of increasing poverty and the reduced budgetary
resources available for essential social services targeted to the
poor, and is trying to strengthen existing safety net structures
and protect key social service expenditures. In this context, the
GOM  is requesting US$500.0 million from  the IDB, and



Hii
US$500.0 million from the IBRD to protect essential social
services and strengthen a low cost social safety net targeted to
the poorest and most vulnerable groups.
The proposed Program of Essential Social Services (PROSSE)
is recommended for financing by the two Banks for the
following reasons: (i) it is consistent with the Banks' country
assistance strategy and would complement other IDB-financed
projects for enhancing sustainable economic growth, poverty
alleviation, and human resources development; (ii) it would
provide a vehicle for rapidly transferring substantial foreign
exchange to Mexico to meet fiscal crisis; (iii) it would protect
essential social services and strengthen the social safety net
targeted to the poor in urban and rural areas; and (iv) it would
lay the foundation for efficiency gains in the high priority social
sector programs in the future.
OBJECTIVES:             The PROSSE has three objectives, to: (i) protect essential
social services for the poor, through the provision of
textbooks to all students, and, on a targeted basis, teaching
materials, maintaining access to pre-school, primary and lower
secondary education in isolated rural areas, and provision of a
basic health care package, vaccines, pharmaceuticals, medical
supplies, and community health outreach campaigns; (ii)
strengthen existing social safety net measures, to cushion the
poor from the effects of the economic crisis through retraining,
the creation of short term employment opportunities for the
unemployed and underemployed, and a nutrition program
targeted to vulnerable groups in the poorest areas; and (iii) lay
the foundation for measuring and implementing efficiency
gains in the social sectors over the medium term through
technical assistance.
DESCRIPTION AND    The PROSSE has been designed as a time slice operation to
COST:                   finance ongoing high priority social sector programs within the
budget allocation as of February 1995. It consists of five sub-
programs: (a) basic education services; (b) basic health
services; (c) retraining and employment generation; (d)
nutrition program for vulnerable groups; and (e) monitoring
and evaluation of social sector programs. In each sub-
program, the GOM will seek to improve the efficiency of public
expenditure, within the constraints of the budget and the two-
year implementation period, using agreed monitoring and
evaluation indicators.



iv
The total cost of the project is US$2,000.0 million of which
both the IDB and the IBRD will participate with US$500.0
million each. The IDB will finance the following: (i) Basic
Education Services. US$218.2 million for basic education for
the poor and basic education facilities; (ii) Retraining and
Employment Generation. US$274.8 million for short-term
employment generation in low-income urban and rural areas;
and (iii) Nutrition. US$2.0 million to improve the nutrition
status of the vulnerable groups in the poorest areas.
The proposed PROSSE would be implemented over a period of
two years and is expected to be completed by December 31,
1996 and the loan account to be closed by June 30, 1997.
ENVIRONMENTAL    The Environmental Committee (CMA), classified this operation
CLASSIFICATION:    in Category III, and the corresponding Environmental Summary
was approved on April 18, 1995. The IBRD classified this
program as category "B". Although no major environmental
issues are foreseen, the eventual inclusion of small civil works
projects, as part of the employment generation sub-program,
deserves the consideration of certain precautions and measures
to address the potential negative impacts. Since the eventual
small civil works will be executed through the Secretaria de
Desarrollo Social (SEDESOL), and should the need arise, the
environmental impact of sub-projects will strictly follow the
criteria and procedures already agreed with the GOM in the
Municipal Development Program (Loan 837/OC-ME).
BENEFTIS:              The project would help reduce possible increases in poverty
brought about by the economic recession, through preserving
essential social services for the poor, providing training and
employment  enhancement  opportunities  for  800,000
unemployed and underemployed workers over the two year
period through the Programa de Becas de Capacitacion para
Trabajadores (PROBECAT), plus approximately 550,000
short-term jobs in 1995 for the unemployed poor through the
SEDESOL Programa Especial de Empleo (PESE), providing
enhanced food and nutrition supplements to women and
children in priority areas. Indigenous populations will benefit in
particular from the services provided under the basic education,
health and nutrition components as these programs are targeted
to the poorest areas where the indigenous populations are
concentrated. The primary benefit of the PROSSE for the
selected services and programs is that it commits SHCP and the
executing agencies to support priority programs targeted to the



v
poor.
RISKS:                 The PROSSE may be subject to the following potential risks:
(a) Uncertainty regarding budgetary allocations. Mexico
continues to face a high degree of uncertainty in terms of
macroeconomic variables which determine the budgetary
ceilings. To this effect both Banks will monitor budgetary
releases carefully during implementation.   Should further
unexpected cuts be necessary, then the program size and targets
would need to be reduced.
(b) Program  diversity.  This risk is being mitigated by
concentrating upon a smaller number of agencies which already
have experience with the procedures of both Banks.  In
financing the PROSSE by the two Banks, three principles were
observed: (i) simple process, whenever possible an entire sub-
program would be financed by one of the Banks in its entirety
(such as the basic health services and the retraining for the
unemployed with the IBRD and the short-term employment
with the IDB); (ii) the experience of the agencies with either
one of the financing institutions; and (iii) in the case of nutrition,
the two Banks would finance equally given their intention to
collaborate in a proposed co-financed nutrition project in the
future. In education, both Banks have agreed to finance
specific activities in order to avoid overlapping and possible
conflicts related to procurement.
(c) Poor targeting and failure to make efficiency gains. All
of the PROSSE supported programs are all targeted to the poor
to varying degrees. Targeting effectiveness will be monitored
carefully during supervision and through the physical auditing
arrangements. PROSSE itself, through the sub-program
Monitoring and Evaluation, will lay the foundation and develop
methodologies to measure and incentives to increase efficiency.
(d) Poor disbursements. Disbursements could be retarded as a
result of inexperience of some implementation agencies with the
Banks' procurement procedures. To minimize this risk, training
of procurement staff in these agencies will be organized as part
of the Banks' supervision programs, and technical assistance
will be provided by staff at the Banks' Resident Missions.
BANKS' STRATEGY:  The proposed loan is consistent with Mexico's Socioeconomic
Report (GN- 1778), and the Country Programming Paper



vi
(CPP), as well as the IBRD's Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS). The strategy focuses on the revival of growth, poverty
reduction   and   human  resources  development,  and
environmental sustainability. The proposed loan is critical to
the strategies of both Banks over the short and longer term.
The loan is one of the six operations proposed by the Banks to
respond to Mexico's current financial crisis. It provides a safety
net to the most vulnerable groups affected by the crisis and
helps maintain the gains achieved in social indicators in recent
years. Over the longer term, this project will continue the work
of both Banks in poverty reduction, and human resource
development, which remain key elements to achieving growth,
equity and sustainable development in Mexico.
RETROACTIVE            The proposed PROSSE will be disbursed over the two year
FINANCING:             period 1995-96, with the target of disbursing 60 percent of
these resources in the critical year of 1995. The Banks have
agreed to finance retroactively up to US$100.0 million each, to
help cover eligible expenditures for equipment, books, stipends,
civil works, and food, made on or after January 1, 1995 (in the
case of the IDB) and February 19, 1995 (in the case of the
IBRD).
PROCUREMENT:           The amounts over which public international bidding will be
required will be US$350,000 for goods and services and
US$5.0 million for works.
EIGHTH                 The proposed PROSSE is targeted to benefit low-income
REPLENISHMENT          groups throughout the entire country.  The Program thus
POVERTY                complies with the guidelines for IDB's participation in poverty
TARGETING:             reduction and social equity programs set forth in the Report on
the Eighth General Increase in the Resources of the IDB.
SPECIAL                During negotiations, the Banks and the GOM confirmed that
CONTRACTUAL            the GOM would:
CONDMTIONS:
(a)   endeavor to execute budgetary policy in the social
sectors, including mechanisms to protect budgetary allocations
to the social sectors during the financial crisis and measures to
increase efficiency of such expenditures, according to the
agreed letter of policy intent (para. 2.8);
(b)   release budgetary amounts in a timely manner to the
executing agencies under PROSSE in 1995 in accordance with
the agreed 1995 budget allocations and physical targets



vii

the remaining life of the PROSSE (para. 3.23);
(f)   through SHCP, NAFIN, SEP, SSA, SEDESOL and
STPS: (i) have the records and accounts for each fiscal year
audited by independent and qualified auditors with a separate
opinion provided on SOEs, in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards and procedures, and with the
specific current understanding with the Mexican authorities; (ii)
furnish to the Banks, no later than six months after the end of
each year, a certified copy of the agreed audit reports; (iii)
furnish to the Banks such other information concerning the
records and accounts as well as the audit as the Banks would
from time to time reasonably request (para. 4.21);
(g)   undertake the Quarterly Reviews of the budgetary
releases and physical implementation progress of PROSSE with
the Banks (para. 5.5); and
(h)   prepare a preliminary action plan (including physical
targets and budget, using Annex 2 as a basis), for the programs
to be supported by PROSSE in 1996 as part of the November
1995 review; and confirm a definitive action plan for the
programs to be supported by PROSSE in 1996, satisfactory to
the Banks, as part of the February 1996 review and that no
changes would be made in the allocations for such programs
without prior consultation with the Banks (para. 5.6)).
EDB Conditions prior to first disbursement
Signing of an agreement between Borrower and Executing
Agencies to transfer resources from the loan.



viii
IDB Conditions during the execution of the PROSSE
(i) During the execution of the PROSSE the Banks will monitor
compliance with the program through quarterly reviews. This
review will be organized by the Coordinating Committee, and
will include representatives of all the executing agencies and
NAFIN. The purpose of this review meeting would be to
evaluate program performance against implementation plans
and agreed targets; provide management with feedback on
program achievements, and issues and areas needing
improvement and further develop programmatic improvements
to increase the efficiency of social sector expenditures (para.
5.6).
(ii) During the execution of the PROSSE, and for the next two
years, the Borrower will submit the program's financial
statements. This information will be presented within 6 months
after the end of each year, and duly audited by independent and
qualified auditors appointed by SECOGEF (para. 4.19).
Note: The Loan Contract, relating to this operation, negotiated with the Borrower, is available
for consultation by the Executive Directors.

1. INTRODUCTION
1.1    Facing near-depletion of its foreign reserves, the Government of Mexico (GOM) was
compelled to float the peso on December 20, 1994. A severe currency crisis ensued and, as a result,
the economy is contracting sharply this year. The origins of the crisis, the Government's economic
program for dealing with it, and an assessment of medium-term prospects are detailed in the 1995
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), which is being distributed concurrently with this
Memorandum.
1.2   The crisis in Mexico has prompted the Bank Group, in coordination with the International
Monetary Fund, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the United States and other G-10
countries, to respond with a major program of support. The proposed Program of Essential
Social Services (PROSSE) is an important component of the assistance efforts of the IBRD and
the IDB, in response to the crisis.
1.3   Economic conditions are expected to remain extremely difficult in Mexico over the next
18 months. Open unemployment has already risen sharply and is expected to increase further,
with estimates of up to one million job losses in 1995 (the unemployment rate had reached 5.7
percent by March 1995, its highest level since 1987). Real wages will also decline sharply and
poverty, which already affects about 34 percent of the population in varying degrees, is likely to
increase. The GOM's economic program calls for a very strong fiscal adjustment, which
necessarily requires major real cuts in aggregate public expenditures and defers a number of
important investment programs and projects.
1.4   These events may severely erode the hard sought social and economic progress that
Mexico has made over the past decade: Mexico overcame the debt crisis of the 1980s and
achieved sustainable economic growth after effecting a series of, oftentimes painful, structural
adjustments.  The previous administration introduced macroeconomic stabilization and an
ambitious public sector reform program. The stabilization program lowered inflation to single
digits (from 159 percent in 1987 to 7 percent in 1994) and the gross domestic product (GDP)
grew at an average annual rate of 2 percent over the period 1989-94. The administration
succeeded in re-negotiating the country's foreign debt, reducing public sector debt (from 75
percent of GDP in 1988, to 32 percent in 1993) and reducing the fiscal deficit. In addition to
correcting the main economic imbalances, including controlling inflation, improvements were
made in addressing social issues such as health, education and poverty reduction.
1.5   The GOM is deeply concerned about the possible dual impact of increasing poverty and
the reduced budgetary resources available for essential social services targeted to the poor, which
would put at risk any gains in social indicators over the last few years. The GOM is committed to
protect key social service expenditures and strengthen existing safety net measures. For that
reason, in its revised programmable budget for 1995, the GOM has increased the allocation to
social sector expenditures from 52.6 percent of the programmable budget (1994) to 55.4 percent
in 1995. In this context, the GOM aims to protect essential social services, strengthen social



2
safety net schemes, and to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of its social sector
expenditures through the PROS SE.
1.6   To help finance the PROSSE, the GOM is requesting US$500.0 million from the IBRD,
and US$500.0 million from the IDB, to be disbursed over the two year period 1995-96. The
PROSSE would:
(a)   consolidate and complement other projects financed by both Banks for enhancing
sustainable economic growth, poverty alleviation, and human resources
development (Chapter II);
(b)   provide a vehicle for rapidly transferring substantial foreign exchange to Mexico to
meet the fiscal crisis (Chapters II and IV);
(c)   protect essential social services and strengthen the social safety net targeted to the
poor in urban and rural areas (Chapters II and III); and
(d)   lay the foundation for efficiency gains in the high priority social sector programs in
the future (Chapter III).
2. BACKGROUND AND SECTORAL OVERVIEW
A. Background
(1) The Financial Crisis
2.1   Facing increasing pressure on the international financial markets, on March 9, 1995 the
GOM announced its new Economic Adjustment Program, superseding the previous program of
January 3, 1995. The development of the new program is based on assumptions that in 1995
GDP will fall by 2 percent in real terms and that inflation will run at 42 percent. The main targets
of the new program are to:
(a)   achieve a primary budgetary surplus of 4.4 percent of GDP for 1995;
(b)   limit net domestic credit creation to a maximum of N$10.0 billion for 1995,
(c)   achieve equilibrium in the current account after running a deficit of 8 percent of
GDP in 1994; and
(d)   restructure N$65.0 billion of outstanding debt of the private sector, representing
13 percent of the total commercial bank loan portfolio.
2.2   The budgetary surplus is to be achieved through a combination of increases in tax rates
and utility prices and cuts in expenditure. The program increases: (a) the VAT from 10 to 15



3
percent; (b) liquefied propane gas and electricity tariffs by 20 percent over and above monthly
adjustments of 0.8 percent; (c) gasoline and diesel prices by 35 percent; and (d) tariffs for airports
and railways by 2.5 percent per month.
2.3    A major feature of the program is that the GOM  intends to reduce public sector
expenditures by 9.8 percent in real terms for 1995 as compared with 1994. This represents an
additional reduction of 4.7 percent in real terms as compared with the January 1995 program. In
making the expenditure cuts, the GOM will give priority to maintaining social programs.
Expenditures for ongoing productive investments would also be maintained, but new investment
projects would be postponed. Low priority programs would be eliminated and existing vacancies
would be frozen. The existing system of subsidies would be revised.
2.4   On the monetary side, the GOM will continue to float the peso and let interest rates be
determined by market mechanisms. The private sector and unions are to negotiate freely their
wage and employment packages, subject only to meeting the minimum wage. The program
stipulates a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage starting April 1, 1995, and including a 3
percent fiscal credit (reverse income tax) to those workers earning between 2 and 4 times the
minimum wage. The GOM has also developed a series of financial mechanisms to protect the
liquidity of the banking system and avert widespread insolvency. These mechanisms are being
supported by the [BRD and the IDB through a Financial Sector Restructuring Loan in parallel
with PROSSE.
(2) The Federal Budget of the Social Sectors
2.5   The GOM has stressed the critical importance of human capital development in economic
development in both its policy statements and in its budgetary allocation decisions. Between 1988
and 1994, the GOM redirected its operating and investment budgets away from the industrial and
energy sectors and towards the social sectors. In the federal programmnable budget, the shares of
the energy and industrial sectors shrank from 27.4 and 12.9 percent of the total budget in 1988 to
20.0 and 0.3 percent of the budget in 1994, while the share of the social sector budget climbed
from 33.2 percent in 1988 to 52.6 percent in 1994 (see Annex 1). This reallocation allowed the
operating expenditures of the social sectors to grow at an average real rate of 11.5 percent at a
time when the share of total public sector operating expenditures in GDP stayed roughly constant
(18.9 versus 19.2 percent) and real GDP grew slowly.
2.6   Even before the recent economic crisis, it was apparent that the period of major
readjustment of the budget was over and, as a result, the rate of increase in social sector
expenditures would depend more strongly on the rate of increase of GDP than it had in the past
six years.  There were no longer the same possibilities for reallocating among budgetary
categories as there was in 1988 when the energy and industrial sectors were considerably larger.
The pre-crisis planned budget for 1995 reflected this slowdown. The share of the social sectors in
the operating budget was programmed to increase slightly from 52.6 to 55.2 percent. Partly as a
result of this modest reallocation, but mainly as a result of an expected 4 percent real rate of
increase in GDP, prior to the crisis the GOM planned that, in 1995, social sector expenditures
would grow by 10.9 percent in real terms.

1995 Budget as of Februaiy 1995.
2.7    The events since December 1994 have altered drastically these planned expenditures. In
January 1995 the government prepared a new 1995 budget that incorporated a real decline of 5.1
percent in total public sector expenditures. The revised budget still maintained a real increase in
the social sector budget, but reduced significantly the real rate of increase. The real rate of
increase in social sector operating budget fell from 10.9 to 1.5 percent. Because the impact of the
cuts fell more heavily on other sectors, the share of the social sectors in the total budget grew
from 55.2 to 55.4 of the total operating budget. In current pesos, the total operating budget of
the social sectors is N$149.9 billion and the investment budget is N$23.2 billion. The total size of
the PROS SE program amounts to 7.7 percent of the total operating and investment budget of the
social sectors. Further details of the federal governmnent budget are presented in Annex 1.
2.8   In March 1995, the Government announced further cuts in spending in real terms with the
objective of reducing total public sector expenditures by 9.8 percent in real terms as compared
with 1994. While social sector expenditures are to receive a high priority, and in particular the
programs supported under PROSSE, the GOM is still finalizing the budgetary framework and the



5
allocations to specific ministries and programs and will complete the exercise by June 30, 1995.
The task of identifying priority programs for the PROSSE began after the February 1995 budget
cuts had been decided. Some of the PROSSE priority programs had already taken severe budget
cuts. It is the goal of the PROSSE to ensure that the essential social services it has identified as
priorities will be protected from subsequent budget reductions. During negotiations, the GOM
confirmed with the Banks that: (a) the GOM would endeavor to execute budgetary policy in
the social sectors, including mechanisms to protect budgetary allocations to the PROSSE
during the financial crisis and measures to increase efficiency of social sector expenditures,
according to the agreed letter of policy intent, which is included in the project file (para. 7.1
(a)); and (b) the GOM would release budgetary amounts in a timely manner to the executing
agencies under PROSSE in 1995 in accordance with the agreed 1995 budget allocations and
physical targets included in Annex 2 and that the GOM may substitute an alternative budget,
if satisfactory to the Banks, for the PROSSE prior to June 30, 1995 (para. 7.1 (b)).
(3) Poverty in Mexico
2.9   As key objective of the GOM is the reduction of poverty in Mexico. Expenditures in the
social sectors are a central element in the GOM's poverty reduction strategy. In 1992, 25.4
percent of Mexico's 84 million people were living in poverty, of whom 13 million were living in
conditions of extreme poverty. Although the majority of Mexico's population (73.7%) live in
urban areas, extreme poverty continues to be disproportionately a rural phenomenon, whose
impact is greatest on the country's indigenous people. In 1992, 56 percent of the extreme poor
lived in rural areas and were engaged in agricultural activities. Poverty increased dramatically in
Mexico with the onset of the 1982 macroeconomic crisis, as per capita GDP and public
expenditures declined considerably. Between 1982 and 1988, real per capita GDP dropped by 10
percent from US$4,160 to US$3,720.
2.10  Since 1989, the overall economy has begun to recover and per capita GDP has risen
slightly to US$3,960 in 1992, although it still remains below its 1982 level.  In addition,
expenditures on health, education and poverty programs have increased sharply and the rate of
extreme poverty in Mexico has declined almost to its 1984 level.  Nevertheless, regional
differences remain very strong, with the poverty rate in the poorest states being ten times that of
richer states. The greatest differences are seen between the states of the center and north which
are either industrialized or have large expanses of irrigated agriculture and those of the southeast
which have little industrial development and depend on rainfed agriculture. Moreover the IBRD's
analysis of the Encuesta Nacional de Ingresos y Gastos de Hogares (ENIGHs) surveys for 1984,
1989, and 1992, shows:
* In 1992, the poverty gap (or measure of the average percentage by which the poor's income fell
short of the poverty line) was 8.3 percent, up from 7.4 percent in 1984, although an improvement
over 9.2 percent in 1989.
* Poverty is predominantly, and increasingly over time, a rural problem - 49 percent of the poor and
84 percent of the extreme poor live in rural areas in 1992 compared 47 percent and 75 percent



6
respectively in 1984 - whereas the rural population accounts for only 41 percent of total
population.
*  In 1992, Mexico's Gini coefficient (measure of income inequality) was very high at 0.533, a
significant increase over 1984 at 0.473.
*  Income is slightly more unevenly distributed in urban areas, with a Gini Coefficient of 0.493 in
1992 compared to 0.451 in rural areas - however, with a national Gini Coefficient of 0.533, it is
evident that the inequality between urban and rural areas is a major determinant of overall
inequality.
* The bottom 5 percent of the population earns only 0.5 percent of national income, whereas the top
5 percent earns 29.5 percent of national income; similarly, the bottom quintile earns 3.6 percent and
the top quintile 58.3 percent.
.
2.11 Moreover the GOM is cognizant of the impact of the financial crisis, and ensuant
recession, in reducing income levels and thereby increasing poverty. Therefore the GOM is
determined to strengthen its social safety net to protect the poorest within its fiscal constraints.
This it intends to do through labor retraining (para. 3.12), short-term employment generation
(para. 3.15), a rural nutrition program (para. 3.18) and formulating policies for the more effective
use of resources allocated to food subsidies/ and income transfers to the poor in urban areas.
B. Government Strategy for the Social Sectors
2.12   The GOM  strategy in the social sectors emphasizes the critical importance of human
capital development in economic development and the important role of the state in interventions
which have: (a) a high public goods element (e.g. preventive care for contagious diseases); (b)
economies of scale (e.g. textbook printing); and (c) failures of the market (e.g. lack of service
provision for the poor and marginalized). During a period of economic crisis, the key objectives
of public policy in the social sectors are the following:
*  targeting, programs targeted to the poor will receive priority in terms of budget allocations;
*  efriciency, with scarce resources, the GOM wants to obtain the maximum output per unit
input, redirecting resources to the most effective programs in terms of their outcomes per unit
invested;
*  consolidation, a key element in increasing efficiency is to eliminate overlapping programs,
such as in nutrition, and concentrate resources on a smaller number of effective programs;
*  protection, during a time of crisis, the GOM wishes to protect programs of a high socio-
economic priority; and



7
redirection, over the medium term the GOM wishes to redirect resources to social sector
programs which manifest greater efficiency as an incentive mechanism for improved
performance.
2.13  Within education, the GOM recognizes the problems and has developed an education
strategy to ensure the provision of the basic inputs required to raise the quality of instruction in
the country and to ensure that all children have adequate access to basic education. This strategy
is implemented through programs which: (i) deliver instructional materials, especially textbooks to
all school children; (ii) provide basic school facilities and equipment; and (iii) encourage
community and parental involvement in the school. Over the last six years the Government has
implemented a comprehensive reform of the education sector, including the decentralization of the
system.
2.14   Since 1991, the Banks have supported this strategy through its financing of the Primary
Education I (Programa para Abatir el Rezago Educativo - PARE - Loan 3407-ME) , Pfimary
Education II (Programa para Abatir el Rezago en Educacion Bdsica - PAREB - Loan 3722-
ME), Initial Education (Loan 3518-ME) projects and PIARE (Programa Integral para Abatir el
Rezago Educativo - Loan 846/OC-ME), with aggregate financing of US$1,135.0 million. These
projects seek to increase education quality through a variety of targeted interventions in the states
with the worst educational indicators, which were partly the result of the sharp decline in
educational expenditures during the debt crisis of the 1980s.
2.15  The current financial crisis and ensuing reductions in real Government expenditures puts at
risk the implementation of the Government's strategy during 1995 and 1996, including the timely
execution of the Banks' financed projects. To minimize this risk and ensure continued delivery of
education services, the proposed program would provide support for the most essential programs
of the Government's strategy. The Secretariat of Education (SEP) and the Banks have reached
agreement that these are essential programs to increase equity in access and quality. The program
would support the GOM by financing selected programs of three federal agencies as follows:
National Council for Educational Development (Consejo Nacional de Fomento Educativo:
CONAFE), Federal School Construction Committee (ComiMt Administrativo del Programa
Federal de Construccion de Escuelas: CAPFCE) and National Textbook Commission (Comisi6n
Nacional de los Libros de Texto Gratuitos: CONALITEG).
2.16  In the health sector, the GOM strategy focuses upon interventions to reach the most
disadvantaged areas in the poorest states. Efforts are being made to fulfill the mandate of the
SSA to determine sector priorities, re-allocating resources from curative to preventative health
interventions and transferring decision-making power from federal to state health authorities
(SHAs) and health jurisdictions, respectively. The ongoing IBRD financed Basic Health Care
project (PASSPA I -Loan No.3272-ME, FY90) supports these initiatives in four states' and a
Second Basic Health Project, scheduled for FY95, is under way to support an additional five
states.
I Oaxaca, Chiapas, Gueffero, Hidalgo and the Federal District.

2.17  However, these measures, which increased federal health spending from 2.8 percent of
GDP in 1988 to 4.1 percent in 1993 (accounting for 17.5 percent of total federal expenditures),2
have been only partially effective. Access to health services and their low quality continue to be
problems, particularly in the poorer states. The effectiveness of the public health budget is
impaired by institutional fragmentation, managerial weakness and duplication of services, resulting
in a loss of efficiency, equity and quality.
2.18  The new administration intends to rationalize resource allocation, to search for alternatives
to sole Government provision and financing of health services and to strengthen the role of the
private sector. However, it aims to first address the basic health care problems in the poorer
states in order to establish a sound basis for later launching a major sectorwide reform program.
The new Government intends to deliver a cost-effective basic health care package which includes
both primary health care interventions and essential clinical services, while simultaneously
supporting institutional, technical and financial reform efforts aimed to improve the health
conditions of 33 million uninsured and underserved poor. More specifically, it intends to support:
(a) equitable access to a cost-effective package of basic health services for the uninsured and
underserved; (b) decentralization of health administration and delivery, as well as improvement of
technical, managerial and financing processes in the states, to improve health service effectiveness
and increase the efficiency of resource use; and (c) modernization and realignment of the SSA to
assume an active leadership role in the health sector. Those objectives would be accomplished by
investments at local levels in accordance with criteria, previously agreed with the federal
government. Under state guidance, local health jurisdictions would define risk areas and prepare
annual investment programs to be financed by the federal Government as part of the
compensation program. Competition and incentives would be introduced for states and local
health jurisdictions to prepare the investment programs.
2.19  In employment, the GOM  recognizes the critical importance of both facilitating the
movement of labor from declining sectors to growing sectors as a result of the financial crisis
through the Labor Retraining Program for the Unemployed (Programa de Becas de Capacitaci6n
para Trabajadores: PROBECAT), and the need to bolster the demand for employment over the
short term through the creation of a Special Employment Program (Programa Especial de
Empleo: PESE).
2.20  In view of the declining employment prospects (paras. 2.46-2.47) in the urban and
manufacturing sectors, the GOM has decided re-orient the PROBECAT for at least 150,000 of
the 350,000 target trainees for 1995 (this compares to training of some 50,000 displaced workers
annually over the period 1988-93) by linking up basic on-the-job skills training and short-term
employment generation through infrastructure rehabilitation programs, training for self-
employment and training of new staff within small and medium enterprises (SME's).
2.21  In addition, the GOM  has announced a short-term  employment program  to create
approximately 550,000 new jobs (of six months duration) in public works programs in areas of
poverty and high unemployment. The GOM announced the PESE, on March 17, 1995, at a cost
2Source: Cuenta Publica y PEF, 1993-1994 (Gasto total consolidado)



9
of N$1.7 billion for 1995. The main objective of the PESE is to offer temporary employment to
impoverished heads of families and, therefore, improve the living conditions of those groups that
suffer the most extreme conditions of poverty. The compensation level paid to beneficiaries
would be set at 80 percent of the minimum wage of the appropriate zone3, thereby self-targeting
to the poor.
2.22  The PESE will use the framework of the Municipal Solidarity Funds (Fondos de
SOLIDARID Municipal: FSM) within the framework of National Solidarity Program (Programa
de SOLIDARIDAD  Nacional: PRONASOL).  PRONASOL  is managed by the Social
Development Secretariat (SEDESOL) and funded through a single federal budget line (Ramo 26)
which is combined with state funds based on the annual Social Development Agreement signed
every year by SEDESOL with each state. The FSM is well-designed for this purpose as it
operates under the following principles and guidelines: (a) community participation in project
selection and implementation through Solidarity Committees; (b) poverty targeting; (c)
decentralization and shared responsibility for Solidarity programs with state and municipal
governments; and (d) sharing of program costs among the federal government, states,
municipalities, and beneficiary communities.
2.23 In the nutrition sector, the administration of President Ernesto Zedillo announced in
February 1995 a new national nutrition program as one of the key elements of the new
administration's poverty reduction program.  The President committed the Government to
implement highly cost-effective nutrition programs targeted to the 127 municipalities which
exhibit very high poverty and nutritional risk in nine states (12 regions with the highest poverty
index in these states). One of the four nutrition-food-health programs identified in this proposal is
the cost-effective integrated nutrition program, based on the pilot program financed by
SEDESOL and SSA, with IBRD and IDB support, in the poorest regions of three states in 1991.
2.24  While the economic adjustment effort is laying the basis for more equitable growth, a
coherent food entitlement policy and nutrition strategy needs to be defined. The Government is
currently analyzing the existing programs with the purpose of rationalizing investments, improving
coordination and targeting and alleviating poverty by reaching the most vulnerable groups of the
population through targeted food and nutrition interventions, or direct income transfers.
C. Program Selection Criteria
2.25  PROSSE is a two year time-slice operation supporting the highest priority social sector
programs. The programs were selected from the sectors of education, health, employment and
nutrition according to the following criteria in order of importance:
(a)   poverty targeting, the programs should target either the poor (e.g. health and
education) or vulnerable groups of the poor (e.g. nutrition for pregnant women
and small children);
3 The minimum wage in Mexico is set for three different geographical zones based differentials in the cost of
living.



10
(b)   safety net, the programs should provide and element of a safety net to protect the
poor from the worst effects of the crisis (e.g. employment programs);
(c)   human capital formation, the programs should contribute to maintaining or
enhancing human capital; and
(d)   size, the programs should be of sufficient size to make a significant social and
economic impact and to be able to absorb significant amounts of external
financing.
D. Issues in the Essential Social Services Program
2.26  The impact of social sector expenditures on the welfare of the poor was never as positive
as suggested by the rising expenditures between 1988 and 1994, nor as bleak as would appear
from the likely cut in expenditures in 1995 and beyond. In the past, the increasing expenditures
allowed the social sectors to recover from the sharp cuts that resulted from the 1982 crisis and to
improve social indicators. However, having budgets rising significantly every year reduced the
incentives to pay attention to efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Thus, in education, health and
employment substantial inefficiencies remain, some of which are detailed below.
2.27  The PROSSE program attempts to improve efficiency in both the short and medium term.
In the short term, PROSSE creates a distinction between pre-existing programs that are included
in the program and those that are judged less essential and thus excluded. This can generate a
reallocation of expenditures as future budget cuts will fall on programs outside of PROSSE and
secondly, even if there are not further budget cuts, SHCP would have an incentive to release
funds to the PROSSE programs first because program expenditures would be reimbursed with
foreign exchange. Under PROSSE, the two Banks will finance both the investment costs of the
programs supported, and also the non-wage operating expenses, which would have been cut in
the absence of the Banks' financial support, thereby undermining service delivery of these key
programs.
2.28  The Banks will provide technical assistance through the loans and through supervision, in
the implementation of the safety net programs, the nutrition and employment programs. In the
medium term, the Banks would help support an effort to improve monitoring of outputs in the
social sectors and to link performance to budgetary allocations.
Education
2.29  Mexico has assigned high priority to human capital investment as part of its economic
development strategy. Since 1950 adult illiteracy has decreased from 40 percent to about 13
percent; the number of schools has more than tripled; the number of teachers has quintupled; and
school enrollments have increased sevenfold as the total population increased only threefold. As a
result, by 1994, 76 percent of children aged 4-5 had access to preschool education, net enrollment



I1
rate for primary education reached 98 percent and net enrollment for lower secondary reached 88
percent. In 1993, total preschool enrollment was 1.9 million children attended to by a network of
51,554 schools and about 114,300 teachers; total primary school enrollment (grades 1-6) was
14.8 million children, attended to by a network of 88,918 primary schools and about 510,800
teachers; total lower secondary enrollment (grades 7-9) was 4.2 million children attended to by a
network of 20,032 lower secondary schools and about 151,000 teachers.
2.30 The formal education system in Mexico includes a well-designed and mainly non-formal
initial education (ages 0 through 3), two-year preschool, nine years of mandatory basic education
(six-year primary education and three-year lower secondary education that had recently been
integrated), three or four additional years of upper secondary education, and three to six years of
undergraduate and graduate university education. The public sector provides educational services
for 90 percent of total enrollment. Preschool and primary education are provided in three
modalities, general preschool and primary education; bilingual or indigenous preschool and
primary education, and the CONAFE (National Council for Educational Development - Consejo
Nacional de Fomento Educativo) preschool and primary education models for small communities
in remote rural areas.
2.31  In the education sector, failure to protect essential basic education (preschool, primary and
lower secondary) expenditures could undermine the very high net enrollment rate of 98 percent,
particularly for children in poor and isolated rural areas and indigenous populations, prevent
attainment of increased access for these groups, and improvement in the quality and efficiency of
basic education. The GOM is seeking to protect investments in essential inputs to the sector,
such as textbooks, so that educational quality, cognitive achievement, and thus the efficiency of
expenditures across the sector, can be maintained, and so that the basic educational opportunities
for the vulnerable poor can be expanded.
2.32  Moreover, despite recent educational achievements, there is still a problem of inadequate
access for the children of the rural poor, especially indigenous children in isolated areas. The
population without access to preschool, primary, and lower secondary education is characterized
by extreme poverty, geographic isolation, and early entry into low-paying positions in the labor
market.
2.33   Although management and operation of all initial, preschool, primary, lower secondary
education, and teacher training institutions were transferred to the states in 1992, including annual
budgetary transfers amounting to over N$30.0 billion, the federal Secretariat of Education (SEP)
still has a leadership role on: (a) preparation and enforcement of educational policy norms; (b)
curriculum development and textbook production; (c) support of educational research; (d)
operation of the evaluation system; and (e) design and financing of compensatory and special
programs for an equitable distribution of education services, especially for those states with
poorer indicators of educational development. Among the most important federal programs to
improve coverage and quality of education are those being carried out by CONAFE,
CONALITEG, and CAPFCE of SEP.



12
2.34  CONAFE is a decentralized agency, located within SEP, charged with designing and
implementing Federal Government financed compensatory education programs targeted on the
poor, indigenous groups, and on children living in poor or remote rural areas. The CONAFE
community school system, in which specially trained lower secondary graduates volunteer to
teach in schools built and maintained by the communities themselves, has been designed to
overcome the problem of constructing and staffing schools in remote areas where it is difficult to
attract and retain teachers and where, given the small size of the community, it would be
extremely costly to establish regular schools. CONAFE manages all basic education expansion
and improvement programs designed by SEP as part of the Compensatory Education Programs of
the federal Government for educationally deprived states. The Banks are supporting these
programs through the Initial Education Project (Loan 3518-ME), First and Second Primary
Education projects (Loans 3407-ME (PARE) and 3722-ME (PAREB), respectively) and by the
Programa Integral para Abatir el Rezago Educativo (PIARE) funded by the IDB. Programs
currently administered by CONAFE include:
2.35  Programs currently administered by CONAFE include:
*  The rural community primary school program started in 1973, provides schooling for children
living in rural villages of under 100 population with between 5 and 19 school-age students.
The program trains lower secondary school graduates to teach in facilities provided by the
communities themselves. These teachers receive room and board provided by the community;
receive a small teaching stipend; and, upon completion of 1-2 years of teaching, receive a
scholarship to permit them to complete upper secondary schooling. The program currently
serves 160,000 children in 15,000 community built schools.
*  The rural community preschool program started in 1980. It is similar in design and operation
to the rural community primary school program administered by CONAFE. These currently
serve more than 55,200 preschool children in 5,330 community built preschools, each having
one volunteer teacher.
*  The migrant children program, Atenci6n Educativa a Poblaci6n Infantil Agricola Migrante,
started in 1989, now operates in about 900 locations in nine states, providing education to
8,700 children of immigrant workers.
*  The indigenous children program, Proyecto de Atenci6n Educativa a Poblaci6n Indigena,
started in 1994, provides preschool education opportunities for indigenous children living in
260 communities and provides primary schooling to indigenous children living in 600
communities.
*  The Solidarity Schools program provides educational materials and improved school facilities
to 680,000 children and 25,000 teachers located in 9,500 traditional schools in urban marginal
areas.



13
*  The instructor scholarship program, Sistema de Estudios a Docentes, provides financial
assistance to community teachers in the rural community preschool and primary education
programs to permit them to complete upper secondary schooling.
*  The student boarding program, Financiamiento Educativo Rural that started in 1984, finances
the transportation or the boarding costs of rural students who must go or live away from
home because their home communities do not provide schooling opportunities.
2.36 CONAFE would continue implementing the above described programs in 1995. Despite
this year's budget cuts, CONAFE will maintain its targets as in 1994. It will cover about 46,500
preschool students, 16,000 primary students from community schools, 215,000 students from the
Solidarity schools and up to 38,400 stipends for community instructors about 25,000 fellowships
for community school instructors. To guarantee these targets, PROSSE will protect the approved
1995 and 1996 budgets.
2.37  CONALITEG is the largest producer of textbooks in Latin America. In contrast to the
serious deficiency in textbooks in most countries of the region, Mexico, through CONALITEG,
produces and distributes textbooks in several subjects (mathematics, Spanish, history, science and
social science) for every primary school student in the country. Textbooks on history and
geography for each state and a geography atlas for Mexico are also produced. In addition,
CONALITEG prints and distributes textbooks under contract with other agencies. This includes
books in more than 24 indigenous languages financed under the First and Second Primary
Education Projects, and books to accompany the TV secondary education program, which
benefits children in grades 6-9 in rural areas who have no access to traditional secondary
education. Approximately 30 percent of all textbooks and teacher guides are printed using
CONALITEG's own facilities, while 70 percent are contracted out with the private sector. After
printing, CONALITEG distributes books to about 1,000 warehouses around the country.
2.38  CONALITEG production for 1994 included a total of 134 million textbooks.  The
program for 1995 was to print 154 million textbooks for all levels of primary education and for
preschool as part of the traditional support to basic education. However, with budget reductions
for 1995, CONALITEG would be able to produce only about 98.7 million textbooks. PROSSE
would ensure that CONALITEG will produce 98.7 million textbooks in 1995, and achieve the
1996 target.
2.39  Despite distribution problems, Mexico has done an admirable job of getting inexpensive
textbooks into the hands of almost all primary school students in the country. This experience
indicates the importance of the Government's long-range commitment to textbook provision, and
is a clear example of a successful experience in overcoming the obstacles associated with a large-
scale national free textbook program. However, the aging of CONALITEG's production
facilities combined with the current budget crisis raise questions as to how textbook production
and distribution could be made more cost-effective in the future in Mexico.  To help
CONALITEG in finding efficiency gains a Productivity Study will also be financed under
PROSSE. Terms of reference for this study are included in Annex 3.



14
2.40  CAPFCE is the federal agency charged with managing the constructing, rehabilitating,
and equipping of educational facilities from preschool through university levels using private
contractors.  School construction needs are determined by the State Secretariat of Public
Education in each state and reviewed and consolidated by SEP's General Directorate for
Planning, Programming and Budgeting at the central level. Up to 1994 it had built some 640,000
classrooms or about 96,000 schools. In the last six years it constructed the equivalent to 46
classrooms per day. This agency has extensive experience in carrying out construction under
IBRD- and IDB-financed projects, including the IBRD's First and Second Primary Education and
the IDB's PIARE projects and the Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation project. While
the states and municipalities are responsible for primary and some secondary school facilities,
CAPFCE manages construction of federally-financed facilities at all levels of education, mainly in
rural, indigenous and marginal urban areas. The four highest priority activities are:
.  The preschool construction program  has four sub-programs serving urban, rural, and
indigenous children, including one program of special education for preschool-age students
with learning disabilities (Centros de Atenci6n Preventiva para la Educaci6n Preescolar).
*  The general secondary education program comprises facilities for rural youth enrolled in the
lower secondary education television program (telesecundaria), and facilities for youth
enrolled in technical training programs. SEP has found that TV secondary education is the
best cost-effective alternative to deliver secondary education services in rural isolated areas
where given the small size of the students, it would be very costly to establish regular
secondary schools. In 1993, the unit cost for TV secondary was about 10 percent lower than
general secondary (N$858 versus N$935 in 1988 constant prices). TV secondary schools are
one-room schools with instructional material delivered to schools by SEP through television.
Despite the low student teacher ratio, the low unit cost is explained by the fact that one
teacher covers all subjects. Currently 5,800 telesecundaria schools operate with about 16,000
teachers and 261,000 students. The schools often start in rented or borrowed premises and
once established, move to permanent premises with the necessary laboratory and sanitary
facilities.
*  Boarding schools (albergues) for indigenous students in isolated rural areas.
*  The maintenance program provides preventive maintenance mainly for school buildings in
basic education. The technical manual for preventive maintenance is the same one used by the
First and Second Primary Education Projects financed by the IBRD and PIARE financed by
the IDB.
2.41   CAPFCE had to reduce by 11 percent the 1995 original targets as a result of the budget
cuts. The physical programs that would be protected by PROSSE include those which benefit the
most educationally deprived students. PROSSE will protect CAPFCE's budget to ensure that
these students, generally from poor and rural areas, will benefit from the 1995 and 1996
construction programs; whose intention is to consolidate and house existing telesecundaria
schools in permanent premises. In 1995, the revised program includes the construction of 5,990



15
educational spaces for preschool, 1,990 for TV secondary and 40 for indigenous boarding
schools.
Health
2.42  In the health sector, further cuts in expenditure on essential health services for the poor,
who rely upon the SSA, could widen the existing large disparities in health status between
geographic regions and income groups. Already life expectancy stands at 55 years in rural areas,
versus 71 years in urban areas; and 53 years among the poor, as compared to 73 years among the
wealthy. Similarly, infant mortality ranges from 20 per 1,000 in richer states to more than 50 per
1,000 in the poorer southern states. The budget for cost-effective preventive and curative
interventions targeted to the poor needs to be protected to prevent an exacerbation of these
disparities.
2.43   Moreover, there is an unfinished agenda, as still some 33 million people live in poverty
without adequate access to health and social services. Of a total population of 84 million, 25
percent (21 million) are poor and another 16 percent (13 million) are considered extremely poor,
not able to meet their basic health needs. Real per capita income in the richer (mainly northern)
states is more than twice that in the poorer (mainly southern) states. Urban centers and northern
states have health indicators similar to OECD levels, while in urban slums, rural areas and
southern states the poor are still subject to a pre-transitional epidemiological pattern,
characterized by communicable diseases and malnutrition. The urban elites and the middle class
are increasingly subject to a post-transitional epidemiological pattern with a higher burden of
chronic diseases. These disparities place very different kinds of demands on the health services
and represent a major challenge for the Mexican health care system.
2.44   Sector work undertaken by the GOM and the two Banks in 1994 shows that after 1988
the Government increasingly made health care a priority in its agenda. As a result, total federal
health spending increased nearly 15 percent per year in real terms and reached an estimated 4.8
percent of GDP in 1994. Overall, IMSS and ISSSTE account for 75 percent of federal health
expenditure, the SSA for 20 percent, and the Armed Forces and other parastatal entities, such as
the Mexican State Oil Company (Petroleos Mexicanos: PEMEX), account for the remaining 5
percent. However, spending increases have not been equitably distributed between the main
providers, favoring higher and middle income classes who are covered by the public social
security system. Fiscal transfers to IMSS account for some 0.5 percent of GDP, which is
equivalent to the total SSA expenditures for the uninsured population. In other words, those
middle and higher income population receive the same public subsidies as the uninsured low
income population. Between 1987 and 1993, the budgets of the Mexican Social Security Institute
(Instituto Mexicano de Seguridad Social: IMSS) increased 80 percent, the Public Sector
Employees Social Security Institute (Instituto de Servicios de Seguridad Social para
Trabajadores Estatales: ISSSTE) 23 percent, and the SSA 44 percent, widening the gap in
public services between those already being covered by the social security system of IMSS and
those not covered and attended to by SSA services. Moreover, although spending increased in
the SSA, a disproportionate share of these resources are allocated to salaries and administrative
costs, leaving the efficiency in public health services provided by SSA further deteriorated.



16
Despite the increases in spending by the SSA and the social security institutes, the decline in
quality of public services and increases in income levels have led to a rapid increase in private
sector spending, which now accounts for 2 percent of GDP, or an estimated US$84 per capita.
2.45  Within the health sector, the PROSSE aims to support the following efficiency gains
within the operation of the SSA:
(a)   Targeting of SSA. The current economic recession will increase the importance of
the SSA's health services as service provider of last resort. Many employees,
estimated up to 1 million, will lose their formal sector jobs and will, over the
course of 1995 and 1996, augment the uninsured population dependent on services
from the SSA as health provider of last resort. The budgetary protection will help
the SSA to effectively use its installed capacity to provide more services for a
greater number of patients, and thereby raise efficiency.
(b)   Selection of preventive and basic health care programs. The PROSSE intends
to protect highly cost-effective preventive programs and priority basic health
interventions from budget cuts as identified by the Fundacion Mexicana de Salud
as the initial proposal for the basic health care package. Thus cuts in the sector
would be concentrated on less cost-effective tertiary curative care and the 10
national health institutes.  This segment of SSA  operations will have to
accommodate to a tighter budget and find additional resources through internal
efficiency gains, competition for budgets or by charging patients for sophisticated
third level care services.
(c)    Budget regularization.  Certain priority programs, such as the immunization
program or the cholera prevention program, are financed through savings under
the budgetary allocations for other programs. The proposed program intends to
not only protect the operation of those priority programs but also to regularize
budget allocations to them and include them into the annual budget process.
(d)   Competition for resources. The proposed program would introduce an element
of competition for budgetary support in 1996. Programs which will not achieve
their programmed objectives are at risk of not receiving of the protection program
in its second year in favor of other more efficient and effective programs.
(e)   Inter-state equity.  Currently, the poorer states receive a lower budgetary
allocation per uninsured population than the richer states. A more rational and
equitable allocation system for the SSA budget will be developed and introduced
under PROSSE.
Employment
2.46 Mexico's financial crisis has already had an impact on unemployment. The formal sector
of the economy is beset by three major problems: (a) a generalized reduction in domestic demand



17
caused by the recession, although the tradables sectors will benefit from an increased external
demand as a result of the devaluation; (b) high interest rates (analysis of companies quoted on the
Mexican stock exchange shows that companies in the transport, construction and non-financial
service sectors have particularly high levels of indebtedness); and (c) the impact of the devaluation
of the peso for those companies holding debt denominated in foreign exchange (sectors
particularly affected are transport, non-financial services and, within manufacturing, cement,
machinery, transport equipment, textiles and clothing).
2.47 Under these circumstances, enterprises in the formal sector have started to shed labor to
reduce costs and improve their short-term cash flow and there is no evidence that this trend will
be reversed in the near future. Evidence of the decrease in demand for labor is as follows:
*  Between November 1994 and January 1995, according to IMSS statistics, 231,000 workers
(2.6 percent of total employment) lost their jobs in the formal sector (according to INEGI,
some 753,000 workers lost their jobs in the first two months of 1995). Of these job losses, 36
percent were in manufacturing, 18 percent in commerce, 11 percent in services and 11 percent
in construction. It is expected that another 800,000 workers will lose their jobs by the end of
the year.
3 Open unemployment rose to 5.3 percent in February 1995 -- its highest level since 1987.
* According to the Encuesta Industrial Mensual, there was a contraction in employment in the
3,218 largest manufacturing enterprises of 5 percent in 1994, concentrated in industries
producing intermediate goods and consumer durables.
- There was a 23 percent drop in the number of vacancies listed through the employment
service in Mexico City in February 1995 compared to a year ago.
- Several major banks are in the process of laying off up to 30 percent of their staff.
* The Federal Government is in the process of establishing downsizing targets for administrative
staff, as well as implementing a general austerity program, in line with the latest round of
budget cuts.
* It is estimated that 2,000 restaurants and eating establishments closed during the first quarter
of 1995, with a loss of some 14,000 jobs.
2.48   Set against the context of the need for the labor market to absorb approximately I million
new entrants annually, the employment position in Mexico appears bleak. Open unemployment is
not a viable option for most workers4 - as most workers in the formal sector are not entitled to
severance pay, and there are no continuing forms of income support or unemployment insurance.
4Despite these developments, open unemployment increased only from 3.3 % to 3.7 % between the fourth quarter of 1993 and
the same quarter of 1994. However, by February 1995, open unemployment had risen to 5.3 % nationally and as high as
10.7% in Mexico City.



18
Workers becoming unemployed thus either seek alternative employment in the formal sector or,
particularly in times of recession, swell the ranks of the informal sector, increasing the number of
under-employed and placing further downward pressure on real incomes in the informal sector.
2.49  Whilst it is expected that the devaluation will have a positive impact on demand in the
tradables sectors (both for exports in such sectors as automobiles, transport equipment,
machinery, extractive industries and metal products) and should boost the flow of tourists, the
impact on demand in the labor market will take some months to be realized. In this context, there
is a need for two types of shorter term interventions to bolster demand in the labor market: (i)
retraining programs for the unemployed to help them take advantage of new employment
opportunities in growing sectors and self-employment; and (ii) short term employment programs
through the rehabilitation and creation of physical infrastructure targeted to the rural and poor
areas.
Nutrition
2.50  In 1988 approximately 42 percent of all children under 5 years of age in Mexico were
malnourished. This level is not likely to have improved since 1988, mainly because malnutrition in
Mexico is a function of poverty, infectious disease and poor feeding practices (including
breastfeeding). Malnutrition is concentrated among the poorest households (defined as less than 2
minimum salaries) and in isolated, largely indigenous, rural municipalities. Although general food
subsidies have been the most widespread and the most costly food program, the Mexican
Government has implemented a series of targeted food and nutrition interventions to provide
income transfers and other services to the poor and those who are nutritionally at risk. The
targeted interventions can be classified into four categories, namely supply and price regulation
programs, price subsidy programs, food distribution programs and nutrition education and
consumer information programs.
2.51   While Mexico has historically devoted large budgetary resources for food and nutrition
programs, malnutrition has not been eliminated. There are currently over two dozen nutrition
programs and food subsidies in operation in Mexico, which in 1995 will cost well over US$500
million. These are designed to help the poor covered by all food and nutrition programs
(estimated to be approximately 16 million people or about 2.7 million families).
2.52   The main problems with the existing nutrition programs are that they fail to reach those at
highest risk of malnutrition (especially in rural areas) and that there is no coordination or
coherence among programs with respect to goals, targeting criteria, monitoring systems, or
delivery systems. The budget for such programs is highly concentrated in urban areas, where
programs overlap in coverage, and whilst in the highest risk rural areas there is a lack of coverage.
Many of the national programs distribute food but the food basket delivered is highly variable
with respect to commodities, nutritional value, and cost. An additional concern is that none of the
programs in place at present are addressing micronutrient deficiencies: for example, iodine
deficiency continues to be a problem in mountainous areas, and iron deficiency is widespread
particularly among the poor. The current expenditures on food and nutrition are not cost-efficient
or effective in overcoming malnutrition. The GOM recognizes that many of the reforms necessary



19
in the nutrition sector require further study and the GOM is seeking additional program support
from the Banks in the field of food and nutrition.
2.53   To improve the effectiveness of nutrition programs in rural areas, in 1991 the GOM
implemented a pilot Integrated Nutrition Health Program, financed by SEDESOL and SSA, with
IBRD (under loan 3357-ME) and IDB support, in the poorest regions of three states. This
intervention included growth monitoring, nutrition education, kitchen gardens, community public
works, and a food basket delivered monthly to families with malnourished children. The project
was carried out by community volunteers operating under the aegis of SEDESOL and the state
Secretariat of Health. An evaluation found that the program was highly cost-effective: the per
capita cost of the project was US$20 per beneficiary (including all family members in the targeted
household) or US$85 per vulnerable individual (pregnant and lactating women and children under
5). In the more malnourished community the rate of moderate and severe malnutrition fell from
18.5 percent to 5.1 percent; in the other community the rate fell from 8.7 percent to 8.2 percent.
The "scaling up" of the pilot nutrition, food and health program, with the modifications suggested
by the evaluation, in these nine states will be supported by SEDESOL under PROSSE(para.
3.20). The priority states, high risk regions and municipalities were selected through the following
criteria: (a) CONAPO Poverty Index;5 (b) national census of growth monitory (children less than
five years of age, 1994); (c) health indicators; (d) national food consumption data; and (e)
health/nutrition indicators of specific nutrition deficiency studies done in Oaxaca, Puebla, Hidalgo
and parts of Veracruz.
E. Lessons Learned from Past Operations
2.54   Many lessons have been leamt from a wide range of social sector projects which have
been undertaken in Mexico. The relevant projects are summarized in Table 4.
5 The CONAPO poverty index ranks states, jurisdictions and municipalities based on results of "principal
components analysis", using the 1990 INEGI census, which takes the following variables into account: (a)
population density; (b) illiteracy in population >15 years; (c) population >15 years without primary schooling;
(d) sanitation; (e) percentage of households without electricity; (f) drinking water; (g) percentage of
overcrowded households; (h) percentage of households with dirt floor; (i) percentage of population in localities
of fewer than 5000 inhabitants; (j) per capita income of less than two minimum salaries; and (k) presence of
indigenous population. The national average would receive the index "0". A composite index between 0 and
I would be considered as "high", between I and 2 as "very high". A negative index (below 0) would indicate a
better than national average poverty situation ("low") and would not be considered for the project.

2.55 The relevant lessons which have been incorporated into PROSSE are as follows:
Education
2.56 Education Quality and Non-personnel Expenditures. The channeling of resources to
non-personnel costs has been instrumental in improving the quality of primary education in
targeted areas. Access to textbooks has been one of the most cost effective education inputs to
increase students' academic performance. There is vast empirical evidence, including studies
financed by the First Primary Education (IBRD) and PIARE (IDB)  Projects, indicating that



21
textbooks improve student knowledge of science, mathematics and language. PROSSE builds
upon this experience by financing textbooks, infrastructure and other educational materials in rural
areas. PROSSE would expand the coverage of CONAFE programs by financing teacher stipends,
for volunteers in single teacher school who could not otherwise be appointed, leaving small
communities without teachers, and thus without schools.  CAPFCE would finance the
consolidation of existing schools, improve the quality of schooling and widen the range of
subjects so that existing teachers provide effective education.
2.57  Access to Basic Education in Rural Areas. Low access in rural areas is due in part by
the poor living standards of the family, and by the lack of adequate schooling system and
infrastructure. SEP regular services are not provided in many small rural communities, but a low
cost alternative education modality, with strong community participation, have been successfully
developed by CONAFE.
2.58  Targeting.  The most effective way to reach the economically and educationally
disadvantaged is by specifically targeting the poor. Both CONAFE and CAPFCE focus most.
project activities to the poorest areas of the country thereby serving small communities selected
for their low socio-economic status (utilizing the CONAPO index).
Health
2.59  The ongoing IBRD financed First Basic Health Project was the first IBRD experience with.
a health related project in Mexico and provided the most valuable source for lessons learned to
consider for the proposed program. Accordingly, the critical evaluation of the implementation
experience of this project helped to transfer positive lessons into the design of the proposed
program. Positive features that are critical for the SSA to accomplish its mandate to provide
health benefits for the uninsured population are:
2.60 Targeting. While the First Basic Health Project targeted poor states, resources often did
not reach populations most in need within the state. Therefore, it is necessary to target delivery of'
a cost-effective basic health care package to the most disadvantaged municipalities within a poor
state. This is the approach being followed under PROSSE.
2.61  Improve Access to Basic Health Care. The First Basic Health Project supported
infrastructure rehabilitation of first level health centers and second level hospitals in order to
provide an environment suitable for basic services of high quality for the uninsured. It has been
demonstrated that the use factor of rehabilitated facilities increased significantly. PROSSE will
continue to finance the rehabilitation of the first and second level care network to provide quality
services to the uninsured.
2.62  Rural Staffing. Basic Health I supported the training and recruitment of community
health care workers which are selected by the community where they will serve. They were
utilized in the project for staffing health posts in communities where no medical doctor was.
available. The PROSSE will build on this experience and finance training for community health.
workers to serve remote communities.



22
2.63  Build Ownership in the States. Basic Health I featured institution building activities by
supporting local decision-making and problem solving, decentralizing procurement of essential
supplies and improving the management capacity and the management information systems at the
local level. PROSSE will continue to support project states in procurement and implementation
matters through the health sub-program.
Employment
2.64 Positive Impact of Training Programs and the Need for Targeting. The IBRD's
experience with both pre-service and in-service training has demonstrated their positive impact
both in increasing the earnings profile of trainees and meeting the needs of private and public
sector skilled employees. Careful use of the selection criteria agreed under the Labor Market and
Productivity Enhancement Project (Loan 3542-ME, FY93) will be continued under PROSSE for
the regular PROBECAT programs will be continued but modified as necessary in relation to para.
2.68. However, these trainees with lesser educational attainments and work experience would be
able to participate in the on-the-job training modality (Annex 4).
2.65  Public and Private Sector Linkages. Experience has shown that close collaboration is
required between publicly funded training institutions and the private sector to ensure that course
content and graduate output match employers' needs and hence employment opportunities
available. PROSSE will promote a stronger linkage between public and private sector for the
regular PROBECAT program.
2.66 Flexibility and Adaptability. The economic crisis in Mexico has focused attention on
the need to shift training and education programs away from rigid courses with a low probability
of directly related employment in the formal sector thereafter. PROSSE responds to this by
supporting combined basic skills and direct employment in rehabilitation programs.
2.67 Unemployment versus Underemployment. Experience in Mexico has shown that open
unemployment is the tip of the iceberg. A more serious problem is underemployment, with the
need being to increase the productivity of employees. Under PROSSE, PROBECAT will be
opened up to the underemployed in both the formal and informal sector to acquire skills, enhance
their productivity an obtain more secure employment.
Nutrition
2.68  Overall Program Design: The evaluation of the pilot nutrition-project conducted under
the IBRD's Second Agricultural Structural Adjustment Loan (Ln. 3357-ME, AGSAL II, FY91),
co-financed by the IDB, found that: (a) measurable results should not be expected before two
years of program implementation; (b) the program should be targeted to the places with the
highest rates of malnutrition; (c) the food basket should contain no more than a few commodities
and yet address micronutrient deficiencies; (d) implementing agencies at the state level and
community levels should be clearly defined; (e) the nutrition education, including growth
monitoring, needs careful design and integration with the rest of the intervention package; and (f)



23
the community volunteers need close supervision and monitoring. These lessons have been
incorporated into the integrated nutrition sub-program to be supported under PROSSE, which
will be closely monitored and objectively evaluated.
2.69  Targeting.  The evaluation of the pilot nutrition project under the AGSAL II confirms
that a well-targeted and executed nutrition program can have a substantially positive effect on the
nutrition and health status of vulnerable population groups. PROSSE will expand this positive
experience in rural areas of the poorest states of Mexico.
2.70  Distribution of Micro-nutrients. Experience in El Salvador, Guatemala, and the
Dominican Republic suggests that fortified baked products can be highly cost-effective in
addressing micronutrient deficiencies in school children in whom such deficiencies cause learning
problems. Therefore, in addition to the basic food and nutrition package, PROSSE will finance
pilot testing of a vitamin and mineral-enriched cookie in the school breakfast so as to better
address micronutrient deficiencies in school-aged children (whilst this does not represent a safety
net measure it addresses an important long-term nutritional goal).
2.71   Distribution System. The distribution of food to the targeted population groups requires
a well established distribution system and executing agency capable of organizing the beneficiaries
to participate in the logistics of food distribution. PROSSE will utilize existing public or private
networks to provide these services and, in addition, will expand it through the health services
network. PROSSE will also use the network of facilities of the National Indigenous Institute in
the most remote rural areas amongst indigenous populations.
2.72  Nutrition Education: The literature on food supplementation programs suggests that
any food transfer should be accompanied by nutrition education and growth monitoring to effect
behavioral change in the family and to communicate to the family about the increased nutritional
needs of pregnant and lactating women and preschool children.  The costs of this program are
modest compared to food supplementation programs in other countries.
F. Rationale for the Banks' Involvement
2.73  The proposed loan is consistent with the IBRD's CAS which will be discussed by the
Board on June 15, 1995 and the IDB's Country Programming Paper (CPP), to be discussed with
the GOM later this year. The strategy focuses on the revival of growth, poverty reduction and
human resources development, and environmental sustainability. The proposed loan is critical to
the IBRD's CAS and the IDB's CPP over both the short and longer term. The loan is one of the
six operations proposed by both Banks to respond to Mexico's current financial crisis. It provides
a safety net to the most vulnerable groups affected by the crisis and helps maintain the gains
achieved in social indicators in recent years. Over the longer term, this program will continue the
work of both Banks in poverty reduction and human resource development, which remain key to
achieving growth, equity and sustainable development in Mexico.



24
2.74  The IBRD and the IDB are the major institutions that have financed social sector
investment in recent years and are the only institutions which can provide the magnitude of the
external financial resources to support essential social service programs in Mexico during its
current fiscal difficulties. The Banks have built up an in-depth knowledge of the social sectors in
Mexico through their extensive operations and sector work. The Banks' experience in supporting
project activities in the social sectors provides the foundation for program improvements which,
although limited due to the short duration of this program, are supported under PROSSE.
Moreover, the experience gained in project implementation by the executing agencies with the
Banks' policies and procedures will facilitate the rapid disbursement of the loan funds, which is
essential for purposes of the overall macroeconomic stabilization program.
3. THE PROGRAM
A. Program Objectives
3.1   The PROSSE has three objectives, to: (a) protect essential social services for the poor,
through the provision of textbooks to all students, and on a targeted basis, teaching materials,
maintaining access to pre-school, primary and lower secondary education in isolated rural areas, a
basic health care package, vaccines, pharmaceuticals and medical supplies, and community health
outreach campaigns; (b) strengthen existing social safety net measures, to cushion the poor
from the effects of the economic crisis through retraining, the creation of short term employment
opportunities for the unemployed and underemployed, and a nutrition program targeted to
vulnerable groups in the poorest areas; and (c) lay the foundation for measuring and
implementing efficiency gains in the social sectors over the medium term through technical
assistance and program monitoring.
B. Program Description
3.2   The PROSSE has been designed as a time slice operation to finance ongoing high priority
social sector programs within the existing budgetary allocations. It consists of five sub-programs:
(a) basic education services; (b) basic health services; (c) retraining and employment
generation; (d) food and nutrition programs for vulnerable groups; and (e) monitoring and
evaluation of social sector programs. In each sub-program, the GOM will seek to improve the
efficiency of public expenditure, within the constraints of the two-year implementation period,
using agreed monitoring and evaluation indicators. Each of these sub-programs is summarized
below:
(1) Sub-Program 1: Basic Education Services
3.3   The basic education services sub-program  (total cost US$593.5 million), to be
implemented by SEP through dependent agencies, would support the Government's strategy to
improve equity in access and to raise quality of basic education. The program would obtain this



25
by increasing access to preschool, primary, and lower secondary education for the poor and the
rural and indigenous children living in the most deprived and remote areas in the country; and by
supporting two of the most important factors related to low quality of education, adequate
physical facilities and access to textbook in the classroom. The program would do this by
providing budget support for the three federal programs described below.
3.4   Basic Education for the Rural Poor (US$132.4 million or 6.6 percent of total costs),
to provide schooling to rural isolated preschool- and primary education-aged children by
supporting CONAFE's programs. The program would benefit 46,500 rural community preschool
students; 161,000 rural community primary school students; and provide up to 21,000 stipends
for former community instructors; up to 38,400 stipends for community instructors; up to 14,600
stipends for transportation or boarding, mainly for lower secondary education students; and about
215,000 Solidarity School students. These expenditures financed by the IDB loan will enable
single teacher schools to remain open continuously.
3.5   Textbooks for Basic Education (US$161.5 million or 8.1 percent of total costs), to
provide 91.5 million textbooks for primary education students in the country and 7 million teacher
guides (32 different topics) through financing of CONALITEG in 1995, and at least the same
quantities in 1996; and to support a productivity study of the cost-effectiveness of
CONALITEG's existing production and distribution system. The agreed terms of reference are
included in Annex 3. During negotiations, the GOM confirmed that it would review the results
of the CONALITEG productivity study and present an action plan to the Banks by July 31,
1 996 (para. 7.1 (c)).
3.6   Improvement and Expansion of Educational Facilities (US$299.6 million or 15.0
percent of total costs), to support CAPFCE's 1995 program regarding: (a) construction of 5,990
educational spaces, including classrooms and support facilities, for preschool serving rural and
indigenous children and children in urban marginal areas; (b) construction and equipping an
estimated 3,720 educational spaces, including classrooms, workshops, store rooms, sanitary
facilities, and support facilities, for TV secondary schools; and (c) construction of 40 educational
spaces for Indigenous Boarding Schools. The construction referred to in (a), (b) and (c) above is
entirely for the replacement or extension of inadequate schools or the replacement of rented
premises with purpose built structures. No new schools will be established under this sub-
program. CAPFCE program administration, infrastructure for training, building maintenance, and
constructing and equipping technical secondary facilities will be financed by the IDB loan.
(2) Sub-Program 2: Basic Health Services
3.7   The Basic Health Services Sub-program  (total cost US$746.5 million) to be
implemented by the SSA, would benefit the 33 million uninsured population through the following
activities.
3.8   Priority Preventive Programs, (US$307.9 million or 15.4 percent of total costs) which
are cost effective public health interventions, by: (i) immunizing 20 million children annually



26
against the most common preventable diseases; (ii) control and treatment of endemic and
communicable diseases; (iii) screening for early detection of diabetes, and other chronic diseases,
involving over 4 million patients annually; (iv) family planning and reproductive health for about
2.5 million new users per year; (v) maternal and child health, pre-and postnatal care, benefiting
about 9 million individual patients annually; and (vi) health and nutrition education and social
marketing of public health programs.
3.9   Basic Curative Health Care, (US$335.7 million or 16.8 percent of total costs) for the
33 million uninsured population, would be delivered through the basic health care and mobile
outreach units.
3.10  Basic Health Infrastructure, (US$102.9 million or 5.1 percent of total costs) civil
works, equipment and maintenance for first and second level health facilities and public health
laboratories scheduled to be initiated in 1995 and concluded by the end of 1996 would be
undertaken by   Infrastructure Division of the SSA  (Coordinaci6n General de Obra,
Conservacion yEquipamiento;CGOCE).
3.11  To implement the above actions, PROSSE would finance: the civil works program; the
acquisition, storage and distribution of vaccines, essential drugs, medical supplies and basic
equipment to the first and second level care network (i.e. health posts, health centers,
jurisdictional centers and second level hospitals); community outreach and per diem and travel for
supervision personnel and on a declining basis.
(3) Sub-program 3: Retraining and Employment Generation
3.12  The employment sub-program (total cost US$644.2 million) includes two elements: (i)
retraining and stipends for 350,000 unemployed and underemployed workers in 1995 and 450,000
in 1996 through PROBECAT, managed by STPS, to enhance worker productivity and
employment prospects (see para. 2.20); and (ii) short-term employment generation through
infrastructure development in low income urban and rural areas through the PESE (see para.
2.22).
3.13  Retraining for the Unemployed - PROBECAT - (US$225.9 million or 11.3 percent of
total costs). At least 150,000 of the trainees each year would benefit from a new training
modality under PROBECAT, receiving basic skills on-the-job training in areas such as plumbing,
electricity, brick-laying plus a stipend to work in rehabilitation and public works programs in low
income areas or whilst training to establish their own small businesses. The remaining trainees
would follow the more traditional PROBECAT modality of training center and in-plant training.
The average stipend would be for three months set at the level of 1 minimum wage (currently
ranging N$15 to 18 per day) plus a small transport allowance. About 30 percent of the stipends
would go to rural beneficiaries. These stipends represent an investment in the human capital of the
individuals concerned, financing the opportunity cost of the training time, acting as an incentive
for enhancing skills and, as a by-product, providing social support to the families of these low-
income targeted trainees. They would be financed by the loans on a declining basis. The



27
effectiveness of both the ongoing and new PROBECAT modalities will be evaluated through the
ongoing evaluation program under the Labor Market and Productivity Enhancement Project
(Loan 3542-ME).  The selection criteria for the different modalities under PROBECAT,
distribution of beneficiaries by state (as of April 28, 1995) and detailed responsibilities for the on-
the-job training modality are attached in Annex 4.
3.14  PROSSE would finance the cost of training, stipends and up to 10,000 tool-kits required
for the on-the-job training modality. The cost of materials for the rehabilitation would be financed
by the beneficiaries. Though the staff assigned for this task will be located within the offices of
the State Employment Services (SEEs) and use their physical infrastructure, the program of
stipends will be financed completely by the federal budget and the loans. In addition to the 99
SEE offices, the SEEs will use the 51 mobile units purchased under the Labor Market and
Productivity Enhancement Project (Ln. 3542-ME, FY93) for expanding the coverage to the
unemployed and underemployed in small urban and rural areas.
3.15 Short-term Employment Program - PESE - (US$418.3 million or 20.9 percent of total
costs). The GOM will carefully ensure that the paid labor approach under the PESE will not
undermine the longer-term community participation approaches under PRONASOL. This will be
achieved in two ways: (a) through making it clear that the paid employment activities are time-
bound; and (b) by funding only certain categories of sub-projects which have a high public goods
element.
3.16  The budgetary allocation for the PESE will come from the states' Social Development
Agreements (i.e. federal funds allocated to each of the nation's 31 states for social development
programs under PRONASOL). The PESE will be coordinated through SEDESOL utilizing the
existing administrative and financial mechanisms established under the FSM (para. 2.22). In
1995, N$1.2 billion (approximately US$200.0 million) has been allocated to rural areas with a
high poverty rate and indigenous population together with N$500.0 million (US$83.0 million) for
urban areas with serious unemployment and poverty problems. It is anticipated that the rural
component would extend beyond 1995, whilst a decision on the urban component would be taken
in the light of developments in the urban labor market during 1995. PROSSE will fund the costs
of the PESE in all these states not already covered under the IBRD supported Second
Decentralization & Regional Development project (Loan 3357-ME).6 However, in these 8 states,
PROSSE will finance PESE in the large urban municipios not covered under Loan 3357-ME and
may finance categories of sub-projects not eligible for financing under this Loan.
3.17  Eligible labor intensive activities under the PESE include construction and maintenance of
rural roads, spot road improvements, cleaning of drainage canals, garbage removal, reforestation,
and conservation programs for soil and water. The state and municipal governments will discuss
and approve specific programs in which to invest the funds. In rural areas, each community,
through the respective Municipal Council, will be directly responsible for selecting an investment
program. Selection of beneficiaries will be self-targeting through the low compensation (only 80
percent of the minimum wage) for the heavy manual work involved. PROBECAT would be able

to train skilled laborers necessary to complement unskilled laborers for the public works
undertaken (para. 3.13). During negotiations agreements were confirmed that the GOM would
execute the PESE through SEDESOL according to the agreed operational modalities (para
7.1(d)).
(4) Sub-program 4: Nutrition
3.18  With respect to key social safety net schemes, the GOM expects a markedly increased
demand due to the economic crisis. Therefore, it is seeking external support for only those
priority nutrition programs which are cost-effective and well targeted to the vulnerable
population groups, such as young children, pregnant and lactating women, in the poorest states.
3.19  The integrated nutrition sub-program (total cost US$8.7 million) would be based on
nutrition and health interventions to improve the nutrition status of the vulnerable groups. The
program would provide a package of interventions for poor rural families with vulnerable groups
(children under age 5, pregnant and lactating women) consisting of: (a) the distribution of a basic
food supplement basket (containing maize flour, beans, salt, sugar and vegetable oil); (b)
micronutrient supplementation; (c) growth monitoring; and (d) health and nutrition education.
Micronutrient supplements would include: (i)  iodized salt because of widespread iodine
deficiency in the highest risk areas; and (ii) iron tablets along with supportive counseling to
pregnant women, and operations research to find better means of encouraging pregnant women to
take iron pills. The community would participate in the program by assisting in the food
distribution process and developing complementary activities, such as construction of latrines,
improvement in water supply and housing, and establishment of vegetable gardens. A simplified
set of indicators has been selected to monitor both the delivery of inputs and impact on the
beneficiaries. The beneficiaries will be strictly monitored to ensure compliance with the targeting
objectives of the food supplements. This will be reviewed by the Banks quarterly (para. 5.5).
3.20 At the central level, the SSA, SEDESOL and DIF (Desarrollo Integral de la Familia -
Integrated Family Development) would be the apex organizations which would devolve to the
state and municipal governments the implementation of the program. At the state level, in the
case of Hidalgo, the operational responsibility would rest with state government under the
coordination of the SSA. Beginning in 1995, Hidalgo state will begin to implement the
consolidated nutrition program in the highest risk municipalities. The state of Hidalgo was
selected as a model for this sub-program of the PROSSE, because it is in a more advanced
planning stage, and the state has already established the necessary agreements with the federal
agencies to coordinate the nutrition interventions, thereby improving efficiency. Similar programs
would be extended to the other of priority states (such as Puebla, Oaxaca and Guerrero) in 1996
under the coordination of SEDESOL and DIF. The nutrition program supported by PROSSE
amounts to an investment of US$20 per beneficiary per year.
3.21  Initially, the food would be procured by the executing agencies through the National
Distributing Company (DICONSA) and then to be transferred to SEDESOL in 1995. However,



29
to expand the programs in 1996, SEDESOL would review the mechanisms of provision,
transportation and storage of food baskets to reach the remote targeted areas.
(5) Sub-Program 5: Monitoring and Evaluation
3.22 The Monitoring and Evaluation Sub-Program (US$2.1 million or 0.1 percent of total
costs) will strengthen the capacity of SHCP to measure and monitor and evaluate the outputs of
social sector expenditures, thereby providing the foundation for a system to increase efficiency in
expenditures throughout the social sectors over the medium term. The IBRD loan will finance
technical assistance to establish such a system, and the costs of a program of physical audits and
beneficiary assessments within the social sectors.
3.23  The initial stage in this process is to establish a reliable set of monitoring indicators which
relate outputs (services delivered) and outcomes (improvements in welfare by beneficiaries) to a
common input (actual expenditures). Unfortunately, many implementing agencies treat output
indicators inadequately. Thus PROSSE will finance consultants services to establish a set of
appropriate monitoring indicators for the social sectors, measure baseline data and establish a
system of incentives for executing agencies to increase efficiency by linking budgetary allocations
to improvements in performance. Such a system will also enable explicit decisions to be made on
the poverty targeting and inter-state equity of public expenditures in such sectors as health. In
order to overcome the moral hazard problem, SHCP will instigate physical audits (to measure
physical outputs and relate these to financial inputs), utilizing suitably qualified independent
consultants, and qualitative assessments of beneficiaries (real outcomes). Priority will be given to
developing the system for these social programs likely to provide most scope for future efficiency
gains, namely (i) hospital care; (ii) secondary technical education and (iii) food and nutrition
programs. Annex I of the IBRD Memorandum of the President and the IDB project file provide
an outline of the process and an initial set of efficiency monitoring indicators to be adopted.
During negotiations agreements were confirmed that the GOM would establish a satisfactory
system of social sector expenditure efficiency monitoring indicators no later than June 30,
1996 and that the system would be implemented throughout the remaining life of the
PROSSE (para. 7.1 (e)).
4. PROGRAM COSTS, PROCUREMENT, DISBURSEMENTS AND AUDITS
A. Program Costs and Financing
4.1   The total program cost is estimated at about US$2,000.0 million, of which an estimated
US$364.3 million would be foreign exchange (18.2 percent of program costs); taxes amount to
about US$159.1 million (8.0 percent of program costs). The table below summarizes the
estimated costs by sub-program.  Investment costs amount to 63.6 percent of total costs;
recurrent costs account for 36.4 percent of total costs. Program costs were estimated at March
1995 price levels. Cost estimates for the PROSSE in 1996 were estimated by taking the real 1995
levels of the budgetary allocations under PROSSE and augmenting these by a factor of 1.8



30
percent to offset population growth and an additional 4 percent to provide for a modest increase
in real terms. Foreign and domestic inflation rates were estimated at 2.6 percent and 42 percent
per annum respectively over the period 1995-96. The exchange rate has been adjusted so as to
compensate for the difference between international inflation on a US dollar base and local
inflation rates. Annex 5 provides a detailed breakdown of program costs and financing. All
program cost estimates are based on current expenditures within the public sector.
4.2   Incremental Recurrent Costs and Sustainability.  There will be no incremental
recurrent costs after 1996 as a result of PROSSE, as the programs financed are ongoing. Over
the implementation period, the efficiency gains anticipated under the monitoring and evaluation
sub-program would help to increase the cost-effectiveness of the GOM's recurrent expenditures.
However, the non-wage operating costs of programs supported by PROSSE would be financed
by the Banks on a declining basis (from 85 percent in 1995, to 50 percent by 1996) as these key
expenditures would have been cut in the absence of support by PROSSE, thereby undermining the
delivery of these services. There is in the case of CAPFCE no expansion of the physical number
of schools, simply the improvement and consolidation of existing schools to enable existing
teachers to teach the full range of subjects in more adequate premises. As the PROSSE programs
are amongst the very highest priority social sector programs in Mexico, their sustainability is
ensured due to the high level commitment to maintain budget allocations for this purpose.
4.3   Program Financing. The program would be financed by the IBRD, the 1DB and the
Federal Government. The Government would finance all taxes and duties, estimated at US$159.1
million, and would finance US$840.9 million of local expenditures, representing 42.0 percent of
program costs net of taxes and duties. The proposed IBRD and IDB loans of US$500.0 million
each would finance 50.0 percent of total program costs, or 54.3 percent of program costs net of
taxes and duties. The two loans would finance 100 percent of foreign exchange expenditures and
38.9 percent of local expenditures, net of taxes. The loans would be made to Nacional
Financiera, S.N.C. (NAFIN), which would make the funds available to executing agencies for the
implementation of the program.

4.4    In financing the PROSSE by the two Banks, three principles were observed: (i) simple
process, wherever possible an entire sub-program would be financed by one of the Banks in its
entirety; (ii) the experience of the agencies with either one of the financing institutions; and (iii) in
the case of nutrition, the two Banks would finance equally given their intention to collaborate in a

proposed co-financed nutrition project in the future.  The financing arrangements for the
externally funded elements of PROSSE are summarized as follows:

B. Procurement
4.5   The program would finance the procurement of a diverse set of goods, works and services
in selected programs in SEP, SSA, STPS, and SEDESOL. Designated executing agencies, for
purposes of procurement, in these Secretariats will be: (a) CONAFE, CONALITEG and
CAPFCE for SEP; (b) CGOCE as executing agency for works in SSA; (c) the Directorate
General for Employment (DGE) for STPS; (d) State delegations of SEDESOL and municipios
for the PESE under SEDESOL; and (e) the Distinbuidora e Impulsora Comercial CONASUPO
(DICONSA), a subsidiary of the National Agency for the Distribution of Basic Goods
(CONASIJ1PO), will procure and distribute food supplements for SEDESOL. The IBRD and IDB
would follow the same procurement procedures unless otherwise noted.
4.6   Due to the need to ensure rapid and timely disbursements, the Banks will, wherever
possible, seek to finance large goods and works contracts at the central level, which would be
awarded through international competitive bidding (ICB), limited international bidding (LIB) (for
medical equipment and pharmaceuticals, including micronutrients), and national competitive
bidding (NCB), following the IBRD procurement guidelines (January 1995) and IDB's standard
procurement procedures. For small purchases done by SSA for health programs in the states, by
STPS for tool kits, and by SEDESOL for food purchases, national shopping procedures would be
used for contracts financed by the Banks.. National shopping procedures would also be
acceptable for goods contracts financed by IBRD entered into by executing agencies between
February 19 and March 31, 1995, eligible for retroactive financing. Such contracts signed after



33
April 1, 1995 would follow the SBDs for goods and civil works agreed to between the IBRD and
GOM, with such modifications as agreed by the IBRD to be necessary for the purpose of the
program. For the PESE, SEDESOL would utilize direct contracting arrangements acceptable to
the IDB.
4.7   Civil Works. The IBRD would finance civil works in the SSA's health sub-programs
through CGOCE. Contracts awards would be mainly through NCB, for values not less than
US$350,000 equivalent, without restriction to foreign participation.  For health sub-programs
financed by the IBRD, contract packages awarded by CGOCE at the central level would not
exceed US$10.0 million equivalent per package; for education programs financed by IDB,
contracts awarded by CAPFCE would not exceed US$5.0 million equivalent per package.
CGOCE would use the prototypes developed under the First Basic Health Project (Loan 3272-
ME) for the construction of three public health state laboratories, with the necessary technical
adjustments needed for each location. It would also contract out the supervision of health civil
works contracts to suitably qualified consultants to ensure consistency with feasibility studies and
adherence to standards during construction and share these reports with the IBRD upon request.
4.8   Goods and Equipment. The Banks' financing of contracts for paper for CONALITEG's
1996 program of in-house printing of primary school textbooks would be done under ICB
procedures. To cover its 1996 paper needs, CONALITEG would also provide flexibility in its
bidding procedures to allow split contract awards based on best price combination.  LIB
procedures may be used by SSA for medical equipment. For purposes of bid evaluation under
1CB, domestic manufacturers may be allowed a margin of preference in accordance with
Appendix 2 of the IBRD guidelines. Eligible goods and services include: in SEP (a) paper; (b)
printing services in CONAFE's and CONALITEG's sub-programs; in SSA: (a) medical
equipment and instruments; (b) miscellaneous office equipment and furniture; (c) laboratory
equipment for three public health laboratories; (d) assorted inputs for the local production of
vaccines by the Gerencia General de Biol6gicos y Reactivos (GBR); (e) vaccines not produced
by the GBR; (f) medical supplies; and (g) printing and reproduction informational materials
(printed and audiovisual). NCB procedures may be used for contracting the following eligible
services: (a) printing of primary school textbooks for contracts costing the equivalent of less than
US$10.0 million per contract; (b) storage, packaging and distribution services for medical
supplies, pharmaceuticals and vaccines in SSA and educational materials for SEP, when these
services are not included in the goods contract in question and are contracted by the states.
National shopping procedures would be used by STPS to procure up to 10,000 tool-kits for
trainees in the on-the-job training modality under PROBECAT.
4.9   Food Supplements. In the nutrition sub-programs financed by the Banks, given the
limited quantities required (US$8.5 million equivalent), food supplements in the basic food basket
(consisting of beans, maize flour, salt, sugar and vegetable oil) would be carried out under the
food procurement agreement between SEDESOL and DICONSA. Purchasing methods used by
DICONSA would follow national shopping procedures, ensuring that such procurement does not
restrict foreign participation.  During appraisal, the Banks verified that the prices paid by
DICONSA for these commodities were below international c.i.f. price equivalents in Mexico.



34
4.10  Technical Assistance. Individual consultants and consultants firms carrying out technical
assistance for the program, including monitoring and auditing services, feasibility and other
studies, and supervision of works under the SSA, would be hired following IBRD Guidelines for
the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency
(August 1981) and IDB's Standard Procedures for Consulting Services.  During appraisal,
technical assistance required to support the programs financed by the program were reviewed and
agreed with each executing agency. For contracting studies and technical assistance services
financed by the IBRD, all executing agencies would use a standard invitation package and
contracts as agreed with the EBRD, amended as required for the purpose of the PROSSE.
4.11   Other Costs Not Involving Procurement. Approximately 15.8 percent of program costs
or approximately US$315.2 million equivalent, would not involve procurement. These costs
include operational expenses, and stipends and training (which would be contracted to public and
private sector training institutions in the same manner as the Labor Market and Productivity
Enhancement project, Loan 3542-ME), as well as travel and per diem expenses in programs
financed by both Banks.
4.12 Review by the EBRD. Prior review by the IBRD would be required for: (a) all annual
procurement plans done by each executing agencies; and (b) procurement procedures and
documentation for all tender packages and contracts for ICB and LIB, tender packages and
related contracts for miscellaneous goods under NCB above US$2.0 million equivalent, all NCB
contracts done by CONALITEG for printing services in 1996, and all civil works contracts above
US$2.0 million. In addition, the IBRD would review all supporting documentation for contracts
for goods valued at above US$350,000 equivalent, entered into during the period allowed for
retroactive financing (para. 4.16). It is expected that these prior review arrangement would result
in about 65 percent of IBRD-financed contracts by value. All terms of reference for technical
assistance and studies would be subject to prior review by the IBRD. Documentation for
contracts with consultants' firms, valued above US$100,000 equivalent and for individual
consultants, valued above US$50,000 equivalent, would be also be subject to prior review by the
Banks. Other contracts under these thresholds would be reviewed by NAFIN under the fimite
autonomo procedures agreed with the Bank. During appraisal it was agreed that procedures for
prior and ex-ante review would be followed by all executing agencies. Ex-post review would be
applicable for all contract documentation retained by all executing agencies, to be done by
subsequent examnination by IBRD supervision missions.
4.13  Prior Review by IDB. IDB reserves the right to review all supporting documentation for
contracts for goods valued at above US$350,000 equivalent, and contracts for works valued at or
above US$5.0 million, entered during the period allowed for retroactive financing.

(1 )   Small quantities of newborn/infant scales along with special equipment for monitoring nutrition status of
pregnant women will be purchased under the nutrition sub-program.
(2)    This would be used for the monitoring and evaluation sub-program.
4.14  Procurement Supervision. Detailed procurement and disbursement procedures are
already included in the operating manuals for SEP, SSA, STPS, and SEDESOL, where other
programs financed by both Banks are under execution. NAFIN would support these agencies



37
with experienced staff in procurement procedures of both Banks. All executing agencies have
experienced staff who can be called upon to supervise the preparation of bidding programs and
packages, and ensure compliance with agreed procurement procedures during implementation.
Each executing agency would be responsible for the maintenance of the appropriate records for
the review by both Banks (prior and ex-post).
4.15  Country Procurement Assessment. No recent Country Procurement Assessment on
Mexico is available. However, Mexico's procurement regulations (Ley de Adquisiciones y
Contrataciones, December 1993) clearly authorize the application of procurement procedures of
international financial institutions for the procurement of civil works, goods, equipment and
services, where the financing for such procurement comes from international financial institutions.
4.16 Retroactive financing of up to US$200.0 million equivalent (US100.0 million from both
the IBRD and IDB, amounting to 20 percent of each total loan amount) would be provided to
help cover eligible expenditures for civil works, equipment, goods, pharmaceuticals, medical
supplies, technical assistance and studies, training and stipends made on or after February 19,
1995 (in the case of the IBRD) and January 1, 1995 (in the case of the IDB).
C. Disbursements
4.17 The proposed program would be partially financed by a IBRD loan of about US$500.0
million and an IDB loan of US$500.0 million to be disbursed over the two year period 1995-96,
with the target of disbursing 60 percent of these resources in the critical year of 1995 (see Annex
5 and tables 11 and 13). By financing and strengthening existing programs both implementation
and disbursements will be accelerated. The PROSSE is expected to be completed by December
31, 1996 and the IBRD and IDB loan accounts are expected to be closed by June 30, 1997.
4.18  Proceeds of the proposed loan would be disbursed against expenditures to be presented to
the IBRD and fully documented for: civil works contracts of US$2.0 million and above, US$1.0
million, foods, materials and equipment contracts of US$350,000 or more and for consultant
contracts with individuals of US$50,000 or more and with firms of US$100,000 or more, subject
to prior review as per para. 4.12. Claims for expenditures under contracts below those amounts
and other expenditures not covered by a contract, such as stipends, training costs, operational
expenses, travel allowances, etc. would be disbursed against presentation of Statements of
Expenditure (SOEs), for which the supporting documentation would be retained by the
executing agencies for periodic inspection by the IBRD and by external auditors.

"Inacludes an Advance of US$ 100.0 mnillion. Retroactive financing of up to USS$100.0 mnillion would be permnitted for
eligible expenditures incurred since January 1, 1995.
4.19 In the case of the IBRD, a Special Account in U.S. dollars, with an authorized allocation
of US$100.0 million, would be established at the Banco de Mexico. Normal documentation
requirements apply, except that in addition, a copy of the bank statement from the institution



40
holding the account detailing the transactions made and reconciled by the borrower would
accompany each replenishment request. The account would be replenished on a monthly basis, at
the recommended level of US$25.0 milliion. In the case of the IDB, an Advance of US$100.0
million would be made to NAFIN.
4.20  Disbursement Procedures. Each executing agency, with the technical support from
NAFIN, would prepare the necessary documentation for prompt disbursement from the Special
Account. SOEs will be prepared on the basis of Cuentas por Liquidar Certificadas stamped by
an appropriate financial institution (i.e. canceled GOM payment cheques) as evidence of actual
expenditures made. NAFIN would be in charge of overall coordination, logistical support and
field supervision of the program.
D. Accounts and Audits
4.21  All executing agencies and NAFIN would maintain records and accounts adequate to
reflect, in accordance with sound accounting practices, the resources and expenditures in
connection with the execution of the program. These records would reflect the resources and
expenditures in connection with the execution of the entire program. During negotiations,
agreement was confirmed that SHCP, NAFIN, SEP, SSA, SEDESOL and STPS would: (i)
have the records and accounts for each fiscal year audited by independent and qualified
auditors with a separate opinion provided on SOEs, in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards and procedures, and with the specific current understanding with the
Mexican authorities; (ii) furnish to the Banks, no later than six months after the end of each
year, a certified copy of the agreed audit reports; and (iii) furnish to the Banks such other
information concerning the records and accounts as well as the audit as the Banks would
from time to time reasonably request (para 7.1(f)). For all expenditures with respect to which
withdrawals from the Loan Account were made on the basis of SOEs, and for all expenditures
with respect to which withdrawals were made from the Special Account, the executing agencies
would upon request provide to NAFIN all records and accounts necessary to allow the timely
performance of its obligations, and to the independent auditors, both the records and the
supporting documentation.
5. PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION
A. Program Implementation
5.1   The program would be overseen by SHCP through the existing Technical Committee for
Budget Integration (Comite Tecnico de Integracion Presupuestal: COTEIP). The COTEIP is
chaired by SHCP (Direccion General de Politica Presupuestal) and includes NAFIN, other
elements of SHCP, and would include high-level representatives of the other PROSSE
implementing agencies for the purpose of implementing PROSSE. COTEIP would monitor
overall implementation and oversee the process of physical and financial auditing of PROSSE



41
activities as a means of laying the foundation for future efficiency gains in social sector
expenditures. SHCP (Politica Presupuestal) would ensure that the budgetary resources for the
programs supported by the PROSSE would be released in a timely manner. NAFIN would be
responsible for ensuring that the executing agencies adhere to the Banks' procurement guidelines
and that the requisite documentation is prepared promptly for disbursement by the Banks. SEP,
together with its subsidiary organizations - CAPFCE, CONALITEG and CONAFE - would
implement the basic education sub-program; SSA would implement the basic health services sub-
program. STPS would implement the labor retraining sub-program and SEDESOL would
implement the short-term employment generation sub-program. SEDESOL, SSA and the DIF
would implement the priority food and nutrition program through the state and municipal
governments. SHCP would implement the monitoring and evaluation sub-program.
5.2   Program  Readiness for Implementation.  In the case of health, education and
PROBECAT, PROSSE essentially finances ongoing programs and activities, and is thus by
definition ready for immediate implementation. In the case of the PESE, the GOM has defined
the operational parameters (paras.3. 17 and 7.1 (d)). In the case of nutrition, one state (Hidalgo)
is ready to proceed. Additional states will enter into the program in 1996. The Banks have
already started to provide informal technical assistance to the SHCP to initiate the Monitoring &
Evaluation Sub-program
5.3   Monitoring  Indicators.   During  appraisal, monitoring  indicators for program
implementation and initial program impact were discussed and agreed (Annex 2) including
preliminary physical targets for 1996. These will form the basis for the program implementation
Quarterly Reviews (para. 5.5).
B. Supervision
5.4   Supervision would focus on the quarterly review of physical attainment of the sub-
programs against the monitoring indicators and the budget release for the PROSSE supported
activities. Special attention will be paid to monitoring the effectiveness of targeting to the poor of
the PROSSE supported programs and providing training and technical assistance to procurement
staff in agencies with limited experience with the Banks' procurement procedures (paras. 6.8 and
6.12). The supervision team would be carefully planned and would be a combination of IBRD
and IDB staff and consultants who would be recruited according to the critical needs of program
implementation. It is estimated that 60 staffweeks will be required for supervision in FY96 and 35
in FY97. This estimate takes into account the multi-sectoral nature of PROSSE, the institutional
development aspects, the prior review and procurement arrangements as agreed under PROSSE
(see paras. 4.5 to 4.10 and 4.12 to 4.14).
C. Quarterly Reviews
5.5   The Banks will monitor compliance with the program through a program of Quarterly
Reviews. Each Quarterly Review will be organized by the SHCP, and will include representatives
of all the executing agencies and NAFIN. The purpose of the quarterly review meeting would be



42
to evaluate program performance against implementation plans and agreed targets; provide
management with feedback on program achievements and areas needing improvement; and further
develop programmatic improvements to increase the efficiency of social sector expenditures. A
useful tool in this regard will be the physical audits and qualitative assessments undertaken
through Sub-Program 5 (paras. 3.22-3.23). The reviews and planning process will provide a tool
for on-going refinements in program strategies and plans, consistent with the overall objectives of
the program. During negotiations, agreements were confirmed that the GOM would
undertake Quarterly Reviews of the budgetary releases and physical implementation progress
of PROSSE with the Banks (para 7.I (g)).
5.6  In addition to the general objectives of review outlined above, each review will have
additional specific objectives. The first Quarterly Review, to be held in August 1995, will focus
on program effectiveness and accelerating initial disbursements. The November 1995 review will
focus on the budget allocations for programs supported by PROSSE in 1996.  During
negotiations, agreements were confirmed that the GOM would: prepare a preliminary action
plan (including physical targets and budget, using Annex 2 as a basis), for the programs to be
supported by PROSSE in 1996 as part of the November 1995 review; and confirm a definitive
action plan for the programs to be supported by PROSSE in 1996, satisfactory to the Banks,
as part of the February 1996 review and that no changes would be made in the allocations for
such programs without prior consultation with the Banks (para. 7.1 (h)). The February 1996
review will focus on the achievement against indicators for 1995 and confirm actual budget
allocations for 1996. The May 1996 review will focus on reviewing progress in establishing the
new social sector monitoring and budget impact system in the SHCP Politica Presupuestal (para.
3.23) and how this system could be utilized in the 1997 budget allocations. The August 1996
review will focus on the 1997 budget allocations and possible follow up time-slice operations such
as the PROSSE. The November 1996 review will focus on an assessment of accomplishments
under PROSSE, the 1997 budget, and include the appraisal of any follow-on program support.
The February 1997 review will focus on the Implementation Completion Report and the
finalization of disbursements.
6. PROGRAM BENEFITS AND RISKS
A. Program Benefits
6.1   The program would help reduce possible increases in poverty brought about by the
economic recession, through preserving essential social services for the poor, providing training
and employment enhancement opportunities for 800,000 unemployed and underemployed
workers over the two year period through PROBECAT (350,000 in 1995 and 450,000 in 1996),
plus 550,000 short-term jobs for the unemployed poor in 1995 through the SEDESOL program,
providing enhanced food and nutrition supplements to women and children in priority areas.
Indigenous populations will benefit in particular from the services provided under the basic
education, health and nutrition sub-programs as these programs are targeted to the poorest areas
where the indigenous populations are concentrated. The primary benefit of the PROSSE for the



43
selected services and programs is that it commits SHCP and the executing agencies to support
priority programs targeted to the poor.
6.2   Program Objective and Poverty Category: The PROSSE forms a central part of the
program of targeted interventions for Mexico by protecting essential social services to the poor
and strengthening a low-cost social safety net, through short-term employment generation to
those adversely affected by the economic crisis and food and nutrition programs to the most
vulnerable groups of the population. It thus falls under the Poverty Reduction category. The
essential social services included are focused on the poor in the following manner: CONAFE
works only among the poor mainly in isolated rural areas, civil works covered under PROSSE are
exclusively in poor rural and peri-urban areas, whilst the SSA services are self-targeting to the
poor, as they cover only the population without access to the social security system or without the
financial means to go to the private sector. The labor retraining and employment promotion
program is exclusively to the unemployed and underemployed as they are registered by the state
employment services in the case of STPS, or self-targeted to the poorest by the compensation
equivalent to only 80 percent of the minimum wage in the case of the short term employment
program under SEDESOL. The nutrition program uses nutritional indicators, which have an
extremely high correlation with poverty, and the CONAPO poverty index (based upon 10 census
indicators of poverty) to identify the beneficiary municipios.
6.3   Environmental Aspects. No major environmental issues are foreseen. However, due to
the inclusion of the scattered small civil works physical sub-programs under the employment
generation sub-program (para. 3.17), PROSSE is rated category "B" for environmental purposes.
The environmental impact of sub-programs is expected to be handled according to the criteria and
procedures agreed in the IDB financed Municipal Development Program (Loan ME- 0051, FY
95).
6.4   Under the small civil works sub-programs, no significant direct or indirect negative
environmental impact is expected from the spot construction and maintenance actions. Final
engineering designs are prepared on the basis of agreed technical guidelines for the spot
improvement program, which include actions to alleviate, reverse, of offset direct environmental
impacts, in particular those related to erosion and siltation.  By their very nature, spot
improvements and routine maintenance focus on identification, diagnosis and elimination of
erosion problems. Since the selected roads are existing ones and among the oldest in the rural
road network, additional indirect negative impacts linked with human activities are almost
nonexistent.
6.5   Participatory Approach: A number of elements of PROSSE involve strong community
participation, namely: (a) under the education sub-program, the community provides food and
accommodation for the CONAFE community teachers in rural areas, whilst indigenous
populations participate in the development and design of textbooks for indigenous education; (b)
under the health sub-program, community participation is mobilized during the health campaigns;
(c) under the employment sub-program, communities form committees and make proposals to the
municipio for small infrastructure projects to be managed by themselves (with technical support
from the states and municipios) thus following the approach already well tested under



44
PRONASOL; and (d) the priority nutrition sub-program involves close community participation
in: health and school activities; food distribution logistics; and development of priority projects
selected by the community (i.e. sanitation, housing, improvements to community health posts and
schools).
B. Economic Benefits
6.6   Whilst it is not possible to undertake an economic evaluation of the PROSSE as a whole,
the PROSSE supports the most essential and some of the most cost-effective social sector
programs in Mexico. The relevant economic analysis behind some of the programs supported by
PROSSE is presented in detail in Annex 6.
6.7   This analysis may be summarized as follows:
(a)   Education: Recent analysis (based upon data for 1992) shows that the average
economic social rate of return per additional year of schooling is 11.8 percent for
primary education and 14.7 percent for lower secondary (the highest rate of return
for all levels of education studied) - it is lowest for tertiary education. The fact
that lower secondary education shows a higher rate of return at the margin reflects
the near universality of primary education in Mexico (and hence diminishing rates
of return to primary education). Whilst this establishes a clear case for expanding
lower secondary education although telesecundaria in rural areas, it is self-evident
that in order to obtain such returns, children must first complete primary education
satisfactorily. Thus for population groups without adequate access to primary
education, the highest priority investments are those to ensure satisfactory
completion of primary education as the foundation for secondary education.
Unfortunately this analysis did not include analysis of rates of return for pre-school
education, although recent analysis, based upon the US experience shows high
rates of return to pre-school education.
(b)   Health:  Analysis undertaken by the SSA, with IBRD  assistance, in 1994
measured cost per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) saved as a result of over
100 health interventions. The most cost-effective interventions (with cost per
DALY saved of less than N$3,000) are all included in the basic package of
services provided by the SSA under PROSSE. They range from N$58 per DALY
saved for attention to sick children for treatment of acute diarrhea in children,
N$182 for treatment of leprosy, through to diagnosis of cervical-uterine cancer
N$1,287, health education N$2,000, treatment of asthma at N$2,772 and
treatment of burns at N$2,984. At the opposite extreme, curative and preventive
services not in the package supported under PROSSE include: osteoporosis
prevention N$7,500, by-pass surgery N$10,985, and multiple sclerosis treatment at
N$37,157 per DALY saved.



45
(c)   Labor Retraining: Based upon a cost benefit analysis completed April 19, 1995,
PROBECAT had a positive impact for 10 out of 12 categories of trainees
evaluated, representing 95.5 percent of all trainees. Particularly, encouraging was
the positive impact upon women (this is in contract to the earlier analysis as
reported in the SAR for the Labor Market & Productivity Enhancement project
(Loan 3542-ME). Once again, the analysis clearly demonstrates the enhanced
effectiveness of in-plant training (one modality of on-the-job training) over class-
room based training for those without prior work experience. This also provides a
basis for shifting a significant proportion of trainees to the on-the-job training
modality.
C. Program Risks
6.8   The PROSSE is subject to four potential risks: (a) the uncertainty regarding budgetary
allocations; (b) program diversity; (c) that PROSSE programs fail in their targeting arrangements
and efficiency; and (d) failure to disburse adequately as a result of inexperience of some
implementation agencies with the two Banks' procurement procedures.
6.9   Dealing with the first risk, uncertainty regarding budgetary allocations, is an essential
element of PROSSE. Mexico continues to face a high degree of uncertainty in terms of the
macroeconomic variables which determine the budgetary ceilings. The GOM has undertaken to
protect high priority social service programs from further cuts under the PROSSE. The Banks
will monitor budgetary releases carefully during implementation on a quarterly basis.
6.10  The second risk, program diversity, is being mitigated by concentrating upon a smaller
number of agencies, most of which already have experience with IBRD or IDB procedures. Co-
financing has also greatly facilitated simplification: for example the IBRD will exclusively finance
the SSA, building upon the IBRD's long operational experience with the SSA; whilst the IDB will
finance the entire PESE under SEDESOL, where the IDB procedures are well adapted to the
realities of a highly decentralized program.
6.11  The third risk, is that the PROSSE programs failing either their targeting arrangements or
efficiency gains. All of the PROSSE supported programs are targeted to the poor to varying
degrees (see para. 6.2), however there are leakages with even the best targeted programs.
Targeting effectiveness will be monitored carefully during supervision (para. 5.4) and through the
physical auditing arrangements (para. 5.5). Increasing the efficiency of the programs supported
by PROSSE, along with other social sector programs, will need to be worked out over the
medium-term. PROSSE itself, through sub-program 5 "Monitoring and Evaluation" will lay the
foundation and develop methodologies to measure and incentives to increase efficiency.
6.12 Within the fourth risk, a potential problem that could impede disbursements is the
inexperience of agencies such as CONALITEG, DIF, some health directorates and state health
secretariats in Banks' procurement procedures. To minimize this risk, training of procurement
staff in these agencies will be organized as part of the Banks' supervision programs, and technical
assistance will be provided by staff at the Banks' Resident Missions.

7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.1   During negotiations, the Banks and the GOM confirmed that the GOM would:
(a)   endeavor to execute budgetary policy in the social sectors, including mechanisms
to protect budgetary allocations to the PROSSE during the financial crisis and
measures to increase efficiency of social sector expenditures, according to the
agreed letter of policy intent (para. 2.8);
(b)   release budgetary amounts in a timely manner to the executing agencies under
PROSSE in 1995 in accordance with the agreed 1995 budget allocations and
physical targets included in Annex 2 and that the GOM may substitute an
alternative budget, if satisfactory to the Banks, for the PROSSE prior to June 30,
1995 (para. 2.8);
(c)   review the results of the CONALITEG productivity study and present an action
plan to the Banks by July 31, 1996 (para. 3.5);
(d)   execute the PESE through SEDESOL according to the agreed operational
modalities (para. 3.17);
(e)   establish a satisfactory system of social sector expenditure efficiency monitoring
indicators no later than June 30, 1996 and that the system would be implemented
throughout the remaining life of the PROSSE (para. 3.23);
(f)   through SHCP, NAFIN, SEP, SSA, SEDESOL and STPS: (i) have the records and
accounts for each fiscal year audited by independent and qualified auditors with a
separate opinion provided on SOEs, in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards and procedures, and with the specific current understanding
with the Mexican authorities; (ii) furnish to the Banks, no later than six months
after the end of each year, a certified copy of the agreed audit reports; and (iii)
furnish to the Banks such other information concerning the records and accounts
as well as the audit as the Banks would from time to time reasonably request (para.
4.21);
(g)   undertake the Quarterly Reviews of the budgetary releases and physical
implementation progress of PROSSE with the Banks (para. 5.5); and
(h)   prepare a preliminary action plan (including physical targets and budget, using
Annex 2 as a basis), for the programs to be supported by PROSSE in 1996 as part
of the November 1995 review; and confirm a definitive action plan for the
programs to be supported by PROSSE in 1996, satisfactory to the Banks, as part



47
of the February 1996 review and that no changes would be made in the allocations
for such programs without prior consultation with the Banks (para. 5.6)).
7.2   Recommendation. Subject to compliance to the above conditions, the proposed program
is suitable for: (a) an IBRD loan of US$500.0 million equivalent to NAFIN, with the guarantee of
the United Mexican States, for 15 years, including a 3-year grace period at the IBRD's standard
variable interest rate; and (b) an IDB loan of US$500.0 million equivalent to NAFIN with the
guarantee of the United Mexican States, for 20 years, including a 4 year grace period at the IDB's
standard variable interest rate, including an inspection fee of 1 percent of the loan amount.

Productivity Study
TERMINOS DE REFERENCIA PARA DEFINIR UN PROGRAMA DE MEJORA EN LA
PRODUCTIVIDAD DE LAS ACTIVIDADES DE LA COMISION NACIONAL DE LOS
LIBROS DE TEXTO GRATUITOS
Antecedentes
1.    La Comisi6n Nacional de los Libros de Texto Gratuitos (CONALITEG) es un organismo
publico descentralizado que fue creada el 13 de febrero de 1959, con personalidad juridica y
patrimonio propios, que tiene por objeto la edici6n, impresi6n y distribuci6n de los libros de texto
gratuitos, materiales didacticos y similares.
2.    Para el cumplimiento de su objetivo, la Comisi6n tiene las siguientes funciones:
(a)    Editar e imprimir los libros de texto gratuitos y toda clase de materiales didicticos
similares, mediante sus propias instalaciones, por concurso o de otro modo si estos
resultasen insuficientes;
(b)   Coadyuvar con la Secretaria de Educaci6n Puiblica (SEP) en el disenio de los libros
gratuitos otros materiales didicticos;
(c)   Participar con un representante en el Consejo de Contenidos y Metodos todos
Educativos de la SEP;
(d)   Distribuir los libros y toda clase de materiales didicticos similares que produzca; y
(e)    Los demis necesarios para el cumplimiento de su objetivo.
3.    En 1994 CONALITEG distribuy6 134.4 millones de libros de texto, con 157 titulos, de los
cuales 75 por ciento fueron subcontratados a diversos impresores y el resto elaborados en los talleres
de la empresa. La distribuci6n se realiza mediante contratistas que llevan los libros, con una carga de
60,000 toneladas, a 208 almacenes en el interior del pais, y 783 almacenes en el area metropolitana,
donde la entrega se hace a nivel de zona escolar. La comisi6n tiene 1,315 plazas de planta.
4.    Ademis del libro de texto gratuito, la CONALITEG produce otros materiales educativos
como pueden ser ediciones en lenguas indigenas y materiales para no videntes en "Braille".
5.    La productividad de la CONALITEG se ha deteriorado en los ultimos tiempos; problemas de
equipo, organizaci6n, metodos, capacitaci6n, y de otra indole, lo que hace necesario mejorar sus
operaciones. La estructura administrativa es pesada y por ende, parte importante en la ineficiencia de
la Comisi6n.
6.    Las operaciones que actualmente lleva a cabo la CONALITEG se sefialan en el siguiente
cuadro:

actividades de entrega de los libros; administra y
supervise la correcta y oportuna distribuci6n de
los mismos.   Asimismo, se hace cargo del
almacenaje de estos materiales en las instalaciones
de la Comisi6n.
7.    A estas actividades substantivas se agregan las tareas normales de administraci6n requeridas
para su funcionamiento. Merece especial menci6n la tarea de control de calidad, que asegura que el
producto lHene las especificaciones requeridas, al mismo tiempo que seniala que requiere de mejoras.
Objetivo
8.    Definir mediante un estudio de mejora de productividad en las actividades de la CONALITEG,
cuil seria la altemativa que permita producir y distribuir los libros de texto gratuitos y materiales
educativos adicionales a un menor costo para el pais, sea a traves una mejora de su operaci6n, de un
canbio tecnol6gico, o mediante la subcontrataci6n de todas o algunas de sus actividades.
Aspectos Metodol6gicos
9.    La firma consultora debera desarrollar la informaci6n necesaria para que la CONALITEG
tome la decisi6n respecto al modo de mejorar la productividad de la Comisi6n. Para este fin se preven
tres escenarios basicos:
(a)   Permanecer en la ubicaci6n actual y con el equipo actual, preparando un plan de
mejora de productividad que incluya la aplicaci6n de ingenieria industrial, cambios en el
disefio de la planta, capacitaci6n del personal, reestructuraci6n administrativa, mejor
mantenimiento de los equipos existentes, de manera que se obtenga la maxima
eficiencia posible en las instalaciones actuales y trabajando a la maxima capacidad que
pueda alcanzar la planta.
(b)   Hacer una renovaci6n de la planta y equipo, considerando la posibilidad de cambiar su
ubicaci6n, e incorporando medidas de entrenamiento, reestructuraci6n administrativa y
cualquier otra necesaria p ara llegar a la maxima productividad de la planta



61                                 ANNEX 3
TOR for CONALITEG
Productivity Study
(c)    Subcontratar total o parcialmente las operaciones actuales con empresas del sector
publico o privado, segun resulte mas conveniente, reduciendo el personal y
reestructurando las actividades administrativas y de calidad para alcanzar la maxima
productividad en estas condiciones.
10.   Los tres escenarios deberan ser comparados entre si para evaluar el costo beneficio de
cada opci6n. Se sugiere que en cada caso la evaluaci6n considere el valor del dinero en el tiempo,
mediante una tasa interna de retorno, valor presente neto u otro metodo sugerido por el
consultor. Para este efecto, el consultor sugerira y sustentara el periodo mas apropiado para la
evaluaci6n de cada opci6n. No deberia ser menor a 5 anios.
11.   En los tres casos, el calculo de costo/beneficio debera considerar el costo de indemnizaci6n del
personal desplazado y el valor de rescate del equipo; el valor de las instalaci6n es y bienes raices que se
sustituyan, si es el caso, los planes de mejora de la productividad incluirin todas las actividades de la
Comisi6n.
12.   Dado el papel que juega la Comisi6n, debera conservar el control de las actividades de
aseguramiento de calidad, estas requieren ser desarrolladas de una manera mis amplia de lo que lo son
actualmente, por lo que se debera incluir en el programa de mejora un aparato de reestructuraci6n y
desarrollo de estas actividades.
13.   El resultado de los tres escenarios debera ser entregado con un anglisis de sensibilidad de cada
opci6n, incluyendo la sensibilidad de los costos financieros y la paridad de la moneda, asi como, un
modelo financiero computarizado que permita ampliar este analisis de sensibilidad y manejar escenarios
nixtos entre el escenario 2 y 3.
14.   Dado que no existe un sistema de costos formal en la CONALITEG, se sugiere al consultor
hacer una revisi6n de la informaci6n contable disponible antes de elaborar su propuesta y cotizaci6n, ya
que tendria que definir los costos actuales de operaci6n mediante un muestreo de las operaciones y de
la contabilidad existente. El metodo que piensa emplear para definir estos costos debera ser
establecido como un anexo de su propuesta.
15.   Para comprar los tres escenarios, el proyecto debera ubicar las posibles fuentes de ahorro y
valorarias. Se espera que cada escenario contenga, ademas de la informaci6n de costos, el plan de
mejora de productividad en cada caso con informaci6n suficiente para que la CONALITEG pueda
emprender el plan que resulte mas apropiado. Esto incluye las areas de mejora ubicadas, las
actividades a realizar una estimaci6n de tiempo y costo de las mismas. En el caso de la renovaci6n de
equipos se deberi entregar cotizaciones del costo de los mismos, comparando varias opciones. El nivel
de detaDle de los costos debera ser el usual en un estudio de factibilidad.

PROBECAT - Selection Criteria
and Implementation Details
SELECTION CRITERIA FOR TRAINEES UNDER PROBECAT
PROBECAT will operate under three modalities during 1995 and 1996, namely: (a)
retraining for unemployed workers full time within training institutions (Escolarizada); (b)
retraining for unemployed and underemployed workers in plant (Mixta); and (iii) on the job
training. The eligibility criteria for each modality are given below - in all cases preference will be
given to those with one or more economic dependents.
(a) Retraining for Unemployed Workers - Escolarizada
Eligible trainees under this modality would satisfy the following criteria:'
(c)   registered as a job applicant at the local state employment office;
(d)   have prior work experience if entering classroom training (minimum 3 months);
(e)    be between the ages of 16 and 55 years; and
(f)    have either complete primary or some secondary education.
(b) Retraining for Unemployed and Underemployed Workers - Mixia
Eligible trainees under this modality would satisfy the following criteria:
(g)   registered as a job applicant at the local state employment office;
(h)   be between the ages of 16 and 55 years;
(i)    have basic reading, writing and numeric skills (to be tested); and
(j)    not necessarily have prior work experience.
(c) Retraining for Unemployed and Underemployed Workers - On the Job
Eligible trainees under this modality would satisfy the following criteria:
(k)   registered as a job applicant at the local state employment office;
(1)    be between the ages of 16 and 55 years; and

PROSSE Economic Analysis
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF PROSSE
A variety of existing evaluations of programs supported by PROSSE, and other
evaluations of social sector programs more generally, provide strong evidence of the economic
effectiveness and benefits of the programs included under PROSSE. The results of these
evaluations and their relationship to PROSSE are presented below are:
1. The Returns to Education in Mexico - based upon a paper prepared by George
Psacharopoulos, Eduardo Velez, Hongyu Yang and Alex Panagides (1994);
2. Economic Efficiency of Selected Health Programs - based on work undertaken by
FUNSALUD in Mexico (1994); and
3. PROBECAT Program Evaluation Study - based upon the evaluation study completed by
STPS (1995); and
(A) The Returns to Education in Mexico
1.    Economic analysis based upon the Encuesta Nacional de Ingresos y Gastos de los
Hogares - ENIGH - (a nationwide household survey which utilizes a stratified random sample
conducted by INEGI) indicates that: (a) the returns to an investment in education are depressed
during periods of economic recession and rise again as economic growth resumes; (b) the returns
to education remain high, even after a significant expansion of the educational system; and (c) in
terms of investment priorities at the margin, secondary education exhibits the highest rate of
return in Mexico. However, by definition, such marginal rates of return are only possible for
those children who complete primary education satisfactorily; where this is not the case, as in
many isolated rural areas, priority still rests in ensuring that children have access to and complete
primary education of adequate quality.
2.    Overall Private Returns.  Using the Mincerian human capital eanlings function
specification applied to the ENIGH sample of each survey years (1984,1989 and 1992), estimates
of the overtime private rate of return to investment in education were calculated as shown in
Table 1 below:

- Females                          16.7      13.4       15.8
3. Private and Social Returns by Level of Education. Application of the "full discounting
method" to the age-earnings profiles, and the unit costs for different levels of education, gave the
private and social returns to education appearing in Table 2.

University                          9.5        9.6        11.1
4.    Regarding the private retums, those for primary education have steadily fallen over the
years due to the near universal coverage of primary education. The private returns to the two
levels of secondary education show no clear pattem. But the private retums to university
education have fallen and risen with the growth of the economy. The social rates of return for
education are consistently lower than the private rates of return - consistent with the experience of
other countries.
5.    Conclusion.  The retums to education largely follow the macro-economic cycle.
Economic recession lowers the returns to human capital, whereas economic growth boosts them.
Second, when a country reaches a stage where primary education coverage is near universal,
secondary education is the next priority for educational investment at the margin. However, for



75                               ANNEX 6
PROSSE Economic Analysis
those not receiving primary education at all, provision of such education has a higher rate of
return than those noted above.
(B) Economic Efficiency of Selected Health Programs
6.    Utilizing the methodology developed by the IBRD in the context of the 1993 World
Development Report "Investing in Health", the GOM (through FIJNSALUD) has made estimates
of the disability-adjusted life-years (DALY) saved for over 100 health interventions and related
these to the unit costs of such interventions. These were then ranked from the most cost-effective
(lowest unit cost per DALY saved) to the least cost-effective. The first 70 such interventions are
listed in the attached table.
7.    The services selected for protection under the PROSSE's Basic Health sub-program
follow the priorities established in this GOM study (which was supported by the IBRD and IDB in
1994) of the economics of health care provision in Mexico. The starting point of the analysis was
the identification of the principal sources of illness in Mexico, as measured by their contribution to
the estimated 12.8 million DALYs lost prematurely in 1991. The study examined over one
hundred health interventions to establish their potential effectiveness and their cost. These
analyses were combined to develop an optimal package of 24 services. Each of the activities
protected by the PROSSE has thus been evaluated as dealing with a significant source of ill health
(responsible for 1 percent or more of premature DALY's lost in Mexico) and whose cost per
DALY saved is less than N$3,000.
8.    As an illustration of the results obtained, the provision of integrated care for sick children,
which will be supported under the Basic Health Care sub-program, was shown to be the single
most cost effective intervention available in Mexico, with a cost per DALY gained of N$58
(1991). Similarly, pre- and post- natal care, both financed under the Preventive care sub-program
had an estimated cost per DALY gained of less than N$300. The study also identified these two
programs as having the largest potential impact on reducing premature DALY's lost in Mexico.
The attached table lists the 70 most cost-effective interventions which are the types of
interventions included in the basic service package supported under PROSSE.

(C) PROBECAT Program Evaluation Study
9.    PROBECAT (Programa de Becas de Capacitacion para Trabajadores) was established in
1984 by the Mexican government to retrain unemployed and displaced workers. The acceleration
of the structural adjustment in Mexico greatly expanded the need to retrain those workers, and the
program was later supported by the Bank through the Manpower Training Project (Loan 2876-
ME) in 1987 with expanded scope and coverage. Since then, the program has provided short-
term vocational training to over 250,000 unemployed workers, approximately 50,000 trainees per
year. The PROBECAT program, administered through the network of state employment offices,
offers training allowances equivalent to one minimum wage to unemployed workers who enter a
retraining program. The allowances are paid for the duration of the course which varies from one
to six months, with the majority lasting three months. The program was originally designed for
displaced workers, but in practice, some 40% of the participants were unemployed workers who
sought job for the first time without prior work experience.
10.   To provide information on the effectiveness of the PROBECAT program as a basis for
policy decision making whether to continue with the program for a longer period than originally
intended, a rigorous evaluation of the impact of PROBECAT on the employment and earnings of
the program participants was conducted as a part of the project. The study evaluated the post-
training labor market experiences of the 1990 cohort of PROBECAT trainees, using new
longitudinal data developed for this purpose. A matched sample of unemployed workers from the
1990-91 quarterly urban labor force surveys (ENEU) was also developed as a control group.
Unlike previous evaluation studies of retraining programs, this study corrects for potential biases
in the estimates of effectiveness by using an appropriate control group and an estimation method
which takes into account the nonrandomness of workers accepted for the program.
11.   Prior (1992) Evaluation: The first evaluation study of the PROBECAT program was
conducted in 1992 to obtain information on the effectiveness of the program as a basis for the
policy decision whether to continue the program.  The results of the study showed that
PROBECAT program was effective in improving employability and earnings of certain groups of
trainees. More specifically, for male trainees of 25 years and older with prior work experience,
benefits of the program participation outweighed the costs within 2 months of completing the
program. For all other male trainees with prior work experience, the benefits paid for itself within
one year. However, for male with no prior work experience, the costs of training were offset only
after 17 months. For women, the costs of training were offset by benefits only for those who
were older than 25 years with prior work experience. The costs exceeded the benefits for other
women.
12.   According to the findings of the 1992 evaluation study, the selection criteria of the
program were modified. The second follow-up evaluation of the PROBECAT program was
conducted in 1994 for the cohort of 1993 trainees. The findings of the second evaluation study
are summarized below and in Tables 1 to 3.

PROSSE Economic Analysis
13.   Time to Find a Job. The probability of finding a job during the follow-up period is
significantly higher for PROBECAT participants than for the control group, which is a matched
sample of unemployed workers from National Urban Employment Survey. The mean duration of
job search is shorter for PROBECAT participants than for the control group (Tables 1 and 2, first
column). Participation in the program reduces time to find a job by about 55%. Although work
experience prior to becoming unemployed does not significantly affect the time to find
employment, the length of unemployment has a significant effect. Those unemployed for a short
period need significantly shorter time to find a job than those unemployed for a long period.
Among the two course modalities offered through the PROBECAT program, "School-based"
courses have weaker impact on time to find a job than "mixed" courses where trainees receive
hands-on training at work places mixed with class room training. For men, the difference between
the "mixed" courses participants and the control group was 2.5 months, whereas the difference
between the "school-based" courses participants and the control was only 0.5 months. For
women, the corresponding differences are 3.7 months and 1.6 months respectively. Years of
general education completed do not have any significant effect on the time to find job, whereas
the age of the unemployed was significant in the case of men.
14.   When we exclude the duration of training courses in the job-search period, the only group
which required longer time to find a job than the control group was male participants of "school-
based" courses aged 25 years and younger and without prior work experience. It should be noted
that those who received "school-based" training without prior work experience were selected
incorrectly according to the selection criteria of the PROBECAT program. For men, the result
above confirms that this group should only be directed to the "mixed" courses. However, for
women, participants of "school-based" courses without prior work experience also gained from
the program, as they experienced shorter time to find a job than the control group by 3.4 months
for those older than 25 years and by 2.1 months for 25 years or younger trainees.
15.   Monthly earnings. The PROBECAT program participation has positive impact for ten
out of the twelve categories of trainees considered, which represent 95.5% of the total program
participants (Tables 1 and 2, last column). The highest impact on the monthly earnings was
achieved for the participants of "mixed" courses, due to their high "employability" (i.e. shorter
time to find a job). The two groups of program participants whose monthly earnings were less
then those of the control group were: (i) men older than 25 years, who participated in "mixed"
courses without prior work experience; and (ii) men 25 years and younger who participated in the
"school-based" courses without prior work experience.  Therefore, for the last group, the
program impact on both time to find a job and monthly earnings turned out to be negative
compared to the control group.
16.   Hourly Earnings.  PROBECAT program  participants, and particularly those who
received "mixed" training, worked longer weekly hours than the control group. The difference of
weekly hours of work between the "mixed" training participants and the "school-based" training
participants is substantially smaller than the difference between these two groups combined and
the control group. As a result of the longer hours of work for PROBECAT participants, the
order of hourly earnings among groups of men who obtained employment get reversed from the
ordering of the job-search duration: the control group invariably earn higher hourly earnings (1.8

PROSSE Economic Analysis
to 5.3 pesos per hour depending on age and prior work experience) than the PROBECAT
participants of "mixed" courses (1.7 to 4.9 pesos per hour). For women, hourly earnings are
higher for participants of "school-based" (1.3 to 6.2 pesos per hour) courses than either "mixed"
courses participants (1.2 to 6.0 pesos per hour) or the control group.
17.   Cost and Benefit of the PROBECAT program. When we do not include the length of
training courses in the job search duration, the cost of the PROBECAT program can be
recuperated immediately upon completion of the program for all participants of "mixed" courses,
with the exception of men older than 25 years without prior work experience. For "school-based"
course participants, recuperation of the cost occurs either immediately or within 5 months for
most of the groups, except for women 25 years old or younger with long unemployment duration.
If we include the length of training courses in the time to find employment, the results continue to
favor the PROBECAT program participants, particularly those who participate in'the "mixed"
courses. For this group, the cost of the program is recuperated within the first five months,
except for men younger then 25 years old with long unemployment duration. For the participants
of "school-based" courses, the recuperation of the cost takes mostly between one and two years.
18.   While the PROBECAT program as a whole was found to have high returns, the "mixed"
training has been shown to have higher returns than the "school-based" training. This finding
supports a recommendation to direct the PROBECAT program more toward courses which are
directly linked to productive activities, either through hands-on training in enterprises or through
community projects such as public works programs designed under the PROBECAT sub-program
of the proposed program.
