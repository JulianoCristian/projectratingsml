Regardless of the Borrower's\n            implementing agencies in fulfilling all requirements for\n            information, and reporting on those components supported by\n            the Loan, it is less clear however, whether the Program of\n            Essential Services (PROSSE) protected the very poor, as\n            intended in the original design project. Nevertheless, the\n            project prevented the deterioration of human capital gains,\n            and built the foundation for measuring efficiency gains in\n            social service programs. The key lessons learned show that:\n            a) rapid disbursement objectives during a relatively short\n            period of time, should be amenable to procurement acceptable\n            by both the Bank and the Government; b) the type of\n            instrument lending should be considered given the nature of\n            the budget support operation, since an investment operation\n            leads to confusion on financing and disbursement methods,\n            whereas under economic emergencies, a more efficient\n            instrument could have been a sector loan; and, c) it is\n            essential to base the initial design on solid ground, tying\n            strategic objectives with operational procedures rather than\n            providing flexibility, which may affect, among others,\n            procurement and disbursements."}, "docdt": "1999-01-22T00:00:00Z"}
