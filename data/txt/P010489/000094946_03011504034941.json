Key lessons relate to\n            public health strategies, government policies and state\n            commitment, and institutional development. First, regarding\n            institutional aspects, because states are the implementers\n            of health programs, securing their commitment is paramount;\n            thus, as demonstrated by this operation, state level health\n            projects are more conducive to facilitate institutional, and\n            policy reform than centrally sponsored schemes. Nonetheless,\n            strong management structures, and adequate financial and\n            administrative capabilities need to be in place, while\n            technical functions need to be decentralized: the experiment\n            of decentralizing to the district level, and strengthening\n            referral committees enhanced local ownership, and\n            participation, with a filtering effect on other\n            tiers/programs, suggesting the need to address its success\n            to the entire health system. Second, on technical and social\n            aspects, the development of service norms is critical, as\n            are timely disbursements, and monitoring performance, to\n            ensure management decisions, and ability to document reforms\n            that share experiences, and promote learning. Third, on\n            operational aspects, synchronizing hardware/software\n            activities is also critical, which calls for a strengthened\n            procurement management regarding equipment supply, and civil\n            works cost escalations."}, "docdt": "2002-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
