The project provides for infrastructure\n            development in a key port in northeastern China, as well as\n            technical assistance and training to strengthen the\n            port's management and improve its operating\n            capabilities and to address intermodal aspects of port\n            operations.  To that end, the proposed project consists of:\n            (a) construction of two container berths and two general\n            purpose berths capable of conversion to container berths as\n            and when needed, together with the necessary infrastructure\n            such as dredging, reclamation, pavement, roadways, railways,\n            water supply and sewerage systems.  The project also\n            involves (b) provision of the required loading/unloading\n            equipment, navigational aids and some harbor operation\n            equipment and boats; and (c) provision of training and\n            technical assistance for port planning, construction\n            supervision, financial management, and preparation of two\n            studies:  one for updating the port's Master Plan and\n            the other for intermodal distribution containers in the\n            hinterland of Dalian."}, "docdt": "1988-01-05T00:00:00Z"}
