                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The primary development objectives of JRP2 are to: (1) provide Armenia's judiciary with the administration, facilities and expanded capacity necessary to
                         improve the efficiency, reliability and transparency of judicial operations and services; and (2) continue to improve awareness of judicial services and access to
                         legal and judicial information. JRP2 will support the Armenian judiciary in implementing a second stage of judicial reforms launched by passage of
                         Constitutional amendments and the introduction of a new Judicial Code. Achievement of the Project Development Objectives will be measured by performance
                         indicators, including Government and judicial operational statistics supplemented by: (i) measures of court performance and user perceptions (BEEPS); (ii)
                         expert assessments of judicial qualifications and training (American Bar Association's CEELI Judicial Reform Index); and (iii) project funded monitoring and
                         evaluation efforts (court users survey and NGO court monitoring).

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Implementation of the project is generally in line with target indicators. The main pending activity is capacity building assistance for Academy of Justice and development of
                         training courses on specific topics. The activity is still on hold because of the delays with adoption of the Law on Academy of Justice. The draft law was originally included in the
                         agenda for the additional session of the National Assembly in December 2010, but was ultimately dropped. Nevertheless the construction of the training facilities is already ongoing
                         and will facilitate provision of technical assistance once the legislation is in place.

                         Overall, as of MTR stage, the project demonstrates about 35% average achievement for project outcome indicators and 55% for immediate outcome indicators (measured based on
                         normalized progress from baseline to target values for each particular indicator from the results frameworks for the credit and co-financing grants).

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The mission proposed streamlining the environmental review and monitoring procedures currently applied by Project Implementation Unit (PIU) through the introduction of
                         Environmental Management Checklist for Small Construction and Rehabilitation Activities, now broadly applied across the Bank portfolio. The use of this instrument would allow PIU
                         developing site-specific Environmental Management Plans (EMP) for individual construction sites based on the framework EMP compiled at the project preparation phase and to
                         accurately monitor application of the recommended specific mitigation measures.
