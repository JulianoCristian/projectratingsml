satisfactory.

Significant\n            lessons learned during project implementation include: 1)\n            operations seeking to modernize organizational practices\n            even through apparently low key technical investments in ICT\n            should expect and explicitly address potential risks,\n            resistance, and mitigating measures; 2) change management\n            efforts might be more effective if the accountability\n            systems are introduced at project inception; 3) selective\n            use of independent project monitoring mechanisms, especially\n            of an expert character, can bring credible feedback on\n            project performance; and 4) project team continuity is valuable."}, "docdt": "2013-12-19T00:00:00Z"}
