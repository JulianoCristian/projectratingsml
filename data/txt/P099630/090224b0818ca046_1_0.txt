                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The primary development objectives of JRP2 are to: (1) provide Armenia's judiciary with the administration, facilities and expanded capacity necessary to improve the
                         efficiency, reliability and transparency of judicial operations and services; and (2) continue to improve awareness of judicial services and access to legal and judicial
                         information. JRP2 will support the Armenian judiciary in implementing a second stage of judicial reforms launched by passage of Constitutional amendments and the
                         introduction of a new Judicial Code. Achievement of the Project Development Objectives will be measured by performance indicators, including Government and
                         judicial operational statistics supplemented by: (i) measures of court performance and user perceptions (BEEPS); (ii) expert assessments of judicial qualifications and
                         training (American Bar Association's CEELI Judicial Reform Index); and (iii) project funded monitoring and evaluation efforts (court users survey and NGO court
                         monitoring).

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The closing date of the project is extended till June 30, 2013. The Implementation of the project is generally in line with target indicators, despite the delays related with some capacity
                         building activities on judicial training, where the option of introducing distance learning modules is observed. The project has already supplied Armenian judiciary with over 20,000
                         sqm rehabilitated premises for operation and training, necessary case management and transparency (on-line access to legal and judicial acts) information system, etc. In addition to
                         series of public awareness activities, a court monitoring activity, inter alia, focusing on assessing the project impact from another prospect, has been initiated and will be completed
                         shortly.

                         Since December 2011 judiciary has been making steps in piloting random case assignment in first instance Yerevan courts. To facilitate potential implementation of project
                         recommendations on random case assignment and evaluation of judges, a workshop was organized by the World Bank via videoconferencing in end-January 2012, in which senior
                         judges and judicial officials from Singapore, Macedonia, Portugal and the USA participated. The purpose of this conference was to support the Armenian peers in finding the
                         appropriate model for the evaluation of judges, which could further enhance the impact and sustainability of the project funded activities and results on the ground. Following the
                         workshop additional activities were conceptualized on judicial budgeting and statistics currently being procured through consultancy services.
