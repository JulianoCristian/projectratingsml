                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The primary development objectives of JRP2 are to: (1) provide Armenia's judiciary with the administration, facilities and expanded capacity necessary to improve the
                         efficiency, reliability and transparency of judicial operations and services; and (2) continue to improve awareness of judicial services and access to legal and judicial
                         information. JRP2 will support the Armenian judiciary in implementing a second stage of judicial reforms launched by passage of Constitutional amendments and the
                         introduction of a new Judicial Code. Achievement of the Project Development Objectives will be measured by performance indicators, including Government and
                         judicial operational statistics supplemented by: (i) measures of court performance and user perceptions (BEEPS); (ii) expert assessments of judicial qualifications and
                         training (American Bar Association's CEELI Judicial Reform Index); and (iii) project funded monitoring and evaluation efforts (court users survey and NGO court
                         monitoring).

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The implementation of the project was completed by the extended closing date of June 30, 2013. Project disbursements have been ahead of projections during the entire life of the
                         project. According to the completion mission's assessment 5 out of total 6 project development objective indicators have been achieved.

                         The most robust project results include rehabilitation of 23,500 square meters of judicial infrastructure, including 16 courthouses, buildings for the Forensic Center and the Academy
                         of Justice, and launch of modern ICT solutions at Courts, Judicial Department and Enforcement Service. All the rehabilitated courts were fully furnished and equipped by audio case
                         recording systems. The information management systems developed under the project include (a) Case Management System (CAST2) at courts, (b) DataLex Portal (www.datalex.
                         am), (c) e-Payments (www.e-payments.am), (d) MIS for Enforcement Service (MAKS), and (e) updated ARLIS legal database, etc.

                         Nevertheless, the progress on improvement of public perception about the courts appeared to be marginal. The activities with limited progress were related to removal and
                         disciplining of judges, efficiency of court support stuff and public confidence in courts. Number of delivered project outputs enable advancing the lagging reforms on judicial statistics,
                         budgeting and evaluation of judges in the future (after the project completion), which will largely contribute to meeting the remaining project targets as well. These reforms (systems)
                         will be endorsed through scheduled legislative amendments to meet the end-2013 deadline set in 2012-2016 Judicial Reform Strategy.
