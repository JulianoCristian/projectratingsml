7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The primary development objectives of JRP2 are to: (1) provide Armenia's judiciary with the
administration, facilities and expanded capacity necessary to improve the efficiency, reliability and
transparency of judicial operations and services; and (2) continue to improve awareness of judicial services
and access to legal and judicial information. JRP2 will support the Armenian judiciary in implementing a
second stage of judicial reforms launched by passage of Constitutional amendments and the introduction of
a new Judicial Code. Achievement of the Project Development Objectives will be measured by
performance indicators, including Government and judicial operational statistics supplemented by: (i)
measures of court performance and user perceptions (BEEPS); (ii) expert assessments of judicial
qualifications and training (American Bar Association's CEELI Judicial Reform Index); and (iii) project
funded monitoring and evaluation efforts (court users survey and NGO court monitoring).
