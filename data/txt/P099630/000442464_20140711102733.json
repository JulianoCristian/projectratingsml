The purpose of the investigation\n            underlying this report is to allow the World Bank Group\n            (WBG) to determine if the rules have been violated. This\n            report summarizes the findings of an administrative inquiry\n            (the investigation) by the WBG's Integrity Vice\n            Presidency (INT) into allegations of irregularities in a\n            joint venture bid submitted by Company A for a contract\n            under the Bank-financed Armenian project. The investigation\n            involved Company A and a Company A representative. INT\n            investigated allegations that Company A, under the\n            supervision of such representative, submitted a bank\n            reference letter containing false information in the bid for\n            a contract under the project. INT's interviews with\n            relevant parties and review of correspondence between\n            Company A's joint venture partner, Company B, and the\n            Issuing Bank indicate that Company B was not aware that the\n            bank reference letter was false. The WBG reserves the right\n            to invoke its privileges and immunities, including at any\n            time during the course of an investigation or a subsequent\n            judicial or other proceeding pursued in connection with this matter."}, "docdt": "2014-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
