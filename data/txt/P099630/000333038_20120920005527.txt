1. The closing date for Armenia, Second Judicial Reform Project, Credit 4265-AM and
   PHRD Grant TF 057514, P099630 will be extended from December 31, 2012 until
   June 30, 2013.

2.      The implementation of the project has been progressing well, with high rates of
disbursement and made publicly acknowledged improvements in the area of judicial
transparency and court administration. The delays in commencing a few project activities
were due to technical and organizational reasons. The project development objective, to
(1) provide Armenia’s judiciary with the administration, facilities and expanded capacity
necessary to improve the efficiency, reliability and transparency of judicial operations
and services; and (2) continue to improve awareness of judicial services and access to
legal and judicial information, remains achievable and in-line with 2012-2016 Strategic
Program for Legal and Judicial Reforms in the Republic of Armenia.

3.       The proposed extension is necessary to complete the Credit funded construction
of Kapan courthouse and Japanese PHRD co-financing grant funded technical assistance
related to capacity building activities on judicial training, judicial budgeting and
statistics. The Recipient has an action plan to complete the activities before the extended
closing date.

4.     The audited financial statements on the project have been received by due date.

5.     This will be the first extension of the project.
