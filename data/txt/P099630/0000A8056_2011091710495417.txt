                         The Implementation of the project is in line with target indicators. The main pending activity is capacity building assistance for Judicial School and development of training courses on
                         specific topics. The activity has been on hold because of the delays with adoption of the Law on Academy of Justice, which would merge Judicial School with training institution for
                         prosecutors. Nevertheless the construction of the training facilities is already ongoing and will facilitate provision of technical assistance once the legislation is in place. Decision was
                         made to initiate development of couple of model distance training courses for the training institution in cooperation with the Judicial Department without waiting for reorganization of

                         Following MTR of the project Council of Court Chairmen adopted rules for random case assignment that will be piloted in selected Yerevan courts. The new Judicial Reform Strategy
                         and 2012-2014 Action Plan was drafted and will be finalized by Ministry of Justice and adopted by the President of Armenia by the end of 2011. The draft strategy includes specific
                         actions and targets for the most challenging institutional reforms supported under the project (e.g. random case assignment, evaluation of judges, judicial budgeting and statistics)
                         and will ensure consistency of reform course after completion of Bank financed project. To facilitate implementation of relevant project recommendations, the Bank team proposed to
                         organize series of targeted video conferences for key judicial reform stakeholders to provide wider international perspective for decision making. A number of public awareness and
                         well as court case analyses and monitoring efforts are to commence in Fall 2011 and will ensure further improvement in transparency of judiciary and public perceptions in courts.
