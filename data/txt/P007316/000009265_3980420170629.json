The\n            project was appraised in September 1990, negotiated in April\n            1991, and approved by the Banks Board in June 1991. The\n            credit agreement was signed in September 1991, but the\n            project never became effective, because the coup d etat that\n            took place the same month led to the termination of all\n            international assistance to the de facto government. Even\n            though the project never became effective, the major lesson\n            learned is that the activities proposed for the project were\n            very important for the country. They were already necessary\n            to Haitis sustainable development when the project was\n            prepared, and they are even more vital now to Haitis\n            reconstruction needs. As indicated in the report of the\n            first inter-agency mission which visited Haiti after the\n            return of the constitutional government in October 1994, it\n            is highly unlikely that much economic progress can be\n            achieved in the absence of improvement in education quality\n            and access."}, "docdt": "1996-02-26T00:00:00Z"}
