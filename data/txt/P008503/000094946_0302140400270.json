Lessons highlight\n            primarily the importance of project ownership, and effective\n            management, actions which proved critical in accelerating\n            the slow pace of implementation, by ensuring that qualified\n            staff and consultants move the project towards successful\n            development objectives. While the autonomy of the\n            participating financial institutions (PFIs) in the selection\n            of subprojects was conducive to a sound loan portfolio\n            (based on a commercially driven criteria), this however, led\n            indirectly to the high dominance of large borrowers, at an\n            advantage over the smaller ones, in the ability to present\n            adequate collateral, and economies of scale. Thus, in order\n            to broaden the scale of rural lending, gaps in lending to\n            smaller, underserved rural clients needs to be further\n            analyzed; possibly, supporting microfinance, through\n            non-bank financial institutions. Moreover, public\n            information campaigns, technical assistance, and training\n            should be further emphasized so as to enhance credit\n            operational sustainability, and the capacity of PFIs, in\n            order to lower the high risk, and costs perceived in rural\n            lending. Similarly, although services to rural clients in\n            the preparation of their business plans, training, and\n            seminars were conducted free of charge, emphasis should\n            focus on the need to determine, and establish a financing\n            mechanism for these capacity building activities, to foster\n            long-term sustainability."}, "docdt": "2003-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
