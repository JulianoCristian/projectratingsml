                          (b)     Improved access and utilization of treatment and care services for HIV/AIDS infected and affected persons, notably the persons living with HIV/AIDS

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Despite the post election crisis, the project is making progress in reaching project targets. For example: (iI) the percentage and number of high risk groups female sex workers (FSW)
                         who received an HIV test in the last 12 months and who came back for their test increased from 2912 (28% of the target) in June 2010 to 6933 (99%) in June 2011; (ii) the
                         percentage and number of adults and children with advanced HIV infection receiving antiretroviral therapy rose by 1,303 people increasing from 218 to 1501, representing 61 % of the

                         end of project target; (iii) the number of sub-contracts awarded and implemented for High Risk Groups (HRG ) and the vulnerable increased from 74 subprojects to 81, surpassing
                         the end of project target by 59%. Studies related to the impact indicators launched in 2010 have been delayed due to the crisis.

                         Disbursement: Currently all project funds have been committed; disbursement increased from 55% in January 2011 to currently 75.86%. It is expected that the full Grant amount will
                         be disbursed prior to the closing date (June 2012).
