Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The emergency HIV/AIDS Multi-Sectoral Project aimed to support the government
response to the pandemic by:

  (a) Strengthening access to and increased utilization of prevention services among
vulnerable and high risk groups (such as women, youth, commercial sex workers,
personnel of line ministries);

  (b) Improving access and utilization of treatment and care services for HIV/AIDS
infected and affected persons, notably the persons living with HIV/AIDS (including
PLWHA and OVC).

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      Cote d’Ivoire is the second largest economy in the West African sub region with a
population of 21.9 million (2010) of which 43% are under 15 years old and more than
half are living in the rural areas. The 2005 report on Human Development (Rapport sur le
Développement Humain 2005) indicated that average annual population growth rate was
3.3, the total fertility rate was estimated at 4.6, the maternal mortality ratio was 960
deaths per 100,000 live births, and the infant mortality rate was 84 deaths per 1000 live
births). Life expectancy at birth had decreased from 51 years in 1998 to 45.9 years in
2003 (Rapport sur le Développement Humain 2005).

2.     The country was stable for almost three decades and took advantage of this to
develop its economy, achieving double digit growth. This exceptional growth was in
large measure due to the dynamism of the agricultural sector, but falling prices had an
impact on this growth. From 1981 to 1992, annual GDP growth averaged -0.2% and
Côte d’Ivoire slipped from the rank of middle income countries into the low income
group. The devaluation of the CFAF in 1994 triggered an economic rebound, but this was
soon undermined by the political crisis which began in 1999.

3.     The political crisis started in December 1999, culminating in a brief civil war in
2002 and resulting in the partition of the country into two zones, one under control of the
Government and the other one under control of the rebels. The 2010 presidential election
was followed by post electoral troubles which paralyzed the country for almost 9 months.
The country is currently recovering slowly with peace prevailing in most parts of the
country. Nevertheless, the reconciliation and peaceful coexistence of this multi-ethnic
country remains the major challenge.

4.      The political instability and the economic crisis had increased the level of poverty
from 10% in 1985 to 38% in 2002 (Enquête Nationale de vulnérabilité – 2002). Social
sectors, including the health sector, were also affected with reductions in the availability
and use of basic social services including HIV/AIDS services.

5.      At the time of the project appraisal, Cote d’Ivoire was among the countries in
West Africa most affected by HIV/AIDS with HIV prevalence of 4.7 percent and an
estimated 750,000 people living with HIV/AIDS, including 74,000 children aged 0-14
years. It was estimated that 65,000 adults and children had already died of AIDS.




                                             1
6.     The HIV/AIDS epidemic in Cote d’Ivoire was considered generalized with the
following characteristics (AIS 2005):

        a. Feminization – the HIV prevalence was significantly higher among females
           (6.4%) compared to males (2.9%);
        b. Urban and geographical differences – the prevalence is higher in urban areas
           (7.4% for females and 3.2% for males than in rural areas (5.5% for female
           and 2.5% for male) ;
        c. Poor knowledge about HIV (only 16.5 % of females and 26% of males had a
           comprehensive knowledge about HIV);
        d. Early sexual debut - 73% of young males and 56% of young females had
           their first sexual relations before the age of 18 years;
        e. Multiple concurrent sexual partnerships (33.2% of females and 58.1% of
           males had extra conjugal sexual intercourse);
        f. Transactional sex – 2.2 % of males indicated that they pay for sex ;
        g. Relatively high HIV prevalence among Commercial Sex Workers (CSWs)
           (27% in 2004)
        h. Limited use of condoms during high risk sexual intercourse (12% among
           females and 30% among males);
        i. Limited access and utilization of VCT services (only 13% of females and
           10% of males had ever been tested for HIV);
        j. Limited access and utilization of PMTCT services (only 7% of pregnant
           women had been counseled and tested for HIV).

7.     Based on these indicators, the populations at higher risk for acquiring and
transmitting HIV included sero-discordant couples, uniformed service members, ex-
combatants, commercial sex workers, economically vulnerable women and girls, truckers
and mobile populations, sexually active youth, and orphans and vulnerable children. The
major factors contributing to the spread of the HIV infection included early sexual debut,
intergenerational and multiple concurrent sexual partnerships, poor knowledge about HIV
transmission and prevention methods, and low condom use.

8.     The initial Government response to the HIV epidemic was introduced in 1986
with the development and implementation of short and medium-term plans by the
National AIDS Program under the Ministry of Health. In comparison to the other
countries, Cote d’Ivoire was the first African country to launch an ARV program in 1998
with the support of UNAIDS. In 2001, a Ministry was established which was exclusively
dedicated to leading the fight against HIV/ADS (Ministère de la Lutte contre le SIDA)
with specific tasks which included coordination, advocacy, and resource mobilization. A
multi sectorial approach became a cornerstone of the anti-HIV/AIDS strategy, and the
Ministry was a strong advocate for this strategy.

9.     The 2002-2005 HIV/AIDS National Strategic Plan was only partially
implemented because of the political situation in the country and the constantly changing
coordinating bodies for the national HIV response.



                                            2
10.     The rationale for Bank involvement included the Bank’s comparative advantage
versus other donors to pull together countries and partners, especially in the context of
AIDS programming; its ability to work across various line ministries and sectors; and the
fact that HIV growth was a threat to human capital, economic growth, and overall
poverty reduction. Compared to the available funding for the implementation of the
National Strategic Plan (2006-2010) from domestic sources and contribution from
donors, the World Bank financial support to the plan was relatively small with specific
objectives to fill the identified strategic gaps which were determined according to two
dimensions: geographic coverage and service provision.
      a. To fill the geographic gap, four regions out of nineteen regions of the country
         were identified on the basis of the level of the HIV epidemic, existing support
         from other partners, and ethnic composition of the population (taken into account
         to ensure a balance between ex-warring parties and avoid triggering political
         backlash);
      b. With regard to service provision, prevention stood out as being desperately under-
         funded with less than a quarter of the total estimated budget of the National
         Strategic Plan dedicated to prevention activities. Within prevention, emphasis was
         to be placed on the groups most likely to contribute to new infections, such as sex
         workers, and on the activities combining a low cost per capita and a relatively
         high-risk target, such as school-based prevention.
      c. In these four regions, the project was designed to scale up available support,
         strengthening and rationalizing ongoing activities, and launching new activities in
         line with the NSP (National Strategy Plan). The aim was to ensure full coverage
         of vulnerable and high-risk groups.

11.     Being a fragile and post-conflict country, Cote d’Ivoire has suffered from
exacerbation of risk factors (large population movements, increased number and
movement of armed men, widespread sexual violence, etc.) that are associated with the
spread of the disease. Thus, the AIDS epidemic in such conditions required a rapid and
flexible response which was possible to be delivered under OP/BP 8.0. The use of the
streamlined procedures allowed under OP/BP 8.00 was to help ensure timely processing
of the operation in direct support of the immediate needs of the Government in
addressing the AIDS pandemic. It was also to make it possible for the project to reach its
“cruising speed” faster and to be implemented in a more flexible manner, for example by
allowing start-up activities to begin with an interim arrangement.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
    approved)
 
12.     The objective of the Project was to support the Recipient’s response to the
HIV/AIDS pandemic, focusing on four (4) Regions, by: (a) strengthening access to and
increasing utilization of prevention services among vulnerable and high-risk groups, such
as women, youth, commercial sex workers, and personnel of line ministries; and (b)
improving access to and utilization of treatment and care services for HIV/AIDS infected
and affected persons, notably persons living with HIV/AIDS, orphans, and vulnerable
children.  


                                              3
13.    The four focus regions included the following: (i) the Savannah Region in the
north of the country, the Mountain and former Moyen Cavally Region in the West, the
Lagoons Comoé Region in the South, and Abidjan. The total population of these regions
is estimated at 10.5 million (the last census was in 1998), which represented
approximately 48% of the total population of the country. 
14.     Over and above the activities in the four focus regions, the project financed some
interventions with country-wide coverage to strengthen the national prevention effort. For
example, the instruments and mechanisms developed for the intensive IEC campaigns
targeting commercial sex workers and vulnerable youth were piloted in the four focus
regions but later expanded to other areas of the country. 

15.      The logical results chain toward the achievement of project development
objectives led from the inputs to increase the national capacities to implement project
activities which should be translated into the following outcomes: increased knowledge
and awareness of HIV, increased safe sexual practice, and improved access to and
utilization of HIV/AIDS prevention, care and treatment services. A set of four PDO
indicators were selected to monitor the progress toward the Project Development
Objectives
           a. Percentage of female sex workers reporting the use of a condom with their
              most recent client;
           b. Percentage of women and men from 15-49 years of age having had more
              than 1 sexual partner in the preceding 12 months reporting condom use
              during their last sexual intercourse;
           c. Percentage and number of HIV-infected pregnant women who received a
              completed antiretroviral treatment to reduce the risk of mother-to-child
              transmission;
           d. Percentage and number of adults and children with advanced HIV
              infection receiving antiretroviral therapy (disaggregated by sex and age).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

16.    The primary beneficiaries of the project were the vulnerable and high risk groups
such as (i) Commercial sex workers (male and female), (ii) Orphans and vulnerable
children (OVC), (iii) people living with HIV/AIDS and affected individuals and families,
and (iv) particularly vulnerable youth and women which include women living in low-
income neighborhoods of the urban centers in the four focus regions. These included two
regions formerly controlled in whole or in part by the rebels (in the north and west) and
two controlled entirely by the Government (in the south and Abidjan). As noted in
paragraph 13, the total population of the focus regions is estimated at 10.5 million.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

17.    The Project is in the amount of US$20 million and consists of four components:

18.     Component 1: Social mobilization and HIV/AIDS Prevention Services for
vulnerable and high risk groups (US$6.4 million. This component supported the
implementation of social mobilization and HIV/AIDS prevention activities by national
and international NGO’s. These activities were planned to be implemented mainly in the
four regions and targeting identified the high risk beneficiary groups noted above.

19.     In addition, this component provided support to the private sector in these regions
to set up HIV/AIDS committees in agro industrial enterprises which had implemented
various HIV/AIDS prevention activities in the workplace. It also financed several country
wide interventions such as intensive Information Education and Communication
campaigns targeting commercial sex workers and vulnerable youth, as well as mass
campaigns for the general public to improve knowledge about HIV/AIDS and reduce the
stigmatization of PLWHA and other high-risk groups.

20.     Component 2: Public Sector Interventions: Prevention and Care (US$7.8
million). This component was intended to support the provision of prevention and
treatment services in the four focus regions by the Ministry of Health (subcomponent 2.1)
and to support the three key Ministries (Education, Defense and Interior) which had a
mandate to cover the target groups that could not be easily reached through the NGOs.
These target groups included youth who are in school, the armed forces, and the police
respectively (subcomponent 2.2).

21.      Component 3: Capacity Building (US$3.3 million): This component aimed to
facilitate effective implementation of the project by building the capacity of project
implementers: key technical Ministries (Education, Health, Social affairs, Youth, etc.)
and civil society members. The component also financed strengthening of the
performance of the four regional project coordination units.

22.    Component 4: Coordination, Management, Monitoring and Evaluation (US$2.5
million): The component supported the overall coordination, monitoring and evaluation
of the project by funding (a) the incremental operating costs for the Project
Implementation Unit (PIU); (b) the fiduciary management firm; and (c) the establishment
of a comprehensive, computerized national monitoring and evaluation system for
HIV/AIDS-related activities.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Identification/Preparation

23.    Initial project identification started in November 2000 and was extended until
August 2002. A concept review was held in June, 2002 with a $50 million project being
envisioned using the classic Multi-Sectoral AIDS Project (MAP) approach.

24.     Once the PCN review was completed, a PHRD Grant in the amount of $1 million
was provided for project preparation. This grant was almost three-quarters utilized
before it closed in 2005. The deteriorating political situation in September 2002
prevented further preparation activities. In December 2003, following the first peace
agreement, project preparation continued and the project was appraised in March and
April, 2004, still with an allocation of US$50 million. In November 2004, due to the
political turmoil in the country, the World Bank suspended its entire program in the
country and as a result the preparation process was once again frozen.

25.   Following the peace agreement in 2007 and the appointment of a national Unity
government, the Bank lifted the suspension of its operations in the country. A new ISN
was developed and the Bank decided to support the country under OP/BP 8.0.

26.     Project preparation was re-launched in February 2008 and it was decided to
reduce the project amount to US$ 20 million to target just four regions. In addition, there
were a number of developments on the ground which affected preparation of this version
of the project, including: (i) availability of a new HIV/AIDS strategic plan (2006-2010)
which was designed based on the recent evidence about the epidemiological situation
(AIDS Indicator Survey 2005) and (ii) availability of more resources for HIV/AIDS
which were mobilized from external donors such as Global Funds, PEPFAR, etc.

27.     The HIV/AIDS National Strategic Plan (2006-2010) guided the identification of
priority areas as well as the target populations for the World Bank supported Emergency
Multi-Sectoral HIV/AIDS Project. The National Strategic Plan focused on seven pillars
of interventions such as prevention, care and support, coordination, monitoring and
evaluation, etc. The Plan also specified a clear organization and coordination framework
at the national, regional, district and local level (Section 4.3) The total estimated budget
was US$594 million of which 56% was dedicated to care and support and less than a
quarter to the prevention activities. About 96% of the total budget was secured, with the
major contributor being the US Government through the PEPFAR.

28.     Taking these factors into consideration, the World Bank developed a new set of
interventions consistent with the HIV/AIDS National Strategic Plan (2006-2010) which
identified the priority areas as well as target populations. The new project design focused
on the following pillars: prevention, care and treatment and monitoring and evaluation
for evidence based policy. It aimed at filling the strategic gaps (both in terms of
geography and service provision) and exploit synergies with ongoing efforts.


                                             6
29.     The strategic gaps would be filled through the focus on four underserved regions
of the country – two of which being under the control of the rebels – a well as prevention
activities with emphasis on most at risk populations such as sex workers and their clients
which were the drivers of the epidemic.

30.     In sum, due to the ongoing fragility and intermittent conflict situation, preparation
of this project entailed multiple disruptions and re-design, with 6 years between the initial
PCN Review in June 2002 and eventual Board approval in June 2008.

Design

31.     The design reflected the experience and lessons learned by the country while
implementing HIV/AIDS activities in such areas as promotion and distribution of
condoms for female sex workers, care and treatment of STIs, care and support of people
infected and affected by HIV/AIDS including orphans and vulnerable children,
involvement of NGO’s (local and international) and empowerment of civil society. The
involvement of the NGO’S (local and international) to reach some target populations was
considered an advantage since (a) these populations are often discriminated against and
marginalized, and therefore avoid contact with public services and (b) the public sector
often lacks the capacities and experience to provide such services.

32.     The project design has also incorporated the lessons learned from the evaluation
of HIV/AIDS MAP projects in Africa. Lessons include the need for strong political
leadership and commitment; country ownership as a process of empowerment; a multi
sectorial and decentralized approach; focus on high risk and vulnerable groups; and the
use of an independent agency to carry out fiduciary functions. The design stresses the
need for efficient partnership and collaboration to ensure better coordination of the
national HIV response. The overall supervision role of the National HIV/AIDS Control
Council (NACC) chaired by the Head of State with the participation of representatives
from all socio-professional groups including associations of people living with
HIV/AIDS was clearly indicated in the PAD.

33.    A project Implementation Unit (PIU) created at central level under the Ministry in
charge of HIV/AIDS (Ministere de la Lutte contre le SIDA) was in charge of daily
management of the project. The PIU was composed of contracted staff recruited through
a competitive process including a National Coordinator (NC), a Public Sector Program
Officer; a Civil Society Program Officer; a Monitoring and Evaluation Officer; a
Capacity Strengthening Officer; and a Fiduciary Management Team (FMT), which was
in charge of Financial management and procurement aspects. This PIU complemented
the Ministry, which did not have specific expertise on financial management and
procurement in Bank-financed projects, and had a limited number of staff who were fully
committed to other duties. A PIU was therefore considered an appropriate vehicle.

34.     At the decentralized level, the management of project activities as well as overall
coordination of the national HIV/AIDS response was given to the existing Regional
AIDS committees. It was agreed that the project would provide the needed support to
these regional institutions to meet their obligations.


                                             7
Risks and Mitigation measures

35.    The PAD identified a number of risks that might jeopardize the implementation of
the project and the achievement of development objectives if the appropriate mitigation
measures were not implemented. The following major risks were identified:

      a. Insecurity, instability and uncertainty about holding of elections – despite the
         peace agreement in March 2007 and the redeployment of government
         administration in the areas formerly occupied by the rebels, the overall security
         concern remained acute. This risk was to be mitigated by close follow up and
         strong implementation support to the peace process by the World Bank and other
         key development partners;
      b. Insufficient implementation capacity – the decade of crisis weakened the
         capacity of both the public and private sector and posed a greater risk to the
         successful implementation. In view of the decentralized governance arrangement,
         it was felt that this would require the presence of competent and dynamic
         individuals both at the national and at the regional level. The establishment of the
         Project Implementation Unit to monitor overall project implementation, the use of
         Regional AIDS Committees to act as regional coordinating units, and the
         inclusion of a Capacity Building Component were all thus intended to strengthen
         the capacity of implementing agencies and to support sectorial focal points;
      c. High governance and fiduciary risk – governance and transparency indicators
         of the country were among the worst in the world. The control environment was
         very weak and the impact of internal audits and external audit bodies was not
         effective. Throughout the project preparation, the Bank took a number of
         precautions to ring-fence the operation against governance problems and address
         fiduciary risks, including: (a) reliance on an independent fiduciary management
         agency, and (b) independent audits of the Project;
      d. The disrupted health system in 2 regions formerly controlled by the rebels –
         including the insufficiency of human resources, nonfunctioning health facilities,
         lack of leadership at the regional and local level, and weak governance systems
         was also identified as a risk. Mitigation measures included government initiated
         redeployment of required human resources, and project support to this process. It
         was acknowledged, however, that the complete redeployment would take time;
      e. Weak capacity of the Public Health Pharmacy – to supply drugs and medical
         equipment: In order to mitigate this risk, the project carried out international
         procurement through UN agencies.

36.      There was no formal Quality-at-Entry review.




                                              8
2.2 Implementation

37.    The project was implemented in an extremely difficult political and security
environment. It was approved on June 12, 2008 and became effective (October 1, 2008).
The establishment of a functional PIU including the project's fiduciary unit was a
condition of effectiveness and was completed more than 90 days after the signing of the
Financing Agreement, thus delaying effectiveness. This delay raised the effectiveness
flag. Further, by the time the project become effective, the country was divided into two
zones, one controlled by the government and one by the rebellion. Since the official
launching of the project in January, 2009, implementation has not been linear and has
encountered many constraints and as a consequence, the IP rating was changed three
times, moving between Satisfactory to Marginally Satisfactory.

38.     Between October 2008 and February 2009, the project focused on putting in place
the implementation prerequisites such as the recruitment of the project staff, the
validation of project implementation manual and guidelines, and the development and
approval of the annual work for the first calendar year of the project. The 2009 work plan
was mainly focusing on the recruitment of implementing agencies; procurement activities
(NGOs) and the service delivery activities started only in 2010. Unfortunately, the
presidential election in the last quarter of 2010 and the post-election crisis during the first
semester of 2011, which was exacerbated by armed conflict, stopped implementation for
almost nine months before activities resumed in June 2011.

39.     Despite the severe ongoing constraints, the PIU team as well the task team
conducted regular supervision of the project in order to ensure smooth implementation of
project work program. Considerable attention and support was given by the PIU team to
the Regional coordination unit in the project supported four regions.

40.     The election and post-election crisis prevented the planned Mid-Term review
(MTR) which was scheduled for October 2010, from taking place. It was eventually
done in January 2011, when the situation permitted it. As an alternative to the MTR, the
government project team, with the support of the World Bank team, undertook a review
of the project with the objective of assessing project achievements and constraints.

41.     Although the implementation of all project components faced difficulty, the
health subcomponent (2.1) suffered more. The disruption of the health system in the 2
regions formerly controlled by the rebels, the lack of human resources, and the lack of
leadership at the regional and local level delayed the launch of health related activities
considerably. Progress was further hampered by frequent stock-outs of re-agents and
drugs.
42.     This impact on project implementation was not unique to the Bank-financed
project. For example, according to a PEPFAR report, some of their project activities
declined by 60 to 90 percent between (their) FY09 and FY11 (October 2009 to
September 2011), increasing only in FY12. Figure 1, below, shows some of these results:
prevention and training activities appear to have been the most affected; which also
represents a significant portion of the Bank supported interventions.

43.     While similar activity level data is not available for the Bank project, the quarterly
disbursements show much the same pattern (Figure 2), clearly indicating that project
implementation was significantly affected by external factors beyond the control of those
implementing and supporting the project. After the initial allocation and a gradual scale-
up of project activities, disbursements settled in at around $1.5 million per quarter for a
full year – for a respectable disbursement rate of 31% during this period. The crisis later
in 2011 led to virtually no disbursements for 6 months, followed by an increase towards
the end of the project as the country situation improved and implementation once again
ramped up.

44.     Despite this difficult beginning and constraints during the implementation, more
than 85% of planned project activities were executed, including: (i) NGOs were recruited
to implement social mobilization activities, care, and support to vulnerable groups such
as CSW, PLHIV, OVC, etc.; (ii) IEC activities were conducted targeting the large group
of population through local radio stations; (iii) the private sector was supported to
establish workplace HIV/AIDS clubs which delivered HIV/AIDS prevention activities;
and, (iv) 59 health facilities were supported to provide HIV related activities.

45.    As of the project closing date (September 30, 2012), the grant was fully disbursed
although the disbursement was low at the beginning and more than half of the funds
(58%) were disbursed during the last two years of the project.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E Design

46.    The HIV/AIDS National Strategic Plan (2006-2010) is comprised of a national
monitoring and evaluation framework which tracks evolution of the HIV epidemic and
monitors the performance of the national response to HIV/AIDS. This framework has
defined a set of indicators (outputs, outcomes and program performance) with a well-
documented data collection methodology to allow efficient tracking of the progress made.

47.     The M&E subcomponent of the project was designed to ensure availability of data
required to monitor progress towards achievement of the project development objectives
while strengthening the overall National HIV/AIDS M&E system. The proposed M&E
arrangements under the project included a combination of routine health services data,
monitoring on HIV/AIDS program activities, periodic behavioral and biological
surveillance surveys, and periodic surveys on the coverage and quality of services. Box
1 below outlines the various surveys that were either full or partially funded by or
otherwise available to the project.



                                                     11
                          Box 1 – Population Based Surveys

Two general population surveys were available during the project timeframe. First the
AIDS Indicator Survey (AIS 2005), was conducted in 2005 and provided
comprehensive indicators on knowledge, attitudes, behavior and HIV/AIDS status. It
covered 5,183 females and 4,503 males aged 15-49 in 4,368 households. A
Demographic and Household Survey (DHS 2012) was done in 2012 and included
10,060 females and 5,135 males aged 15-49 in 9,689 households. As a standard DHS
survey, it included many other topics, but had good coverage or HIV/AIDS related
knowledge, attitudes and behaviors as well as HIV prevalence through testing, as in the
AIS 2005. Aside from the oversampling of females, the approaches with respect to
HIV/AIDS were consistent. Both surveys included regional level data (8 regions), with
roughly equal sampling between regions (around 400 households per region in the AIS
and around 850 per region in the DHS).

During the course of the project, three separate surveys were undertaken covering
knowledge, attitudes and practices relating to HIV/AIDS and STD. One of these
covered the general population and the other two of focused on commercial sex workers
(CSW) and one covered the general population. The sample size, coverage and specific
questions varied between the three surveys. The first one was the “Comportements,
Attitudes et Pratiques des Professionnelles du Sexe vis-a-vis des IST/VIH/SIDA dans 8
Départements les Plus Affectées par la Crise en Côte d’Ivoire” (Behavior, Attitude and
Practice of Sex Workers vis-a-vis STD / HIV / AIDS in 8 Departments Most Affected
by the Crisis in Ivory Coast). It was done in 2007 and is taken as the baseline in several
indicators (referred to as ENSEA 2007. In total, 2,461 CSW were surveyed, with about
half of those in the city of Abidjan (1 213) and the rest in 7 other cities in the country
(Yamoussoukro, San-Pedro, Man, Duékoué, Danané, Daloa et Bouaké.

The second survey was done in 2011: “Analyse des Connaisances, Attitudes et
Pratiques des Professionnel (les) du Sexe dans 18 Villes de la Côte d’Ivoire” (Analysis
of Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices of Commercial Sex Workers in 18 Cities of Côte
d'Ivoire – KAP 2011). In total, 5,720 female and 468 male sex workers were surveyed
from cities in were both in project focus regions and those not covered by the project
and the analysis provided to date does not differentiate between the two groups of cities.

The third survey was a general population survey entitled: “Enquête connaissances,
attitudes et pratiques sur les IST et le VIH/SIDA dans les régions des lagunes, des
montagnes, des savanes et du sud Comoé” (Survey of knowledge, attitudes and
practices on STD and HIV / AIDS in the areas of Lagunes, Montangnes, Savannes and
southern Comoé). Known as ECAP 2011, it was a general population survey of focus
regions as well as Abidjan, although the presence of the capital city was not noted in the
title. The survey covered 3,339 persons aged 10-49 years in 1,499 households,
distributed equally among the five areas.

48.    Project performance indicators were a subset of the national monitoring and
evaluation framework and the baseline data as well as the targets were clearly defined in

the PAD. However, there are discrepancies between the source used for the baseline and
the source proposed and/or eventually used to track the progress, which limited data
comparability. Part of this was due to the fact that national survey data (AIS 2005) had to
be used for some of the baseline indicators, but since eventual project had more limited
geographic scope, focusing on only 4 regions, the national level baseline data was not
appropriate. Fortunately, as indicated above, since both the AIDS Indicator Survey of
2005 and the DHS of 2012 included many of the same indicators and also contained
disaggregation at the regional level, these two surveys facilitated analysis of the likely
impact of the project using population-level survey data, although the regions used are
not a perfect match for the intervention areas of the project, The 2012 DHS data (final
report pending) only became available well into the preparation of the ICR, and in fact
extensions of the ICR delivery date were required in order to take advantage of it and
fully analyze this data.  

M&E Implementation and Utilization

49.     With regards to the operationalization of the M&E subcomponent, the following
activities were implemented:

       a. In addition to having staff in country to monitor progress on an ongoing basis,
          periodic formal supervision missions were also conducted to ensure timely
          implementation of the work program and to undertake the quality audit of
          reported data by implementing agencies;
       b. Regional and Sectoral mid-term reviews of the work program were conducted;
       c. Financed the development of a strategy on HIV/AIDS vulnerability and
          response among the youth. UNICEF collaborated to develop the TOR, and
          UNICEF and UNFPA are now developing activities based on this document.
       d. 346 persons were trained on M&E of HIV/AIDS;
       e. Quarterly project progress with all routine data were prepared and widely
          distributed;
       f. The project provided support to the 2012 DHS survey, which proved to be a
          major element in the evaluation of project performance;
       g. The project also funded the KAP study in the four project supported regions.

50.     Despite the early initiation of M&E activities, data informing the project
outcomes indicators were not always available at the time of the ISR completion, mainly
due to the timing of the surveys required to produce the data. Thus, the data for two out
of the four PDO indicators were made available only in December 2010 and for the two
others only in 2011 after completion of the survey.

51.     In sum, the timing of the data availability for some indicators did not facilitate
regular monitoring of the project, but the data provided through the M&E plan and some
of the activities financed under the project were key to support the final evaluation.
However as noted in Box 1, the lack of comparability in the geographic areas covered by
the different surveys made comparisons difficult. Overall, the M&E activities for this
project are rated Moderately unsatisfactory.



                                            13
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

52.     Environment and management of medical waste-At the time of the appraisal, the
project was listed as Category B because the project was not expected to have substantial
adverse environmental effects. The main environmental issue deserving attention was
Medical Waste Management.

53.     As the Medical Waste Management Plan was more than five years old, the Plan
was updated by the Ministry of Health. It was disclosed in the country and at the
Infoshop on November 1, 2002. The project supported the implementation of the updated
plan in the project zone through training of health personnel and communal workers,
installation of four incinerators and provision and distribution to the health centers of
appropriate equipment. The implementation as well as the impact of the project on the
environment was monitored regularly as an element of supervision missions.

54.     Financial management and disbursement: The project appraisal had identified
high fiduciary risk and has proposed appropriate mitigation measures such as contracting
out the fiduciary management to an independent fiduciary management agency and
conducting regular independent audits of the Project. These mitigation measures were
implemented and during the project implementation period, the Financial Management
was rated satisfactory. However the rating has been downgraded in November 2009 from
satisfactory to moderately satisfactory because of the increased risk associated with
having numerous partners working at the national level as well as the regional,
departmental and communal levels. In order to mitigate this risk, the project hired an
internal auditor to strengthen the project financial management system. Throughout the
project life time all the IFRs have been produced on time and all audit reports have been
produced on time and were unqualified.

55.     Disbursement was low during the first two years of the project with 26.8% of
project funds disbursed compared to 65.6% planned. As noted above, this was due to a
number of factors, including delays in project effectiveness and several periods where
Bank-financed activities came to a stand-still across the board due to conflict. However,
as indicated below, the grant was fully disbursed by the closure of the project.

                      Table 1: Disbursement level in percentage

                                           14
56.     Procurement- The project was assisted by two procurement specialists and annual
procurement plans were prepared and implemented satisfactorily. No complaints were
recorded during the life of the project. Accordingly, Procurement has been rated
satisfactory throughout the project life.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

57.     The government has developed and adopted a new HIV/AIDS National Strategic
Plan for the period of 2011-2015 to guide the National HIV/AIDS response. The total
cost of the plan was estimated at US$ 870 of which 67% was already secured by 2011.
The government is working toward filling the remaining gap.

58.     With respect to the current project, the government has developed an exit strategy,
and for the transition period adequate financial resources (740 million CFA or USD 1.5
million equivalent) were mobilized to finance the activities in the short term. Beyond
this, the government has put in place a National Fund for HIV/AIDS through taxes
imposed on alcohol and tobacco purchases with the objective to finance care and
treatment of HIV/AIDS. The Global Fund and other development partners will continue
to support HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care activities.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Relevance of objectives

59.    The epidemiological situation of HIV/AIDS which prevailed at project appraisal
and guided the definition of the project still persists. The country continues to be among
those most affected by HIV/AIDS in West Africa with a high HIV prevalence in 2012
(3.7%) despite a reduction observed from 2005 level (4.7%). The HIV epidemic remains
generalized and marked by gender and geographic differences.

60.    The socio-economic and political crisis has engendered massive displacement of
the population and disruption of the socio-economic system with a negative impact on the
availability and use of basic social services including HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and treatment
services. The country is in the process of a slow recovery from both political and economic
crises, factors that have contributed to the spread of HIV/AIDS are persistent and the national
response needs to be consolidated. Therefore, the focus on most at risk populations continues to
be appropriate since these groups, while being the major drivers of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, are
the most affected. The new HIV/AIDS Strategic plan (2011-2015) has confirmed the
priorities reflected in the previous plan which has guided the definition of the project
development objectives.

61.     The PDO is in alignment with the basic objectives of the PRSP, the Interim
Strategy Note (ISN) and the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). The World Bank’s
involvement in HIV/AIDS in Cote d’Ivoire is consistent with the ISN endorsed by the
Board on April 1, 2008. The objectives of the ISN included Pillar 2 which was designed
to “assist war-affected populations by way of community rehabilitation and support for
the provision of basic social services”, including HIV/AIDS, and support to HIV/AIDS
was specifically mentioned as an intervention. It is also consistent with the 2010-2013
CPS which highlighted the need to improve basic services under Objective 4, including
those relating to HIV/AIDS (“Strengthened access to and increased use of HIV/AIDS
prevention services; improved access and use of treatment and care services”), and also
noted the gender aspect of HIV/AIDS as a cross-cutting issue, since more than twice as
many women as men are infected with the disease.

62.    The relevance of the project development objective is therefore rated substantial. 

Relevance of design

63.     The project design was based on available knowledge of the HIV/AIDS epidemic
and appropriate responses. The situation analysis conducted as part of the development of
the National HIV/AIDS Plan – and used during project preparation – identified most at
risk populations which were both major vectors of disease transmission and key victims
of the disease.




                                              16
64.     The identification of the project beneficiaries, commercial sex workers (male and
female), Orphans and vulnerable children (OVC), people living with HIV/AIDS and
affected individuals and families and particularly vulnerable youth and women including
those living in low-income neighborhoods of the urban centers in the four focus regions
was based on this situation analysis and it continues to be relevant. Moreover, the
targeting of these groups fills a gap in the overall HIV/AIDS strategy for Cote d’Ivoire
which was not and is still not being met by other development partners.

65.     The identified HIV/AIDS prevention, care and treatment activities (HIV/AIDS
awareness creation; safer sexual-behavior by both CSW and their clients, delayed first
sexual intercourse; reduction in early marriage; reduced sex with non-regular partners;
promotion, distribution and use of condoms; promotion and use of voluntary counseling
and testing services, care and treatment of PLWHA including OVC) are still the most
cost-effective activities as of today. Evidence support that the effective implementation of
such interventions would significantly contribute to the control of the HIV epidemic and
achievement of project development objectives.

66.     The project activities are highly relevant and respond to the objectives of the
project. Using NGOs and civil society organizations (CSOs) to reach defined highly
vulnerable populations proved to be a key factor in ensuring that the interventions
provided to these populations largely continued during the crisis. The capacities to
effectively implement the project and to manage the national HIV response had been
identified during project preparation as a major issue, and consequently the project
included the capacity building and M&E components.

67.    The relevance of the project design is therefore rated substantial.


Relevance of implementation

68.    The difficult political and security environment that prevailed in the country at
appraisal and during the project life required great flexibility and innovation. The
coordination of the project as well as the national HIV/AIDS response was under the
responsibility of existing national institutions (NACS and regional Coordination
Committees) which were reinforced throughout the project life. A project management
Unit with competitively recruited national staff was in charge of the project
implementation. This institutional set-up was adequate and allowed timely completion of
the project activities and disbursement despite major upheavals and disruption arising
beyond the project from the country conflict.

69.     The choice of civil society organizations, mainly national NGOs and key public
sector, and private institutions (e.g., helping to set up HN/AIDS committees in the
various agro-industrial enterprises and by supporting various activities for the fight
against HIV/AIDS in the workplace) to implement project activities was another flexible
approach to deliver services to the different categories of beneficiaries in a post conflict
context which prevailed and continues to prevail in the country.



                                            17
70.     The relevance of the implementation approaches for the second component in
general and the health sector response in particular are also still very relevant, although
external circumstances resulted in considerably delays. The PAD has highlighted the
disruption of the health services in the two rebel controlled regions as a risk but the
proposed mitigation (redeployment of personnel by the government) measure was outside
of direct project control. In terms of implementation, the project could have envisaged the
use of NGOs to deliver these essential services, if even for an interim period of time.

71.    Based on this, the relevance of Project Implementation is rated Substantial.

72.    Relevance of the project: Based on the above presented data on the relevance of
the project’s objectives (Substantial), design (Substantial), and implementation
(Substantial), the overall relevance of the project is rated Substantial.


3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

73.    The Project’s development objectives were as follows:

       PDO 1 – To strengthen access to and increase utilization of prevention services
       among vulnerable and high risk groups (such as commercial sex workers, mobile
       populations, and vulnerable women and youth).

       PDO 2 - – To improve access to and utilization of treatment and care services for
       HIV/AIDS infected and affected persons, notably the persons living with
       HIV/AIDS (including PLWHA and OVC).

74.   PDO 1 was expected to be achieved through effective implementation of
component 1 (Social mobilization and HIV/AIDS Prevention Services) and sub-
component 2.2 (Support to the action plans of key Ministries such as Education and
Defense), while the second development objective was implemented through
subcomponent 2.1 (Health Sector).
75.     Before going into the assessment of the achievement of the PDO, it is useful to
consider the changing context in the country between when the project was started and
when it finished. The general sense is that the impact of the conflict in 2011 resulted in a
decline in indicators across the board (the causal chain being that the conflict caused an
increase in poverty, a general decline in services followed by rise in risky behavior and
poor social outcomes), and then a gradual improvement post-conflict. This suggests that
in fact there was a “U”-shaped trajectory to many of the indicators, with the end-line
values representing progress up from the bottom of the “U”, although in many cases not
enough of an improvement to meet the indicator targets.
76.      While it is difficult to get comprehensive data, and the nature of the timing of
many of the PDO indicators meant that the baselines were collected well before the latest
crisis, there is some data that may shed some light on what was going on.



                                            18
77.     In 2010, the Development Economics Group of the Bank began a panel survey of
people who received counseling and testing. The original sample was 3,600 people but
the researchers were able to contact only 2,011 for the follow-up survey in 2013. In
addition to bracketing the conflict period, the survey was also able to stratify the sample
into conflict-affected (C) and non-conflict affected (NC) groups. Three definitions of
“conflict” were used: (i) any type of disorder in the respondent’s neighborhood
(“Disorder”), which included 95% of the sample in the C group; (ii) someone killed in the
neighborhood (“Killed”), which covered 45% of the group; and, (iii) the respondent or
household members were victims of economic damage (“Economic”), which covered
27% of the sample.
78.     There were clear differences in sexual behavior, both over time and between the
conflict and non-conflict groups. Figure 3 shows that sexual activity increased and
average of 9.6% between 2010 and 2013, while condom use declined almost 18%. This
suggests a general rise in risky behavior between the two surveys, as well as differences
between the conflict affected group and those not affected by conflict, and variations for
different types of exposure to conflict.

79.     The 2013 survey had more details on risky behaviors, so the differences between
the conflict and non-conflict groups can be examined in more detail. Figure 4 shows a
higher proportion of those exposed to conflict had extramarital affairs, with the largest
differences between those who knew of someone being killed (18%), compared to around
10% for the other 2 conflict definitions.
                   Figure 4 – Sexual Behavior – Conflict vs. Non-conflict

80.     Figure 5 shows both the average number of extramarital partners for different
groups and the average number of partners who the respondent had paid for sex. Again,
there are differences between the conflict and non-conflict groups, and between different
definitions of conflict. Those who were in a neighborhood where someone was killed
had higher numbers of partners and number paid for sex (36% and 22% difference
respectively). It should be remembered that 45% of the respondents to the survey were
included in this definition of “conflict”. There were fewer differences in these indicators
between conflict and non-conflict groups when other definitions of conflict were used.
While these differences do not show causal links, they do show that the social situation
was in significant flux over the period of the two surveys, and between the conflict and
non-conflict groups.

81.    The further analysis of PDO achievement needs to be considered against this
backdrop of a very volatile social situation. Further national-level analysis is also
provided below.
82.     PDO 1: Under component 1 and sub-component 2.2 social mobilization and
HIV/AIDS prevention, care and support activities were implemented in four project
supported regions by national and international NGO’s, private sector groups and the
defense Ministry. The NGOs helped to carry out implementation of sensitization and
counseling (both pre- and post-testing), condom distribution, outreach to MSM and CSW,
support to Orphans and Vulnerable Children and palliative care for people living with
HIV/AIDS. The networks provided service both to the general population and CSW,
including carrying out mass sensitization campaigns, condom distribution, and
counseling and testing, including PMTCT testing. Details of implemented activities and
their respective outputs are presented in annex 2, below are summaries of those
achievements.
             a. Mass communication campaigns on HIV/AIDS prevention, through 42
                community radios with the technical support of the national radio and
                television network (RTI)
             b. 68 NGO’s have executed 81 subprojects focusing among other activities
                on social mobilization, condom promotion and distribution, behavioral
                changes activities, promotion of VCT, etc.;




                                                             20

84.       The  achievement  of  the  first  PDO  (improved  access  to  and  utilization  of  HIV/AIDS 
prevention  services)  would  have  contributed  to  the  improved  HIV/AIDS  knowledge  and  to 
behavioral  change.  Two  PDO  indicators  and  four  intermediate  results  indicators  were  identified 
in  the  PAD  to  monitor  progress  toward  this  development  objective.    The achievement of this
PDO is rated substantial: Out of the two PDO indicators, the target was 97% achieved
for the first (Percentage of female sex workers reporting the use of a condom with their
most recent client) despite a difficult social situation and limited condom availability
(although there are some issues with data sources) and Indicator 2 (Percentage of women
and men from 15-49 years of age having had more than one sexual partner in the
preceding 12 months reporting condom use during their last sexual intercourse) showed
substantial improvements in condom use for women and condom use very close to the
target for men (See table 3).

                 and 99% of the target for males. Further, the detailed analysis by region
                 (see paragraph 85 below), shows condom use in the project regions
                 higher than for the non-project regions (37.8 versus 32.2 percent).


85.     The detailed 2012 DHS tables contain data at the regional level, which can help
shed some additional light on the end-line values of PDO Indicator 2. The regions of
North, West, South and Abidjan roughly cover the focus regions of the project, although
they do not exactly match. If these four regions are aggregated for males (there was not a
large enough sample at the regional level to do this calculation for females) the DHS
shows a total for the project regions of 37.8% compared to 32.2% for the non-project
regions and 35.7% overall. The published data for the 2005 AIS does not contain the
detail for this indicator at the regional level.

86.     Out of the four intermediate results indicators (table 4), the target was achieved
for two indicators: Percentage and number of high risk groups (FSW) who received an
HIV test in the last 12 months and who came back for their test results; and, Number
(Percentage) of women and men aged 15-49 who received an HIV test in the last 12
months and who came back for their test results. The target was not achieved for one
indicator: Number of condoms- male & female distributed among the CSW in the 4
target Project regions. This is likely due to the disruption of the supply chain during the
crisis, which affected both the import of commodities into the country and the
distribution to target groups.

87.     Based on the data included in the latest ISR, it is not possible to make a judgment
on progress on indicator 3 (Percentage of people from at risk-groups who both correctly
identify ways of preventing sexual transmission of HIV and who reject major
misconceptions about HIV transmission) because of data non-comparability. The end line
data was collected by a survey in the four project regions while the baseline data were
extracted from the nationwide survey. However, data presented below (Tables 7 and 8)
from the AIS and DHS suggest a significant improvement for the general population, so
it would be relatively safe to assume similar improvements for the target populations.

   88.      The 2005 AIS and 2012 DHS allow us to shed some more light on these issues.
   In the area of testing, Table 5 and 6 show comparable data for the 4 project regions and
   the rest of the country, and also breaks out the two regions which were formerly under
   full or partial rebel control (North and West) from the other 2 project regions. These data
   show significant increases in testing in both the project and other regions, with roughly a
   tripling of annual testing in Cote d’Ivoire as a whole. While still large, the increase in the
   project regions is less than that of the rest of the country.

   89.     However, the improvements in the North and West regions are particularly stark,
   with an eight-fold increase in annual testing for males, and a sixteen-fold increase for
   females. In the South and Abidjan, the increases are more modest, since the base was
   that much higher. The overall level of testing in the North and West are now about two-
   thirds of that of the rest of the country, a significant increase over 2005.

   90.     While not specifically related to at-risk groups, the AIS and DHS data also shed
   some light on the overall level of knowledge in the project regions compared to others.
   First Table 7 shows the level of recognition of HIV/AIDS, with the regional break-out of
   project regions below. Here the project regions show a higher level of improvement for



                                                    25
females and marginally less for males. This is consistent with the focus of the project
activities on females.

91.     Of particular interest is the increase in knowledge in the North and West regions,
which have gone from 74% for females and 81% for males to 87% and 96% respectively.
Given the level of IEC activities carried out in the project (almost 2 million people
reached with IEC, behavioral change or condom promotion activities, with over half of
this directed to the general population), this increase in recognition is a positive
indication of the possible impact of these activities.

92.     A second set of tables, shown in Tables 8 and 9, show the level of knowledge of
those 15-49 regarding 3 preventions methods: (i) use of a condom (Condom); (ii)
limiting sex to a single uninfected partner (Single); and (iii) using a condom and limiting
sex to a single uninfected partner (C+S). For both males and females, the recognition of
condom use as a prevention measure is now greater in the project regions, compared to
the non-project ones, and the level of increase in knowledge is significantly higher, given
overall decreases in knowledge country-wide, and in particular in the non-project regions.
Knowledge of other prevention measures has also grown but to as great an extent as with
condom use. Again, referring to Table 2, the level of condom promotion may well have
contributed to this result.

93.    Table 9 shows the same data for the project regions, broken down between the
former rebel-controlled regions and those controlled by the government. Again, this table
shows the differential improvement in the North and West regions, with female and male
knowledge improvement with respect to condom use of 54% and 31% respectively, and
smaller but still significant knowledge improvements in other areas. By contrast,
knowledge in the South and Abidjan regions has stagnated or even declined marginally.
The higher population in the south affects the overall averages.

94.     A final area to look at is HIV/AIDS prevalence, shown in Table 10. While the
link between prevalence and the project interventions is much more tenuous, it is
interesting to note that prevalence among females – one of the primary target groups of
the project – has fallen much more quickly in the project regions, compared to the rest of
the country. In contrast, the prevalence rate for males has fallen more quickly in the
non-project regions and actually increased marginally in the project regions. A break-out
comparison of the project regions is not shown due to the relatively low prevalence and
smaller sample size of the North and West regions.

95.     PDO 2: In order to achieve the second development objective, the project
supported the implementation of the subcomponent 2.1 (health sector). The health
subcomponent was implemented through a network of 59 health facilities (among which
36 are new) which integrated into their service package, HIV/AIDS service such as VCT,
PMTCT, STI, and ART. The late start-up of the health component as well as frequent
shortages of medicine and reagent has considerably affected the effective implementation
of these activities.

96.     A total of 51 000 pregnant women were tested and among those who were tested
positive for the HIV (2,018 or 3.9 percent), 893 women (44.25 percent) received a full
course of antiretroviral treatment to reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission.

97.    Another 12,341 persons affected by the HIV received appropriate medical
treatment, care and support and 2,710 of those with advanced form of the disease
received antiretroviral therapy.

98.    Table 11 shows that one out of two targets was achieved for the second PDO.

99.      Table 12 shows that of the 6 intermediate outcome indicators, one became
redundant and the other 5 were either fully or substantially (over 80 percent) achieved.
The indicator that became redundant was due to an institutional change in HIV/AIDS
governance in the new government following the 2011 crisis, where the Ministry of
HIV/AIDS was merged with the Ministry of Health. Therefore, 68% of the 13 CTAIL
were established and made operational 54% through project implementation, indicating
that this indicator was clearly on target prior to the institutional change, and suggesting
that all IO indicators would have been met if the change had not been made.

100. In summary out of the four PDO indicators, the target was achieved for two
indicators; and substantially achieved for one other. For some of the indicators, there
were data comparability problems that make comparisons to the baseline (on which the
targets are based) difficult, for some indicators. Given the data comparability issues
which were driven by the lack of appropriate geographically disaggregated data at the
time of appraisal, the ICR team utilized other sources of data to assess PDO progress: the
AIS national survey of 2005 and the DHS national survey of 2011/12. This comparison
shows significant improvements in a number of areas in the project regions, especially
when compared to the non-project areas. In many cases, the areas of improvement can be
linked to the focus of project interventions. Of particular interest (see Table 10), is the
fact that prevalence among females – one of the primary target groups of the project – has
fallen much more quickly in the project regions, compared to the rest of the country.

101. In addition to the PDO-level analysis, the review of Intermediate Outcome
indicators shows that five out of the 10 indicators were fully achieved, two were
substantially achieved (84 and 88%), comparable data could not be obtained for one, and
one indicator has become irrelevant due to institutional changes in HIV/AIDS
governance but likely would have been achieved if the change had not been made. In
light of the difficulties with the comparability of the “official” PDO indicators, the
generally positive results shown from the AIS/DHS comparison, and the positive results
from the IO indicators, the efficacy of the project is rated as Significant.

3.3 Efficiency

102. The PAD provided an economic justification for a coordinated and
comprehensive response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Cote d’Ivoire. Cote d’Ivoire was
the most HIV/AIDS affected country in West Africa (HIV prevalence of 4.7 percent)
with generalized HIV epidemic marked by gender and geographic differences. Protracted
politico-military crisis that affect the country since 1999 has led to significant population
displacement, increased poverty, insecurity and sexual violence.

103. The economic and social impact of the epidemic was obvious; in 1998, a survey
conducted to assess the impact of HIV/AIDS in education sector pointed out that 64
percent of primary teachers’ deaths were found to be due to AIDS. In the health sector,
AIDS patients greatly increased the occupancy of hospital beds. The economic cost of the
HIV epidemic of Cote d’Ivoire is substantial, with a model simulating the impact of the
epidemic through its effect on human capital and savings suggesting that by 2010 GDP
would be about 13 percent lower than what GDP would have been in the absence of the
epidemic. The same model also indicated that the loss in GDP could be reduced by
providing access to antiretroviral treatment. Treatment prevents the loss of adults in their
prime productive years, thereby increasing the ratio of the active population to the total
population; and also increases the productivity of the labor force by reducing losses in
human capital. The net effect of antiretroviral treatment is estimated to offset about 32
percent of the potential loss of GDP in the case of the Cote d’Ivoire.




                                             31
104. The level of HIV/AIDS epidemic and its socio-economic impact have pushed the
government to prioritize financing the cost of the AIDS response. The government
prepared 5 year strategic plans (NSP) to respond adequately to HIV/AIDS epidemic and
submitted this plan to development partners for resource mobilization. The total
estimated budget of the latest NSP was US$594 million of which 56% was dedicated to
care and support and less than quarter to the prevention activities. About 96% of the total
budget was provided by external financing, including the US Government through the
PEPFAR as a major contributor.

105. The purpose of the current project was to complement national effort to tackle the
increasing demand for the HIV/AIDS response and to focus on the most vulnerable and
high risk groups. It supported highly cost-effective interventions such as voluntary
testing and counseling, promotion and distribution of condoms, peer-based programs to
educate higher-risk groups, including sex workers and youth, etc. which are known as
cost-effective at US$100 or less per HIV infection averted (a commonly-used threshold
for cost-effectiveness).

106. During the implementation, the project has introduced two innovative approaches
which led to reductions in unit cost:

   a. Introduction of the use of finger pricks (a simple method similar to diabetes blood
      testing) which does not require laboratories has reduced the cost of mass testing.
      The finger prick test costs patients $4.17 per test, whereas a person tested through
      traditional testing is three times more ($17.73). Apart from the affordability, the
      use of “finger pricks” has also contributed to improved access to HIV testing;
   b. The massive involvement of local NGOs and faith-based organizations through
      direct contracting by the project compared to the prior practice whereby
      International NGOs recruited local NGO to implement services have led to
      significant reduction in the overhead and operating costs.

107. An economic analysis (Annex 3) showed that the project has a benefit/cost ratio
of 1.85:1, based on DALYs averted through reaching out to most at risk groups.

108. Between the inherent economic justification of a comprehensive response to the
HIV/AIDS epidemic in the country, the choice of highly cost-effective interventions, the
innovative cost effective approach such as use of finger pricks, the relatively acceptable
achievement of the project objectives, and the benefit/cost ratio noted above, project
efficiency is rated as Substantial.


3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

109. Rating: Based on the above presented data and analysis on the relevance of the
project’s objectives, design, and implementation (Substantial), achievement of PDOs
(Substantial) and efficiency (Substantial), the overall outcome rating of the project is
Moderately Satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

110. Gender Aspects: The epidemiological data has highlighted a feminization of
HIV/AIDS epidemic in Cote d’Ivoire where in all age groups females were by far more
likely to have HIV than males. Therefore, the project identified commercial sex workers
and women living in low-income neighborhoods of urban center as key target groups.
Women in those areas face dual challenges due to limited access to services and poor
protection given by the strong social control and more conservative behaviors generally
found in the countryside. In addition, women are often victims of gender based sexual
violence. Despite the fact that only marginal improvements were achieved in the project
outcomes related to this subgroup, they have received strong support from the project.
However, there is a need for further strengthening such targeted efforts at national level
so as to ensure that the women receive the deserved attention which is required to reverse
the current epidemiological trend.

111. Social Development aspects: The project contributed to strengthening the
capacities of civil society for a better involvement in the fight against HIV/AIDS. The
social mobilization component of the project supported 68 NGO’s to implement 81
subprojects focusing among other activities on social mobilization, condom promotion
and distribution, behavioral changes activities, promotion of VCT, and so on, while 5
HIV/AIDS prevention networks (COSI, RIP+ARSIP, REPAMASCI, RIJES) received
financial and technical support from the project.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

112. The project supported the strengthening of institutional capacities to coordinate
the decentralized national HIV/AIDS response. A continuous support was given to
National Council for HIV/AIDS (CNLS), regional HIV/AIDS committees, line ministry
committees (CMLS). The project supported the development and dissemination of
essential documentation such as technical guidelines.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)


3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

113.   A beneficiary survey was not conducted

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

114.   Rating: Moderate

115. The HIV/AIDS continues to be a public concern and the government response is
proportional to this concern. Government ownership of the national response to
HIV/AIDS epidemic has been demonstrated through high political commitment and
involvement including financial support expressed at the early stage of the HIV/AIDS
epidemic, development of subsequent HIV/AIDS National Strategic Plans, development
and strengthening of appropriate intuitional capacities to coordinate and manage the
national response. In order to ensure the continuity of services supported by the current
project, the government has mobilized adequate financial resources. For the transition
period, the Government advanced 740 million CFA (USD 1.5 equivalent) to continue to
finance these activities. In addition, the government has put in place a National Fund for
HIV/AIDS through taxes imposed on alcohol and tobacco purchases with the objective to
finance care and treatment of HIV/AIDS. The support of the Global Fund and other
development partners will continue to support prevention and care activities. There have
also been recent discussions between the Bank and PEPFAR regarding enhancing their
collaboration in the country. Based on these various factors, especially the commitment
by the Government for securing funding for its national HIV/AIDS strategic plan, the
risks to development outcomes are considered Moderate.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately satisfactory.

116. The project identification and design were based on the National HIV/AIDS
Strategic Plan (2006-2011), development of which was designed based on comprehensive
situation analysis of HIV/AIDS epidemic and the national response.

117. The Plan has clearly defined the priority targets groups as well the appropriate
actions to reduce the burden of HIV epidemic. In addition, the plan provides detailed
budget breakdown as well the existing financial gap. Therefore, the project was designed
to complement the efforts of the government of Cote d’Ivoire together with its
development partners in combatting the epidemic. The support from the project was
entirely needs based focusing mainly on filling gaps. The project design has also
benefited from the existing knowledge and experiences and lessons from the previous
MAP project elsewhere. The project preparation also benefitted from a large ($1 million)
project preparation grant, which was about three-quarters used and contributed both to
informing the project design and ensuring project readiness.




                                           34
118. Despite this, there were two areas where quality at entry could have been
improved. First, a QER was not conducted for this project, which would have been a
good idea given the security and economic uncertainties in the country. Second, the
selection of indicators and baseline values should have been adjusted once the decision
was made to scale back from a national program to one covering just 4 regions, and plans
for regional level baseline production should have been incorporated into the overall
project M&E plan. These factors contributed to the quality at entry rating.

119. Nevertheless, once the ISN was in place, the Bank moved quickly to modify
preparation and push ahead with this important operation, using available data and
ensuring the design was as customized as possible to the specific drivers of the HIV
epidemic in Cote d’Ivoire and National Strategic Plan.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

120. The presence of the World Bank team and the TTL on the ground was crucial for
the timely completion of the project. Of particular note is that the project was
implemented under very difficult circumstances related to the conflict and consequent
disruptions and deteriorations in poverty and services in the country. Despite these issues
the World Bank team was able to conduct regular supportive supervision and keep the
client as well as the World Bank management informed of the situation.

121. Despite the regular proactive supportive supervisions, the task team could not
conduct the midterm review as planned. The political situation which prevails in the
country may be the main reason. However, as an alternative to the Mid Term review, the
project team with the support of the World Bank team undertook a review of with the
objectives to assess the project achievement and constraints and the outcomes of this
review were presented in February 2012, seven months before the closure of the project.

122. Again, one implementation issue on the M&E front was the failure to ensure
comparable data and/or suitable base-line data for several key indicators, or to change the
indicators once it became clear that comparable data would not be available. Also,
following Bank re-engagement after the crisis, performance targets should have been
reviewed and revised to reflect what was possible in the remaining time frame. In sum,
quality of Bank supervision is rated Moderately Satisfactory..

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

123. Rating: Based on the Moderately Satisfactory rating for quality at entry and
Moderately Satisfactory rating for quality of supervision, overall Bank Performance is
rated as Moderately Satisfactory.




                                            35
5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

124. The commitment that the government of Cote d’Ivoire has demonstrated to fight
against HIV/AID, since 1986 when the first comprehensive national plan was developed
is commendable. The establishment in 2001) of a Ministry exclusively dedicated to fight
against HIV/AID (Ministère de la lutte contre le SIDA) despite the difficult political and
economic situation is an additional evidence of higher political commitment.

125. In order to ensure effective and successful implementation of subsequent national
HIV/AIDS plans, the government of Cote d’Ivoire has mobilized not only external
financial support but also committed domestic resources.

126. The HIV/AIDS National Strategic Plan (2006-2010) which has served as a basis
for the design of the current project was developed through active participation of
relevant key stakeholders including development partners.

127. In order to ensure the sustainability of the project, the government has developed
an exit strategy for the current project and has mobilized substantial financial resources to
sustain the results of the project. In addition, the government has established a National
Fund for HIV/AIDS through taxes imposed on alcohol and tobacco purchases with the
objective to finance care and treatment of HIV/AIDS.

128. Institutional reforms in 2011 resulted in merging two Ministries: the Ministry of
Health and the Ministry of the fight against AIDS. This created some concerns among the
stakeholders. The major concern was the preservation of the CNLS and regional
coordination units. However, the new Ministry reassured partners of the government’s
continued commitment to fight against HIV/AIDS.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

129. The project was executed under the supervision of national HIV/AIDS council
(CNLS) which is chaired by the head of state and regroups representatives of all socio-
professionals groups including networks of Peoples leaving with HIV/AIDS. The CNLS
was responsible for the monitoring of overall national response and inform stakeholders
on progress as well constraints. Although, annual progress reports were issued regularly,
the CNLS was not able to hold the annual review meeting as planned (only one meeting
took place from 2008 to 2010). The institutional uncertainty which preceded the inclusion
of Ministry in charge of HIV/AIDS as well the political instability which prevailed in the
country may have prevent CNLS (which is chaired by the head of state) to hold regular
meetings.




                                             36
130. A Project Implementation Unit was establish under the responsibility of the
Ministry in charge of HIV/AIDS to ensure the coordination, financial management and
monitoring of the project. The recruitment of the PIU was a major condition of project
effectiveness and was completed within more than 90 days after grant signature. The
project team was in place during the whole project implementation period and has
performed relatively well despite the volatile political environment. The team conducted
an alternative process to the mid-term review, since a normal review was not possible.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

131. Rating: Based on a Moderately Satisfactory rating for the Government’s
performance and a Moderately Satisfactory rating for the implementing agencies, the
Borrower’s performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.



6. Lessons Learned

132. Sustained political commitment at higher levels, together with the allocation of
domestic resources, is essential to mobilize and effectively engage development partners
in conflict prone settings like Cote d’Ivoire. The high level commitment and ownership
demonstrated by the government facilitated securing of more than 96% of the budget
required to implement the HIV/AIDS National Strategic Plan 2006-2011.

133. Rapid project implementation was assisted by taking advantage of the project
preparation period to identify key implementation requirements and initiate required
activities such as recruitment of implementing agencies, procurement of goods (drugs,
reagents, medical equipment, etc.).

134. Close monitoring of the project toward the achievement of project development
objectives using a simplified and well-designed M&E system is essential. This would
help for regular monitoring of progress and analysis of implementation challenges for
timely implementation of corrective measures. Where projects are sub-national in nature,
M&E systems need to recognize this and not rely on national level data. This is
especially important with respect to developing appropriate baseline data, since this
cannot be developed after the fact.
135. Following events such as the 2010-2011 political crisis and subsequent re-
engagement, project parameters, indicators and targets should be carefully assessed, and
restructuring should be initiated where it appears that some project objectives are no
longer attainable.

136. The use of local NGO’S to deliver HIV/AIDS prevention services was
commendable. This service delivery modality could be applied to the provision of other
services, especially for client groups where the use of public service providers is
problematic. In the context of weak public health services, the involvement of non-public
service providers such as NGO’s, faith-based association is a viable alternative.


                                           37
137. In the context of post conflict and fragile situation where large parts of the
population are prone to displacement and economic precariousness, the usual landscape
of commercial sex work changes. This makes it difficult to find such groups in the usual
public places such as bars, etc., and alternative strategies need to be developed.
Moreover, due to the poverty, more young women are involved in transactional sex
during such periods of uncertainty. Therefore, it is important to adjust the communication
means/strategy to reach these groups.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1: Social mobilization and HIV/AIDS Prevention Services for vulnerable
and high risk groups.

138. The component supported the implementation of social mobilization and
HIV/AIDS prevention, care and support activities in four project supported regions by
national and international NGO’s. The identified activities were HIV/AIDS Information,
Education and communication activities as well behavioral change communication
activities with a focus on safer sexual-behavioral, delayed first sexual intercourse;
reduction in early marriage; promotion and use of voluntary counseling and testing
services, care and treatment of PLWHA including OVC). These activities were targeting
the following high risk groups: commercial Sex workers, orphan and vulnerable children
people living with HIV/AIDS, and particularly vulnerable youth and women which
include women living in low-income neighborhoods of the urban centers.

139. The component had also financed a few country wide interventions such as
intensive IEC campaigns targeting commercial sex workers and vulnerable youth, mass
campaign for the general public to improve common knowledge about HIV/AIDS and
reduce the stigmatization of PLWHA and other high-risk groups.

140. In addition, the project contributed to the improvement of mass communication
campaigns on HIV/AIDS prevention through the agreement signed with the national
radio and television network (RTI) to support 42 community radios for the transmission
of communication materials for behavior change.

141. The project has supported 68 NGOs to implement 81 sub-projects targeting the
high risk groups and focusing among other activities on social mobilization, condom
promotion and distribution, behavioral changes activities, promotion of VCT. The
networks of HIV/AIDS civil society groups (COSI, RIP+ARSIP, REPAMASCI, RIJES)
received a financial and technical support from the project to strengthen their capacities
and provide services to their members and their affiliates.

142. The subcomponent supported to Men who have Sex with other Men (MSM) by an
experienced international NGO (Heartland);
143. Establishment and continuous support to four regional centers to serve as a
platform for NOG’s supporting orphans and Vulnerable children

144. The project has supported the private sector through its national network (private
enterprises working against HIV/AIDS in Cote d’Ivoire). Forty eight small and medium
enterprises have conducted HIV/AIDS prevention activities in the work place.

145. The table below summarizes the implemented HIV/AIDS prevention activities by
the categories and the number of beneficiaries.

Component 2: Public Sector Interventions: Prevention and Care

146. This component has supported Ministry of Health and three other key Ministries
to deliver essential HIV/AIDS prevention, care and treatment services

Sub-component 2.1: Health Sector

147. The Ministry of Health was support to deliver health related essential HIV/AIDS
prevention, care and treatment services in the four projects focus regions.

       a.     59 health institutions of new health facilities were equipped to integrated
              the delivery of health related essential HIV/AIDS prevention, care and
              treatment services into the their basic package of services;
       b.     The laboratory capacities were strengthened in the four region by
              establishment of 7 regional laboratories and reinforcing the capacities of
              36 health facilities;
       c.     Support to the prevention of blood transmission;
       d.     Support the implementation of Medical waste management plan through
              procurement and installation of 4 incinerators in regional hospitals;
       e.     Procurement and distribution of medical commodities, reagents, medicines
              including ART drugs;
       f.     Training of 1145 health workers

Sub-component 2.2: Support to the action plans of key Ministries

148. This subcomponent supported the three key Ministries (Defense, Interior and
Education) with the mandate to cover the target groups that cannot be easily reached by
NGOs, such as youth who are in school, the armed forces and the police.

149. The Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Interior implemented their respective
action plans on national scale and were aiming to improve the knowledge, the attitudes
toward HIV infected people and promotion of safer sexual behavior. The subcomponent
supported the delivery of health related HIV/AIDS prevention, care and treatment
services by the army and police health services in the four regions. The project has also
supported to set up military personnel network for West Africa and a center for
HIV/AIDS prevention (REMAFOC/AIDS) and over 7993 military personnel and their
families have benefited. Over 5358 people have been tested (53% of those current
military personnel).

150. The support to the Ministry of Education was limited to the project supported four
regions and was aiming to complement the ongoing effort from other partners such as
UNFPA, PSI and FHI. The project supported the introduction of HIV/AIDS modules for
pre-teenagers, development and dissemination of curriculum for both students and
teachers, and the activities of teachers associations of PLWHA. The project supported the
establishment of 86 anti AIDS clubs in project supported four regions which contribute to
target 33, 101 school children.

Component 3. Capacity Building Component

151. This component has supported the strengthening at all level (managerial and
implementation level) the capacities necessaries for the successful implementation of the
project. The special attention was given to the public sector which was in a bad shape
compare to the NGO’s. The project has contributed to the set-up of an information center
on HIV/AIDS and to the development of norms and national guidelines on the different
themes which were supported such as support to commercial sex workers, ARV
treatment, gender based violence, nutrition, etc.

152. The project has also contributed to the training of over 2700 people in the various
sectors of interventions for HIV/AIDS prevention. It has also contributed to the
development of training modules for implementation entities and five implementation
manuals. It has also contributed to the overall implementation manual, to the manual for
planning, monitoring and evaluation, as well as to those of the civil society and the
private sector.

153. The component also the project coordination units in the four regions in order to
endure competent project implementation.

Component: Coordination, Management, Monitoring and Evaluation

154. The project contributed to strengthen the coordination and supervision capacities
of institutions involve in the management of national HIV/AIDS response. Although the
project support covered the overall organization of the coordination, management,
particular attention was given to the decentralized level of coordination, line ministries
and implementing agencies. Funding was provided to help set up and operationalized the
CRLS in the 19 regions of the country, as well as establish the accompanying Technical
Units to Support Local Initiatives (CTAIL).

155. The project has also supported to establishment of the monitoring and evaluation
(M&E) system to track the achievements of all project components but also provided
required support to the national M&E framework.

           a. Periodic supervision missions were conducted           to ensure timely
              implementation of work program and to undertake the quality audit of
              reported data by implementing agencies;
           b. Conduct of Regional and Sectorial mid-term review of work program;
           c. Support to the DHS survey;
           d. Support was provided to the HIV/AIDS vulnerability and response among
              the youth managed by UNICEF;
           e. 346 persons were trained on M&E of HIV/AIDS;
           f. Quarterly project progress with all routine data were prepared and widely
              distributed;
           g. KAP study in the project supported four regions;
           h. DHS 2012 survey.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

156. The section provides the economic and financial analysis of the project. It first
summarizes the economic context within which the project operated, and then analyzes
the cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analysis of the emergency HIV/AIDS Multi-
Sectoral Project.

Economic Context

157. For two decades following its independence in 1960, Côte d’Ivoire stood as an
island of prosperity, peace and stability on a continent beset by conflicts and poverty. A
fairly rich natural resources endowment, political stability, a bold open door policy to
attract a productive labor force and favorable terms of trade for its main agricultural
exports helped the country achieve a strong economic performance which, by the end of
the 1970s made Côte d’Ivoire the major player of the West African Monetary and
Economic Union. Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita grew steadily during
that period at average 6% per year.

158. A sharp reversal began in 1980 as terms of trade deteriorated precipitously and
the CFAF became increasingly overvalued. From 1981 to 1992, annual GDP growth
averaged -0.2% and Côte d’Ivoire slipped from the rank of middle income countries into
the low income group. The devaluation of the CFAF in 1994 triggered an economic
rebound, but this was soon undermined by the political crisis which began in 1999.

159. A period of political instability began with the coup d’état of December 1998. A
second, failed, coup d’état on September 19, 2002 evolved into a long-standing rebellion
which split the country along a north-south divide until mid-2011. The conflict brought
economic activity to a standstill, severely affected basic social service delivery and
further damaged the country’s social fabric. The conflict aggravated an already high
unemployment rate, especially of the youth, and unemployed younger persons have been
easily recruited for political gain. Poverty surveys have indicated that the number of
people living below the poverty line more than quintupled between 1985 and 2008, from
10% to 50%. Poverty in rural areas increased from 49% in 2002 to 63% in 2006.
Malnutrition rates are high, with 39% of children under five suffering from stunting, and
almost 30% are underweight. Central, Northern and Western Côte d’Ivoire (known as
CNO zone, which is also the cotton and cashew producing areas) have been particularly
affected, underlining regional dimension of rural poverty. Côte d’Ivoire now ranks 166th
out of 171 countries on the UNDP Human Development Index, and will be far from
achieving the MDGs in 2015.

160. The political and military crisis largely ended in April 2011 and the new
Government has made rapid progress in restoring security, reinstating public and social
services and launching the rehabilitation of critical infrastructure. The Government is
strongly committed to tackling various reforms (coffee/cocoa sector, electricity sector,
the judicial system, business climate and public sector governance) that should offer
opportunities to strengthen the economy and its growth potential.


                                           44
161. Real GDP fell sharply (5.8%) in 2011, but the economy has rapidly recovered
since the reopening of banks and financial institutions at the end of April 2011 and the
lifting of the European Union (EU) embargo at the end of the post-election crisis.
Economic activity rebounded more strongly than projected in 2012 following a
contraction in 2011 induced by the crisis. GDP increased by 9.8 percent in 2012. Most
economic indicators have evolved favorably since May 2011 and the economic outlook
for 2013 and over the medium term is favorable. Real annual GDP growth of 8.5% is
forecast for 2013-15.

Economic Analysis

162. To get the benefits of the project and compare it with the costs, the “disability-
adjusted life years (DALYs) averted due to intervention were estimated. The DALY
extends the concept of potential years of life lost due to premature death (PYLL) to
include equivalent years of healthy life lost by virtue of being in states other than good
health. Following Murray and Lopez (1996) total DALYs for each case-age-sex group
are calculated as the sum of burden of premature mortality (YLL) and the non-fatal
burden (YLD). Thus,

DALY = YLL + YLD ……………………………………………… ………….......... (1)

163. Where, N is the number of deaths, C is the age-weighting correction constant, r is
the discount rate, B is the parameter from the age weighting function, a is the age of onset,
L is the duration of disability or time lost due to premature mortality, I is the number of
incident cases in the reference year, DW is the disability weight and K is the parameter
which specifies whether age-weighting is specified (K=1) or not specified (K=0).

164. To analyze the DALYs averted due to the use of HIV/AIDS preventive and
treatment methods, the following assumptions were used:

         1) The discount rate for DALYs equals to 0.03 based on the Global Burden of
            Disease (GBD) standard value, the age-weighting correction constant equals
            to 0.1658 based on GBD value, the parameter from the age weighting function
            equals 0.04 based on GBD value, and financial discount rate is 3.9 %.
         2) Use of condom by commercial sex workers will reduce the prevalence rate
            from 18.5 % (national average) to 2 %.
         3) Cost per DALYs averted for condom use ranges from 19 - 205 USD (in this
            case the average is taken)
         4) DALYs averted per 1000 condoms distributed/sold equals 5.19



                                                          45
       5) The following parameters are adopted from previous studies on the estimation
          of unit costs of HIV/AIDS treatment in Ivory Coast (Hatt et al., 20084) after
          proper adjustment for inflation (3.9 %) has been made. These are:
           - Unit cost of counseling and testing equals 8 USD
           - Unit cost of antiretroviral therapy per person per year equals 459 USD
           - Unit cost of prevention of mother-to-child transmission per pregnant
               women counseled and tested equals 7.8 USD
           - Laboratory test per HIV positive receiving monitoring and test 47 USD

       6) Life expectancy in Ivory Coast equals 55.4 years whereas; the per capita
          income is taken as 1570 USD.


165. The benefits of the project are analyzed based on the estimations of DALYs
averted and the equivalent amounts of investment needed to bring about the same amount
of benefits in terms of prevention and treatment done in similar projects. By adopting
assumptions 1 and 2; and equations (3) and (4) above, the DALYs averted by use of
condom by commercial sex workers equals to 253. Taking the per capita GDP of Ivory
Coast as 1570 USD, the monetary amount of 253 DALYs averted equals to 397210 USD
(253 *1570). Studies also indicate that cost per DALYs averted for condom use ranges
from 19 - 205 USD. We take the average of this value, which is 112 USD to calculate the
monetary value of the DALYs averted from use of condom reported in the project as
362208 USD (112 * 3234). Moreover, estimates made in Zambia indicate that per 1000
condoms sold/supplied, 5.19 DALYs are averted.

166. Based on this, we estimated the monetary value of condom supplied by the project
to be $25.2 million. The rest of the benefits are also calculated based on the equivalent
amounts of investment needed to do the same amount of intervention in a similar socio-
economic environment. For instance, the monetary value of service rendered by the
project through giving antiretroviral therapy to adults and children with advanced HIV
infection amounts to $1.56 million. The rest of the calculations follow the same
procedure based on the number of beneficiaries of the project and the assumptions made
to value the services rendered (with proper discounting and compounding wherever
necessary). Table 1 gives the details of the benefits of the interventions.

167. The present value of the benefit from the project which amounts to $30,2 million
(Table 1) is far greater than the present value of cost incurred which amounts to $16,3
million USD (Table2). Hence, as the benefits are greater than the costs, the investment is
reasonable. Moreover, benefit-cost ratio of the project is 1.85 which means that for every
dollar invested, there will be $1.85 in benefits.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

Summary of Borrower’s ICR:

168. Implemented for a period of four (4) years (October 2008 - September 2012), the
Emergency Multisectoral AIDS Project (EMAP), with the support of the World Bank,
aims to increase access and the use of prevention services for vulnerable groups and high-
risk groups, and to improve access to and use of treatment services and support for people
infected and affected by HIV.

169. These objectives are to strengthen prevention services for HIV / AIDS, increasing
access to care, treatment and support for those infected and affected, strengthen the
capacity of stakeholders to implement activities and enhance coordination, management,
and Monitoring and Evaluation (M & E) of the project. It is mostly implemented in four
(4) regions namely the former regions of the Lagoons, Mountains, Savannah and South
Comoé.

170. The project is divided into the four (4) components: (i) social mobilization and
prevention services against HIV / AIDS, (ii) public sector interventions, (iii) capacity
building and (iv) coordination, management, monitoring and evaluation.
 

171. After four (4) years of implementation and in accordance with the funding
agreement and the M&E plan, PUMLS decided to make the final assessment of the
project following accurate objectives.

172. The evaluation of PUMLS aims to establish the overall performance of the project
and measure its contribution to the improvement of action against AIDS in Côte d'Ivoire
from 2008 to 2012. This evaluation focused on the following issues: relevance,
effectiveness, impact interventions of PUMLS, the link between resources and
achievements of the project from 2008 to 2012, the sustainability of implemented
activities, value added provided by the PUMLS and performance of the Government and
the World Bank in the preparation, implementation and monitoring of the project.

173. The methodology combined literature reviews, interviews and field visits. The
final evaluation mission of PUMLS covered comprehensively the general objective and
specific objectives expected by the PUMLS and the World Bank, and it concerned the
period from 1 October 2008 to 30 June 2012 and all regions of project intervention and
targeted both the PCU, the RCU as well as the implementing agencies who have
contributed to the achievement of the project at national and regional levels.

174. Overall, the mission was conducted from July to September 2012 according to the
following main steps: Kick-off meeting of the evaluation mission, development and
validation of the detailed methodology and tools for data collection and preparation of the
interim report by the Consultant, validation of the interim report by the PCU, the Ministry




                                            52
of Health and the Fight against AIDS and the World Bank and the preparation and
transmission of the final report and evaluation tools.
 

175. The data analysis allowed for each PUMLS objective to identify strengths,
weaknesses and the level of performance of each item rated on a rating scale of five (5)
levels: Very satisfactory, satisfactory, acceptable, unsatisfactory, very unsatisfactory.

176. The general opinion of the people and organizations met, we can say that the
project PUMLS is well designed and implemented.

177. In terms of relevance, the evaluation noted that the project was in line with the
strategic directions of Government (NSP 2006 -2010) and the World Bank (strategic
framework for fight against AIDS 2007 - 2011). According to 99% of those interviewed,
it responded to national and regional needs and has especially helped to fill financing
gaps. The evaluation also showed a consistency of strategies with national strategies for
the make-do with 133 implementing agencies, the decentralized approach, capacity
building and support for coordination. Overall adequacy was very satisfactory.

178. The level of effectiveness of the project was satisfactory. With 85% of
implementation of the activities, 70% of achievement and 88% delivery (92% lessor
share) to June 30th, 2012, the performance of the project was satisfactory given the
context in which it was implemented. The main deficiency at this level is the low
performance of impact indicators, such as those related to PMTCT and the distribution
and use of condoms by Sex Workers.

179. The evaluation considers the benefits of interventions and impact satisfactory.
The main forces at this level are the project's contribution to capacity building of national
actors in the fight against HIV / AIDS, strengthening national coordination and
integration of community activities in the system of national M & E. Almost all of the
interviewees endorse these findings. Also there is a great contribution to the achievement
of project results at regional level (average 35 to 50% contribution of PUMLS to regional
results fight against AIDS for regions Mountains, Savannah and South Comoé in 2009
and 2010). Unfortunately, many gains observed at this level have not been documented.

180. At the adequacy of resources and achievements of the project, a cross analysis
between the disbursement rate (88%), the average rate of activities implementation
(85%), the achievement rate of the indicators (70%), and percentage of contract
completion (95%) indicates a relative adequacy in the use of resources. We also note that
51% of spending was allocated to activities towards beneficiaries and the cost analysis of
intervention shows a relative comparative advantage of PUMLS on community
awareness, screening and care of OVC. This aspect was considered satisfactory. It should
be noted delays in the planning of activities due to cash problems, although it has
improved since the end of 2010 by increasing the initial advance.

181. Regarding the sustainability of implemented activities, it should be noted that the
project itself in view of its urgent nature, had not planned activities for sustainability. The


                                              53
evaluation also found that most agencies (especially civil society and the private sector)
had stopped their operations since the funding of PUMLS stopped. However, in the
opinion of actors interviewed, strategies for implementation (capacity building of
implementing agencies and state structures) were likely to ensure sustainability. In
addition, the steps taken by the project toward the Government (MSLS, FNLS) and other
partners (Global Fund, PEPFAR partners) could ensure continuity of services.
Sustainability was therefore considered acceptable by the evaluation.

182. The evaluation considered the added value of the project satisfactory. Strategies
and procedures for implementation of the project have greatly contributed to the
intensification of the fight against HIV / AIDS in the areas of intervention. Interviewees
in this regard, often cited initial situational analysis which has involved them, the
transparent choice process of implementation partners, regular meetings of CRLS led by
the area prefects.

183. At Government - World Bank relations, several facts show excellent collaboration
between the two entities on aspects such as planning, resource mobilization, financial
management, monitoring and supervision. This is certainly a good practice that should be
copied. Performance of the Government and the World Bank in the preparation,
implementation and monitoring of the project was satisfactory. Areas for improvement
related to the formalization of the monitoring framework of the project at the Cabinet of
MSLS, strengthening the communication between the different entities of the projects
and the definition of a regulatory framework more suited to the terms of implementation
of projects financed donor.

184. Key Recommendations- The main recommendations selected for improving the
project in the perspective of a continuation.

Projects
   a. Identify the most appropriate strategies for high-impact activities (PMTCT,
       condoms) and give them more resources to better enhance the project's impact on
       people;
   b. Pay more attention to the documentation of good practices and lessons learned by
       PUMLS;
   c. Continue strengthening the capacity of the implementing agencies on the
       transmission of reports and satisfactory justification of funds.

The Government and the World Bank
   a. Put in place more fluids mechanisms to improve the availability of cash in a
      timely manner;
   b. Ensure the Government's involvement in the identification and implementation of
      mechanisms for sustainability in project design;
   c. Improving the formulation of project performance indicators and determination of
      objectives;
   d. Put in place a regulatory framework for the development of a law on the status
      and terms of implementation of projects financed by donors;



                                           54
   e. Strengthening the synergy between the PCU and the services of Financial Control
      and Accounting Agency.
   f. This project has been a so palpable success that all call its continuity.

Letter

Subject: Comments on the completion report – PUMLS

I acknowledge receipt of the completion report of the Emergency Multisectoral Project
against AIDS... Thank you.

Overall, this report does not call for any particular objections from me. However, some
issues have been raised and I would like them to be considered in the final report. These
points are elaborated in the annex to this letter.

Thanking you for the excellent collaboration between Côte d’Ivoire and the World Bank,
please accept the assurances of my highest consideration.

ANNEX

COMMENTS ON THE COMPLETION REPORT – PUMLS PROJECT

1.      The main observation concerns the achievement of the target of the PDO indicator
"percentage of women and men aged 15 to 49 who had more than one sexual partner
in the past 12 months and reporting of having used a condom during their last sexual
intercourse ".
Indeed, in paragraph 86 of the document of the World Bank, it is clearly indicated that
even if at the first analysis, you cannot appreciate the progress of the indicator because
the denominators are not the same (regional for 2012 and national for 2005), from a
secondary data analysis of regions, both in 2005 and 2012, shows that the target value of
the indicator has been reached. We cannot, therefore, leave behind the value of the work
done by retaining only the negative aspect while the analyses tend to show that the
indicator has been reached. From our point of view, based on the results of the
investigation and the analysis made by the Bank team, we consider this indicator reached.
Consequently, and in light of the above comments, paragraph 85 should be reworded
because on the two PDO indicators of this component, the assessment is as follows:
target not met for the first indicator and target achieved for the second, in other words, 1
indicator out of 2 is achieved. Therefore, to achieve this PDO, the rating should be
beyond "moderate".

2.      Based on the observations made above, two out of four PDO indicators have been
achieved and taking into account the appreciation of the effectiveness and efficiency of
the project on one hand, general comments made by the World Bank evaluation team on


                                            55
the project management on the other hand, the overall rating in our opinion should be
"satisfactory" instead of "moderately satisfactory."

3.      Section F / analysis of the results framework / b) intermediate indicators (page x).
The indicator "Number of Health Personnel receiving training" is not within the project
performance framework. Therefore, paragraph 100 should be wording as follows: Table
no. 12 shows that, out of the five intermediate indicators, one is superfluous and the
others four were either entirely or largely (over 80%) achieved.

4.     In summary, according to our analysis, 2 out of the 4 PDOs have been achieved,
and 2 have not been achieved. On the 9 intermediate indicators, 6 were achieved, 2 not
achieved and 1 superfluous.

Finally, in the current context of the fight against AIDS in Côte d’Ivoire, we believe and
recommend that efforts be pursued to meet the needs of people, especially the most
vulnerable (PLHIV, OVC, professional (the) sex).
In addition, thoughts and actions must be taken to ensure the continuation, expansion and
sustainability of the interventions of the Emergency Multisectoral Project against AIDS
in Côte d’Ivoire.
