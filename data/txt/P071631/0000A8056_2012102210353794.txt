                         9000 were pregnant women and 12 151 commercial sex workers. The NGOs have support over12341peoplelivingwithHIV/AIDSand 16 910 Orphans and Vulnerable Children. In the
                         health sector, the project supported capacitybuilding of five regional health districts and 14 non regional health districts by renewing equipment of 7 laboratories, expansionof care
                         and support activities for 59 health facilities, the establishment of information kits and data collection tools andmotorcycles.The project also supported the transfer of blood products
                         to the appropriate laboratories, financed supervisions, andthe set-up of incinerators for the management of bio medical waste. This support has yielded the following results:
                         anestimated90000peoplewere tested (of which 5100 were pregnant women), an estimated 800 pregnant women received ARV prophylaxisand2700peoplehave been put on ARV.
                         With regards to the education sector, 86 health clubs have been set up to conduct publicawareness campaigns for over33000 people.For the Ministry of Defense, the project
                         sensitized over 7993 military personnel and theirfamilies and tested over 5358 people(53% of those current military personnel). The project has reached two out
                         offourProjectDevelopmentObjective(PDO)indicators : (a) percentage of women and men aged 15-49 who have had more than one sexualpartner in the last 12months reporting the
                         use of a condom during their last sexual intercourse and percentage and number of adultsandchildrenwithadvancedHIVinfection receiving antiretroviral therapy. Those which have
                         not achieved their targets are: (i)thenumberofHIV/AIDSpositivewomen who have received a complete set of treatment to prevent transmission to their unborn child--the end-of-project
                         target for this indicator was 75% but it is estimated to be at 44% only; this is however above the national averagewhich is 40%;(ii) the percentage of commercial sex workers who
                         reported having used a condom with their last client.Thisindicator has regressed slightly compared to 2007 (96% in2007 to 93% in 2012). As for the intermediate outcomesindicators,
                         several(5) indicators have been achieved with the contribution of the project. One target has been achieved with thecontribution from other development partners to ensure
                         complementarity. One indicator became irrelevant to the change ininstitutional arrangements at the Ministry of Health which abolished regional HI/VAIDScoordination entities. Prior to
                         this changethe indicator had progressed but will not achieved its target.

                         All the grant funds have been utilized and will be fully disbursedby project closing.

                         An exit strategy has been developed and is currently being put in place. The national program for care andtreatment will support all the health activities initiated by the project through
                         Government budget and Global Fund resources.ForNGOs, activities will be financed By the National Fund against HIV, this Fund is financed by the Government through taxes
                         onalcohol and cigarettes.
