Environmental Management for the
Kyrgyzstan Urban Transport Project
1. Institutional Arrangements - the attached organization chart outlines the proposed
program for Environmental Monitoring and Supervision of the Kyrgyzstan Urban
Transport Project. The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) will have overall
responsibility for ensuring that the project is implemented in an environmentally
sound manner.
2. The PIU will be responsible for overall contract administration and supervision.
Work in each of the three cities will be carried out by a prime Contractor (the
Contractor) and its respective Sub-Contractors. Each Contractor will be responsible
for implementing the mitigation measures defined in the EMP. The PIU will be
responsible for advising the Contractors of its obligations in this respect, by way of
the Environmental Specifications and any Special Environmental Provisions
contained in the Tender Documents. These specifications and provisions will also
form part of the Works Contracts.
3. The PIU will be represented in the field in each of the three project cities (Bishkek,
Osh and Jalal-Abad) by the respective Roads Department. The PIU and City Roads
Department will coordinate project activities, including day-to-day project
supervision.
4. The primary responsibility for Environmental Quality Assurance (EQA) rests with the
PIU, which will be responsible for ensuring that the Contractors effectively fulfill
follow the Environmental Specifications and Special Environmental Provisions
contained in the contract. Depending on the capabilities of the PIU staff, the PIU
may wish to contract the EQA activities to a local Kyrgyzstan environmental firm.
5. The primary responsibility for Environmental Quality Control (EQC) rests with the
Kyrgyz Ministry of Environmental Protection (KEMP), and primarily, the Kyrgyz
Environmental Inspectorate (KEI), which is a department within the KEMP. The
activities of other monitoring agencies, such as the local city road police (GAI), Parks
Departments (Zilinstroy), etc., will be coordinated by the KEMP. The KEMP will
coordinate its activities with the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) which will
provide the KEMP with project schedules, the Environmental Management Plan
(EMP), design documents, and other relevant plans outlining how the project will be
implemented.
6. Reporting - the PIU will be responsible for preparing Quarterly Environmental
Reports, which will be provided to the World Bank resident mission at the end of
each fiscal quarter. The reports will include:
* Project activities (i.e., construction work undertaken) over the reporting period;
* Status of mitigation measures (i.e., progress in implementing the measures;
effectiveness; etc.);



*  Status of monitoring (i.e, type of monitoring [qualitative or quantitative]; dates
monitoring undertaken; monitoring authority; results of monitoring; budget
expended; etc.);
*  Problems encountered (i.e., non-conformances with environmental specifications
or special environmental provisions of the contract) ; and
*  Management actions taken to correct problems
7. The PIU will coordinate with the KEMP, KEI and others responsible for EQC to
obtain information that will be included in the Quarterly Environmental Reports.
8. Equipment - since most of the monitoring will involve qualitative evaluations of
contractor compliance with the environmental specifications and provisions contained
in the contracts, and with local environmental regulations, standards and norms, it is
not anticipated that any special monitoring equipment will be required for the project.
Should , however, the need for equipment arise during the course of the project, the
project includes $30,000 for equipment and training for environmental monitoring
and mitigation.
9.    Trainin - Environmental training would be provided to PIU Contract Managers,
City Roads Department Project Supervisors, and Road Contractor Supervisors, by
members of the KEI. Additionally, there will be Project Launch Workshop
presentations on World Bank and Republic of Kyrgyzstan environmental objectives
and requirements for the project. Presentations would be made by World Bank,
KEMP/KEI, and PIU specialists to Roads Department staff, local contractors, and
other World Bank and PIU staff.
