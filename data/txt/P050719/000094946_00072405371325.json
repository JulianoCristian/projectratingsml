Trees will\n            be replanted as needed; 4) water spraying will reduce dust\n            and air pollution, materials will be stored in sheltered\n            areas, and, debris will be dampened prior to disposal; and,\n            5) chemicals, and lubricants will be contained according to regulations."}, "docdt": "2000-05-25T00:00:00Z"}
