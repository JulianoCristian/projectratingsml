                          PROJECT

                             RESTRUCTURING PAPER



SUMMARY
1.     This memorandum requests the approval of the Country Director for (i) an
exceptional retroactive extension of the closing date for the Chad Critical Electricity and
Water Project (PRSEE) to allow the payment of outstanding bills under the project
(amounting to US$0.6 million); and (ii) a reallocation of Credit funds. A waiver for the
exceptional retroactive extension of the Credit closing date was approved by the
Managing Director on November 11, 2010.


PROJECT STATUS
2.       The PRSEE, an IDA credit of US$54.8 million, was approved on October 10,
2002 and became effective on March 20, 2003. It was extended for a two-year period in
March 2005. The Project sought to secure the delivery of basic electricity and water
supply services and reduce service delivery costs - through increased private sector
participation. It suffered from lack of progress in its implementation and towards
achievement of its objectives - due in large part to a lack of commitment and
implementation capacity, but also due to the 2006 suspension of disbursements of the
Bank's portfolio. Notwithstanding the Government's request to extend the Project's
closing date, and after intense internal debate, the Bank Regional Management chose to
let the Project close as scheduled on March 31, 2007.

3.     Approximately 43 percent (SDR 17.65 million, USD 27.88 million equivalent)
remain undisbursed under the PRSEE. The retroactive extension of the Credit's closing
date will (i) allow for the payment of SDR 0.38 million or USD 0.6 million of
outstanding expenditures under the Project; and (ii) enable recommitment of remaining
funds under the PRSEE as additional financing to the ongoing PADUR project
(P072030).


PROPOSED CHANGES
4.      Reallocation. The following reallocation is required in order to adjust the various
categories and to provide allocations for the payment of outstanding expenditures under
the Project.

7.     Closing date: The exceptional retroactive extension of the closing date from
March 31, 2007 to December 31, 2010 as approved by the Managing Director will allow
payment of US0.6 million of outstanding of expenditures under the project. The vendors
and consultants will be paid directly by the Bank's Disbursement Department after the
submission of the withdrawal requests.

8.      Next Steps The team is proposing that after the Closing Date of the Project
remaining undisbursed funds (approximately US$27.2 million) would be recommitted as
additional financing in the water component of the ongoing Chad Urban Development
Project (PADUR), as per the attached request from the Government dated September 27,
2010. This is consistent with, and is specifically referenced as part of the proposed new
