Mitigation\n            measures will primarily ensure the appropriate disposal of\n            solid wastes, while lubricants and chemicals will be\n            disposed of at selected sites, following special treatment\n            regulations. Equipment and machinery will undergo specific\n            maintenance to control air, and noise pollution, in\n            accordance with the country's legislation. Wastewaters\n            will be collected at a particular sewage site, to be treated\n            prior to discharge in natural habitats; conversely,\n            wastewaters potentially carrying hydrocarbons, will undergo\n            a specific separation treatment, but will not be discharged\n            into natural habitats, rather into a selected lagoon to\n            undergo a natural evaporation treatment. Industrial\n            wastewaters will be collected separately, treated in septic\n            type tanks, prior to disposal into natural habitats.\n            Transformers containing PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls)\n            will not be allowed, as neither will substances containing\n            asbestos, nor lead.
