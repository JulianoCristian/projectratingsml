services, to\n            prevent the collapse of the system, particularly in\n            N'Djamena, in addition to reducing service delivery\n            costs, through an increased private sector participation in\n            both sectors. The first component will provide resources to\n            maintain, and in some cases increase the delivery of\n            electricity services in N'Djamena and in six smaller\n            urban centers, through the rehabilitation, and expansion of\n            electricity production, transmission, and distribution\n            systems. Expansion, and rehabilitation of water supply\n            systems will be implemented under a second component,\n            likewise in the city of N'Djamena, and in eight smaller\n            urban centers. The third component will improve the\n            technical, commercial, and environmental performance of the\n            Societe Tchadienne d'Eau et d'Electricite (STEE),\n            including personnel safety standards as well. Preparatory\n            activities required to prepare the second phase of the\n            investment program will be implemented under the fourth\n            component, as will the preparatory activities required to\n            initiate the second phase of the investment program, and\n            project oversight."}, "docdt": "2002-08-23T00:00:00Z"}
