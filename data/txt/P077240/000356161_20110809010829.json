unsatisfactory; the risk to\n            development outcome was high; the Bank's performance\n            was unsatisfactory; and the Borrower's performance was\n            also unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included: scope of\n            Project Development Objectives (PDO) in fragile states. PDOs\n            should be simpler, less ambitious and more realistic for\n            countries with limited implementation capacity and a fragile\n            political environment. The time estimated for project\n            implementation should also be more realistic. Choice of\n            investment activities and assessment of project economic\n            benefits in fragile states. Willingness to enforce remedies\n            in the context of a tense dialogue between the bank and the\n            borrower. Compliance with safeguard obligations in fragile\n            states. Level of investments and implementation arrangements\n            for infrastructure investments in fragile states. Importance\n            of realistic risk assessment and appropriate mitigation measures."}, "docdt": "2011-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
