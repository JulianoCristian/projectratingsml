Second Economic\n            Rehabilitation and Recovery Credit for Sierra Leone were as\n            follows: the outcome was satisfactory, the sustainability\n            was likely, the institutional development impact was\n            substantial, and the Bank and borrower performance were both\n            satisfactory. The lessons learned indicate that the\n            catalytic role of the Credit enhanced the benefits of donor\n            coordination. In particular, the Government was able to make\n            good progress in economic and sectoral performance without\n            reducing the effectiveness of its efforts in demobilization,\n            resettlement and reintegration because of the well\n            coordinated and effective participation of the donor\n            community in post-conflict activities and in institutional\n            development. Task forces can be used effectively to develop\n            narrowly focused tasks such as, in the case of this Credit,\n            policy frameworks and implementation roadmaps. A\n            particularly good example was the task force set up to\n            develop a plan for micro-finance services, that included not\n            only an implementation roadmap but also provided for study\n            tours and formal training programs for local staff to run\n            the program once installed. Similarly, the creation of the\n            National Commission for Privatization appears to have been a\n            useful move. It should be recognized, however, that\n            privatization is often a complex and time-consuming process.\n            In this light, the implementation schedule could have\n            capitalized more on the phased nature of the reform program.\n            The Economic Rehabilitation and Recovery Credit (ERRC II)\n            might have focused more on ensuring adequate funding for the\n            National Commission for Privatization (NCP), more time to\n            build capacity within the new NCP, and more time to build\n            capacity within the sectoral ministries that would need to\n            establish new regulatory capacities. Process indicators and\n            performance or output indicators should be carefully and\n            realistically set, with sufficient specificity to measure\n            progress and assess achievement while allowing room for flexibility."}, "docdt": "2003-11-05T00:00:00Z"}
