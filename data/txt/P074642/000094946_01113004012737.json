strategy. It supports\n            a program that builds on the reforms initiated under the\n            first ERRC in the area of poverty monitoring, service\n            delivery, and accountability in the use of public resources.\n            ERRC II provides critical resources to finance part of the\n            foreign exchange and budgetary costs associated with\n            establishing peace and good governance, relaunching the\n            economy, and restoring basic public services. The proceeds\n            will allow the import of essential commodities, including\n            food products, petroleum products, and raw materials and\n            intermediate goods required for relaunching the economy.\n            they also enable the Government to provide basic services,\n            including the rehabilitation of necessary social and\n            economic infrastructure in those parts of the country that\n            have become accessible following the positive developments\n            on the peace and security fronts. it will complement similar\n            support provided by the Department for International\n            Development (United Kingdom), the African Development Bank,\n            the European Union, and the International Monetary Fund. The\n            Credit will be disbursed in two tranches over a period of 15 months."}, "docdt": "2001-11-20T00:00:00Z"}
