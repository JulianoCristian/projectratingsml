It will contribute to sustaining rapid growth by\n            a) creating fiscal discipline, and reducing public debt,\n            towards maintaining macroeconomic stability; b) improving\n            expenditure management; and c) reducing the business\n            environment costs. The PRSC will also support improvements\n            in governance through reforms in financial management,\n            procurement, and other anti-corruption and public\n            accountability institutions, in addition to the civil\n            service reform, particularly in devolution, i.e., through\n            the transfer of increased resources to lower levels of\n            government. The PRSC program will support accelerated\n            progress in human capital, by focusing on measures that are\n            the responsibility of the federal government, namely,\n            strengthening national sector policy in health and\n            education; improving the public expenditure framework for\n            health and education; and, promoting increased data\n            generation, monitoring of outcomes, and program evaluation.\n            The PRSC will further support improvements in\n            Pakistan's safety nets, so as to improve targeting, and\n            ensure that the poor and vulnerable are covered. While risks\n            exist, the project's sustained, and deepened policy\n            dialogue, and the support to capacity building of key\n            government institutions, will far outweigh those risks."}, "docdt": "2004-08-05T00:00:00Z"}
