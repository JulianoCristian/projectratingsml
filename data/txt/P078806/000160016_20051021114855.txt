                                                 I.BACKGROUND

 1.       The last five years have witnessed a resurgence of Pakistan's economy. After a decade of
 political instability, macroeconomic crisis, and limited economic and social progress, Pakistan has now
 emerged as one of the fastest-growing economies in Asia. To accelerate economic growth and poverty
 reduction, the government has launched an ambitious program o f economic reforms and institutional
 strengthening, articulated most recently in the 2003 Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) entitled
 "Accelerating Economic Growth and Reducing Poverty: The Road Ahead."                The government's efforts
 have been complemented by generous restructuring o f international debt and increased concessionary
 financing. This, along with tight fiscal policies, has reduced significantly the public debt burden. Private
 sector response to these developments has been impressive, and i s seen in the rapid take up of excess
 capacity in manufacturing, acceleration o f exports, and substantial investment in textiles, banking, and
 telecommunications. Broad development outcomes, including social indicators, are also improving.

 2.      Reforms since 2000 have been supported by the World Bank at the national level with Structural
 Adjustment Operations and a first Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC 1). At the provincial level,
 reforms have been supported with Structural Adjustment Credits for the North West Frontier Province
 (NWFP) and Sindh, and Education Structural Adjustment operations for Punjab. Reform implementation
 has remained strong over the past year; a second Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC 2) i s under
 preparation, as is a Development Policy Credit for the NWFP.

                                            11.THEEARTHQUAKE

3.       On October 8, 2005, a powerful earthquake measuring 7.6 on the Richter scale hit northern
Pakistan'. The epicenter o f the quake was 100 kilometers north o f Islamabad, Pakistan's capital, along
the fault line where the Indian Plate meets the Eurasian plate. Tremors were felt across a wide swath of
South Asia.

4.      Pakistan has borne the brunt o f the earthquake, especially the western districts o f the NWFP and
most of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK),2 with enormous loss o f life and devastation o f infrastructure
and property. Current estimates put the death toll at 47,700 but this figure is expected to rise.3 Over
67,000 are reported injured. Nearly 4 million people are affected in terms o f loss o f shelter and public
amenities.

5.      The greatest damage to public and private property is in eight districts: three in AJK
(Muzaffarabad, Bagh and Rawalakot), and five inthe NWFP (Abbottabad, Mansehra, Shangla, Batagram,


IThe earthquakehit at the confluenceofIndusKohistanandthe westernrangesof the Himalayas.
2Proceeds from the proposedSupplementalFinancingwill be usedpartly in Azad Janiinu and Kashmir (AJK), an
area over which India and Pakistan have been in dispute since 1947. By fmancing the proposed Supplemental
Financing, IDA does not intendto makeanyjudgment as to the legal or other status o f any disputedterritories or to
prejudicethe final determinationofthe parties' claims.
 Estimatesinthis document are as of October 19,2005.

 and Kohistan). Muzaffarabad, the capital of AJK, has been virtually leveled, and the towns of Bagh and
 nearby villages have also been severely damaged. Rawalakot suffered substantial damage to structures.
 In the NWFP, the town of Balakot has suffered extensive damage. Landslides have wiped out entire
 villages and have blocked roads. Houses, businesses, schools, colleges, hospitals and government offices
 have been destroyed or severely damaged. There i s also extensive damage to electricity, water, and
 telecommunications infrastructure throughout the affected region.           According to Government of
 Pakistan's preliminary estimates, in the hard-hit areas 80 percent o f public buildings, 25 percent of the
 main roads, and 75 percent o f the area and local roads are severely damaged.

 6.        The casualty numbers will continue to rise as information is collated from remote, less accessible
 villages and hamlets. The fast approaching Himalayan winter will also take its toll due to lack of shelter
 and exposure to plummetingtemperatures.

                              111.GOVERNMENT'S       RESPONSETO THE CRISIS

 7.        The Government o f Pakistan and civil society have responded quickly to the earthquake
 emergency.     Although communications with the most severely affected areas and populations were
 severed, the President and Prime Minister visited disaster-stricken sites shortly after the quake. Two
 Divisions o f the Army were moved into the NWFP and AJK, and five advanced staging posts for
 facilitation and distribution were set up. A "President's Relief Fund" has been established to mobilize
 resources for relief efforts. The Prime Minister's office has appointed a Relief Coordinator, with overall
 responsibility for relief efforts, targeted towards providing shelter, food, clean water and immediate
 medical care. Furthermore, the Government has already announced cash transfers of Rs.100,000 for
 death o f individual family members and Rs.50,000 for injuredmembers; this alone would add up to more
 than US$ 100 million. The President has launched a "President's Rehabilitation Initiative" (PRI) to
 rebuild damaged infrastructure, including roads, bridges, government buildings, and schools. The PRI
 will oversee the completion o f the task through an Earthquake Rehabilitation and Reconstruction
 Authority (ERRA). In addition, the civil society in Pakistan has mobilized swiftly, raising nearly Rs. 6
 billion (US$ 100 million) in donations to various private charities and government relief funds, and has
provided clothing, temporary shelter, food, medicines and medical care to the victims.

 8.       The Govemment has also requested international assistance, which started arriving within days o f
the earthquake. The UnitedNations (UN) immediately deployed the United Nations Development and
Assessment Coordination (UNDAC) Team to provide technical assistance to assess the disaster and
manage the disaster response. The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) i s helping coordinate
relief efforts at both national and local levels. Other UN specialized agencies such as United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF), the World Food Program (WFP), and the United Nations Population Fund
(UNFPA) have also provided emergency assistance. To date, around US$ 500 million has been pledged
on a bilateral basis by various governments.       This includes pledges of over US$ 20 million by the
governments of Japan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and the
United States o f America. The UNlaunchedan earthquake FlashAppeal for US$309 million on October
12, 2005, based on the UNDAC's initial assessment. The appeal covers only immediate needs o f shelter,
health, education, infrastructure, food and logistics.

9.       The Government o f Pakistan expects overall economic activity in Pakistan to be adversely
affected over the next few months. Domestic demand is projected to weaken, as disposable incomes o f
the affected people have been virtually wiped out. For the coming months, remittances from family
members and cash transfers from the Government will be the main sources o f income for over four
million people.    Business confidence in the affected areas i s expected to remain depressed until
reconstruction gets into full swing. These factors are likely to lower economic growth below the 7
percent growth targeted for the current fiscal year.



                                                      2

     10.      Relief and reconstruction expenditures will have significant negative budgetary implications over
<   the current and subsequent years. The Government of Pakistan has already allocated Rs. 5 billion (US$
     83 million) for relief operations, and this amount i s likely to rise. Over the next four to five years, the
    Government estimates that it will need at least US$5 billion (or 4.5 percent o f 2004-05 GDP) to rebuild
     damaged infrastructure and return the affected regionto normalcy. Tax revenue from the affectedregions
     i s likely to be virtually wiped out for at least the remainder o f the fiscal year. As a result o f expected
     increase inpublic expenditures, weakening o ftax revenue collection inthe affected area, and a slow down
     in economic activity, the Governmentexpects the fiscal deficit target (3.8 percent of GDP) for the current
    fiscal year (2005/06) to be exceeded. Nevertheless, it also plans to reprioritize development and current
    expenditures in the current as well as in subsequent budgets, so as to minimize fiscal slippages. Inorder
    to protect the fiscal deficit target and stay on the public debt reduction path as envisaged in the
    Macroeconomic Framework, the Government of Pakistan will be seeking substantial amounts o f grant
    assistance.
                                       Iv.BANK'SRESPONSEAND           STRATEGY4

     11.      In response to the earthquake, the Bank has established two crisis management teams in
    Washington and Islamabad, chaired by the Vice President and Country Director, respectively. Within 24
    hours of the earthquake, the Bank announced that US$20 millionwould be available to the Government
    of Pakistan through reallocations from existing projects. This amount was doubled to US$ 40 million on
    October 11, through additional identified reallocations. In cooperation with the Government and other
    development partners, the Bank has helped establish a structure for donor response and planning. Overall
    initial relief operations are being championed by the UNDAC. The World Bank and the Asian
    Development Bank (ADB) have been asked by the Government o f Pakistan to co-lead a multi-agency
    Damage and Needs Assessment, which will start on October 23, 2005. Senior Management is in close
    contact with other development agencies and the UN.

    12.       The Bank is preparing a proposed package o f US$ 470 million to help Pakistan deal with the
    reconstruction effort and safeguard the on-going reform and poverty reduction program. This package
    will include: (i)SupplementalFinancing o f US$ 150 millionunder PRSC 1 and o f US$ 50 millionunder
    NWFP SAC 2; (ii)      additional financing for existing projects (AJK Community Infrastructure and Services
    Project, Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund Project, and Highways Rehabilitation Project); and (iii)
    reallocation o f part o f the proceeds of AJK Community Infrastructure and Services Project, NWFP
    Community Infrastructure and Services Project 11, NWFP On-Farm Water Management Project. In
    addition to this immediate response, if the Damage and Needs Assessment identifies unmet needs, and if
   the Government requests it, the Bank could prepare an Emergency Recovery Program.


                                        V. THEPRSCREFORMPROGRAM

    13.       The PakistanPRSC 1was the first ina series of three operations to support the implementation o f
   the Government of Pakistan's PRSP. The PRSP emphasizes sustained, rapid growth as the main vehicle
   for poverty reduction and i s grounded on four pillars: (i)achieving sustained high and broad-based
   economic growth, while maintaining macroeconomic stability; (ii)improving governance and
   consolidating devolution, both as a means o f delivering better development results and ensuring social
   and economic justice; (iii)investing in human capital, with a renewed emphasis on effective delivery o f
   basic social services; and (iv) targeting the poor and vulnerable, to bringthe marginalized sections o f the
   population and backward regions into the mainstream o f development, and to make marked progress in
   reducingexisting inequalities.

 14.      The overall PRSC program is closely aligned with the four reform pillars outlined in the PSRP.
 As Pakistan's poor growth performance was at the root of the increase in poverty incidence over the
 199Os, the main thrust o f the PRSP and hence o f the PRSC 1 reform program is on a set of policies to
 accelerate and sustain rapid growth. Within the broad PRSP agenda, and given that many of the
 responsibilities for service delivery in education, health, and water and sanitation rest with provincial and
 local governments, the PRSC 1 program focuses on the critical policy and institutional reforms that are
 the mandate of the federal government. Complementary operations, such as the NWFP and Sindh SACS
 and the Punjab Education SACDPC, focus on service delivery improvements at the provincial level.

 A. Economic Performance since the Approval of PRSC 1

 15,      The first PRSC, in an amount o f US$300 million, was approved by the Board and disbursed in
 September 2004. The Implementation Completion Report rated outcomes Satisfactory. Since the PRSC
 1 was approved, economic performance remained strong and progress in implementation o f the prior
 actions for the PRSC 2 has been satisfactory. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth for the fiscal year
 endingin June 2005 was 8.4 percent, and was broad based (see Selected Economic Indicators inTable 1).
 Led by strong domestic demand, industrial growth continued to be strong in the automobiles, fertilizer,
 and consumer durables sub-sectors. Bumper cotton and wheat crops translated into strong growth in
 agricultural output. Exports continued to expand faster than GDP, in spite o f the end o f the Multi-Fiber
Agreement. Foreign direct investmentcontinued to increase, partly as a result o fthe Government's strong
privatization program.

16.      Macroeconomic stability has been sustained and external and domestic imbalances have been
brought to sustainable levels. The IMF-supported PRGF was concluded in December 2004, and the
Government o f Pakistan did not request a successor IMF program. IMF Post-program Monitoring was
deemed unnecessary by the IMF's Board, and as a result Pakistan is now on a standard Article IV
surveillance schedule. An IMF Article IV Consultation mission took place in August 2005, and the Staff
Report for this mission is now with IMFBoardMembers, for discussion on November 2,2005.




                                                             4

 17.      Infiscal year 2004/05, the overall fiscal deficit stood at 3.3 percent o f GDP. This representedan
 increase o f 1 percentage point o f GDP over the previous year, but remains consistent with a stable
 macroeconomic framework and continued debt reduction. The main reason for the increase in the deficit
 in fiscal year 2004/05 was the government's decision to reduce excise taxes on petroleum products to
 cushion consumers partly from the impact o f rising international oil prices. For fiscal year 2006, the
 budget accommodates an expanded public investment program, and continued real increases in PRSP
 expenditures. The current account has gone from a surplus into a deficit, as a result of the sharp increase
 inthe oil import billand increased imports of capital goods.

 18.      Prospects for rapid growth to be sustained over the next three years are good, provided that
 political and macroeconomic stability are sustained, that the momentum o f structural reforms and
 investments to reduce the cost o f doing business (and thus increase returns on private investment) is
 sustained, and that domestic savings and public and private investment continue to increase. The
 earthquake has now placed an additional burden o f the Government's reform implementation capacity,
 and brought about significant needs for relief and reconstruction o f damaged physical and social
 infrastructure inthe affected districts. With strong support from the international community, however, it
 i s reasonable to expect that Pakistan's prospects for continued rapid growth and poverty reduction will
remain bright.

B. Povertyand SocialImpact Analysis

 19.      The impact o f the economic turnaround on the incidence o f poverty will only be known later this
year. The last source o f data (Pakistan Integrated Household Survey) from which poverty estimates can be
derived is now nearly four years old, dating from 2001/02, when economic growth was depressedand the
country's rural areas were hit by successive years o f severe drought An evaluation o f whether the
economic turnaround o f the past few years has translated into lower poverty will have to await the release
and analysis o f the Household Income and Expenditure Survey expected in December 2005; however, it
is to be expected that the incidence o f poverty in Pakistan has declined from 32 percent in 2001/02.5
While income poverty outcomes are not yet known, preliminary figures from the Pakistan Social and
Living Standards Measurement survey (CWIQ methodology), recently released by the Federal Bureau o f
Statistics, suggest improvements across a wide range o f social and welfare indicators.

C. ReformProgresssince the Approval of PRSC 1

Pillar I:Acceleratinggrowth and maintainingmacroeconomic stabiZity
20.      Since PRSC 1 was approved, the pace o f the PRSC reform program continued to be strong. A
stable macroeconomic framework was maintained, even though over the past year the economy has
shown some signs o f overheating. The State Bank o f Pakistan (SBP) has started tightening monetary
policy since early 2005, and this is expected to reduce inflationary pressures.

21.      The Government has passedthe Fiscal Policy and Debt Limitation Law that will lock inthe gains
made in fiscal and debt management over the past four years. Tax administration reforms to improve the
effectiveness o f tax collections by the Central Board of Revenue and reduce the opportunities for
corruption have accelerated. Large Taxpayer Units were set up in Karachi and Lahore, and Medium
Taxpayer Units in Lahore, Karachi, Peshawar and Rawalpindi. The federal budget process i s being
strengthened. With technical support from DFID, a Medium-Term Budget Framework was introduced
with the 2005/06 Budget for the Health and Population Welfare Ministries, and will be expanded
gradually to include 9 additional ministries in 2006/07, and then gradually to cover the entire federal


  The incidence of poverty in Pakistan in 2001/02 is estimated to have risen throughout the 199Os, to between 32
percent (2003 Government o fPakistan's PRSP) and 37 percent (2004 World Bank's Poverty Update),


                                                       5

 government by 2010/11. There is also progress in increasing the integration and coherence of the
 recurrent and development budget. The Government also took steps to improve the effectiveness,
 transparency, and speed of implementation o f public sector development expenditures.

 22.       The Government has accelerated the privatization program, with the bidding of 51 percent share
 o f the National Refinery Limited, privatization o f the Pak-Arab Fertilizer Company, and the bidding for
 26 percent share and management control o f Pakistan Telecommunications Company, the largest such
 transaction in Pakistan's history. A number o f other companies are at an advanced stage in the
 privatization process. The Government has made significant progress in revising labor legislation to
 improve labor market flexibility, through consolidating and rationalizing existing laws, increasing
 working hours, particularly for women, and allowing employers with greater discretion in personnel
 matters. Albeit more slowly, reflecting difficult political economy issues, power sector reform is
 advancing, with significant steps towards improved governance and efficiency o f the sector. In the
 coming months, the establishment o f tariffs specific to each distribution company will open the way to
 further strengthenthe regulatory and institutional framework for the sector.

 Pillar 11: Improving governanceand devolution
 23.       Governance and institutional reforms have also continued to advance. Complementary reforms to
 improve accounting, financial reporting, internal controls, external audit, and legislative oversight are
 being implemented, in particular computerization of budget execution, implementation o f a new chart o f
 accounts and of an automated accounting system. Legislative oversight has improved with the
 establishment o f Public Accounts Committees at the federal level as well as in the provinces, and these
 committees are making good progress in reviewing audit reports, and in tracking and monitoring cash
 recoveries from public officials. The Government has introduced a new cash flow statement, which will
 reinforce Pakistan's conformance to international accounting standards. The Pakistan Procurement
 Regulatory Authority notified new procurement rules, conforming to international best practice, that
 apply to all procurement of goods carried out by the federal government line departments, as well as those
 o f state-owned enterprises and semi-autonomous organizations.

 Pillar 111: Investingin human capital
 24.      Reforms to improve the delivery o f education and health services have continued to advance.
 Public expenditures for health and in particular education have continued to increase rapidly in real and
 per capita terms, although less rapidly than GDP. A pilot conditional cash transfer scheme to encourage
 schooling of children from poor households was recently approved, and the government i s also at an
 advanced stage to approve a pilot to for improvingtuberculosis case-detection and treatment successrates
through the use o f cash incentives for patients.

Pillar IV: Targetingthepoor and the vulnerable
25.       Budgetary allocations for key safety net programs have increased. In particular, funds for the
Food Support Program, which provides a minimum o f food consumption support to chronically poor
families, have been increased from Rs. 3 billion in 2004/05 to Rs. 4.5 billion for 2005/06. These
additional funds will be used to increase the number o f beneficiaries and to increase the cash transfer per
household.

                    VI. RATIONALE PROPOSED
                                        FOR             SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCING

26.      The magnitude and devastationo f the earthquake and the required response from the Government
o f Pakistan are resulting in higher financing requirements than previously anticipated. Nevertheless, the
Government remains committed to the implementation o f the reform program supported under the PRSC,
including the maintenance o f a stable macroeconomic framework.



                                                     6

 27.       A formal Damage and Needs Assessment is expected inmid-November, however, it is clear that
 the economic impact o fthe earthquake is sizeable. Table 2 summarizes the estimated reconstructioncosts
 of areas hit by earthquakes in recent years. Relief and reconstruction costs in Pakistan are likely to be
 high, as the death toll and intensity of the quake were considerably larger. Early estimates suggestthat the
 reconstruction costs o f the lost infrastructure will runinto several billions o f U S dollars and thus will have
 a sizeable impact on the overall financing needs of the Government o f Pakistan (as well as the
 Government o f the NWFP). The proposed Supplemental Financing would support the sustained
 implementation o f the PRSC reform program, and help finance part o f the gap in resources incurred as a
 result of the earthquake of October 8, 2005. This is consistent with Bank policy as reflected in OP 8.60,
 according to which supplemental financing may be provided for a development policy operation for
 which an anticipated gap in financing jeopardizes a reform program that i s otherwise proceeding on
 schedule and incompliance with the agreed policy agenda.

28.        The proposed Supplemental Financing, which would contribute to maintaining the sustainability
of the overall reform program o f the government, meets Bank requirement for Supplemental Financing
under OP 8.60 as follows:

          (a) Theprogram is being implemented in compliance withprovisions of the Credit Agreement:
          Pakistan i s currently implementing the PRSC reform program in full compliance with all
          covenants.

          (b) The borrower is unable to obtain sufJicientfundspom other lenders on reasonable terms or
          in a reasonable time: Under the Government o f Pakistan's leadership, the Bank and other donors
          are gearing up to provide support in a coordinated manner.                    However, the need to begin
          reconstruction is immediate. This would be the first significant financing package to help the
          Government o f Pakistan face immediate needs. Other development partners are pledging
          additional resources, which alongside with the Supplemental Financing will contribute to closing
          the financing needs o f the Government o f Pakistan for urgent rehabilitation, social support
          programs, and critical reconstruction investments in the affected areas. The Bank i s consulting
          with the ADB, EU, JBIC and DFID to reaffirm our commitment to avoid fragmentation o f
          external assistance as much as possible.

         (c) The time available is too short to process afurther peestanding Bank credit: The use o f a
         Supplemental Financing option can enable the Bank to deliver program support in a timely
         manner to respond to the urgent financial needs of the Government o f Pakistan due to the

         earthquake. Timely response from the Bank will help the people o f the affected areas rebuild
         their lives. PRSC 2, which is currently under preparation, is expected to be presented to the Board
          only in early 2006. Waiting for PRSC 2 to be prepared would delay much needed financial
          support to the Government o f Pakistan.

          (d) The borrower is committed to theprogram and the implementing agencieshave demonstrated
          competence in carrying it out: The Government o f Pakistan is committed to pursuing prudent
         macroeconomic policies over the medium term and to implement needed structural reforms in
          line with its poverty reduction strategy.      It has demonstrated commitment and capacity to
          implement a far-reaching reform program, as demonstrated in the completiodimplementation
         reports of PRSC 1, but also o f SAC 1 and SAC 2. There is satisfactory progress towards
          indicative triggers o f PRSC 2.


                                  VII. IMPLEMENTATION         ARRANGEMENTS

 A. Terms of the SupplementalFinancing

 29.     N o conditions, save for the standard requirement for a legal opinion will apply to this
 Supplemental Financing. There will be an overall requirement that the Government continues to maintain
 a satisfactory macroeconomic policy framework as was requiredunder the first operation.

 30.     The closing date for the Supplemental Financing is March 31, 2006.

 B. FundsFlow and AuditingRequirementsfor the SupplementalFinancing

 31.     Supplemental Financing proceeds will be deposited into a deposit account with the SBP into
which the Supplemental Financing proceeds will be disbursed on a single tranche basis. The funds in the
Account will, automatically, be transferred in the Consolidated Fundo f the Government o f Pakistan held
with the SBP. Disbursements from the Consolidated Fund by the Government of Pakistan shall not be
linked to any specific purchases and no special procurement requirement shall be needed. As i s the case
under the original credit, IDA reserves the right to request an audit o f such account. IDA disbursements
will not be linked to specific expenditures but the proceeds o f the Supplemental Financing shall not be
usedfor excluded expenditures as set out inthe legal agreement.

C. EnvironmentalIssues

32.      Policies supported by this Supplemental Financing are not expected to have a significant
environmental effect inPakistan.

                                        VIII. BENEFITSAND RISKS

A. Benefits

32.      Timely program support will contribute to assisting the Government o f Pakistan in covering
immediate needs for relief and reconstruction by accessing financial assistance necessary to mitigate the
impact o f the earthquake. At the same time, it i s critical that macroeconomic stability i s maintained while
relief and rehabilitation takes place. Supplementalprogram support will be an important source o f budget
financing for the Government of Pakistan as it will provide financing at a time when the impact of the
disaster on government revenues is unknown; and there i s an urgent need for additional government
expenditures. While donor pledges have now reached nearly one billion U S dollars, pledges typically
have a longer gestation lag than desired and so flexible financing o f the type being proposed i s necessary



                                                       8

to speed up the rehabilitation process.      Supplemental financing under PRSC 1 i s quick disbursing,
contributing to timely provision o f support to affected populations, while helping maintain
macroeconomic stability and the momentum o fthe reform program.

33.     Supplemental financing for PRSC 1 will thus complement the support for short- and medium-
term rehabilitation that will be provided through the restructuring and reprogramming of ongoing
operations in the Bank's portfolio. It will also complement the assistance provided by other multilateral,
inparticular the ADB, and bilateral agencies.

34.     Finally, the Supplemental Financing will contribute to minimizingthe risks to the overall reform
program, maintain the integrity o f the transition to, andthe preparationof, the PRSC 2.

B. Risks

35.     Based on experience from other countries in similar circumstances, there are risks involved with
the type o f assistance being considered by the Bank.          In this case, the main risks relate to the
Government's limited administrative capacity to implement relief and reconstruction operations o f this
magnitude. So far, the Government's response to the earthquake emergency has been satisfactory, in
particular taking into consideration the difficulties of reaching remote communities when
communications are interruptedand means are limited. In addition, UNDAC and other specialized UN
agencies, the Bank, the ADB, and several countries are helping strengthen the government's capacity to
respond.
