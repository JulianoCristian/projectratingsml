                      through the transfer o f increased resources to lower levels o f government. The
                      PRSC program will support accelerated progress in human capital by focusing
                      on measures that are the responsibility of the federal government, including
                      (i)strengthening national sector policy inhealth and education; (ii)    improving
                      the public expenditure framework for health and education; and (iii)     increased
                      data generation, monitoring o f outcomes, and program evaluation. The PRSC
                      program will support improvements in Palustan's safety nets, so as to improve
                      targeting and ensure that the poor and vulnerable are covered.

Risks andMitigationStrategy:
                      Risks include: (i) of sustainedimplementation due to capacity constraints,
                                         lack
                      and (ii) exogenous shocks. These risks remain relevant, but have diminished
                      somewhat as a result o f the demonstrated ownership o f the PRSP's reform
                      program by the elected government and the continuity o f economic and social
                      policies over the past 4 years. The Bank i s mitigating these risks by sustaining
                      and deepening its policy dialogue, supporting capacity building o f key
                      government institutions, and disbursingagainst a set o fprior actions.

Disbursement:         The credit, in an amount equivalent to US$300 million, will be disbursed in
                      one tranche upon effectiveness.

                                             I.OVERVIEW


1.       For Pakistan's poor, the 1990s were a lost decade, with little progress made in reducing
poverty and improvingsocial indicators. Annual deficits averaged 6% o f GDP, and were financed at
highdomestic interest rates. There was a further accumulation o fpublic debt, which addedto the already
large debt stock inherited from the 1980s. The imposition o f trade and aid sanctions, following the 1998
nuclear tests, further highlightedPakistan's economic fragility. At the end o f the 1990s, Pakistan faced
slow growth, a macroeconomic crisis, and an unsustainable level o f debt, with interest payments
consumingmore than halfo f total tax revenue.

2.       Per capita growth per year declined to 1.2% from 3% in the 1980s. The slow growth o f the
1990s, exacerbated by drought and poor agncultural performance inthe second half o f the decade, led to
an increase inthe incidence o f poverty. By 2001, when the latest household survey was carried out, over
30% o f Palustani households livedbelow the poverty line. Improvements inother indicators were limited
or absent. In fact, even when growth and poverty reduction occurred in the previous decade, there was
limited improvement in human development. As a result, Pakistan started the new century with lagging
indicators for child mortality, female literacy, primary school enrollment, and other social indicators
compared to other countries at the same per capita income level.

3.       Prospects for sustaining faster growth, reducing poverty, and improving social indicators
are now brighter. The government that took power in 1999 made substantial progress in stabilizing and
reviving the economy. It launched an ambitious and comprehensive program o f reforms to modernize
Palustan and its institutions, and demonstrated its determination to tackle difficult reforms: improving
fiscal balances, privatizing public sector enterprises, taking steps to strengthen public and corporate
governance, liberalizing external trade, reforming the banlung sector, and reducing untargeted subsidies.
It also launched an ambitious devolution program.

4.       The momentum o f the reform program slowed somewhat in the months following the October
2002 elections, as a result o f a longer-than-expected transition and a lengthy constitutional impasse.
During 2003 and the first months of 2004, the pace of reform accelerated and macroeconomic
performance was sustained. The elected government has maintainedthe policy directions o f the previous
govemment.      Recent policy developments include submission o f the Fiscal Responsibility and Debt
Reduction Bill to Parliament, liberalization o f the telecommunications sector, and privatization o f Habib
Bank, This direction i s likely to be sustained despite the recent change inthe office o fthe prime minister,
as the composition o f the new cabinet, especially key economic management positions, remains largely as
before.

5.       Widespread economic reforms and good macroeconomic management, along with larger inflows
of concessional assistance, debt restructuring, increased remittances, and favorable weather, contributed
to the turnaround inPakistan's economy. Economic growth has accelerated to 5.1% in2002103 and 6.4%
in2003/04. Key extemal and domestic balances have improved significantly, withprimary surpluses in
both extemal payments and the govemment budget. Although still high, the burden o f debt has started to
decline. Inflationhas remainedlow and the Palustani Rupee has been stable.

6.       The elected government completedthe Poverty ReductionStrategy Paper (PRSP), entitled
"AcceleratingEconomicGrowthandReducingPoverty: The RoadAhead", onDecember31,2003l.
Because the Interim-PRSP was prepared by and reflected the reform program o f the military government
that had come to power in 1999, the government decided to defer preparation o f a full PRSP until an
elected government was inplace. Completion o f the PRSP helpedbroaden consensus for and ownership
o f reform. The main focus o f the PRSP i s on second-generation reforms to accelerate growth to over 6%,
while maintaining macroeconomic stability. Other pillars o f the PRSP include strengthening governance
and furthering devolution, accelerating investments in human capital, and targeting the poor and
vulnerable.   The PRSP targets are in line with the progress necessary to meet the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs), and the PRSP projects significantly higher expenditure allocations for
education, health, and poverty-related infrastructure. The Bank-Fund Joint Staff Assessment, discussed
by the Board o f the IMF on March 8, 2004 and the Board o f the Bank on March 11, 2004, endorsed the
PRSP and indicated that it provides a good policy framework for the implementation o f a strong reform
program, which can translate into the Government's ambitious development goals and thus accelerate
progress towards the MDGs for Palustan.

7.       The Government's reform program has been supported by strong external bilateral and
multilateral financial and technical support. In particular, the World Bank has supported the
Government of Palustan's structural reforms with two national Structural Adjustment Credits, and the
reform programs o f Provincial Governments with multisectoralprovincial Structural Adjustment Credits
for Sindh and NWFP, and an Education Structural Adjustment Credit for Punjab. The IMFhas supported
macroeconomic stabilization policies with a 3-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF).
Implementation o f the PRGF program i s on track, with successful completion o f the Eighth Review on
June 22, 2004. The Asian Development Bank has supported Palustan with adjustment and investment
projects at the national and provincial levels. A number o f UN agencies have expanding programs in
Palustan, as have UK's DFID and USAID. The EUand several other bilaterals are also providing project
finance as well as budget support incash or indebt reduction.

8.       Guided by the CAS, and based on the track record and request of the Government of
Pakistan, the Bank will continue to support Pakistan's reforms and development through
adjustment and investment lending as well as non-lending instruments, including the proposed
Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC). The World Bank Group's 2002 Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) for Palustan laid out a program o f support for Pakistan's I-PRSP. The CAS specified the
instruments best suited to pursue the strategy: (i)policy-based, fast-disbursing lending to pursue the
governance and sectoral reform agenda; (ii)         programmatic sector and investment lending to support
implementation o f reforms in economic management and governance (e.g., technical assistance to the
central bank and reforms in tax administration and public financial management); social infrastructure
and delivery systems for education and health; and community infrastructure services (including water
management) at all levels o f government; and (iii)        analytical work and other non-lending services to
monitor developments in the areas o f low engagement and to encourage reforms. The CAS Progress
Report, which was presentedto the Board on April 20,2004, confirms that the strategy set out inthe 2002
CAS remains valid in light o f the full PRSP and proposes an extension o f this strategy untilthe next CAS
i s prepared.  Based on the government's strong progress in implementing reforms and restoring its
creditworthiness, the program o f Bank support outlined in the CAS i s proposed to be expanded and fully
aligned with the PRSP.

A. The Context-Economicand SocialChallenges

10.      Inthe first 20 years after independence in 1947, Palstan had the highest growth rate in South
Asia.   In 1965 it exported more manufactures than Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and
Turkey -- combined. It would have made anyone's list o f the Asian countries most likely to enjoy rapid
growth over the ensuing decades. As i s
now evident, this didnot happen. Chronic                     Figure 1: Poverty Trend in Pakistan:
fiscal deficits fed into mounting debt and                           Poverty Headcount (%)

rising interest spending, which combined
with highdefense expenditures cut sharply       35 1
into development and poverty-reducing
spending. Corruption took hold, the civil
service became politicized, and local
govemment was abolished. While the
growth rate inthe 1980s was still over 6%
per year, it slowed to around 4% by the
mid 1990s. Poverty incidence increased                                 T
throughout the decade (Box 1). Palustan               1987-88 1990-91 1992-93 1993-94 1996-97 1998-99 2000-01
became the slowest growing country in
South Asia, an exact reversal of its            Source: Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, Government of Pakistan.

 11.     Successive governments in the 1990s attempted to respond by announcing measures to free
interest rates, privatize, reduce trade barriers, reform the banks, spur the development o f small and
medium-sized enterprises, and even (via the Social Action Program) to address the large social and
gender gaps. The results o f these initiatives were disappointing. Reforms were partial, while corruption
and weak institutions failed to provide a solid foundation for a market economy. Public investments,
operations and maintenance, and education and health-related spending were crowded out by interest and
defense spending. The large social gap acted as a constraint to productivity enhancements and growth.
The unstable political and security situation led private investors (both Palustani and foreign alike) to
consider Pakistan a highrisk,highcost business environment.

 12.     The government that took office in 1999 sought to reverse this situation and built upon the efforts
of its predecessors. It launched a comprehensive reform program that sought to attack the interlinked
problems o f slow growth, the social gap, and the heavy debt burden. Four years on, and after an elected
government took office in late 2002, sustained implementation has resulted in macroeconomic stability

and laid the foundations for rapid growth and poverty reduction. The acceleration o f growth in 2002103
and again in 2003/04 suggest that poverty has now started to decline; however successive years o f high,
broad-based economic growth will be required to make a dent on poverty. Despite this progress, private
investment remains low, as investor confidence has taken time to improve. The burden o f public debt,
while declining, remains high. And social indicators are improving, including for women, but more
slowly than would be required to attain the MDGs (Figure 2).

                                       Box 1: A Profile of Poverty in Pakistan

 The positive developments o f the past few years are encouraging. Economic growth has accelerated and has been
 broad based, and as a result it is expected that poverty incidence will have declined since the last household survey
 was conducted (2001). Yet poverty i s widespread inPakistan, and the country faces a serious challenge intrying
 to meet the MillenniumDevelopment Goals. Based on the 2001 data, using the Government's recently-developed
 official poverty line, 32.1 percent o f the population was classified as poor in2001 compared with 30.6 percent in
  1999. These figures, although the most up-to-date available, are basedon a survey conducted in2001.

 The government recently adopted an official poverty line, based on the estimated expenditure necessary to attain a
 minimum threshold o f calorie consumption.          However, a number o f methodological questions on poverty
 measurement remain. It is important to note however, that irrespective o f what methodology i s used, an increase in
 poverty incidence is observed for the period o f 1999-2001. The increase in poverty between 1999 and 2001 i s
 attributable to low growth in the intervening years, in particular in agriculture, mostly o n account o f successive
 years o f drought preceding 2001 that had a severe impact on the rural economy. Estimates from a short household
 survey conducted in April-May 2004 point to a decline in poverty as compared to the equivalent (April-May)
 period covered in the 2001 PIHS; however, these estimates are not strictly comparable with those from earlier
 household surveys.

 Poverty inPakistan is characterized by a high concentration o f population around the poverty line; approximately
 41 percent o f the population i s concentrated ina small range o f 75 to 125 percent o f the poverty line, implyingthat
 unanticipated shocks, such as illness, death, or drought can result in large increases in poverty. Human
  development indicators in Pakistan show substantial gender disparities and continue to lag behind those of
  countries with similar per capita incomes. There are wide variations in poverty between urban and rural areas,
  geographical regions, and gender. An overwhelming majority of Pakistan's poor live inrural areas, and poverty i s
  especially high among the large segment o f the population who earn their livelihood in the informal sector.
  Poverty manifests itself not only in low levels o f consumption, but also in lack o f opportunities to improve
  incomes - in the form o f lack o f access to education and health services, to productive assets, and to public
  services ingeneral.




B. Recent Political Developments

13.      T h e government followed through on its pledge to hold elections and restore Parliament. As
it promised to do upon talung power in 1999, the military government under President Musharraf held
elections to Parliament and the four Provincial Assemblies in October 2002. The elections were accepted
as legitimate, though the transition to the new govemment took longer than expected. The Palustan
MuslimLeague-Quaid-e-ham              (PML-Q) won the largest number o f seats, butnot an outright majority,
delaying the formation o f national and provincial assemblies while parties negotiated over the formation
of a coalition government. In addition, the pace o f Parliamentary business was slowed during 2003 while
the Government and Parliament sought to resolve a dispute over amendments to Palustan's 1973
constitution. A compromise package o f amendments was approved by Parliament in December 2003.
Resolution o f the constitutional impasse increases the prospects for a relatively stable political
environment, which has in the past been marked by considerable instability. The elected govemment i s
characterized by continuity o f policy and personnel in key economic management positions including
Finance Minister and central bank governor. It has continued the ambitious reform program launched
under the military government, although in late 2002 the momentum o f the reform program was slowed
somewhat by the prolonged transition. Recently, there has been a change in leadership within the ruling
political party and there i s a new Prime Minister and cabinet. This development i s unlikely to affect the
momentum o f reforms, as the composition o f the cabinet remains largely unchanged.

14.      Regional tensions have subsided over the past year. Peace initiatives launched during 2003
and early 2004 have led to promising steps toward normalization o f relations between India and Pakistan.
These include the resumption o f air, rail and bus links, and restoration o f full diplomatic relations. A
successful summit meeting between Indian Prime Minister Vajpayee and President Musharraf was held
on the margins o f the January 2004 SAARC summit inIslamabad. The summit also resulted in agreement
on a landmark free-trade agreement under which SAARC members will reduce their intra-regional tariffs
to 5 percent or less over the next decade while also eliminating informal trade barriers. The summit was
subsequently followed by talks on a range of bilateral issues between the two countries' respective
foreign secretaries, the first such detailed dialogue in six years. The war in Afghanistan and its aftermath
continue to pose a challenge, requiring increased military deployments in the border region, and have
resulted in sporadic, but significant, clashes between the military and tribal militants.

C. Recent EconomicDevelopments

15.      Implementation of the Government's reform program has been largely successful, helping
to transform Pakistan's economy from a highly regulated to a more open, market economy. As a
result, growth has now accelerated, external financial inflows are increasing, and the Government is
gradually consolidating its domestic and external reputation as a reformer. Economic performance has
continued to strengthen under the leadership o f the elected government. In2002/03 GDP growth at factor
cost accelerated to 5.1%, industrial production grew by 9% (against a 3% annual average in the 1990s),
inflation remained low, and external balances continued to improve (Table 1). In 2003/04 it accelerated
further, to an estimated 6.4% of GDP, led again by industryand service^.^

16.      Due to high remittances, strong exports and sizeable extemal support, the current account and
overall balance o f payments improved. The current account has remained in surplus over the past two
years. Debt re-profiling, made possible by the current low interest rate regime, availability o f grants and
concessional finance, debt write-off and fiscal prudence, resulted in a significant reduction in the debt
burden (Figure 2).      As a result, progress in reducing Pakistan's debt burden was substantial with
government debt as a share o f GDP declining fi-om 108% o f GDP in 2000/01 to a projected 84% in
2003/04. Pakistan's debt dynamics have improved considerably and are sustainable under a large number
o f stress tests.




 Pakistan's FederalBureauof Statistics completedinMay 2004 a comprehensive revision of the nationalaccounts statistics. The
base year was moved from 1980181to 1999/00 and severalnew sectors of economic activity were included. The results of this
revisionare anominalGDP for 1999100and subsequent years that are about 20% higher than previously estimatedlevels. This
programdocument (and the IMF's Eighth Reviewdocument on June 2004) uses the "old" GDP series. The "new" series will be

17.         The government has set an ambitious path for fiscal balance based on a combination of
expenditure discipline, increased revenue collection, and improved debt management. This
programhas beenlargely successful. Fiscal outcomes improved significantly in2002/03 and 2003/04.
The fiscal deficit fell from 6.7 of GDP in 2001/02 to 4.5% of GDP in 2002/03, falling below 5% for the
first time in more than 25 years (Table 1). It i s projectedto have declined further in 2003/04, to 4.0% of
GDP. Tax revenue collections, one of Pakistan's key macroeconomic wealmesses, grew by 16% in
nominal terms, rising from 13.2 to 13.8% of GDP in 2002/03 and are projectedto have reached 13.5% of


                                                                                      7

GDP in2003/04. Aggregate expenditures have remained incheck, with increasedallocations provided to
PRSP expenditures, lower than projected interest payments, and higher defense expenditures resulting
from military activity on the Afghan border. Monetary aggregates grew rapidly inthe first nine months of
2003/04, reflecting the strong economic recovery, low interest rates, and ample liquidity inthe banks.

18.       The 2004/05 Federal Budget, announced in June, 2004, is fully consistent with the PRSP and
balances the twin objectives o f enhancing public allocations for poverty- and growth- related
expenditures, and of reducing the public debt burden further. The continued efforts made to expand the
tax base and the projected increase in CBR revenue, along with the continued efforts to limit subsidies to
loss-making enterprises, should allow for greater fiscal space being allocated to PRSP expenditures. At
6%, GDP growth is projectedto remain strong in2004/05.

19.       The IMF-supportedPovertyReductionand GrowthFacility(PRGF) remains ontrack. The
Eighth Review under the three-year arrangement was approved by the IMF's Board in June, 2004.
Performance under the PRGF has been strong, at times exceeding expectations with respect to
quantitative performance criteria. The majority o f structural measures have been implemented. There
have been a few delays in implementing structural conditionalities, but these were generally o f limited
significance.    An Article I V missioni s plannedfor early September, 2004.

20.       The Government has made progress in re-orienting public expenditure toward poverty
reduction. Expenditures in I-PRSP categories4 have risen steadily in real terms, with the total
accumulated increase reaching 62% between 1999/00 and 2003/04.                        As a share o f GDP, actual
expenditures in I-PRSP categories expanded faster than projected in the I-PRSP, although inpart this i s
due to the increases in salaries introduced in 2001/02 and 2003/04. Subsidies to the power sector on
account of operational losses and investments have not diminished as planned and continue to represent a
sizable claim on the budget, around 1.6 % o f GDP infiscal year 2002/03.

21.        The CBR reformprogramcontinuesto progressinmodernizingthe institution. Weaknesses
intax administrationhave long been identified as being among Pakistan's most serious challenges and
reform o f the Central Board of Revenue (CBR) i s a critical priority inthe government's reformprogram.
Indeed, for macroeconomic consolidation and debt reduction to continue without compressing PRSP
expenditures, the government's tax effort needs to be strengthened. The government i s now reforming its
key tax administration institutions to remove inefficiencies and change the culture from one o f extortion
to one based on transparency and integrity. A fundamental change was introduced inJuly 2002 with the
introduction o f a system based on Universal Self Assessment with risk based audit and record keeping to
minimize the taxpayers' interaction with tax officials. The government also initiated the restructuring o f
CBR in FY02.5 This restructuring includes a complete reorganization over a three-year period (FYs 02-
04) along with changes inhuman resource management.

22.        There hasbeen significant progressin reforming Pakistan's bankingsector. The core o fthe
government reform program-privatization              o f public sector banks-continued to advance with the
privatizations of United Bank Limited in October 2002, and o f Habib Bank, Pakistan's largest bank with
over 5 million depositors, in January 2004. With the sale o f Habib nearly 80% o f the country's banking
sector assets are now in private hands. (This share would be a little lower --79%-- if one included the


  The I-PRSP definedthe following budget categories as PRSP expenditures: Education, Health, Rural Development, Irrigation,
Social Security and Foodprograms, Population, Disaster Relief, Roads Highways and Bridges and Land Reclamation. The full
PRSP adopts a broader definition of poverty-relatedexpenditures, including also Law and Order, Access to Justice, and Rural
Electrification.
  It is expectedthat the Bankwill support CBRreformwith a Tax AdministrationProject, currentlyunder preparation.

three specialized public sector banks, i.e. Zarai Taraqiati Bank, IDBP and Punjab Provincial Coop.) Four
banks now remain state-owned, includingthe National Bank o f Palustan (NBP), FirstWomen Bank, Bank
o f Khyber (BOK),and Bank o f Punjab. Except for NBP, the other banks are small in terms o f their
market share. First Women Bank will be automatically privatized if NBP i s also sold (Habib, United and
National were its main shareholders). BOKalready has a privatization plan agreed with Government o f
North West Frontier Province (NWFP), with the government's share expected to be reduced to 51% by
end 2004. A Banlung Sector Adjustment Credit will provide follow-on financing to partially support the
balance sheet restructuring that was necessary to bring Habib and other Banks to the point o f sale.
Governance reforms in the sector are being supported through the Technical Assistance to the Banking
Sector (TABS) Project approved inJuly 2002.

23.      A Financial Sector Assessment report, part o f the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP)
has recently been concluded. It notes that the major achievement o f the Govemment's reforms i s the
transformation o f a predominantly state-owned and weak banking system into a healthier, market-based
system.   Privatization has been supported by a strengthened legal and regulatory environment, and
significant improvements in transparency, corporate governance, and credit culture, with a resultant
improvement in financial soundness indicators, increased resiliency to credit, market, and liquidity risks,
and improved compliance with international supervisory standards. The strengthened financial position
o f the banks, together with increased liquidityinthe sector, have resulted in a marked expansion o f credit,
particularly to previously underserved markets    - consumer, housing, SME, and agriculture finance have
all shown considerable growth inthe past two years.

24.      There has also been continued progress in further de-regulating the economy so as to
reduce the cost of doing business in Pakistan. Reforms to business registration procedures were
undertaken cutting the time for business start-up in half from 53 days in 2002 to 24 days in 2003. The
government consolidated several laws and regulations governing industrialrelations and promulgated the
Industrial Relations Ordinance 2002 in October 2002. The Government established a Committee on
Reforms in Regulatory Legal and Policy Environment under the Ministry o f Industries & Production
(MOI&P) in January 2002. The Committee i s comprised o f predominantly private sector representatives
with the Minister o f Industries & Production as chair. Under the Committee's auspices, the effort to
rationalize the many redundant and out-dated labor lawshegulations that hinder business growth and
employment has made good progress.          A comprehensive review o f industrial and commercial labor
legislation identified 20 laws as having significant impact on industrial relations and employment
generation, and called for their modernization and consolidation. It was proposed to repeal these 20
instruments and replace them with the following six consolidated draft categories o f laws: (1) industrial
relations; (2) employment conditions; (3) wages; (4) human resource development; (5) occupational
safety and health; and (6) labor welfare and social safety net. The process o f drafting and revising three o f
these six laws - Conditions of Employment Act; Payment of Wages Act; and Amendment Act to Industrial
Relations Ordinance, 2002 - i s well advanced. In addition, the Drug Act 1976,long considered to be a
deterrent to the healthy development o f pharmaceutical industry, has been revised with input from
stakeholders and promulgatedas the Drugs Ordinance 2002 inNovember 2002.

25.      Over the past year, considerable progress has been made in improving the regulatory and
institutional policy framework for the telecommunications sector, with the aim of establishing a
competitive market, increasing the levels of teledensity, and reducing the cost of
telecommunications in Pakistan. The GoP deregulation policy approved in January o f 2004 provides
for an open licensing regime for fixed-line service providers following expiration o f the monopoly o f the
state-owned Pakistan Telecommunications Company Limited (PTCL) on December 31, 2002. Adoption
of the new pro-competitive policy i s a major milestone with the potential to transform Palustan's
telecommunication sector into a fully competitive market. The entry o f new private operators in the
provision o f basic services will ensure much needed investment inthe sector. Inaddition, implementation


                                                      9

o f a universal access fund will help address chronically poor rural access. The government has also
revised its policy for cellular service with the objective o f introducing further competition in this fast-
growing market segment; duringthe last year, the number o f cellular subscribers has doubled and i s likely
to surpass the fixed line network over the coming year. Although PTCL has not yet been privatized,
deregulation inthe sector reduces the urgency o f this privatization.

26.      Reform o f the power sector in Pakistan remains a critical priority both for accelerating growth
and reducing the sector's drain on the budget. The focus o f the Bank's support for power sector reform
has been through policy dialogue and adjustment lending. Inparticular the reform program agreed under
SAC I1 called for measures to restore the financial viability o f the state-owned Water and Power
Development Authority (WAPDA) and its unbundling and corporatization with the eventual aim o f
privatizing the distribution and generation o f power. The Karachi Electric Supply Corporation (KESC)
was also to be privatized with support from a power program loan from ADB. In the near term, the
Financial Improvement Plan (FIP) aimed at restoring financial viability by addressing WAPDA's
structural weaknesses: weak bill collection, highline losses, and insufficient pass through to customers o f
changes incost.

27.      The pace of reform, however, hasbeenslow. Owingto several factors, includingweak investor
interest, KESC was not privatized as planned - although the process i s continuing and several investors
are now performing due diligence. The process o f unbundlingWAPDA, althoughwell behind schedule, i s
now substantially advanced. It has so far proven impossible to significantly improve the sector's financial
performance through improved bill collection, reduced losses, and tariff increases. Inpart this i s due to
very difficult political economy problems. First, an important part o f the losses are due to the difficulties
in enforcing bill collection in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). Moreover, electricity
tariff increases in FY03 were substantially less than the level agreed in the FIP reflecting the
government's reluctance to increase electricity tariffs. Increasing tariffs for industrial consumers would
be undesirable, as these consumers already pay relatively high tariffs. On the other hand, the price for
"lifeline"  consumption has been held steady for many years while real prices for "middle-wage"
consumers have risen since mid-2000 by up to 40%. Power tariffs are a sensitive issue for Palustani
voters and further tariff increases over and above those implementedin2002 could potentially negatively
impact the power sector reformprogram.

28.       Inlight of these developments, the Bank and the GoP have reassessedthe strategy and timing of
power sector reforms. The Bank has worked with the Government and WAPDA to prepare a revised FIP
based on realizable targets for collecting outstanding public sector bills and reducing technical losses and
theft.   To date, these revised targets have been met. Meanwhile the Bank is working with the
Government to help prepare a medium-term adjustment program for the sector - termed the Financial
Recovery Plan (FRP) -- which aims to eliminate the sector's drain on the budget on a more gradual basis
which together with reducing losses, will take into account the potential for changing fuel sources, and
future investments.     The progress with the corporatization process and attendant strengthening o f
incentives for improved performance have increased the prospects for success. The Govemment has also
requestedthe Bank's assistance inthe formulation o f a broader sector strategy that defines a path not only
toward financial viability, but also toward the expanded access, increased reliability and lower costs
necessary to support rapid economic growth.        At first this support will take the form o f technical
assistance and analytical support; in the future it could involve focused investment support for loss
reduction and could lead expanded lending to support the sector reforms and the investmentprogram that
the strategy will entail.

29.       There has been progress in implementation of the oil and gas reformagenda, in particular
in the petroleum downstream sector. The Government's long-term goal is to institute a competitive,
efficiently-run, financially-viable, and largely private oil and gas sector. Historically, performance o f


                                                     10

these sectors was erratic with considerable inefficiencies throughout the industry. Since 2000 however, a
fundamental policy shift has taken place throughout the industry characterized by the Government
focusing on policy formulation; the state-owned enterprises, most o f which are on the way to
privatization, being given vast autonomy and encouraged to operate on a commercial basis; and natural
monopolies being entrusted to a regulatory body. These measures have had a far-reaching impact in
revitalizing the sector, with approximately $2 billion innew investments (mostly private-sector) inoil and
gas infrastructure over the last three years, and an increase o f about 50% ingas supplies to end-consumers
inFY2004.

30.      The Government has been steadfast in implementingthe automatic fortnightly petroleum
price adjustment mechanismeven inthe face of significant fluctuations inglobalprices. Fueloil and
High Speed Diesel prices are fully deregulated and are set by Oil Marketing Companies (OMC)
competitively, based on their actual costs. Similarly, LPGprices (both at production and retail levels) are
fully deregulated and competitive pricing is observed inthe market.

31.      Implementationof the six-monthly gas price adjustment mechanism, however, has been
inconsistent. An independent regulatory regime for the oil and gas sectors was implemented in year
2000, and Oil & Gas Regulatory Authority (OGRA) was established. Since then, regulatory functions
have been gradually transferred to OGRA, and the Ministry o f Petroleumand Natural Resources has been
focusing on policy-formulation. OGRA i s becoming fully operational, has issued tariff rules and licenses,
but does not have the authority to set retail tariffs. The Government did adopt a formula-based gas
pricing framework in March 2001, under which six-monthly producer and consumer price adjustments
were envisaged and financial subsidies (defined as the difference between the average cost of supply and
consumer price) were to be gradually phased out, thereby increasing the government's Gas Development
Surcharge (GDS) revenues. The Bank's recent Oil and Gas Sector review highlighted that the
beneficiaries o f the subsidy are not the poor. Implementation o f this gas price adjustment mechanism,
however, has been inconsistent; three out o f seven semi-annual adjustments have been missed, subsidies
have not been phased out, and structural reformo f household gas tariff i s yet to take place.

32.      Pakistan's privatizationprogramhas continued to advance at a reasonablepaceduring the
last two years. Despite a difficult international environment, the program made headway by targeting
domestic investors for smaller transactions and disinvesting government shares instate owned companies
through the stock markets. The Government managed large strategic transactions with the sale o f United
Bank Limited and Habib Bank, as discussed earlier. In addition, a number o f other key transactions
including Pakistan State Oil, KESC, Faisalabad Electricity Supply Company and Jamshoro Company
have reached advanced stages o f privatization. Sale o f the Government's downstream company (Palustan
State Oil, PSO) to a strategic investor is also probable in the near future. While the technical work has
been completed, the Government's concern about the strategic importance o f the enterprise still needs to
be resolved. Progress has also been made in the privatization o f State assets, by disposing o f LPG
businesses, selling State shares inpetroleum concessions, and very successful, IPOs o f the National Bank
o f Pakistan, Oil and Gas Development Corporation (OGDC), Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC),
Palustan International Airlines (PIA), and Palustan Petroleum Limited. Based on these successful initial
public offerings, the Privatization Commission intends to take a similar route for the sale o f minority
shares through stock markets for a few other transactions such as K o t Addu Power Company.

33.      The Government implemented a comprehensive program of trade reforms, key steps of
which were supported under the Structural Adjustment Operations I and 11. Currently, the
maximum tariff rate i s 25%, down from 30% in FY02, and 65% and 125% respectively in 1995196 and
 1990/91. The number of slabs has been reduced to only 4, i.e. 5%, lo%, 20% and 25%. The effective
tariff rate, defined as collection o f net customs duties relative to dutiable imports, declined from 73% in
 1990-91 to 16% in 2002-03. The total number o f tariff lines with specific tariffs has also declined in


                                                       11

recent years. There are now 43 lines with specific rates, down from 103 tariff lines inthe 1995 schedule.
The specific tariffs that were formerly levied on a wide range o f alcoholic beverages, scrap metals, and
synthetic textile inputs have been converted into ad valorem tariffs, as have specific tariffs on a few
isolated tariff lines such as business forms, film and postage stamps. At the same time, ad valorem tariffs
on edible oils have been convertedinto specific tariffs.

34.     Agricultural sector reform has continued to advance.                  Palustan's I-PRSP and PRSP
highlighted the key role o f apculture in poverty reduction and the critical importance o f water for the
sector. Non-tariff barriers to private sector participation in agricultural trade have been removed. A
strong agricultural reform program i s also under way, with technical and financial support from the Asian
Development Bank. As part of its measures to deregulate the sector, the government has attempted to
abolish restrictions on the internal movement (inter-provincial and inter-district) o f agricultural
commodities, including wheat. However, there has been some backtracking on this front, as provinces
sought to curb fi-ee movement o f wheat between districts and provinces. The government continues to
intervene inthe market, particularly wheat markets, by purchasing through Palustan Agricultural Storage
and Services Corporation (PASSCO) and provincial Food Departments. The government reform agenda
envisages limiting the role o f the government to management o f the strategic emergency reserves on a
commercial and cost-effective basis. Thus, in subsequent years, the public food system will procure and
sell a declining amount until it reaches a minimum emergency reserve stock level. Reforms have also
started in sugar marketing and processing, with farmers in sugar mill zones no longer required to sell
sugarcane to the mills intheir area, and the lifting o f restrictions on the production, marketing, and export
of brown sugar. Most subsidies on agricultural inputs and outputs have been abolished, except some ad
hoc subsides in favor o f PASSCO and Trading Company o f Palustan (TCP) for wheat and sugar exports,
and implicit subsidies for canal water and fertilizer. To encourage private sector participation inthe seeds
market, no new subsidies have been granted to public seed production or marketing companies. Inline
with the ongoing dialogue with the ADB, the government will take action to sustain the progress already
made, take corrective actions where needed and implement reforms that are still on the reformagenda.

35.     The government has also moved in the direction o f phasing out commodity price supports and
subsidies for inputs. The Ministry for Food, Agriculture and Livestock (MINFAL,) has made policy
announcements that ensure gradual movement o f procurement prices o f various commodities to market
clearing prices. For wheat, the basis for the procurement price will be international reference price
(export and import prices depending on the expodimport need o f the year), with the aim to phase out
producer and consumer subsidies. For cotton, export parity prices will be used as a basis for procurement
price while there will be n o procurement price for sugar and rice.

36.      Irrigation i s crucial to Pakistan's agriculture, and the government is working towards
developing a consensus on an overall water sector strategy. Ninety percent o f apcultural output i s
dependent on irrigation. However, Pakistan faces major water and drainage issues that have serious
social, economic and environmental implications.           These include (i)low efficiency o f water use;
(ii)environmental sustainability problems     -- large areas waterlogged and saline with low crop yields;
lack of a drainage master plan and a "drainage accord" amongst the provinces; environmental water flow
requirements for the Indus delta unprotected; dilapidated state o f irrigation system due to inadequate
O&M; (iii)    depleting storage capacity; (iv) growing competition and disputes among the riparian
provinces, which warrant strengthening o f Indus River SystemAuthority (IRSA); and (v) lack o f strategic
planning capacity. The PRSP highlights the importance o f a balanced Government policy response to
address issue o f both supply and demand management and envisages a substantial increase inwater sector
expenditures from 0.4% o f GDP inFY03 to 1.1% o f GDP inFY07.

37.      To address water sector issues that lie within the federal domain, GOP i s supporting investments
in storage, systemrehabilitation and water conservation, as well as encouraging policy and institutional



                                                      12

reforms by the provinces. Recently a Parliamentary Committee supported by a Technical Committee has
been established to, inter alia, help develop consensus on a National Irrigation Water Strategy; and to
improve the working o f IRSA.

38.      Governance reforms have continued to advance. Recognizing that problems o f weak
governance and high levels o f corruption have been at the heart o f Pakistan's poverty and development
challenges, the government made improving government and public sector performance a central element
o f its poverty reduction strategy.       As outlined in the National Anti-Corruption Strategy (2003), the
government has recognized that its approach needs to be comprehensive, including awareness-building,
strengthened accountability mechanisms, and improved management to reduce the need and opportunities
for corruption. Beginning in 1999, the government launched far-reaching governance reforms, including:
(i)reforms inpublic financial management and procurement to increase fiscal transparency and
accountability; (ii)   restructuring o f the Central Board o f Revenue to strengthen tax administration; (iii)         a
devolution initiative aimed at improving the delivery o f public services by creating more accountable
local governments; and (iv) reform o f the civil service to improve incentives and accountability.

39.      The government's reform program in public financial management has advanced in a
number of key areas:

     1   Accountingand FinancialReporting. The Controller General of Accounts (CGA) organization
         has been strengthened and annual final accounts for the Federal Government have been produced
         within six months of year-end. Data reliability has improved so that monthly and quarterly
         Federal reports are posted on the web and budget execution data i s sent to ministries by mid-
         month for reconciliation. The medium-term objective i s to adopt a new public chart o f accounts
         and financial reporting requirements under a new computerized accounting system supported by
         the Bank-fundedProject for Improvement inFinancial Reporting and Auditing (PIFRA).6

     1   ExternalAuditing. There has been considerable progress inimproving the timeliness o f audits
         over the past two years with audit reports starting to become available within six months o f the
         end o f the fiscal year. An Annual Audit Programthat sets out specific goals and targets has been
         published, and the Auditor General o f Palustan (AGP) has recently begun the process o f
         recruiting over 800 qualified auditors to conduct audits o f local governments.

     1   Legislative Oversight. A key element o f the govemment's strategy is to revitalize transparency
         and effective legislative oversight through the Public Accounts Committees (PACs) o f the
         National and Provincial Assemblies, which review the findings o f audit reports. The ad hoc
         PACs, which were formed during the military government, are now being replaced by PACs
         under the auspices o f the newly elected national and provincial assemblies.                     The Federal
         government and the four provincial governments have now reconstituted the PACs. A high
         priority for the future will be to devise a strategy for addressing the backlog o f unreviewed
         reports (starting from the most current year) while focusing on significant findings.

38.      Progress in addressing the serious shortcomings in public procurement identified in the
2000 CPAR was limited,untilrecently. The Public Procurement Regulatory Authority was created in
2002 through a Presidential Ordinance, with the powers to formulate new legislation on public
procurement applicable to all federal government and public sector procurement.                       There was little


 PIFRA implementationwas initially slow but has recentlyaccelerated,with the successfullaunch of four computerizedDistrict
Accounting Offices. Basedon this progress, work has begun on a follow-on PIFRA I1project, which will extend the upgraded
accounting systems at the District level.

progress in drafting new legislation until recently.                  The Federal Government has issued Public
Procurement Rules 2004 through a Gazette Notification, which will apply to all new tenders starting in
FY05. These rules supersede all other procurement rules and are to be followed by all the Federal
Government departmentdagencies and public sector corporations.                          At the provincial level, the
Government o f NWFP has adopted a new procurement ordinance and i s in the process o f developing
modem rules, which are expected to be promulgated inthe coming months.

39.       Pakistanhasmadegoodprogressinstrengtheningits anti-money laundering(AML)regime
inboththe bankingand non-bank financialsectors. Inaddition to freezing suspicious accounts inthe
wake of September 11, the State Bank o f Palustan (SBP) reinforced its Prudential Regulation on
prevention o f money laundering and other unlawful trade and activities in 2002. In January 2003, the
Cabinet approved amendments to the Anti-Terrorism Act o f 1997 declaring the laundering o f terrorist
funds and fundraisingby terrorists to be illegal. A newAML-specific piece o flegislationhas been drafted
and i s expected to be enacted in2004.

40.       Under Pakistan's devolution initiative, the main responsibility for delivery of key social
services, such as education, health, and water supply and sanitation, now rests with provincialand
localgovernments. As a result, the federal government share o f total expenditures insocial sectors such
as education and health i s quite limited (approximately 12% each)'.                 The bulk o f these expenditures i s
now part o f district budgets. Functional reassignments have been accompanied by major political,
administrative, and fiscal reforms. The new local government political structure consists o f 6,458 new
elected local (district, tehsil, and union) governments, with new electoral arrangements, and rules for
government formation and dismissal. A significant achievement o f the system i s the large increase in
women's participation in the political process. Administrative reforms include the creation o f district
governments divided into eleven departments, and the District Coordination Officer (DCO) established as
the highest-ranlung civil servant inthe district.

41.       There has been some progress in implementing civil service reforms. The Government
recognizes the importance o f improving the quality o f the civil service in order to increase the
effectiveness o f its poverty reduction programs and set out an ambitious agenda o f restructuring,
recruitment reform, enhanced training, and pay and pension reform. Reforms in the promotion system
have been introduced to make evaluations more objective, increase transparency inpromotion, and to link
promotion to higher grades to required training. Major pay and pension reforms were instituted in
January 2002, which restored about 75% o f the lost purchasing power o f wages (pay and pensions were
last increased in 1994). Further phases of pay reform were also implemented in the form o f across-the-
board 15% salary increases in July 2003 and July 2004 respectively. These increases have improved
compensation somewhat, but do not address the problem that the wage structure remains severely
compressed. Presently, the compression ratio (of top to bottom salaries) i s l:lO, as compared to 1:46 in
the 1960s.' The higher echelons of public servants have significantly lower compensation than
comparators, malung it difficult to recruit and retain high-caliber staff. The government has constituted a
Pay and Pensions Committee to analyze options for further pay and pensions reforms, and the committee
i s expected to submit its recommendations by January 2005.

                       111. PAKISTAN'SPOVERTYREDUCTIONSTRATEGY


42.      The positive developments o f the past few years have now laid the foundations for accelerating
poverty reduction inPalustan. Looking forward, the main objectives o f the Government o f Pakistan are to
achieve and sustain a higher growth path while maintaining macroeconomic stability, translate this higher
growth into lower poverty, and bridge the social gap. The Government's Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper (PSRP) for 2002/03 to 2007/08', completed inDecember 2003, provides the overall framework for
consolidating and advancing reforms towards these goals. The Bank-Fund Joint Staff Assessment (JSA),
discussed by the Board on March 11, 2004, endorsed the PRSP and indicated it provides a good policy
framework for the implementationo f a strong reformprogram, which can translate into the Government's
ambitious development goals and thus accelerate progress towards the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs).

43.       The PRSP i s a comprehensive strategy for addressing poverty in its various dimensions. It
emphasizes policies to sustain rapid growth as the main vehicle for poverty reduction and i s grounded on
four pillars: (i)achieving sustained high and broad-based economic growth, focusing particularly on the
rural economy, while maintaining macroeconomic stability; (ii)         improving governance and consolidating
devolution, both as a means o f delivering better development results and ensuring social and economic
justice; (iii)investing in human capital, with a renewed emphasis on effective delivery o f basic social
services; and (iv) targeting the poor and vulnerable, to bring the marginalized sections o f the population
and backward regions into the mainstream o f development, and to make marked progress in reducing
existing inequalities. A summary o f Government's key actions to implement the PRSP over the next
three years, a subset o f key reforms inthe PRSP, i s attached inAnnex B."

44.       The PRSP focuses on accelerating poverty reduction and improving social indicators through
rapid, private-sector and export-led growth and more effective and equitable delivery o f health, water and
sanitation, and education services. The main thrust o f the PRSP i s on a set o f second-generation structural
reforms to reduce the cost o f doing business and increase productivity, and thus encourage increased
private investment and growth. Because most o f the poor in Pakistan live in rural areas, the PRSP
includes a rural development strategy, which emphasizes reforms and scaled up investments in
infrastructure. This i s expected to improve performance not only o f agriculture but also o f the non-farm
 sector, which increasingly i s providing job opportunities for the large agricultural workforce. Over the
medium and long-run, however, the key source o f poverty reduction and employment is expected to be
rapid growth andjob creation inthe manufacturingand service sectors, which are already respondingwell
to economic reforms.

45.       Improving governance i s critical to poverty reduction. Indeed, research indicates that per capita
incomes and the quality o f governance are strongly correlated across countries."             While there has been
considerable progress made in this regard, the PRSP states that improving governance remains a priority
 for the Government o f Pakistan. The PRSP builds on the positive developments o f the past three years
 and outlines an ambitious governance agenda, which includes measures to advance financial management
 and procurement reforms, accelerate police reforms and improve citizens' access to justice, improve the
 functioning o f the civil service, increase transparency o f policy making and improve public
 accountability. These measures are expected to contribute to an improved investment climate and thus
 contribute to faster growth and poverty reduction. The PRSP also outlines critical next steps to advance

fiscal and administrative devolution, which are expected to improve delivery o f key public services and
empower local governments to respond to local development priorities.

46.       Pakistan's social indicators lag well behind those o f countries at comparable levels o f income.
Evenwhen growth is rapid, the progress on improving social indicators has been limited. Achieving the
MDGs on education and health, and Pakistan's ability to accelerate growth and income poverty, are
dependent on the Government's success in increasing enrollments, reducing child and maternal mortality,
and making rapid progress in improving social indicators in rural areas and for females. On the other
hand, more rapid growth can translate (through increased tax revenues) into increased resources that can
fund additionalpublic expenditures on health, education, and water and sanitation. The thrust o fthe PRSP
i s to substantially increase budget allocations for these key sectors, and complement these actions with
civil service, administrative, and functional reforms to improve the effectiveness o f public delivery. The
strategy also includes stepping up the evaluation o f the services provided.

47.       Inaddition to efforts to increase and sustain broad-basedgrowth, and accelerate progress towards
reaching the MDGs, the Government plans to strengthen special programs to alleviate poverty o f its most
vulnerable groups. The PRSP includes targeted interventions for the vulnerable and the poorest o f the
poor in Pakistan. A number o f programs already exist inPalustan, including provision of micro-finance
to generate self-employment opportunities; public works program to provide temporary and permanent
employment and SME growth at local level; cash transfer systems (Zakat, food support) to protect
vulnerable people against negative shocks; and reforms in pensions to ensure old age benefits, while
safeguarding fiscal sustainability.

A. PRSP Targets andAlignmentwith the MDGs

48.       The PRSP's targets are fully aligned with the MDGs (see Table 2). Growth is projected to
accelerate to over 6% per year and remain broad based, and as a result poverty i s projected to decline to
28% by 2005-06, down from 32% in 2000-01. The literacy rate o f 15-24 year olds i s projected to
increase to 59.5%, from 58% in 2000-01. Between 2000-01 and 2005-06, it i s expected that gross
enrollmentrates will increase from 87% to 104%, infant mortality rate will decline from 77% to 63%, and
the proportion o f fully immunized children aged 12-23 months will rise from 53% to 82%.12




   Efforts to develop consensus on the baseline for critical education indicators are still underway and require urgent resolution.
For many o f these indicators (e.g. on education and health), the PIHS represents a reliable source, especially since it is
representative at both the national and provincial levels.

B. The Strategy

49.         Pillar One: Accelerating economic growth while maintaining macroeconomic stability.
Since the mid 1990s, successive governments have transformed a closed, heavily regulated, public-sector
driven economy into a more open, private-sector driven one. This involved external trade liberalization,
domestic liberalization o f output and input markets, opening most sectors o f the economy to private
activity, and getting the government out o f productive and marketing activities. While some o f these
reforms were launched in the 1990s, the pace o f reform accelerated considerably after 1999. The PRSP
now sets the broad policy framework for a private-sector led economy, and outlines policy reforms and
investments to accelerate growth.

50.          Rapid economic growth, by bolstering incomes and raising employment, i s expected to be the
main engine for poverty reduction. To generate rapid growth, of 6% or more per year, as envisaged inthe
PRSP, the strategy projects a substantial increase in private sector investment and the continued
expansion o f private sector activity. T o increase private investment, the PRSP outlines a set o f structural
reforms to increase productivity and reduce the cost o f doing business in Pakistan. It also envisages a
significant      increase in public development spending in critical infrastructure, which i s expected to help
crowd in private investment. The second-generation measures in the PRSP include financial sector
reforms, labor reforms to increase flexibility in the labor market and create jobs, deregulation to reduce


                                                                     17

red tape, telecommunications reforms to increase teledensity, privatization to improve efficiency,
infrastructure reforms and investments to address shortages inthe transport, irrigation, and energy sectors,
and a rural development strategy focused on water sector investments and reforms to accelerate growth in
rural areas.

51.      Many of the Government's PRSP reforms are cross-cutting in nature, and thus are expected to
have an economy-wide impact on all sectors.                     For instance, policies for macroeconomic stability,
telecommunications liberalization, energy sector reforms, investments in roads and ports, financial sector
reforms, and deregulation and labor market reforms, are all expected to improve the investment climate
for all sectors o f economic activity and thus benefit the Pahstani economy broadly. Measures to improve
enrolments and literacy, and the fuller inclusion o f women inproductive activities, discussed under other
pillars o f the PRSP, can also be expected to have a cross-cutting impact on growth through productivity.
Measures to reduce corruption, increase accountability o f civil servants, devolution, and reforms in the
justice and police sectors, are all expected to improve welfare o f Pahstani citizens directly, but also to
reduce transactions costs for businesses. It i s expected that as a result of these measures growth will
remain at over 6% through 2007/08, driven by continued rapid growth in manufacturing and services
(Table 3).

 52.      Other measures are expected to have a more focused impact on particular sectors and/or goals.
For instance, improved management of water resources and increased investments in irrigation are
 expected to have a focused impact on rural and agricultural performance, by reducing vulnerability to
 drought, reducing environmental degradation, and enhancing agricultural diversification and productivity.
 Given that output and inputmarkets and external trade are, for the most part, de-regulated, land and water
management issues are now where policymakers' attention i s expected to ~OCUS.'~As a result o f the
 combined impact o f sector-specific and cross-cutting measures in the PRSP, growth in agriculture i s
 expected to accelerate moderately, to 4.5% by the end o f the PRSP period. Given agriculture's past
performance, with growth rates of around 4% over the 1990s, the projected acceleration o f growth to
 4.5% i s expected to be feasible (Table 3).

 53.      The effectiveness o f structural reforms will be limited if macroeconomic stability i s not
 maintained. While the Government i s expected not to seek a successor PRGF arrangement with the IMF,
 itrecognizes that the "asset poor" are the first victims o f inflation and other symptoms o fmacroeconomic
 instability. The PRSP identifies and outlines a good framework for reducing threats to macroeconomic
 stability, namely: (i)   the overall fiscal deficit; (ii) mobilization; (iii) or implicit liabilities
                                                              revenue                       explicit
 of the budget; (iv) performance of key public enterprises, inparticular the power sector; and (v) the stock
 and terms o fpublic debt.


 l3While land redistribution could increase the poverty-reducing impact of growth in agriculture, a political consensus for its
 implementation has not yet developed inPakistan.




                                                                 18

54.      The PRSP's medium-term fiscal fi-amework balances the need for increased social- and poverty-
related spending and debt reduction. The overall deficit excluding grants i s projected to be contained
between 3% and 4% of GDP, and total public debt i s projected to fall to 66% o f GDP; external public debt
would fall to 29% of GDP by 2007/08. This debt reduction path would result in a continued reduction o f
fiscal  and particularly external vulnerabilities. Within this framework, social- and poverty-related
spending i s raised by 1.4 percentage points to 6.8% o f GDP in2007/08, and PSDP spending i s raisedby
1.1percentage points to 5.5% of GDP in2007/08, while overall expenditures stays flat inpercent o fGDP.
The fiscal space for this i s to be created by an increase in domestic revenue, lower interest expenditures,
and compressing other expenditures, notably transfers to public sector enterprises, inparticular the power
sector. In FY03, the power sector's claim on the budget was equivalent to 1.8% o f GDP. The
government's commitment to continued fiscal discipline i s embodied in the Fiscal Responsibility and
Debt Limitation (FRDL)Bill, which was presentedto the Parliament inOctober 2003.

55.      A key result of Palustan's successful stabilization program is the prospect for growing fiscal
space to fund the Poverty Reduction Strategy and at the same time undertake new public investment. If
current favorable policies are maintained, the PRSP indicates that lower interest rates, increasedrevenues,
and continued efforts to improve the performance o f key utilities could further expand fiscal space for the
government. External financing on concessional terms and the projected availability o f grants o f over 1%
of GDP further provide the scope for additional funding for PRSP and other priority expenditures. All
told, this increased fiscal space could allow non-interest, non-defense spending to rise by as much as 3-
4% of GDP by 2006107, permitting considerable increases in public investment and social sector
spending.

56.      Pahstan's PRSP explicitly recognizes the linkages between the environment and poverty through
the impact o f environmental degradation on livelihoods, health and vulnerability. The principal concerns
with respect to the livelihoods o f the poor relate to water-logging, salinizationand rangeland degradation
that diminish productivity and incomes. It i s estimated that some 13% o f the irrigated area i s severely
waterlogged and 14% i s saline, while up to 80% o f rangelands are degraded. The health o f the poor i s
severely impacted by environmental factors that are estimated to account for more than 20% o f the burden
of disease. Vulnerability to natural disasters i s important both as a cause and effect o f poverty, with
persistent droughts in recent years cutting agricultural production by approximately 12%, leading to
devastating impacts on livelihoods o f the poor. Many aspects o f the Government's reform agenda can be
expected to have positive environmental outcomes including improved water management to address
water-logging and salinization, and oil and gas reforms which will lead to improved access to cleaner
fuels with health benefits in the form o f reduced risks o f respiratory infection. There remain, however,
significant areas o f environmental concern in which more concerted action i s required, including efforts
to reduce the incidence o f waterborne disease through improvements in water supply and sanitation,
initiatives to improve the management o f rangelands, and measures to better address the growing burden
of industrial and urban pollution. While the legislative framework for environmental management i s
largely in place, the PRSP recognizes the urgent need to strengthen the capacity o f the institutions
charged with its implementation.

57.      Pillar Two: Improvinggovernance and devolution. The PRSP recognizes that continuing to
improve governance in Palustan matters critically for economic growth and the development o f human
capital. Key elements of the Government's strategy include accelerating civil service reform, furthering
devolution, improving access to justice, police reforms, accelerating improvementsinpublic procurement
and financial management, and additional measures to accelerate progress on fiscal and financial
transparency and reduce opportunities for corruption.




                                                       19

58.      Regarding civil service reform, the government's strategy highlights a flatter structure, merit-
based recruitment and promotion criteria, performance based compensation, and incentives to innovation.
There is also a proposal to restructure the civil services by creating five new services -- the Federal Civil
Service, the National Executive Service, and the Provincial, District, and Tehsil Services -- in order to
break free o f some o f the structural rigidities resulting from the current cadre system. While both the
Federal and Provincial Civil Services are expected to continue to be divided into occupational groups
below grade 18, the National Executive Service (NES) would be an elite, better paid All Palustan Service
comprising a pool o f officers selected on merit from amongst officers o f the Federal, Provincial and
District Services for critical policy and management positions beginning at Grade 19. The government
also indicates its intention to implement next steps o fpay and pensions reform.

59.      Devolution i s a key element o f the GOP's strategy for improving service delivery by changing the
relationship between decision-makers, service providers, and citizens in fundamental ways to improve
access to and quality o f service delivery. Overall, significant progress has been made in establishing the
political, fiscal, and administrative institutional structure o f local government. Over the next two/three
years, the government intends to focus on administrative and fiscal decentralization. The transfer o f staff
currently managed by provincial governments to districts and creation o f a District Civil Service i s
discussed inthe PRSP. The PRSP also includes a commitment to transfer an increased share o f the fiscal
space generated at the federal level to provincial governments, and to restructure the federal govemment
and transfer functions to the provinces. The upcoming National Finance Commission (NFC) award will
offer an opportunity for the federal government to transfer a greater share o f the divisible pool o f taxes to
provinces, and it i s expected that provincial governments would subsequently also pass on the additional
transfers to lower levels o f government through the Provincial Finance Commission (PFC) mechanism.
The expansion inthe coverage o f the General Sales Tax (GST) on services will also be an important step
towards correctingthe large vertical imbalances inPalustan's fiscal federalism structure.

60.      The PRSP indicates the government's commitment to accelerate reforms in public procurement.
In May 2002, the President promulgated an Ordinance creating the Public Procurement Regulatory
Authority (PPRA) responsible `Tor improving governance, management, transparency, accountability
and quality of public procurement".         The PRSP refers to forthcoming improvements in the legal
framework for public procurement at the federal level, which would improve the transparency, cost
effectiveness, and quality o fpublic expenditures.

61.      In financial management, the Govemment's plan is to continue to pursue a comprehensive
strategy to improve public accounting and auditing. The two functions have now been separated through
the promulgation o f the Controller General of Accounts Ordinances. With the introduction o f a New
System o f Financial Control and Budgeting, significant spending powers are now delegated to the
administrative heads o f spending agencies, thus impacting on improvements in budget execution. The
thrust o f the Government o f Palustan's financial management reforms, however, rely on the widespread
implementation o f an automated accounting system (under PIFRA), which will improve the transparency
in the government's financial        administration as well as the timeliness, accuracy, reliability,
comprehensiveness o f financial and fiscal data and information. Fiscal Monitoring Committees at the
Federal and Provincial levels prepare, reconcile, and publishupdated quarterly consolidated data verified
by the Controller General o f Accounts.         T h i s will help address the problem o f unreconciled and
unidentified expenditures and thus enhance the reliability o f financial and fiscal reports. Next steps also
identified in the PRSP include accelerating PIFFU implementation, strengthening accounting expertise,
and buildingcapacity o f PAC secretariats.

62.      Pillar Three: Investing in human capital. InPalustan, social development lagged even when
growth was robust and the incidence o f income poverty declined. The Government's PRSP acknowledges
that without a considerable improvement in social indicators, including for women, Palustan will be


                                                        20

unable to sustain highrates o f economic growth. Educationi s acknowledged as the most important factor
distinguishing the poor from the non-poor. The PRSP, therefore, includes increased allocations for
education, health, water and sanitation, and rural infrastructure.

63.     The PRSP recognizes that much of the responsibility in the actual delivery o f services now lies
with provincial and local governments. Because o f the ongoing devolutionprocess, there is some degree
of overlap and mismatch between levels o f government regardingthe responsibilities for program design
and delivery o f services. In its PRSP, the government pledges to correct this mismatch gradually. The
expected increase (through the NFC and PFC mechanisms) in the share o f fiscal resources available for
provincial and local governments to carry out these (and other) expenditure priorities and the gradual
correction o f vertical imbalances through the tax system, will contribute to improving availability o f
resources for service delivery at provincial and local level.        Over time, it i s expected that federal
ministries o f education and health will gradually focus on overall policy making and monitoring and
evaluation.

64.     The government's national education policy underscores increased enrolments in public sector
schools, eliminating urban-rural and gender imbalances, and improving quality o f education at all levels.
The PRSP indicates that responsibilities of the Federal Ministry of Educationwill be gradually refocused
to include curriculum reform, and quality assurance such as teacher accreditation and the establishment o f
the National Education Assessment System. Governance o f education i s also indicated as an important
priority o f the Government. The Government i s in the process o f creating a system o f educational
governance by empowering the local governments and employing civil society in the preparation,
execution, and supervision o f the schemes for the education sector.

65.      The national Education Sector Reform Action Plan 2001-2005 (ESR) and the Education For All
Action Plan 2001-2015 (EFA) form the centerpiece o f the PRSP education strategy.                The primary
components o f the ESR strategy consist of: (i)     removing gender and access gaps, (ii)   improving access
and equity for quality universal primary education, (iii)         increasing literacy through adult literacy
programs, (iv) supporting technical education in secondary schools, (v) improving quality o f education,
(vi) establishing public-private partnerships to increase access, and (vii) mainstreaming Madrassahs. The
key elements o f the EFA include universalprimary education and quality education for all, attaining 86%
literacy rate for both genders, and establishing quality technical and s h l l development programs.

66.      Another significant process initiated by the Federal Government i s the revision o f the curriculum
of grades 1-12, a revision that has been initiated after a gap o f several years. This effort has resulted in
the re-notification o f the curriculum for sciences and social sciences, and new textbooks have been, and
are being, developed by the provinces on the basis o f this revised curriculum. There has not yet been a
comprehensive assessment of the revisions and changes brought through these revisions. However,
Government will reinforce efforts to revise the curriculum with professional support.

67.      Inhealth, the PRSPrecognizes the needto increase financing andenhance efficiency of spending
through organizational and management reforms. Resources to the health sector are to be more than
doubled over the next three years. Furthermore, the PRSP focuses on reorganization o f district health
structures, strengthening o f district and tehsil hospitals, improving hospital administration through greater
autonomy, and regulation o f the private sector. On the programmatic front, the strategy prioritizes control
of communicable diseases, reproductive health, child health and nutrition. It goes beyond the National
Health Policy in the important areas o f reproductive health and nutrition through development o f
community midwifery, improvement o f emergency obstetric care, behavior change and communication
and various nutrition related initiatives. Inhealth, the Federal Ministrywould focus on development o f a
disease surveillance system, which would include the Health Management Information System and on
gradually devolving preventative care programs, which would increasingly be designed and not only

implementedby provincial and local governments. The Government may also sponsor a limited number
o f perfonnance-based grants to provincial and local governments to encourage the achievement o f
national goals, such as the PRSP outcomes.

68.     The PRSP acknowledges that the achievement o f key PRSP goals in health depends also on
policies and developments outside of the health sector such as literacy, access to drinlung water and
adequate sanitation. The PRSP acknowledges the problems in delivery o f basic municipal services in
urban areas, and discusses plans for specific initiatives such as that for a program to regularize and
develop packages for unauthorizedunserved settlements.

69.     The Government has made progress in improving the delivery o f family planning services, and
the PRSP indicates that this will continue to be a priority area. While fertility levels are starting to
decline, there continues to be significant differences in fertility and contraceptive use across income and
education levels. Expenditure levels inpopulation-related programs have increased substantially over the
past two years, and the Population Policy approved by Cabinet in 2002 calls for specific, monitorable
actions and outcomes which, to be implemented, would support improvements in family planning
services considerably.

70.     Pillar Four: Targeting the poor and the vulnerable. Targeting the poor and the vulnerable
through safety net programs i s one of the integral pillars o f the strategy. It encompasses the expansion o f
microfinance programs, strengthening public works programs like Khushal Pakistan, improving transfer
programs like Zakat and food support and reforming pension systems for the formal private sector. The
Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund (PPAF), supported by the World Bank, i s a key element o f the
Government's anti-poverty programs. It i s an innovative model o f public-private partnership and includes
three windows through which financial assistance i s provided: (i)       a line o f credit for the expansion o f
targeted micro-credit programs; (ii)   grants and loans for community physical infrastructure on a cost-
sharing basis, mostly for clean water and irrigation purposes that are community identified and managed;
and (iii)grants to strengthen and build the institutional capacity o f partner organizations and
communities.

71.      There are several safety net programs in Pakistan, which have as their objective improving the
welfare o f the poor and vulnerable groups. The programs include cash transfers through the Zakat and
Bait-ul-Maal programs, in kind assistance through, for example, the school meals program (Tawana
Pakistan), and programs to reduce the prevalence of child labor (stipendshchools for workmg children
and their families).    In addition to cash and in kind transfers, Khushali Bank, and various provincial
programs assist low-income households to obtain loans to improve community or individual welfare. As
natural disasters, such as droughts are major calamities for the poor, programs to protect individuals
against drought are also under consideration. There are also schemes, under the Bait-ul Maal, to help
individuals deal with catastrophic illness. The Government i s concerned about improving the welfare o f
the disabled in Pakistan and i s in the process o f developing an implementation plan for improving the
conditions for disabled inthe country.

72.      The safety net programs noted above uses different sources o f financing, different levels o f
benefits, methods of targeting, and program administration. Although an independent review o f some o f
these programs has been conducted, the PRSP envisages a comprehensive report that would review the
financing, targeting efficiency, adequacy, and administration o f select safety net programs that would be
useful for improving the efficiency of public expenditures on safety net programs to reach the poor, or
other target groups. This review would help the Government identify key measures for improving the
effectiveness o f its safety net programs.

C. Monitoringo f PRSPOutcomes

73.      Improving the quality and effectiveness o f economic and social policies in Palustan will require
increasing the timeliness and reliability o f information available for policy malung and for assessing
development outcomes. Significant progress has been made since the I-PRSP. The PRSP outlines a
monitoring framework, which includes the indicators to be monitored, identification o f relevant data
sources, and institutional arrangements for the monitoring system and for providing feedback to
policymakers. A collaborative process, involving federal and provincial ministries, donors, and civil
society, conducted during 2002, resulted in the selection o f appropriate monitorable intermediate and
outcome indicators. Sources for these indicators include existing data sources, as well as planned annual
surveys for traclung intermediate indicators related to access, usage, and satisfaction with public services
at the district level. The PRSP signals the Govemment's intention to rely increasingly on thirdparty data
sources, so as to minimize the reliability problems associated. with administrative data reported by
implementing agencies. On the expenditure side, a quarterly traclung and reporting system for poverty-
related expenditures has been implemented and will be expanded to include the new PRSP expenditure
categories.

74.      Poverty outcomes will be monitored on the basis o f the Pakistan Integrated Household
Survey/Household Income and Expenditure Survey (PIHS/HIES).               A new round of this survey is
expected to be launched in2004, and poverty estimates are expected in 2005-06. The PRSP also reports
encouraging progress in planning and implementing a modified Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire
survey (CWIQ) to track intermediate indicators. A pilot o f this survey has been successfully completed,
and the first full survey i s planned for August 2004. Implementingthis survey and institutionalizing it on
an annual cycle will provide a valuable database for traclung the impact o f reforms at the district level, to
provide timely feedback for policy implementation that i s expected to occur to a large degree at the
district level as devolution takes hold.

75.       The success of a monitoring system-and    its impact on the policy process--critically depends on
the institutional arrangements and the capacity within these institutions. Progressing from the I-PRSP, the
PRSP lays out an institutional setup inmore concrete terms, specifying a general mechanism for tracking
and reporting outcomes, coordinated by the national PRSP Secretariat.


                        IV. BANK'S ASSISTANCE PROGRAMINPAKISTAN


76.       The Bank's assistance strategy to Pakistan i s guided by the Bank Group's Country Assistance
Strategy, which was discussed by the Board on June 11, 2002. The CAS laid out a country program in
support o f Palustan's Interim-PRSP. The CAS Progress Report, presented to the Board on April 20,
2004, confirms that the strategy set out inthe 2002 CAS remains valid inlight o f the full PRSP. The CAS
Progress Report provides an update on economic and political developments and describes progress in
implementation o f the country program since that time. Based on the government's strong progress in
implementing reforms and restoring its creditworthiness, the program o f Bank support outlined in the
CAS was proposedto be adjusted to be fully aligned with the PRSP.

77.       Lending for the balance of the CAS period reflects Palustan's continued strong overall progress in
reforms. As discussed inthe CAS Progress report, the lending program will continue to feature a mix o f
policy-based fast disbursing lending, programmatic sector lending, and investment projects. Adjustment
operations will continue to account for a large share o f new commitments. Reflecting completion o f the
fullPRSP andPalustan's strongrecordo fimplementingreforms, the PRSCprogramwill take the place of
the series o f one-tranche adjustment credits envisioned inthe CAS.




                                                     23

78.       The program of provincial adjustment credits initiated inthe CAS i s also expected to continue as
these are fully aligned with achieving PRSP objectives at the provincial and local level. Indeed,
improving delivery o f key services by provincial and local governments i s critical for attaining several o f
the MDGs. Provincial and local investment lending will continue to emphasize support for high impact
govemance reforms such as those intax administration and financial management.

Analytical underpinningsof the proposedPRSC

79.       Knowledge partnership i s a core element o f the Bank's assistance to Paki~tan.'~Over the period
FY00-03, a CPAR, a CFAA-I and CFAA-11, a national Public Expenditure Review (PER), a
Development Policy Review (DPR), a Poverty Assessment, a Provincial Finances Report, a PER for
Punjab, an Oil and Gas Sector Review, and a number o f other important policy notes were prepared. In
2004, a policy note, Power for Pakistan, served as the basis for high level dialogue on power sector
reforms. Key additional analytical pieces o f work have been completed in 2004. These include a report
on Devolution and Service Delivery, a Financial Sector Assessment Report, a Rural Factor Markets
Study, and an Economic Report for the Punjab pr~vince.'~These tasks contributed to informing the
policy dialogue and the PRSC reform program.16                         A Gender Assessment, a Strategic Country
Environmental Assessment are under preparation. Inaddition, Economic Reports for North West Frontier
and Sindh provinces, expectedto complement programmatic operations andinvestment loans that support
implementation o f the PRSP at the provincial level, are also under preparation.

80.       The Development Policy Review (2002) identified improving macroeconomic sustainability,
investing in people, monitoring social services, improving rules for inter-governmental fiscal relations,
rationalizing and privatizing banks, and improving the investment climate as the priorities for accelerating
growth and social development in Pakistan. Achieving and sustaining growth of 6% per annum, will
depend in large part on increasing private and public investment, and improving firm productivity.
Sustained growth rates o f 6% per annum, targeted inthe PRSP, are expected to have a strong impact on
poverty reduction. As worldwide experience demonstrates, and as the Poverty Assessment (2002) reveals
in the case of Pakistan, there is a strong positive relationship between growth and poverty. Between
1984-85 and 1990-91, the incidence o f poverty declined substantially in Palustan as a result o f strong
economic growth, but during the latter half o f the 1990s growth slowed down considerably, leading to a
rise in the incidence o f poverty. Volatile agricultural performance over the 1990s, and drought in second
half o f the decade contributed to the rise inrural poverty.

81.        The firms surveyed as part o f the Investment Climate Assessment (2003)'' identified power
supply, telecommunications services, small business access to finance, tax and customs administration,
and the state o f business regulations as the key factors impacting firm-level productivity. Inadequate
power supply, specifically power outages, were highlighted as the major infrastructure bottleneck to
profitability followed by inadequate access to telecom infrastructure, as indicatedby long waiting periods
for getting new telephone connections. Harassment by govemment officials from the tax authorities and
regulatory agencies, particularly by officials from CBR, was mentioned as a particularly serious
impediment to private sector activity.


l4A recent Quality Assurance Group (QAG) assessment ofthe Bank's programo f Analytical and Advisory services for Pakistan
rated the program as Satisfactory and indicated that the country budget resources devoted to analytical work are a clear indication
of the prominent role that the country team assigned to analytical and advisory services inthe overall program.

l5The Devolution Report and the Punjab Economic Report arejoint products o f the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank,
and UK's DFID.
  Three ofthe outputs that underpin this operation, e.g. the DPR, Public Expenditure Review, and CFAA I,were rated by QAG
"Highly Satisfactory".

                                                                24

82.       Private investment mustbe supported by significant improvements inboththe level and quality o f
public expenditures, to overcome gaps inthe delivery o f public goods, including infrastructure, and make
accelerated progress towards the Millennium Development Goals.               The indicative macroeconomic
projections o f the PER (2003) suggest that ifpublic enterprise losses are reduced (by 1.1% o f GDP),
defense spending i s contained (constant at 4 % of GDP), CBR tax revenue increase (by 1.4% o f GDP) and
interest payments decline (by 2.9% of GDP), then the "fiscal space" available for investment in priority
expenditures in health, education, and infrastructure can increase by 3.4% o f GDP between 2001-2 and
2006-07. Efficacy o f public expenditures would require improvements in budgetary and planning
processes, careful screening of projects, strong monitoring and evaluation systems, as well as broader
governance reforms through the strengthening o f the civil service.

83.       Achieving this fiscal space, among others, will depend on power sector reform. As highlightedin
the policy note Powerfor Pakistan (2004), WAPDA's losses arise from the fact that the average per unit
generation cost exceeds the average tariff by 13 percent. WAPDA's financial position deteriorated
significantly between 1995 and 2002, largely due to (i)     the incomplete pass through o f foreign exchange
exposure and power purchase costs o f the P P s that were commissioned during the late 1990s, and to
(ii) increaseincostsofimportedfuel. Reducingcostswillrequiremanagingthegenerationmix
    the
(thermal to hydel/gas); reducing transmission and distribution losses; improving generation efficiency;
managing debt service costs; improving billing and collections; and managing IPPs through possibly
renegotiating the power purchase agreements. In addition, raising and improving the structure o f power
tariffs i s also an important element o f an overall financial recovery program. At present, commercial and
industrial consumers subsidize the household sector; for households, tariff rates are below the average
cost o f supply and significantly below the cost o f service.

84.       Increasing the fiscal space will also require better targeting o f gas subsidies. As outlined in the
Oil and Gas Sector Review (2003), the commercial, industrial, and power consumers subsidize
households and the fertilizer industry,and that these subsidized tariffs do not even cover the cost o f gas as
a commodity. The subsidy to the household sector i s large and poorly targeted, due to the very large first
two slabs o f the retail tariff (0-100, and 100-200 m'). Fewer than 20 percent o f Pakistani households use
natural gas, and these are predominantly urban households. The first slab accounts for some 54 percent o f
the consumers in the winter, and 82 percent in the other months. Given also the increasing block
structure, consumers inhigher slabs still benefit from the subsidized first one, and as a result two-thirds o f
the gas i s sold under the first slab. As a result, the annual economic cost o f the subsidy i s estimated to be
about Rs. 9 billion. In sum, therefore, the gas price subsidy to households primarily benefits higher
income urban families.

85.       As the Poverty Assessment and the recently-completed Devolution Report (2004) note, neither
growth nor increased public expenditures through the Social Action Program have had a long-lasting
impact on improving social indicators in Palustan. In addition to increased budgetary allocations to
health, education, water and sanitation, institutional reform i s the key to improving service delivery.
Palustan's devolution initiative offers the potential for improved outcomes through the increased
accountability o f policy-makers and service providers. Supporting devolution requires that some o f the
increased fiscal space be transferred first from the Federal government to the provinces via the NFC
award (also recommended inthe PER), and from the provinces to local governments via the PFC awards,
as well as through tax reassignments.         However, given the political economy still prevalent at the
provincial and local-government levels, a simple transfer o f resources will not be enough to ensure
improved service delivery.        In addition, the federal government has an important role to play in
encouraging provinces and local governments to meet national PRSP priorities.




                                                        25

86.      In addition to devolution, govemance reforms in the areas of financial management and
procurement are essential for improving the effectiveness and transparency o f public expenditures. As
noted in the CPAR (2000), procurement irregularities have been a significant problem in Pakistan. In
addition, audit o f Bank projects revealed that poor management, inadequate record keeping, inordinate
delays in decision-making and restrictive bidding on contracts had impeded performance and affected
results. A major reason for these problems was the weak regulatory framework that discouraged due
diligence in contract awards and stifled open competition. The report recommends the enactment o f a
modem, transparent public procurement law reflecting international best practice, and the creation o f a
regulatory agency to develop the procurement framework with functions that involve policy,
documentation, and development o f rules.

87.      Improving the effectiveness o f public expenditures also requires reforms to improve the financial
reporting and traclung of expenditures, and to build adequate financial controls at all levels o f
government. The key reform priorities, as identified in the CFAA (2003) include improving financial
reporting through accelerating PIFRA implementation, working towards automating bank and account
reconciliation processes, while as interim measure, strengthening the Fiscal Monitoring Committees to
ensure timely reconciliation, and strengthening intemal controls through the introduction o f CFOs to
assist the Principal Accounting Officers. With regards to extemal auditing, improvements are needed in
the methodology and scope for national, provincial, and district audits, specifically moving from
transaction-based auditing to system-based auditing, and with audit reports focusing more on key issues
and significant irregularities. Finally, and most importantly, effective legislative oversight i s required.
This has been accomplished through the setting up o f Public Accounts Committees and establishing
precedence for open proceedings (to the press and public) o f these committees.               Loolung forward,
providing these committees with the necessary technical support will contribute to their effectiveness.


                                     V. THE PROPOSEDCREDIT

A. The PRSCProgram

88.      The PRSP summarized in Part I11of this program document sets out a 5-year framework for
growth and poverty reduction.18 The Bank-Fund Joint Staff Assessment, discussed by the Board on
March 11, 2004, endorsed the PRSP and indicated that it provides a good policy framework for the
implementation o f a strong reform program, which can translate into the government's ambitious
development goals. The PRSC program i s closely aligned with the Govemment's PRSP and its four
pillars. It supports measures to: (i)accelerate and sustain broad-based growth through an improved
investment climate as the main vehicle to accelerate poverty reduction in Palustan, while continuing to
maintainmacroeconomic stability; (ii)   improve the overall policy framework and increase the fiscal space
available for education, health, water and sanitation and other critical infrastructure, so as to accelerate
progress towards the Millennium Development Goals; (iii)        improve govemance through financial and
procurement reforms and measures to improve transparency and public oversight, and support devolution
through an increased transfer o f resources for provincial and local levels o f government so as to improve
empowerment o f citizens at the local level; and (iv) provide an effective safety net for the poor and
vulnerable.

89.      This PRSC is expected to be the first of a series o f three one-tranche programmatic operations
that would support the next phase o fthe Government of Palustan's medium-termreform program, laidout




  Annex B summarizeskeymilestonesof the Govemment's programfor 2003/04-2005106, as outlinedinthe PRSP.

inthe PRSP. The proposedPRSC programwould monitor the key areas of the PRSP described below,
and would be disbursed against a selected set o f prior actions.

90.      The PRSC, much like the Government's PRSP, would focus on supporting policies that help
sustain rapid, broad-based growth, maintain macroeconomic stability, and provide a national overall
policy and public expenditure framework and incentive structure for accelerating poverty reduction and
improvements in education and health. While the PRSP sets forth an ambitious program o f reforms to
accelerate growth, reduce poverty, and improve social indicators, it does not provide an explicit timeline
for implementation. The preparation o f the PRSC helped in this regard, as the process o f preparing the
Program Matrix of relevant actions and outcomes encouraged a dialogue among various parts o f the
government-and      with nongovernmental stakeholders-that             helped define an implementation plan. It i s
expected that the PRSP Progress Report, expected inearly 2005, will further develop this implementation
plan and inform subsequent PRSCs. Each year's PRSC would be expected to focus on a few particular
areas o f the government's reform program and would be closely aligned with the government's budget
cycle, so as to provide reliable access to program support by the Government on an annual basis.lg

Pillar I:Reformsto AccelerateGrowth and MaintainMacroeconomic Stability

91.      The continuationof a policystance conduciveto macroeconomic stabilityis one of the prior
actions for the PRSC program. A stable macroeconomic environment, with low inflation, a low fiscal
deficit, declining net present value o f debt, and no major external imbalances, i s a sine qua non for
economic growth and poverty reduction. It i s also critical that the level and composition o f expenditure
continues to improve, with increasing resources provided to growth enhancing and poverty reducing
expenditures. This will also include transferring increased resources to, and increasing own revenues of,
provincial and local governments, with which much o f these responsibilities lie. The PRSP's medium-
term macroeconomic framework (Table 4) balances the need for increased social- and poverty related
spending and reduction of the public debt burden. The PRSC program would support the implementation
of this medium-term macroeconomic framework. Satisfactory implementation o f the MF-supported
PRGF was a necessary condition for this PRSC. For subsequent operations, the maintenance of sound
fiscal and monetarypolicies, along with a satisfactory public expenditure profile will be necessary.

92.      The Fiscal Responsibilityand Debt Limitation Bill i s intended to lock in the gains made in
fiscal and debt management over the past 4 years; its submission to the National Assembly i s one o f the
prior actions for PRSC 1. The Bill requires reducing the revenue deficit to zero by June 30, 2008 and
maintaining a surplus thereafter, and reducing total debt to 60 % o f GDP or lower by June 2013. The Bill
protects PRSP expenditures, and the projections contained in the PRSP, are fully consistent with the
Fiscal Responsibility and Debt Limitation Bill.

93.     For macroeconomic consolidation to continue gradually, without compressing expenditures, and
for additional fiscal space for poverty reduction expenditures to be created, it i s important that the tax
effort be strengthened. PRSC 2 i s expected to include a specific trigger in this area, to complement the
reforms and efforts envisaged under the Tax Administration Project, currently under preparation.
Pakistan has a l o w tax-to-GDP ratio, and thus renewed efforts inthis direction are critical. InJune 2000,
a Task Force supported by the Bank, was set up to review the problems o f the Central Board o f Revenue
(CBR). It found Palustan's tax laws complicated and the process o f filing retums and collecting refunds
cumbersome.     Moreover, the system i s characterized by frequently changing and ad hoc legal and
administrative arrangements, which provides opportunities for increased discretion and corruption. Based
on these findings, CBR in November 2001 developed a broad strategy for reforms focusing on:
(i)restructuring o f CBR along functional lines and integration o f income, sales and excise taxes, as well
as providing it with more autonomy to operate and take decisions with respect to hiring, remuneration,
placement, promotion and other day to day tax implementation issues, was made; (ii)       reengineering and
automating business processes and workflows;         (iii)establishing databases for reporting and audit
purposes; (iv) introducing self assessment system for filing o f tax retums; (v) improving services for the
taxpayers; and (vi) strengthening the human resource base. The Govemment also made extensive policy
reforms to broaden the tax base, reduce unjustified exemptions and facilitate dispute resolution process.
CBR has also prepared a comprehensive tax and customs reform strategy with the assistance o f foreign
consultants and through intensive efforts of the reformteam under guidance o fthe Chairman.

94.     As part o f this strategy, the future organizational structure for the administration o f direct taxes
will be based upon a functional approach, and tax administration activities will eventually be collocated
into twelve regional tax offices (RTOs), with extended operations for taxpayer facilitation purposes into
60-75 taxpayer facilitation centers (TFCs). There will also be three large taxpayer offices (LTUs), one o f
which has been established in Karachi, and 6 medium taxpayer units (MTUs), one o f which has been
established in Lahore. These MTUs will become part o f the 12 regional tax offices that will co-locate
sales tax and income tax, providing for greater sharing o f information, resources and removing
duplication o f certain common functions. Insales tax, the project will address the issue o f the limited
number o f registrants and their poor compliance (150,000 unitsregistered out o f a potential o f 800,000 to
1.5 million).   Customs administration reforms will entail moving progressively away from "blanket"
controls and detailed procedures that impact on all or most importers and exporters, to interventions that
are highly targeted towards identified risk shipments, traders and goods. Reforms will also introduce a
risk-based system and provide speedy clearances to those that have proved and maintained their
dependability. Face-to-face contact will be limited and CBR plans to strictly limit access by customs
agents to secure accommodation. Plans call for development o f a system enabling electronic
preparatiodsubmissionof declarations, intemetIED1transmission, selection o f declaration for audit based
on riskanalysis, and electronic assessmenthelease.

95.     The PRSC program would support the implementation of the Government's pro-poor
public expenditure profile stated in the PRSP (Table 5). Comparedto the I-PRSP, the PRSP presents
budget allocations that are better aligned with the desired improvements in social indicators and
specifically the Millennium Development Goals. The share o f PRSP allocations in the total budget (and
GDP) i s projectedto increase from 26% (5.6% o f GDP) in fiscal year 2003-04 to 32% (6.8% o f GDP) in
fiscal year 2007-08.

96.      There is scope to improve the effectiveness and impact of public expenditures, and the
Government intendsto implement a reformprogramto improvePublic ExpenditureManagement.
Currently, the budget formulation and execution processes are undergoing major reforms. A Medium-
Term Budget Framework (MTBF) i s being developed with the assistance o f DFID in health and
population welfare and signifies a major improvement in budgetingprocess. This exercise i s presently
limited to only two sectors, but the government envisages expanding it to other sectors in a phased
manner. In the interim, and to facilitate the MTBF expansion process, the artificial and unwarranted
duality in budget-making has to be removed by integrating the development and recurrent budgets, and
will be a proposed trigger for PRSC 2.20 The implementation o f the New System o f Financial Control
and Budgeting (NSFCB) has also been uneven. Inorder to operationalize the NSFCB the government has
established a Release Committee, which will identify the impediments to the process and suggest steps to
simplify and streamline the release o f funds andmake them consistent withNSFCB. The Committeewill
present its report to the Government by end-July 2004.

97.       To improve the effectiveness and poverty orientation o f development expenditure, the Planning
Commission i s in the process of undertakmg some important measures. The medium-term planning
process i s being reinvigorated. The National Economic Council (NEC) has asked the Commission to
formulate the Tenth Five Year Plan (2004/09), a draft o f which i s expected to be presented to the NECby
M a y 2005. The Plan i s to be prepared with active consultations with stakeholders. To provide better
linkingof Government policies and plans, the Tenth Five Year Plan will establish sectoral polices and
strategies on which Sector InvestmentPrograms (SIPS) will be formulated, along with a Business Plan for
Infrastructure Development. The Plan will come into operation shortly and i s expected to sharpen the
sectoral focus o f the PRSP.

98.       Steps are also being undertaken to improve monitoring and evaluation o f development projects
and programs, including preparation o f comprehensive quarterly monitoring reports.                           T h i s i s being
strengthened by convening special monitoring sessions o f Executive Committee o f NEC (ECNEC) and
NEC and posting project profiles and project monitoring reports on the Planning Commission's website.
Project approval and evaluation criteria are being revisedand improved.

99.       The Governmentis seekingto improvethe businessenvironment so as to reducecompliance
and regulatory costs imposed on businesses, in particular small and medium enterprises. These
measures are a key part o f the government's employment creation and poverty reduction strategy.
Following are some reforms areas o f priority in this regard: (a) improving labor-related regulations;
(b)telecommunications deregulation; (c) improving the supply and improving the efficiency o fthe energy
sector (petroleum, gas, and electricity); (d) water management; and (e) privatization.

 100.     Reform of labor legislation has progressed well and revised legislation is expected to be
presented to Cabinet in 2004. These reforms are aimed at enhancing flexibility o f the labor market,
while protectingworkers' rightsand continuing to discourage childlabor.

 101.     While the performance o f the Pakistan telecommunications sector has improved considerably in
the past years, the provision of telecommunications services is still short o f its potential incomparison to
other countries at comparable income levels, and does not adequately support the needs o f a modem, fast
growing economy. Recent developments are likely to improve Pakistan's telecom sector significantly,
and contribute to lower the costs o f doing business in Palustan. The fixed line policy, which had been
approved in principle by Cabinet in July 2003, was approved by Cabinet on January 10. The key


  To facilitate this process, the Government intends to commission a study to work out the modalities and identify steps involved
inthe process.




                                                              31

objectives o f this policy are to: a) increase choice for customers o f telecommunication services at
competitive and affordable rates; b) promote infrastructure development through increased private
investment and competition; and c) increase rural access, where the majority o f Pakistan's poor live. The
Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) has received 93 applications for the grant o f Local Loop
(LL)and Long Distance International (LDI) licenses from prospective investors so far. A new mobile
policy was recently announced, which effectively opens the way for increased competition in the sector.
Under the new policy PTA has invited EOIs for licensing two additional mobile operators. A total o f 33
firms expressed interest, o f which 16 are international groups, including M C I Communications, Emirates
Telecom Corporation, Singtel, TurkCell, Telekom Malaysia and Deutsche Telecom through CellOne.
PTA held an investors conference on February 18 to clarify the mobile policy and the selection process
for the award o f the two new licenses, and on M a y 27, issued mobile cellular licenses to two foreign
companies, thus increasing the total number o f mobile operators in the country to six. The government
has already received a total o f 291 million dollars as 50 per cent o f the license fee while the two
companies are to deposit the remaining amount over a period o f 10 years.

102.      As part of the high-level sector dialogue between the Government and the Bank, the
Government has recently approved an Action Planto improve the performance of the power sector.
The Govemment recognizes that the power sector struggles under a burden o f inefficiencies and losses,
provides inadequate services to its existing customers, and i s unable to increase access to rural areas and
poorer segments o f the population. The Action Plan, recently approved by the Government, aims at
improving the financial viability o f the sector through better governance, reduced costs, rationalized
tariffs, and more targeted and transparent subsidies. It specifies the institutional mechanisms for driving
power sector reforms, through the establishment o f a Policy and Implementation Cell in the Ministry o f
Water and Power to lead and implement the overall reforms. The Plan also recognizes the importance o f
a more rational tariff structure for the overall financial viability o f the sector, and calls for policy
guidelines for NEPRA on tariff rationalization and tariff differentiation, both across consumer categories
and cross-regionally, including more targeted and transparent subsidies and a time-bound phasing out o f
cross-subsidies.21 The Govemment approval o f the Action Plan i s a trigger for PRSC 1, while subsequent
PRSCs would support the timely implementation o f the agreed plan, as per the sequencing and timeline
outlined inthe plan.

 103.     The Government is expected to sustain reform efforts in the oil and gas sector, so as to
better target subsidies and improve the efficiency of these sectors. In gas, the government now
intends to implement consistently the Transparent Pricing Formula and bi-yearly adjustment mechanism
of the retail tariffs for Natural Gas price, approved in2001. In the petroleum sector, further deregulation
of petroleum products prices (ex-refinery, consumer-level), upgradation o f infrastructure (port facilities,
refineries, transportation, storages, etc), phasing-out o f freight pool, and improvement o f quality
specifications would be needed. Similarly in the natural gas sector, pricing reforms (wellhead price for
Mari Gas, cost-based consumer pricing, phasing-out o f subsidies, etc), improved regulatory practice,
sector master-planning (leading possibly to Third Party Access, gas storage, etc), extension o f
transmission and distribution infrastructure, and substitution o f imported fuel oil inpower generation are
envisaged. Continued reforms will provide the necessary impetus to expand the supplies o f commercial
energy (natural gas, LPG, etc) to a wider section o f the society, promote equity among urban and rural
consumers, arrest deforestation in selected areas, and reduce poverty by enabling the populationto switch
from costlier fuels. It also gives a very strong signal on the commitment o f the government to safeguard
and balance the interests o f all stakeholders. Since investments inthis sector are usually lumpy, and have
long gestation periods, such a commitment to private sector owners i s o fparamount importance.

104.     Sustaining reductions inpoverty incidence in rural areas will require improving the performance
o f agriculture. Most distortions in agricultural output and input markets have now been removed.
Accelerating agricultural growth will now depend critically on improving the management o f water
resources, so as to reduce vulnerability o f poor households to negative, drought-related shocks and
provide for a more efficient and equitable use of water. The Ministry o f Water and Power has prepared a
draft National Water Policy (NWP) and a Water Sector Strategy in 2002 that highlight the need for
institutionalizing an Apex Body for the water sector that would develop long-term investment plans and
priorities, build the sector knowledge base and introduce modern analytic tools, and guide system
operating policy. A technical body would assist the Apex Body. The NWP i s expected to be submitted
for Cabinet approval after the Parliamentary Committee has submitted its report. A proposed ADB
technical assistance program to, inter alia, help implement the NWP, and to strengthen IRSA i s under
discussion. The Ministryof Water and Power will establish a Water Policy Cell that would gradually be
strengthened to play the role of the technical assistance arm o f the Apex Body. IRSA i s also preparing
proposals for enhancing its capacity and to conduct various studies, including more accurate estimation o f
water losses and lag times in various reaches of the Indus river system, and better forecasting o f system
inflows. These measures are expected to be supported under PRSC 2. Provincial reforms o f water
management systems are supported under provincial SACS.

106.     Despite a difficult international environment, Pakistan's privatization program has moved at a
reasonable pace during the last two years, by targeting domestic investors for smaller transactions and
disinvesting government shares in state owned companies through the stock markets.              Based on
successful initial public offerings o f National Bank o f Palustan, Oil and Gas Development Corporation,
Sui Southern Gas Company, Palustan International Airlines, and Palustan Petroleum Limited, the
Privatization Commission intends to take a similar route for the sale o f minority shares through stock
markets for a few other transactions such as K o t Addu Power Company where privatization to strategic
investors i s expected further down the line. The Government also managed a large strategic transaction
with the sale o f United Bank Limited, which was successfully completed in October 2002, and has
recently sold Habib Bank. In addition, a number o f other key transactions including Pakistan State Oil,
KESC, FaisalabadElectricity Supply Company and Jamshoro Company have reached advanced stages o f
privatization and it i s expected that several o f these companies will be privatizedduring2004.

Pillar 11: Reformsto Improve Governance and Devolution

 107.    Procurement reform has been on the agenda o f the government for close to a decade. To
improve the transparency and effectiveness o f public expenditures and reduce the opportunities for
corruption, the PPRA was given the powers, inter alia, o f (i)     recommending to the Federal Government
revisions in or formulation of new laws, rules and policies with respect to public procurement and (ii)
making regulations, codes o f ethics and procedures for public procurement. PPRA has now developed a

set of national procurement rules, which were notified by the Government under Article 26 o f the
Ordinance, and conform to intemationalbest practice. These rules apply to all procurement carried out by
the federal government line departments, as well as to those o f the state owned enterprises and semi-
autonomous organizations (such as WAPDA and PIA), and came into effect starting FY05. Future
PRSCs would encourage the development of supporting regulations, procedures, andprocesses to monitor
and report on public procurement such that the PPRA i s able to provide relevant and appropriate statistics
on public procurement inPalustan.

108.    Financial management reforms have progressed well, with a number o f actions taken to
improve budgetary and accounting systems and internal control arrangements. These actions consist o f
both technical reforms such as the implementation of a new chart o f accounts and an automated
accounting system, as well as institutional reforms to improve accounting, financial reporting, internal
controls, extemal audit, and legislative oversight. The proposed PRSC program would support next steps
inthe implementationofthe financial managementreform program, consistent with the 2003 CFAA. The
accuracy o f financial information i s crucial for improved utilization of public expenditures, and
particularly for traclung key PRSP expenditures, and has improved - with the reconciliation of
expenditures, receipts, suspense, and intergovemmentalaccounts o f the federal government improving to
99%, loo%, 98% and 95% respectively as o f December 2003 as compared to 96%,         loo%,  92%, and 93%
as o f December 2002.      A key challenge remains the adoption o f a methodical and comprehensive
accounts reconciliation framework and strengthened internal control systems, particularly at the
provincial and local level, where some deterioration has taken place, especially in Sindh and Balochistan,
after devolution. Next steps in financial management that the proposed PRSC would support include the
increase inreconciliation of accounts at the federal and provincial levels o f government, and the increase
inoversightbythe FederalPublic Accounts Committee.

109.    Civil Service reform i s on the agenda of the Government. A broad reform strategy has been
developed and will be submitted to the President and the Cabinet for approval. A Civil Service Reform
Unit(CSRU) has been created inthe Establishment Divisionto manage and oversee the reformprocess,
focusing on the areas o f devolution, recruitment and promotion reforms, pay and pensions reform,
professional development, and monitoring and evaluation. A Pay and Pensions Committee has also been
constituted, which will provide policy recommendations on pay and pensions reform to the government
by January 2005. While progress has been slow, specific measures that could be supported under the
PRSC include the creation o f an elite, higher paid National Executive Service (NES) comprising o f
officers selected on merit for critical policy and management positions beginning at Grade 19; promotion
o f merit-based recruitment by strengthening the Federal Public Services Commission (FPSC);
comprehensive pay and pension reform reducing the financial burden posed on the govemment by
unfundedpension liabilities while ensuring old age benefits to civil servants.

 110.   Pakistan's devolution initiative was launched with the explicit objective o f improving service
delivery through increased accountability o f elected representatives and govemment officials. While
there are early signs that devolution i s beginning to yield positive results in terms o f more responsive
government, much remains to be done to fully implement the initiative. District governments face
significant obstacles caused by incomplete administrative and fiscal devolution, and in some cases
tensions between elected district leaders and the provincial chief minister and assemblies. Much o f this
agenda for completing fiscal and administrative devolution rests with the provincial govemments.
Nevertheless, the Federal Government can play a critical role in creating the necessary enabling
environment for these reforms, in particular by transferring more resources to the provinces so that they
may in turn transfer these to local govemments. The next NFC Award offers an opportunity for the
Federal Government to effectively support the process, by increasing the provincial share o f the divisible
pool transferred to provincial govemments, and improving the distribution o f these resources between




                                                     34

provinces to make these transfers more pro-poor. Local governments are gradually buildingup capacity to
utilize these additional resources more effectively.22

Pillar III:  InvestinginHumanCapital

111.     Improving Pakistan's poor human development indicators i s a reform priority, and the Federal
Government, in the context o f devolution, has a key role to play in policy formulation, and monitoring
and evaluation. The improvement in levels of financing for key PRSP expenditures, including on
health, education, water and sanitation, etc., will be supported by and monitored under the PRSC
program.      The PRSC program will complement and encourage additional efforts o f provincial
governments in stepping up the quality and access o f underserved populations to health and education
services. The Bank directly supports these efforts already with analytical, project and program support at
the provincial level, namely through the North West Frontier Adjustment Credits Iand 11, the Sindh
Adjustment Credit, and the Punjab Education Adjustment Credit. In addition, the PRSC program will
support additional efforts by the federal government, namely through demand side interventions such as
vouchers or performance-based grants, so as to enhance the demand for education and health services.

112.     As the reform areas under the PRSC will be agreed at the national level, the PRSC will support
reforms that are being implementedby the Federal Government. Ineducation,a specific federal area that
impacts the quality o f education i s student-learning achievement. A major national initiative i s the
launching o f the National Education Assessment System (NEAS), which i s a sample-based national
assessment o f student learning, to be conducted at grade 4 and grade 8 levels. A first pilot assessment o f
Grade 4 (two subjects) has been conducted. This i s the first time in Pakistan that a national and cross-
provincial baseline o f student achievement will be measured against the national curricula. This exercise
would provide credible data for the purpose o f enhancing the quality o f education at the elementary level,
and would enable the Federal and Provincial Governments to make assessment a permanent feature o f the
country's education system.

113.     In health, in addition to policy formulation and monitoring and evaluation, the federal
government plays a key role in preventing the spread o f communicable diseases, through preventive
health care programs, such as the Lady Health Worker (LHW) program and communicable disease
control programs. The PRSC will support the federal government's efforts in each o f these areas.
Palustan has a fi-agmented public health surveillance system for making key public health decisions, and
strengthening it requires the development o f a comprehensive system and the building o f organizational
capacity at federal, provincial and district levels for its effective functioning. A technical assessment o f
existing surveillance system will be undertaken this year, and the findings will be used to develop and
implement a Public Health Surveillance and Response System. Such a system should include surveillance
o f priority communicable diseases, non-communicable diseases and associated behaviors and to establish
a sample registrationsystem for vital events to track infant, child, and maternal mortality. Inaddition, the
Ministrywill strengthenmonitoringand evaluation byundertakmganalysis ofhealth systemperformance
by districts and disseminateresults to provinces/districts and the public.

114.     The Government has approved a financial sustainability plan for the immunization program and
aims to improve coverage through strengthening management and supervision at the district and


22The Asian Development Bank, through its Decentralization Support Program, i s supporting capacity building at the district and
provincial levels, as are the World Bank's Community Infrastructure Project in the NWFP and the Education Structural
Adjustment Credit in Punjab. In addition, the Bank is also supporting the devolution agenda through technical dialogue (2000
Provincial Finances report, 2003 Public Expenditure Review, and the 2004 report on Devolution in Pakistan), and financial
management reforms.




                                                            35

provincial levels, and enhancing the shlls o f vaccinators. GAVIassistance i s being usedto replace aging
cold chain, strengthening logistics, improving access by involving non-government sector and provision
of immunization services through community basedworkers.

115.     The program will pilot demand side interventions in health and education. For example,
there i s considerable international experience o f the successful use o f vouchers or cash transfers to
encourage families and households to immunize their children, to complete TB treatment, and for
pregnant women to attend antenatal care. These are expectedto be supportedunder PRSC 2.

116.     The government will continue to expand and consolidate the LHWsprogram to improve access to
family planning and primary health care. The program will hire about 30,000 new Lady Health Workers
to reach its target o f 100,000 workers reaching approximately 100million women and children by FY05.
Inaddition, the programwill test programmatic innovations with significant impact onhealthoutcomes
that could be incorporated into the scope o f work of the LHWs -- e.g. single-dose vitamin A for neonates,
promotion o f hand washing and multiple micronutrient supplementations inpregnancy. The program will
also implement management and organization reforms as a means for further decentralization o f
management o f the program in line with devolution initiative. Performance-based compensation for
LHWs will also be tested and results to work with provinces and districts to expand performance-based
compensation inthe health sector.

117.      The federal government i s also expanding the provision of preventive health services through
contracting out services to the non-governmental and private sectors. The Government has launched the
ExpandedHIV/AIDSPrevention Program, which i s contracting non-government organizations for service
delivery and strengthening o f management. Inaddition, the government has also contracted NGOs for the
provision of malaria and TB DOTS services.

Pillar IV: Targeting the Poor and the Vulnerable

118.      Caused by adverse macroeconomic conditions and low growth rates, poverty in Pahstan has
increased between 1993194 and 2001, when it stood at around one-third o f the population. The
Government's poverty reduction strategy relies on rapid, broad based growth as the most effective way to
accelerate poverty reduction, complemented by improvements in governance and stepped up efforts to
improve the delivery o f education, health, and water and sanitation services to underserved populations.
Targeted programs aiming to address poverty and vulnerability directly are also an important
component o f the government's strategy to reduce poverty. As discussed earlier, the Government has
instituted a number o f social protection and safety net programs that have as their objective improvingthe
welfare o f the poor and vulnerable groups and reduce food insecurity. In addition, the government also
operates a universal untargeted food subsidy. The social protection programs use different sources o f
financing, different levels o f benefits, methods o f transfers, and administrative arrangements.

 119.     The implementation of these programs raises several questions regarding their coverage,
administration, and effectiveness of targeting. To address these questions and create a well-targeted,
financially viable and well-administered safety net, the government i s interested in carrying out a
comprehensive review of the safety nets (PRSP p. 83) and has requestedBank assistance to undertake this
work. This comprehensive review of the financing, targeting efficiency, adequacy, and administration o f
select social protection and safety net programs would be useful for improving the efficiency o f social
protection expenditures. The review, which will be supported by the PRSC, would help the Government
identify key measures for improving the effectiveness and targeting o f its social protection programs.
Next steps to be supportedby the PRSC program (under PRSC 2 and 3) would bereform o f safety nets, to
implement the recommendations ofthe review according to a mutually agreed reformprogram.

 B. ProposedPrior Actions for PRSC 1andIndicative Triggers for PRSC2

 120.    A set o f prior actions has been taken by the Govemment in advance o f PRSC 1approval, and a
 indicative triggers for PRSC 2 have been agreed upon (Table 6). This approach captures the medium- to
 long-termnature o f most significant reform efforts but allows flexibility to adjust to new information and
 changing circumstances duringimplementation and to expand the scope of the reformprogram change the
 scope o fthe operation over time.

C. PerformanceUnder and LessonsLearnt from SAC 1and SAC 2

121.    This PRSC builds on the successful implementation o f the Government's reform program,
supported under previous programmatic operations.          The Bank has supported the Government o f
Palustan's medium-term reform program since 1999 with two programmatic operations, Structural
Adjustment Credit 1 (US350 million equivalent) and Structural Adjustment Credit 2 (US$500 million
equivalent), approved inMay 2001 and M a y 2002, respectively. These operations were the Bank's main
vehicles to support implementation o f the I-PRSP.         A third Structural Adjustment Credit was not
processeddue to a slowdown inreform implementation duringthe political transition.

122.    The SACSeffectively supported the achievement of a number o fimportant objectives, and helped
lay the foundations for Palstan's achievement o f the MDGs. The focus o f SAC 1 and 2 was on policies
to engender growth; improve governance; and improve delivery o f social services. It included measures
to accelerate growth, reduce indebtedness and accelerate fiscal consolidation, prioritized the social sectors
and critical infrastructure in public expenditure policy, improved tax administration, devolved powers to
newly established local governments, improved financial management, and civil service reforms. Growth
has now accelerated and i s broad based, which bodes well for poverty reduction. Ultimately, the impact
of the Government's overall reformprogram (and o f the Bank's operations that supported it) will only be
fully ascertainedas new data onpoverty incidence and education andhealthoutcomes becomes available.
Data from the CWIQ and the new round o f PIHS are expected to provide important information to this
end.

123.    Notwithstanding these achievements, there were areas where the pace o f reform implementation
fell short o f expectations. These included power and gas sector reforms, and reform of public
procurement. In some cases, such as power and to a lesser extent gas sector reform, the Bank and
Government's expectations may have been overoptimistic and may have underestimated the political
economy constraints involved in implementing such a complex reform program. Clearly, reforming the
power sector will take longer than originally envisaged, and these lessons have now been taken into
account inthis PRSC.

124.     The proposed PRSC includes support for actions that were the logical next steps in the reform
program supported under the SAC program, namely those for SAC 3. These include reforms in the
energy sector, privatization, procurement reform, de-regulation, improvement o f the fiscal framework for
local governments, and PRSP monitoring. While the proposed PRSC program will track performance in
all key areas o f the Government's reform program, some reform areas supported under the previous
operation will now benefit from either dedicated operations (under preparation) and/or deepened technical
dialogue. In the financial sector, the proposed Banlung Sector Adjustment operation will support the
overall sector program o f reforms and restructuring. Tax administration reform and CBR restructuring
are expectedto be supportedunder a Tax Administration project.

 125.    Regarding the power sector, the PRSC program will require that the subsidy to the power sector
on account o f losses, debt-equity swaps, and investments, be consistent with the overall resource
envelope, the Government's debt reduction targets (as laid out in the Fiscal Responsibility and Debt
Limitation Bill), and competing PRSP expenditure priorities. Inthe short-run, the Government will need
to avoid any further deterioration in the sector's financial performance (and the associated drain on the
budget) by implementing in a timely manner cost reductions, efficiency improvements and tariff
adjustments determined by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA). The outlook for
the sector has now improved, as an Action Plan to improve power sector performance has recently been
approved by the Government. In addition, the Government has requested the Bank's assistance in the
formulation o f a broader Sector Recovery Plan for the power sector. This plan would include measures to
(1) improve governance and accountability-including      accelerated privatization; (ii) costs through
                                                                                       reduce



                                                     39

greater use o f domestic natural gas, debt restructuring, and reduced losses; (iii)     reforming tariff and
subsidy policies; and (iv) establish a policy framework that ensures that the investmentsrequired inthe
power sector will be fully funded and consistent with the Government's overall macroeconomic
framework. High-level discussions with the Government on the components o f this Plan were held in
February 2004 and work i s underway to further refine it. Fullimplementation o f this Plan would not only
place the sector on a path toward financial viability, but also support efforts to expand access, increase the
reliability o f power supplies, and (over the medium term) lower the cost o f power-which     i s necessary to
sustain rapid economic growth. Initially, Bank support for the Plan will be through technical assistance
and policy advice; subsequently, the Bank could also provide expanded lending to support the sector
reforms and investments to be implementedunder the Plan.

126.     Other areas supported under the proposed PRSC were not part o f the SAC program and are new,
second-generation reforms that reflect the broader and deeper policy framework outlined in the
Government's full PRSP. These include fiscal responsibility legislation, public expenditure management,
telecommunications liberalization, pay and pensions reform for civil servants, increasing fiscal space
transferred to lower (provincial and local) levels o f government, increase inthe fiscal space for PRSP and
in particular social sector and critical infrastructure expenditures, water management reforms, and
measures to refocus and improve the effectiveness o f federal government institutions in the design and
monitoring o f social service delivery.

127.     The completion o f the full PRSP now provides a much stronger, home-grown policy framework
on which to underpin the proposed PRSC program.                 Nevertheless, many o f the lessons in the
Implementation Completion Reports for SAC 1and 2 remainvalid for PRSC. These include:

         Both operations were multi-sectoral and supported the overall reform program, but focused on
         implementation o f a set o f priority actions.    For SAC 1 and 2, the core reform areas were
         privatization, oil and gas sector reform, trade reform, power and financial sector reforms, and
         overhaul o f CBR. Agriculture reform was part o f the overall reform program, but has been the
          focus o f the Asian Development Bank. Social protection was not a key area o f reform, as there
         was insufficient analytical basis to identify priority actions. Health and education reforms, while
          again part o f the program, were dealt with more appropriately through the provincial and local
          adjustment operations inSindh and NWFP, and more recently inPunjab.
         One tranche operations were appropriate to take into account the fact that Pakistan had a weak
          implementationtrack record and multi tranche operations would have been less effective against
         backsliding. Indeed, reforms have continued to advance in a wide range o f areas, and when the
         pace o freform slowed duringthe political transition, so did Bank financial support.
         Inimplementingaseries ofone-trancheoperations, itisimportanttomaintainamedium-to long-
         runfocus, i.e., a systematic review o fthe longer-termreformagenda shouldunderpinpreparation
          o f the individual adjustment operations.
         Pakistan's home-grown reform program has been a strength, as evidenced by the continuity o f
          overall reforms, however it places an extra burden on the Bank to assess the assumptions that
          underlie the program. For instance, the power sectors' Financial Improvement Plan was designed
         by the Government, but was based on assumptions the realism o f which proved difficult to assess
          ex ante.
         Analytical work and other operations, both adjustment and investment operations, are playing and
          will continue to play an important role inreinforcing and deepening the reformagenda.

         Careful consideration should be given to the program's balance between targeted interventions
          and broader measures to support growth and improve social service delivery. Particularly where



                                                       40

         financial and administrative resources are scarce and poverty widespread, as in Pakistan, and
        where poverty programs are relatively untested, targeted programs are likely to be less effective
         inreducing povertythan is rapid, broad-basedgrowth.


D. ImplementationArrangements

128.    Institutional. The implementation o f this ambitious, multi-sectoral reform program requires
effective coordination between Government Ministries and agencies.             The PRSP Secretariat in the
Ministryo fFinance will be the focal point for the PRSC and will oversee the implementationo freforms.
Itwill also continue to monitor and disseminate PRSP expenditures on a quarterly basis.

129.    Funds flow and auditingrequirements for the credit. The funds flowing from the PRSC will
be disbursed to the Borrower under the IDA'Ssimplifiedtransfer mechanism for adjustment operations.
The Government o f Pakistan shall establish a Special Deposit Account with the State Bank o f Pakistan
(SBP) into which the proceeds o f the Credit will be disbursed on a single tranche basis. The funds inthe
Account will, automatically, be transferred into the Consolidated Fund o f the Government held with the
SBP. Disbursements fi-om the Consolidated Fund by the Government o f Palustan shall not be linked to
any specific purchases and no special procurement requirement shall be needed. The proceeds o f the
Credit shall, however, not be applied to finance expenditures inthe negative list as defined in Schedule 1
o f the DCA. If any portion o f the Credit i s used to finance ineligible expenditures as so defined in the
DCA, IDA shall require the Government to reimburse the amount to the Special Deposit Account to
finance eligible expenditures or refund the amount to the IDA. The SBP, on behalf o f the Govemment,
shall maintain an appropriate accounting system in accordance with generally acceptable accounting
principles. The Bank may request an audit to be carried out, with a view to providing a `special opinion'
as to the receipt o f funds into the special deposit account and the eventual transfer o f the local currency
equivalent o f such funds into the ConsolidatedFundAccount o f the Govemment o f Palustan.

130.    Partnershipwith other Donors. Bank and Fund staff collaboration inPalustan continues to be
effective. Bank staff routinely participate inFundmissions, and Fundstaff have also participatedinBank
missions, namely on tax administration reforms. Collaboration with other donors i s also increasing. In
AAA, two economic reports (the Devolution in Pakistan report and Punjab Economic Report) were
prepared as joint products o f the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and U K ' s DFID. The
government has indicated its interest in ensuring good coordination o f policy dialogue and program
support inPalustan and providing the leadership for this coordination, and indicatedthat the PRSC, along
with the PRSP, would provide a good instrument for this coordination. It i s expected that the PRSC will
be the main vehicle to improve collaboration and consistency o f program support by Palustan's largest
donors. U K ' s DFID and more recently the U S have expressed interest in disbursing budget support
against PRSC actions.

131.     Capacity Building. To strengthen the capacity o f the civil service in general, and that o f key
ministries and regulatory bodies involved in the reform process, the Bank has prepared a Public Sector
Capacity BuildingProject that was presented to the Board on M a y 20, 2004. The first component of the
project focuses on the broad-based professional development o f public sector officers, through
professional training programs for middle and senior officers, as well as strengthening in-country training
capacity through support o f training institutions. The second component focuses on the enhancement of
key ministriedagencies that are in the forefront of design, implementation, and monitoring of policy
reforms - such as the Finance Division, CBR, Planning, and Establishment Division -- through both
training o f staff as well as upgradation o f infrastructure and information technology. The final component
o f the project supports capacity building in the core regulatory agencies such as NEPRA, OGRA, and
PTA.

 I    Box 2: FiduciaryIssues: PublicSector FinancialManagement,Accountability, and Procurement

  Recognizing that problems o f weak governance have been at the heart o f Pakistan's poverty and
   development challenges, the Government of Pakistan has made improving performance o f the public sector
   a central element o f its poverty reduction strategy. T o address this challenge and beginning in 1999, the
   government launched a far-reaching set o f initiatives, including reforms inpublic financial management and
  procurement to increase the effectiveness,         transparency, and accountability in public expenditure
  management. Continued emphasis on and consolidation o f existing reform programs inthe short term, in
   conjunction with the introduction of new financial rules over the mediumterm, would be needed to increase
   the effectiveness o f intended reforms. Work has already started in this direction under the auspices of
   PIFRA and it i s expected that new financial and treasury rules will be inplace by 2005.

   Significant progress has been achieved so far in financial management and procurement reforms to increase
  the effectiveness, transparency, and accountability in public expenditure management are key priorities of
   the Government's PRSP. As noted inthe 2003 Country Financial Accountability Assessment, considerable
  progress has been made in each of these areas. With the deepening o f the current reforms, albeit slow, and
   improved implementation o f the PIFRA program, fiduciary risk to the Bank, other donors and government
   funds managed through mainstream accounting, financial reporting and internal controls systems have been
   significantly reduced. Inthe light of these positive strides, coupled with improved expenditure tracking, the
   structural adjustment loans disbursed and managed through reliance o n the government's own financial
   management systems have shown satisfactory outcomes.
 I

   In accounting and financial reporting, specific challenges o f fundamental nature that remain to be
   accomplished within the accounting and reporting function are as follows: i)the creation of internal audit
   units in departments to improve internal controls; ii)the finalization o f the Controller General o f Accounts'
   control over organization, staffing, and training arrangements with clearly defined roles and responsibilities
   for staff reporting; iii)drafting o f an action plan and the adoption o f the International Public sector
   Accounting Standard's (IPSAS) cash basis o f reporting for the government's finance accounts and the
   provision o f modified cash basis statements as additional information only.

   Infinancial management, the timeliness and financial accuracy o f financial statements has improved, with
   annual accounts being produced within six months o f the end o f the fiscal year, improved reconciliation,
   and, under the PIFRA program, the progressive adoption o f a new chart o f accounts under a computerized
   accounting system. T o improve legislative and public oversight, Public Accounts Committees have been
   established in all four provinces, and very recently, at the Federal level.    The PRSC will support further
   reforms in this area, such as improvements in the reconciliation benchmarks for expenditures, receipts,
   suspense accounts, and intergovernmental accounts on a quarterly basis at federal level, and inparticular,
   provincial levels, and further strengthening o f the Federal PAC. Inprocurement, as noted inthe Country
   Procurement Assessment Review 2000, procurement irregularities have been a significant problem in
   Pakistan, in large part due to a weak regulatory framework governing public procurement. The Public
   Procurement Regulatory Authority was created in 2002 through a Presidential Ordinance, with the powers
   to formulate new legislation on public procurement applicable to all federal government and public sector
   procurement.    Supported by the PRSC, the Government is now adopting a set o f procurement rules
   conforming to international best practice. This is expected to improve the quality o f public expenditures and
   reduce the scope for corruption. The PRSC will also support the development o f supporting regulations and
   procedures, andprocesses to monitor and report on public procurement.




132.    In addition, the Bank is undertaking capacity building programs in key economic management
agencies such as CBR and Audit/Accounting Departments.                          Apart from the comprehensive
computerization exercise, PIFRA has been focusing on building capacity o f the staff o f the Auditor
General and Controller General o f Accounts. PIFRA i s also supporting the devolution agenda through


                                                         42

support to financial management reforms, which are critical buildingthe district governments' capacity to
manage services. The capacity o f local govemments i s also being strengthened through the community
infrastructure projects in rural areas. The Bank i s now in the final phase o f preparation o f Tax
Administration Reform Project, which i s expected to focus on computerization and capacity building of
CBR.

133.     The Bank i s also worhng closely with the Government to strengthencapacity to monitor PRSP
outcomes, in particular the MDGs. Following extensive consultation Pakistan officially adopted a
poverty line, which will facilitate the tracking o f progress toward the poverty head count target. The
Government has also developed an action plan and begun to implement a program to improve the
monitoring of health and education intermediate outcome indicators and, in conjunction with the
provinces, to monitor PRSP-related expenditures. These are beingreportedin quarterly reports, which are
available on the internet. To provide an independent cross check on data provided through govemment
information systems while also gaining insight into the impact o f services provided through non-
government channels, a Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire (CWIQ) survey has been developed and
piloted. The CWIQ will provide facility and household level data for a range o f intermediate and final
outcome indicators. The govemment i s also mahng increasing use o f independent third party surveys to
assess progress in achieving project outcomes; the Sindh and NWFP adjustment credits and Punjab
Education Adjustment credit all make use o f such surveys to ensure reform programs are on track.
Finally, while, the Government o f Pakistan has initiated a number o f steps to restructure the federal
statistical system to improve the quality and reliability o f statistics, further steps are needed to strengthen
the system o f official statistics to provide better information on economic, demographic, and social
trends. The Bank `will continue to work with Pakistan to support its efforts in this area, including
measures to increase the independence and enhance the capacity o f the Federal Bureau o f Statistics.

134.     Other donors have large capacity buildingprograms in Palustan. With the support o f the ADB,
the government i s conducting a major capacity buildingprogram in financial management while the Bank
supported PKFRA program i s modemizing accounting and auditing systems down to the district level. The
ADB's Decentralization Support Programfocuses on the institutional strengthening and capacity building
of local governments, as well as providing technical assistance to improve fiscal decentralization, through
for example support to the Provincial Finance Commissions. DFID has a large and expanding capacity
building effort, focusing on health, education, and population. DFID is also working with local
governments to enhance their capacity to deliver services, particularly inhealth, and municipal services.

135.     Related operations. The Government o f Pakistan's PRSP is supported by a number o f related
World Bank lending operations, as well as operations supported by other development partners (Table 7).

136.     Environmentalissues:As notedearlier, the PRSP recognizes the linkage betweenenvironmental
degradation and poverty, specifically with regards to water-logging, salinization, and rangeland
degradation. In addition, there are serious administrative constraints on environmental policy and
institutional coordination, inadequate budgetary transfers to environmental agencies, and insufficient
policy-relevant data and analysis. Bank assistance for environmental management has moved away from
stand-alone technical assistance towards mainstreaming o f environmental concerns in sector programs,
combined with analytical and advisory services, including the on-going work on a Strategic Country
EnvironmentalAssessment to support the program o f development policy lending

137.    Overall, the following reforms supported by the PRSC are likely to have a positive environmental
impact: i)power sector reform, specifically reduction o f electricity subsidies; ii)oil and gas sector reform,
including reduction in gas subsidies and further deregulation o f petroleum markets; and iii)privatization
of state owned enterprises. As noted in the Strategic Country Environmental Assessment, the financial
restructuring through the reduction o f electricity subsidies can lead to environmental benefits by
encouraging more efficient use o f energy and water. Increased costs o f using irrigation water should
discourage the overexploitation o f groundwater, and slow the rate o f water-logging and salinization. In
the oil and gas sector, the liberalization of the import o f petroleum products, predictable pricing policies,
and privatization should result in increased competition, encourage technological improvements, and
result in higher quality petroleum products. Elimination o f the gas subsidy to the fertilizer industry i s
expected to constrain excessive fertilizer use, encourage integrated nutrient management, and mitigate
adverse impacts on soil fertility. While these reforms offer an opportunity for positive environmental
outcomes, further gains can be made if economic and sector reforms are accompanied by improved
environmentalregulation, incentives, and institutional development.

138.    Disclosure. Transparency and accountability are fundamental to the development process. The
Bank's disclosure policy provides that Program Documents for all Poverty Reduction Support Credits
(PRSCs) are disclosed, and it presumes that borrowing governments will consent to Bank disclosure o f
the ProgramDocuments for other development policy support operations.

                                       VI. BENEFITSAND RISKS

A. Benefits

139.    It is expected that growth and poverty indicators, along with key indicators in health and
education, will have improved significantly when the three-year PRSC reformprogram i s completed. The
PRSC program i s expected to contribute towards these improvements by supporting rapid, broad-based
growth, and a policy and expenditure frameworks supportive o f improved service delivery in health,
education, water and sanitation.

140.    The PRSC would support selective reforms by the Government o f Pakistan that will contribute to
sustaining rapid growth by (i)improving the business environment; (ii)           creating fiscal space while
reducing public debt and maintaining macroeconomic stability; and (iii)improving expenditure
management. The PRSC will also support improvements in governance and devolution through reforms
in: (i)financial management, procurement, and other anti-corruption and accountability institutions;
(ii) servicereform; and (iii)
    civil                            devolution. The program will also support accelerated progress in
human capital by focusing on reforms that are the responsibility o f the federal government: (i)       national
sector policy in health and education; (ii)data generation, monitoring o f outcomes and program
evaluation. Finally, the program will support improvements in Pakistan's safety nets, so as to improve
targeting and ensure that the poor and vulnerable are covered. Along with national accounts indicators,
the upcomingPMS and CWIQ surveys are expected to provide the necessary information for monitoring
outcomes o f the government's overall reform program. In addition, the PSRC program will include
program outcome indicators.

B. Risks

 141.    Politicalrisks remain, but have diminished over the past three years. Risks that political
opposition may block reforms have diminished somewhat, now that the opposition has been drawn into
the formal governing process.        This has allowed some forces, which previously felt ignored or
underrepresented, to have a full stake in malung the democratic process work.             The transition to a
democratically-elected government has taken place without major incident, and the Government elected


                                                     45

inOctober 2002 has continued the reform agenda set out by the preceding government and completed the
preparation o f the full PRSP. While political opposition remains, the government has shown that it can
pursue its policies without major disruptions. However, occasionally, it has delayed the implementation
of some measures. Active involvement o f parliament will be key to ensure broad based political support
for the PRSP reform agenda.

142.     Delays in implementation, insufficient institutional capacity, and adverse exogenous shocks
remain the biggest risks to swift implementation of reforms. Technical and institutional capacity has
been augmented by substantial capacity building programs, but weaknesses remain. The State Bank o f
Pakistan and the nationalized commercial banks have undergone major restructuring and staff
strengthening programs. The Central Board o f Revenue has embarked on a thorough-going reform,
including staff renovation. Agency improvement plans have been developed for a large group o f key
agencies in the Federal Government. Nevertheless, weaknesses remain in all areas, particularly in the
newly formed district and local governments. A stalled devolution process could negatively affect the
achievement of the Government's human development targets. As the overall reformprogram i s extended
to more and more parts o f the country, the weaknesses in implementation capacity need to be reduced to
get the benefits sought. In addition to the above, there are many approaches to capacity building at the
federal, provincial and local government levels that must pay off inthe medium-term future.

143.     There are moderate downside risksto the fiscal outlook. There are three main downside risks:
(i) impliedexpenditurecompressionisambitious, inparticularforreducingtransferstothepower
    the
sector, though it would certainly be welcome; (ii)  non-tax revenue may not reachprojections if dividends
fall on account o f privatization; and (iii)  losses of the SOEs may be difficult to achieve. Steadfast
implementation o f the government's strong program o f tax administration reforms, which the Bank plans
to continue to support with a proposed Tax Administration project, will be critical to improving revenue
collections. If tax revenue exceeds the government's expectations (as projected in the PRSP), this could
provide some offset for the downside risks. Any additional fiscal space could be used to further raise
PRSP expenditures ifinstitutional capacity to absorb additional spending i s enhanced.

 144.    Adverse exogenous shocks could set back the government's reform agenda.                       Most
importantly, growth could fall short o f the ambitious targets set out inthe full PRSP. Political or security
concerns could limit investment-in     particular foreign investment-and   unfavorable weather conditions
could hold back agricultural production. An associated reversal o f capital inflows could put pressure on
the balance of payments. Sensitivity analysis shows that Pakistan could weather temporary shocks to the
baseline scenario without public debt or external debt becoming unmanageable. Hence, the Government
shouldhave some leeway to protect PRSP spending to some degree incase o f adverse developments.

 145.    These risks remain relevant, but have diminished somewhat as a result o f the demonstrated
ownership o f the PRSP's reform program by the elected government and the continuity o f economic and
social policies over the past 4 years. The Government's credibility as a reformer i s now stronger than it
has been over a decade, and the recent successful Eurobond issue provided a market test to this
credibility. The Bank i s mitigating these risks by sustaining and deepening its policy dialogue, supporting
capacity buildingo f key government institutions, and disbursingagainst a set o f prior actions.

 146.    The overall benefits o f supporting Pakistan's reform program clearly outweigh the risks.
Palustan's track record to date has shown no sign o f overall slowdown in the pace o f the reform. There
are certainly reform areas such as streamlining business regulations, public and private partnerships in
infrastructure financing and development, and the reform o f tax policy and administration, where the
support for reform i s broad and resistance i s limited to a small number o f constituents. The proposed
operation could help lock inthe reform gains and deepen the reformprocess.

  IMFExecutive Board CompletesEighth Review UnderPakistan's PRGF-Supported Program and
                          Approves DisbursementAmounting to US$253Million


The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the eighth review o f
Palustan's performance under a three-year, SDR 1.034 billion (about US$1.52 billion) Poverty Reduction
and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement. Completion o f the review enables the release o f a further SDR
172.28 million (about US252.60 million) under the arrangement, which would bringtotal disbursements
to SDR 861.42 million (about US$1.263 billion).

Incompleting the review, the ExecutiveBoardalso approved Palustan's requestfor waivers for thenon-
observance o f certain structural performance criteria and for the modification o f one o f the end-June 2004
quantitative performance criteria.

Following the Executive Board's discussion o f Pakistan's economic performance, Agustin Carstens,
Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, stated:

"Pakistan has come a long way in a short period o f time in the context o f the three-year arrangement
under the PRGF, and there was strong macroeconomic performance during the first nine months o f
2003/04. GDP growth accelerated further, inflation remained within target, and significant surpluses in
the external balance were achieved. In addition, the fiscal deficit was lower than expected, and tax
collections were slightly higher than projected. Poverty-related expenditures grew by 28 percent over the
same period inthe previous fiscal year.

"Structuralreforms were further advanced. Financial and tax administration reforms were implemented
broadly as envisaged, and energy prices and tariffs were adjusted inline with international prices.

"Far-reaching reforms have also resulted in a more efficient and competitive financial system. In
particular, the predominantly state-owned banlung system has been transformed into one that i s
predominantly under the control o f the private sector. The legislative framework and the State Bank o f
Pakistan's supervisory capacity have been improved substantially. As a result, the financial sector i s
sounder and exhibits an increasedresilience to shocks. Loolung ahead, it will be important to continue to
restructure the banking system, and to implement the recommendations o f the recent assessment of the
financial sector under the FSAP.

"The macroeconomic policy framework for 2004/05 i s broadly appropriate. Fiscal policy aims to further
increase poverty-related expenditures while reducing the public debt burden. Accordingly, the 2004/05
budget envisages a consolidated fiscal deficit o f 4.0 percent o f GDP and an increase in poverty-related
expenditures. Monetary policy will continue to be geared toward reining ininflationary pressures, and the
exchange rate will continue to be managed flexibly.

"Continued prudent debt management remains a key priority. The early repayment o f some relatively
expensive external debt i s commendable, as well as Pakistan's successful return to international capital
markets inearly 2004.

"To maintain or accelerate the current growth momentum and make continued progress on poverty
reduction, the authorities need to steadfastly pursue their reform agenda to further improve the

                                                                                                 Page 2 of 2

environment for private sector investment, along the lines envisaged in Palustan's Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper. It will be essential to press ahead with the ongoing reforms to simplify the tax system and
broaden the tax base. In the energy sector, measures should be implemented to contain demands on the
budget while improving service delivery and puttingpower utilities on a sound financial footing over the
mediumterm. This will requireclose collaborationwith the WorldBank,"Mr.Carstens said.

The PRGF is the IMF's concessional facility for low-income countries. PRGF loans carry an annual
interest rate o f 0.5 percent, and are payable over 10 years with a 5 1/2 -year grace period on principal
payments. Pakistan's PRGF arrangement (see Press Release No. 01/51) was approved on December 6,
2001 and i s due to expire inDecember 2004. The Pakistani authorities have stated that they do not intend
to request a successor arrangement.
