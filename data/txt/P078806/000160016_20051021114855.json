CHILDREN WITH MILD TO MODERATE DISABILITIE", "versiontyp": "Gray cover", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "On October 8, 2005, a powerful\n            earthquake measuring 7.6 on the Richter scale hit northern\n            Pakistan. Pakistan has borne the brunt of the earthquake,\n            especially 5 northeastern districts of the North West\n            Frontier Province (NWFP) and three districts covering most\n            of had Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), with enormous loss of life\n            and devastation of infrastructure and property.  In response\n            to the earthquake, the Bank announced that US$20 million\n            would be available to the Government of Pakistan through\n            reallocations from existing projects. This amount was\n            doubled to US$ 40 million on October 11, through additional\n            identified reallocations.  The Bank is preparing a proposed\n            package of US$ 470 million to help Pakistan deal with the\n            reconstruction effort and safeguard the on-going reform and\n            poverty reduction program. This package will include: (1)\n            Supplemental Financing of US$ 150 million under the Poverty\n            Reduction Support Credit (PRSC 1) and of US$ 50 million\n            under NWFP SAC 2; (2)additional financing for existing\n            projects (AJK Community Infrastructure and Services Project,\n            Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund Project, and Highways\n            Rehabilitation Project); and (3) reallocation of part of the\n            proceeds of AJK Community Infrastructure and Services\n            Project, Second NWFP Community Infrastructure and Services\n            Project, and the NWFP On-Farm Water Management Project. In\n            addition to this immediate response, if the Damage and Needs\n            Assessment identifies unmet needs, and if the Government\n            requests it, the Bank could prepare an Emergency Recovery\n            Program. Even without a formal Damage and Needs\n            Assessment--expected in mid-November-- it is clear that the\n            economic impact of the earthquake is sizeable. Early\n            estimates suggest that the reconstruction costs of the lost\n            infrastructure will run into several billions of US dollars\n            and thus will have a sizeable impact on the overall\n            financing needs of the Government of Pakistan (as well as\n            the Government of the NWFP). The report covers the proposed\n            Supplemental Financing of US$ 150 million, which will\n            support the sustained implementation of the PRSC reform\n            program, and help finance part of the gap in resources\n            incurred as a result of the earthquake This is consistent\n            with Bank policy as reflected in OP 8.60, according to which\n            supplemental financing may be provided for a development\n            policy operation for which an anticipated gap in financing\n            jeopardizes a reform program that is otherwise proceeding on\n            schedule and in compliance with the agreed policy agenda."}, "docdt": "2005-10-19T00:00:00Z"}
