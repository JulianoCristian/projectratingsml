institutional development impact is modest; Bank performance\n            is satisfactory; Borrower performance is satisfactory. Among\n            the findings and implications for subsequent operations were\n            the following: 1) Future Poverty Reduction Support Credits\n            (PRSCs) should focus on key policy reforms that are within\n            the domain of the federal government. PRSCs would therefore\n            continue to need to be complemented with provincial\n            adjustment operations, such as those in Punjab and NWFP,\n            which could focus more heavily on service delivery\n            improvements. 2) The approach of using a one-tranche\n            operation as advocated in the Country Assistance Strategy,\n            appears to be working well. 3) Since Pakistan's\n            three-year arrangement under the IMF's Poverty\n            Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) ended in December 2004,\n            future PRSC's will need to pay greater attention to the\n            monitoring of key macroeconomic indicators, and will also\n            need to be informed by a number of analytical activities\n            currently underway (on labor markets, safety nets, disease\n            surveillance, civil service pensions, and on gender). 4)\n            Subsequent PRSCs will also need to support, and be informed\n            by, development of timely and reliable sources of data, such\n            as the two major surveys --- the Core Welfare Indicators\n            Questionnaire (CWIQ) and a Household Income and Expenditure\n            Survey (HIES), which will provide social sector and poverty\n            data by July 2005 and December 2005 respectively."}, "docdt": "2005-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
