under a Phase I\n            project in the Northern Province. Development of upland and\n            swampland rice, groundnuts, and maize started under the\n            previous project, which covered 4,900 square km, would be\n            extended to reach farmers in an additional 8,500 square km\n            area. Fruit tree cultivation and livestock promotion would\n            be introduced. For these purposes, the project would\n            provide: agricultural inputs, credit, extension services,\n            feeder roads, village wells, and technical assistance. About\n            13,500 farm families, or about 40 percent of rural families\n            in the area covered by the two projects, would benefit\n            directly and earn significantly higher incomes. All of these\n            families earn below the relative rural poverty threshold for\n            Sierra Leone of $67. Taking into account the general\n            improvement in agricultural services and the road and well\n            components, nearly 50 percent of the rural families in the\n            Phase I and II areas would benefit. Normal risks associated\n            with projects of this kind would be reduced by the fact that\n            this is the second phase in the area and would build upon\n            the organizational structure and techniques developed under\n            the previous phase."}, "docdt": "1981-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
