                         Implementation Status Overview
                          Implementation of MSI was reviewed in Sept 2010 and the project is progressing smoothly. Disbursement has improved ($19.32 million) since the mid-term review due to
                         procurement having been completed for Round 1 grantees. Delivery of equipment for Round two grantees is underway. Other activities are also proceeding smoothly so
                         disbursement is likely to remain steady. The project was due to close in December 2011 but given the delays in procurement, the project will need to be extended to allow for
