                         The project's development objective is for Ugandan universities and research institutes to produce more and better qualified science and engineering
                         graduates, and higher quality and more relevant research, and for firms to utilize these outputs to improve productivity for the sake of enhancing S&T-led
                         growth.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Implementation of MSI was reviewed in June 2011 and the project is progressing smoothly. Disbursement has improved ($23 million) since the mid-term review due to procurement
                         having been completed for Round 1 grantees. Delivery of equipment for Round 2 grantees is almost complete . Other activities are also proceeding smoothly so disbursement is likely
                         to remain steady. The project was due to close in December 2011 but given the delays in procurement, additional time is needed to allow for research activities to be completed. The

                         project has also supported some grantees in a third round with savings and unallocated amounts within the project funds. The Government requested an extension of the closing date
