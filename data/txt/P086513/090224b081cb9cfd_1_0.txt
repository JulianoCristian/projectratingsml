                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Uganda Millennium Science Initiative (MSI) project was a key intervention to support Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) at a time when funding for STI was scarce and
                         the research base was stagnant. However, there were some positive indications of Government's commitment to STI. Government was placing greater emphasis on S&T at all levels
                         of education and budget allocations were increasing These indications signaled the need for investment dedicated to giving an impetus to STI both at the policy level as well as at the
                         institutional level. The project design benefited from the Bank's comparative advantage in transferring its global knowledge, in particular drawing upon best practices and lessons
                         learned from similar projects in Latin American countries. A key achievement of the Project, the mechanism to institutionalize merit based, competitive research grants was adapted

                         to Ugandan conditions from the experience gained from similar Millennium Science Initiative projects in Chile, Venezuela, Brazil, and Mexico.

                         In this context, MSI was approved on 25 May 2006 for a credit of $30 million equivalent to support an emerging environment for STI. It became effective on March 2, 2007. The
                         project was due to close on December 31, 2011. The Project was restructured twice and its closing date was extended to June 30, 2013. As of June 4, 2013 disbursements under the

                         credit stood at $31.355 million out of the current credit value of about $31.357 million (historical credit of $30 million) representing 99.99% utilization. All project activities are on
                         schedule to be completed by June 30, 2013. The government as well as the Bank team has begun preparations for the project Implementation and Completion and Results Report
                         (ICR) which is due by December 31, 2013.

                         Project activities were clustered in two components. Component 1 supported: (i) competitive grants to research teams (ii) creation of undergraduate programs in S&T subjects and/or
                         upgrading of existing S&T degree programs in select institutions; and (iii) collaboration with private sector cooperation to solve problems of direct interest to industry, and pursue
                         solutions; and (iv) formal firm-based internships for students.

                         Component 2 supported an outreach program, institutional strengthening of Uganda National Council of Science and Technology (UNCST) and Uganda Industrial Research Institute
                         (UIRI), Monitoring and Evaluation, and policy studies.

                         The Project Development Objective was highly relevant at the time of design and remains so at project closing. However, the project was restructured and the indicators were revised
                         to better align their relevance to the PDO and to make them more measurable. End target values were not changed.

                         The Project has registered significant achievements against its PDO. Four of the five PDO indicators were surpassed. The remaining indicator also registered significant gains
                         towards PDO targets. The Project contributed to substantial increase of active researchers and publication in international peer reviewed journals. There was also a substantial
                         increase in the number of students obtaining undergraduate and graduate degrees. Employability of S&T graduates improved as measured by the increase in percentage of S&T
                         graduates employed by firms active in technology development.

                         As a result of these achievements, the Project has contributed substantially to promoting the STI agenda in Uganda. It was instrumental in the development of the National STI Policy
                         that was adopted by Government in 2009. The Project also supported the development of the Implementation Plan for the STI policy. MSI provided a platform for regional and
                         international scientific community for policy dialogue on STI. The Project’s adoption of a transparent mechanism for awarding merit based, and competitive research forms the
                         cornerstone of the credibility and successful outcomes from the research grants.

                         Most of the project achievements are expected to be sustained. For example, the introduction of new as well as upgraded S&T programs will continue to enlarge the pool of S&T
                         graduates. Upgraded laboratories and equipment is expected to have positive impact on the quality of ST programs. Competitive grants have strengthened research capacity in
                         universities and research institutions. The capacity of UNCST and UIRI has been strengthened. Government will need to provide adequate financial resources to sustain these
                         achievements
