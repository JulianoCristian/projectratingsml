The purpose\n            of this six month extension request is to: (i) finalize the\n            remaining procurement for the highly sophisticated research\n            equipment using international competitive bidding and\n            consumables for the research grantees and; (ii) give\n            researchers and PhD students the opportunity to complete\n            their research activities financed by the round three\n            research grants. The restructuring paper also includes\n            revisions and explanations to ensure uniformity between the\n            PDO indicators being tracked in the Implementation Status\n            Result (ISR) reports and the performance indicators in the\n            Financing Agreement and to better align them with the PDO."}, "docdt": "2012-12-12T00:00:00Z"}
