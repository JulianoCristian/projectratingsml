moderately satisfactory, risk to development outcome was\n            significant, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory,\n            and Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: while research funds are common in\n            Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development\n            (OECD) countries, it is also possible to establish and\n            implement a world-class science research fund in a\n            low-income country. An appropriate cost-sharing agreement is\n            needed at entry to facilitate sustainability. The promotion\n            of a knowledge-based economy requires an integral approach,\n            involving several ministries as well as the private sector.\n            A research fund is a viable mechanism to increase research\n            and create programs for science and technology graduates,\n            but its impact may be enhanced by extending\n            capacity-building and technical assistance to grantees.\n            Requiring data collection for grants may also yield better\n            impact or at a minimum a clearer understanding of what was\n            achieved. Given the low numbers of Ugandan women scientists,\n            a gender focus is warranted."}, "docdt": "2016-04-07T01:13:03Z"}
