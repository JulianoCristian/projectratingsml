1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
1. In the 1990s, Uganda made significant progress in economic development which resulted
in substantial reduction of poverty rates from 56 percent in 1992 to 38 percent in 2003
(World Bank, 2006). After consistent high growth rates and macroeconomic stability in the
1990s, however, economic growth started slowing down in the 2000s, stagnating around 5
percent per year as opposed to an average 7 percent annual GDP growth or higher, which was
needed for Uganda to become a middle-income country within 20 years.

2. Uganda’s economic activity was dominated by the primary sector of the economy, such
as agriculture that accounted for 34 percent of GDP and two-thirds of the workforce. Limited
knowledge of farmers on technical requirements of commercial production was a major
constraint in the industry. Further, the secondary and the tertiary sectors of the economy
suffered from low-tech and inefficient production due to limited financial investment, lack of
policy, and very limited electricity supply (World Bank, 2004). The country needed
significant improvement in all (primary, secondary, and tertiary) sectors of the economy.

3. The stagnant economic activities in all sectors partially stemmed from little attention to
science and technology (S&T) at the tertiary education level. Weak institutional capacity
lacking holistic coordination and cooperation among stakeholders to lead S&T activities
exacerbated the situation. This adversely affected, in particular, three areas in S&T; (i)
education and research infrastructure, (ii) human resources, and (iii) quality and quantity of
research at tertiary education institutions.

4. Virtually, there was no public resource allocated to Science & Technology (S&T), except
for the National Agricultural Research Organization. Laboratories and facilities at public
universities were obsolete due to lack of capital investment. Private universities did not have
laboratories in S&T disciplines.

5. Tertiary education system suffered from limited human resources at the institutional level.
There were approximately only 550 faculty members with Ph.Ds. which caused a very high
student teacher with PhD ratio of 200:1. The number of students pursuing S&T disciplines
remained limited. Enrollment in S&T disciplines was consistently low at 15% of the total
higher education enrollment, which was significantly lower than not only the worldwide
average of 38% but also Sub Saharan Africa’s average of 25% (US National Science
Foundation, 2004).

6. Production of published papers in basic sciences was essentially non-existent in
chemistry, physics, mathematics, engineering, and earth sciences. Hence, knowledge and
human capital required for economic growth was very limited, especially those demanded by
the local market.

7. Considering the gravity of the situation, the government gave high priority to
development of an S&T culture under the Human Development Pillar of the Poverty
Eradication Action Plan (PEAP). The government budget for 2005/06 increased investments
in industrialization, research and development, and technology areas. The budget continued
to increase in S&T areas in 2006/07. In response to the strong government commitment to


                                              1
improve the capacity of S&T, the Uganda Joint Assistance Strategy (UJAS) approved by the
Bank Board in December, 2005 also gave high priority to strengthening capacity in S&T
areas, mainly through two pillars: (i) enhancing competitiveness, production, and incomes
and (ii) human resource development, which were higher level objectives to which the
project was expected to contribute.

8. In addition to the alignment with UJAS, the Bank had four specific rationales to support
S&T through the MSI project: (i) the Bank was, and remains, a major development partner,
and the interventions of the project in promoting human development, productivity and
growth were considered central to the long-term success of Uganda’s development strategy;
(ii) the Bank was in a unique position to be able to address the cross-sectoral and system-
wide issues due to its intensive involvement in private sector development, agriculture,
education, and other S&T related areas; (iii) the Bank had experience in supporting reforms
in tertiary education and had already completed an analytical work on tertiary education
policy in 2002, which became a solid foundation for the project preparation; and (iv) the
Bank also had extensive international experience and expertise in the reform and promotion
of national S&T systems across regions. The success of other Millennium Science Initiative
projects in Chile, Venezuela, Brazil, and Mexico also motivated the Government of Uganda
to collaborate with the Bank.1

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
9. The project's development objective was for Ugandan universities and research institutes
to produce more and better qualified science and engineering graduates, and higher quality
and more relevant research, and for firms to utilize these outputs to improve productivity for
the sake of enhancing S&T-led growth.

10. The following Project Outcome Indicators (PDO) were established to monitor the project
and evaluate its achievement.

PDO1: Size/number and productivity (measured by publications, patent, applications, and
      number of students trained) of researchers and research groups increase by 50%
PDO2: Pipeline of science, technology, and engineering undergraduates and postgraduates
      increases by 50% in key disciplines.
PDO3: Firms active in technology development/evaluation employ 25% more S&T talent
      and enhance technology use
PDO4: Survey of clients shows that Uganda National Council for Science and Technology
      (UNCST) and Uganda Industrial Research Institute (UIRI) provide effective services
PDO5: More Ugandan A-level student plan careers in S&T fields, and positive impressions
      of careers in science and technology increase

 The Science Initiative Group, administered at Institute for Advanced Study, has been the initiator and
main driver of the MSI concept. MSI initiated in 1999. MSI projects successfully completed in Chile and
Brazil supported by the Bank in 2002 and 2004, respectively. MSI in Chile has grown incrementally since
1998. As of 2012, the Chilean MSI supports 6 institutes and 16 nuclei in the natural sciences, as well as 7
social science nuclei. MSI has been evolving in Asia such as Bangladesh and Vietnam.


                                                    2
11. In addition to the five PDO indicators above, there were eleven Intermediate Outcome
Indicators supporting the PDO indicators. The intermediate outcome indicators are discussed
in detail in Annex 2.

12. It should be noted that the Financing Agreement (FA) included a slightly different
wording of the same indicators (see Table 1 below). This was later rectified during project
restructuring but had no effect on the project as the substance of the indicators remained
essentially intact.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification
13. No revision was made to the PDO during project implementation. However, there was a
change made to the key indicators in 2012. Mainly, changes entailed a rephrasing of the five
key outcome indicators to enhance clarity and measurability and to rationalize the two
different sets of indicators in the FA and the PAD. Also, the original first Key Outcome
Indicator was divided into two indicators, one of which became a new indicator. Lastly, the
original indicator #5 was dropped as it was not directly linked to the PDO. There was no
revision to the target values, except to correct the target for PDO indicator #1 (see ICR
datasheet). Table 1 below shows the changes in PDO indicators.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,
14. The project had identified the following as the main beneficiaries:
    Primary beneficiaries:
        Students, researchers and faculty members in STE fields at tertiary education
           level who received the competitive grant after rigorous assessment of proposals
           (Window A);
        Departments of STE fields at tertiary education level, as well as their institutions,
           which received grants for upgrading and/or creating programs with new
           equipment (Window B);
        Firms that had an access to knowledgeable partners from academia to solve
           technological problems (Window C);
        UNCST and UIRI that developed their capacity through implementing the
           project activities; and
        Students and teachers at secondary education level through exposure to national
           scientists, technologists, and entrepreneurs who presented intriguing aspects of
           science and technology (Component 2).

   Indirect beneficiaries:
       Members of civil society who benefited through research outcomes of the project
          researches. A good example is a research product called “milk booster”.
          Makerere University in partnership with Kakira Sugar Works Limited, Kakira
          Out-growers Rural Development Fund (KORD) and Dairy Development
          Authority (DDA) succeeded in converting the sugarcane molasses into a
          commercial dairy feed supplement which enhances milk production.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)
15. The project was designed with two components. Component One consisted of three
windows to develop research capacity of the country. Component Two chiefly aimed to
improve public understanding and appreciation of science, and strengthen the capacity at
UNCST and UIRI.

   Component One [USD 16.69 million] was to provide competitively awarded grants
   through three different windows.
      Window A funded research groups led by senior researchers or emerging
       investigators to conduct relevant, high-quality scientific and technological research
       closely connected to graduate training.
      Window B funded creation of undergraduate programs and/or upgrading of existing
       degree programs in basic science and engineering at licensed public and private
       institutions.
      Window C funded (i) collaboration between private sector and researchers to pursue
       solutions of problems directly relevant to industries and (ii) formal firm-based
       internships for students in science, engineering, and business administration.



                                                     4
    Component Two [USD 16.65 million] was to support an outreach program, institutional
    strengthening, M&E, and policy studies.
       Outreach Program helped to enhance public understanding and appreciation of
        science through (i) School visits program by top scientists and researchers
        demonstrating positive and interesting aspects of science, (ii) National Science Week
        to promote science and technology, for instance, through policy dialogue with
        regional and international participation, and a variety of outreach activities involving
        students, institutions, and the public and (iii) showcasing project activities and
        achievements for science, engineering, technology communities and other
        stakeholders.
       Capacity building was conducted for UNCST and UIRI. The project helped UNCST
        to enhance its capability for project coordination and implementation, and
        formulation and adoption of national science policies and plans such as National
        Science Technology and Innovation Policy and National Science Technology and
        Innovation Plan. Similarly, the project supported UIRI, as a focal point for
        technological development of the industrial sector, to focus upon articulating links to
        industry, rehabilitating the laboratories and other physical facilities.
       Monitoring and Evaluation was strengthened to overcome the paucity of statistical
        data on Uganda’s S&T sector. Continued monitoring and evaluation established a
        better basis for information gathering and data assessment on the sector as well as the
        project activities. Enriching statistical data made it possible to conduct in-depth
        studies. It provided more accurate data to policy makers to make better informed
        policy choices.

1.6 Revised Components
16. There was no change in the agreed components during the project life.

1.7 Other significant changes
17. There were three changes made during project implementation.

First Restructuring approved on February 14, 2011.
  Changes: Reallocation of funds between categories
  Reasons: Building on the two successful rounds of competitive research grants, the
  government and the World Bank team agreed to support another round of competitive
  research grant. The project had enough funds to support the third round under the
  unallocated category (XDR 2.41 million) and Project Preparation Facility (PPF)
  (approximately XDR 0.26 million).
  Justifications: The reallocation permitted the full utilization of the Credit proceeds. It also
  allowed the utilization of unallocated funds and savings accruing from different categories
  for ongoing activities within the design of the project, thus strengthening implementation
  and expanding the coverage.

Second Restructuring approved on September 28, 2011.
  Changes: Extension of the Closing Date by one year from December 31, 2011 to
  December 31, 2012.
  Reasons: The extension was requested by the government to fully complete the third round
  of the research grants. Further, there were some delays in procurement of scientific
  equipment, which needed additional time to be fully completed.


                                               5
 Justifications: The project implementation continued to be satisfactory with 70% disbursed
 at that time. With a one-year extension, it was expected that the project could fully
 complete the third round and all other project activities.

Third Restructuring approved on November 15, 2012.
 Changes: Extension of the Closing Date by six months from December 31, 2012 to June 30,
 2013, and amendment of five performance indicators in the Financing Agreement
 Reasons: The reason for the six month extension was to (i) finalize procurement for the
 highly sophisticated research equipment using international competitive bidding and
 consumables for the third round of research grants; (ii) give researchers and Ph.D. students
 the opportunity to complete their research activities financed by the third round of research
 grants; (iii) amend the Financing Agreement to be consistent with the PAD in terms of
 wording of the project performance indicators.
 Justifications: The following justifications were provided for the changes: (i) the project
 objective continued to be achievable; (ii) the performance of the government and other
 project implementing agencies was satisfactory (with 95% disbursement); (iii) the
 government prepared a specific action plan acceptable to IDA to complete the existing
 contracts and agreements; and (iv) the amendment of the FA would enhance clarity of the
 performance indicators.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
18. The design incorporated lessons learned from relevant project across the regions.
The project drew upon considerable successful experiences with similar project designs in
Latin America, East Asia, and Africa regions, during the project design stage. Given that
there was a strong demand for skills in science and technology at that time in the country, the
Bank, as a major development partner with extensive international experiences, had a solid
rationale to support the government’s effort to improve the capacity in S&T fields.

19. A sound technical analysis on Science Technology and Innovation (STI) in Uganda
and a wide range of consultations with stakeholders helped improve the quality of the
project preparation. The project was prepared based on a number of background studies.
For instance, “The State of Science and Technology in Uganda” (Muhumuza, 2005) served
as a background paper identifying strengths and weaknesses in Uganda’s S&T system and
provided important insights with specific policy recommendations. Further, the project team
spent significant amount of time with stakeholders for consultations, from pre-tertiary
education, to university, private sector, and policy making levels. The consultation process
was documented in a series of reports in October, 2004.

20. The government showed a strong commitment with budget increase in the S&T
development. Development of S&T capacity was a PEAP priority under the Human
Development Pillar. The government put special emphasis on four principal areas: (i)
improving science education at the secondary level; (ii) restructuring of support to tertiary
education to promote greater enrollment in S&T and economic priority areas; (iii)
promulgation of policy initiatives and mechanisms designed to support technology transfer
and commercial innovation, including the Industrial and Innovation Fund; and (iv) the
restructuring of the National Agricultural Research Organization and the creation of a




                                              6
National Agricultural Research Council. In order to achieve these four areas, the government
increased the budget for 2005/06 and continued to increase it for 2006/07.

21. Risks were rightly identified during the preparation. Before appraisal, the Decision
Meeting advised the Bank team to closely monitor the progress towards restructuring the
UNCST and its readiness to begin implementation. The PAD rated the weak capacity of
UNCST as a substantial risk. The project design took into account this factor in the project
design, and the Component Two was designed to strengthen UNCST (and UIRI) with strong
emphasis on M&E. This turned out to be one of the most successful outcomes of the project.
The detail of the achievements under the component is discussed in the M&E Section and
Annex 2 below.

22. The Quality Enhancement Review and the Decision Meeting in 2005 endorsed the
project as “a model for similar projects in the Africa region…”. Indeed, the project received
a lot of attention from neighboring countries during the implementation, and a delegation
from Tanzania visited Uganda to learn about management of competitive research grants.

23. Given the technical soundness of project design as discussed above, the quality of
project preparation and design at entry was satisfactory. One shortcoming was
inconsistency of indicators between PAD and FA. Although the content was the same, the
wording of the indicators was slightly different in these two documents (as explained above).

24. Overall quality at entry is rated as Satisfactory.

2.2 Implementation
25. Project Implementation was rated as Satisfactory for the majority of the project
period. As discussed above, there were three changes during the project implementation.
They were undertaken by the Government and the Bank team to quickly respond to the needs
of project beneficiaries. As a result of these three changes, the project was able to meet the
urgent demands from the beneficiaries, e.g., the third round of competitive funding which
was not in the original project scope, full completion of procurement of scientific equipment,
and full completion of research activities.

26. There are other factors that led to successful project implementation. First, the capacity
development at the implementing agencies, i.e., UNCST and UIRI, was instrumental in
ensuring project success. Both institutions strengthened their capacities through a number of
training programs as well as physical upgrades of the institutions. M&E capacity at the
UNCST, for instance, substantially improved. While there were few publications at the
UNCST before the project, it produced a number of reports providing STI statistics for not
only the project outputs and outcomes but also the STI system as a whole. UIRI, too,
improved its capacity by providing staff with training and increasing the number of its
technical staff. As a result, the number of consulting services provided by UIRI increased
from 5 to 20 from 2005 to 2012. Its revenue also jumped from almost nil to UGX 67 million
during the same period. These outcomes will be further discussed in M&E and Outcome
Sections

27. The second factor is the strong capacity of beneficiaries due to the rigorous and
successful selection of research teams through the competitive funding. The competitive


                                                 7
environment in obtaining research grants was well perceived by academia and researchers.
Most of the R&D support by other donors was modest ranging between US$ 2000-10,000
and unable to support large STI projects. Public resources remained limited, and the budget
for research was distributed based on previous years’ budgets, not competitively. The MSI
project complemented other funding sources through provision of sizeable grants
(US$ 500,000-800,000) for research and training capacity as well as modest infrastructure
strengthening at universities.

28. The third factor is the close interactions between the implementing agencies and the Bank
team throughout project implementation. Regular communication and frequent meetings
resulted in strengthening collaboration which made it possible for them to identify issues and
take actions as they arose.

29. Despite these positive factors, there were some shortcomings during implementation. The
first and the second restructuring could have been done at the same time. This was partly due
to the fact that the Bank team was fully focused on other implementation challenges. Also,
while the client commended the Bank technical capacity and support to the project, the Bank
team could have ensured greater efficiency and precision in administrative procedures,
particularly with respect to fiduciary aspects.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
30. Design: Although some definitions of indicators were not clear enough in the beginning,
M&E framework captured the substance of what should be monitored in the project. Four
PDO indicators and one intermediate indicator directly reflected the PDO: “…. for Ugandan
universities and research institutes to produce more and better qualified science and
engineering graduates (PDO Indicators 3 and 4), and higher quality and more relevant
research (PDO Indicators 1 and 2), and for firms to utilize these outputs to improve
productivity for the sake of enhancing S&T-led growth (Intermediate Indicator B3)”. PDO
indicator 5 was to measure the overall quality of services provided by UNCST and UIRI.

31. Implementation: M&E was rated as Satisfactory in all ISRs throughout the project
implementation except for the first ISR which was provisionally prepared for administrative
purpose. M&E performance at the UNCST was satisfactory. The UNCST periodically
conducted a series of surveys collecting not only project specific data against the agreed
indicators but also data to monitor the progress of the entire STI system in the country. It
published findings of all surveys conducted by the UNCST. The publications include
“National Innovation Survey”, “Science Technology and Innovation Statistical Abstract”,
“National Survey of Research and Development”, and “The Careers and Productivity of
Doctorate Holders (CDH) Survey”. Further, UNCST staff periodically visited beneficiaries
and discussed with them any emerging challenges. Both the surveys and the field visits by
UNCST improved quantitative and qualitative analysis of the project. One shortcoming was
that while actual values against all five PDO indicators were recorded in all Aide Memoirs,
those against intermediate indicators were not always recorded in Aide Memoirs.

32. Utilization: Based on accumulated facts from the surveys and the field visits, the UNCST
developed “National Science, Technology and Innovation Policy” which was adopted in
2009. Further, with the Bank support, the UNCST translated the Policy into a implementation
plan in 2012 and published “National Science, Technology and Innovation Plan” which


                                              8
identifies Uganda’s short, medium and long term priorities in the STI field, along with
sixteen key policy recommendations to policy makers. The whole process of the exercise
from conducting surveys to developing national policies and plans are exemplary for other
countries that aim to develop a national STI framework.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
33. Safeguard: There was no major issue on safeguard compliance during the entire project
period. The project considers safeguards as an integral part of the research management
process. Safeguards are often considered as separate and treated as parallel sets of activities.
This constrains project budgets and is likely to interfere with the research process. The MSI
project conducted quarterly supervision of the project sites including laboratories on a
quarterly basis. The supervision visits were integrated and combined audit with M&E and
environmental inspection. The national environment management authority (NEMA) was
also instrumental in the design and implementation of the safeguards as part of their routine
environmental inspections of all research facilities in the country.

34. Financial Management and Procurement: There were no major fiduciary issues
throughout the project. The capacity in financial management and procurement improved
among grants recipients and at the implementing agencies. However, because this was the
first time for them to work in accordance with the World Bank’s financial management and
procurement guidelines, there were some delays in activities of FM and procurement. Both
FM and procurement were downgraded to Moderately Satisfactory (MS) in the middle of
2011 and remained so until project closure.

35. On FM, the major reasons for downgrading were the absence of the governing council at
UNCST and delays in submitting audit reports. The members to the Governing Council were
not nominated because the Government was proposing legal action to make the Council more
dynamic and effective by reducing the number of members which was not accomplished
during the project. In addition, some delays in audit reports were observed till the end of the
project. Despite these challenges and issues, no irregularities were observed, and there was
no issue regarding eligibility of expenditures for reimbursement from the Bank.

36. On procurement, the reason for the MS rating is due to delays, particularly as the
scientific equipment was highly specialized in nature, and it was procured through
international competitive bidding. Further, for the first round of grants, all international
biddings were combined in one package. This resulted in delays because, for instance, if one
participant delayed in submission of procurement documents, the rest of the participants had
to wait until the whole procurement package was ready. This was changed for the second and
the third rounds which resulted in faster procurement. Before project closure, all procurement
activities were successfully completed.

37. FM and procurement oversights were mostly limited to desk review documents at the
Bank and visits to the implementing agencies, but usually did not include field visits and
interactions with grants recipients. More regular interactions with grant recipients, who
prepared procurement documents, and the implementing agencies would improve the
efficiency of fiduciary management.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
38. A skills development project expected to be approved by the Bank Board in 2014 may
partially complement some of the achievements made by MSI, particularly activities related
to science education. Further, if Uganda participates in the proposed regional Africa Center
for Excellence (ACE) project, some of the research activities supported by MSI could be
further assisted.2 However, transition arrangements to further sustain the achievements of the
MSI are not fully developed.

39. In order to maximize the achievements of MSI in the long run, the established
competitive funding mechanism could be utilized in collaboration with the ACE activities.
Even without ACE activities, a small fund for competitive funding of research activities
would further strengthen the research environment in the country. There is a strong demand
from almost all researchers and universities involved in the project to continue the
competitive funding. It is highly recommended to maintain this momentum as it usually takes
years to establish such a competitive research environment.

40. In addition, it is highly recommended that UNCST receives sufficient budget allocations
to continue to publish important policy papers and reports that describe STI statistics. The
statistics accumulated during the MSI project is an essential national asset. This information
enables policy makers to make decisions based on evidence.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
41. Relevance is rated as High. The project remains highly relevant in objectives, design
and implementation. Uganda’s National Development Plan (NDP) 2011 – 2015 has eight
objectives of which the sixth one states “promote science, technology, innovation, and
information and communications technology (ICT) to enhance competitiveness”. The MSI
PDO directly addresses the importance of increasing and improving the human capital in
science and technology fields. Further, the PDO tackles an issue of improving the
productivity of the country, which is essential for the country’s competitiveness in science
and technology fields. The PDO remains supported by both Country Assistance Strategy and
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper for Uganda for the period of 2011 to 2015 to be in
alignment with the NDP.

42. The country’s priorities remain unchanged, and so does the relevance of the project
components and implementation. In fact, the project design, objectives, components, and
implementations are even more relevant to the current country context where more quality
knowledge in science and technology fields is needed for further economic development. For
instance, industry-institution partnership, which was promoted by UIRI in this project, has
been seen as one of the most critical elements of recent higher education projects in other
countries and regions. Additionally, the competitive funding mechanism has been
increasingly used in similar higher education projects in other countries and regions (e.g.,
Nepal in 2007, Bangladesh in 2009, and India in 2010). The mechanism of competitive
funding is gaining popularity in a more result-oriented context. In Tanzania, the government

 The African Centers of Excellence (ACE) regional project, currently being prepared, focuses on Science,
Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM), health and agriculture, and is the latest effort by the
Bank to underscore the importance of S&T in transforming African economies.


                                                   10
is contemplating the development of a flexible funding facility that will provide grants to
institutions on a competitive basis. Indeed, a delegation of Tanzania came to visit Uganda to
learn from experience from MSI competitive funding.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives (Efficacy)
43. Efficacy is rated as Substantial. As discussed in Section 2.3 above, four PDO indicators
and one intermediate indicator directly monitor the PDO progress and achievements. Hence,
this sub-section discusses efficacy, i.e., achievements of the five indicators as well as the fifth
PDO indicator, which examines the quality of the service delivered by UNCST and UIRI.
Further, this section tries to identify causal linkages between outcomes and project
interventions with best available resources which are in most cases quantitative dada. The
achievements of other intermediate indicators are discussed in Annex 2.

44. The PDO was to “to (a) produce more and better qualified science and engineering
graduates (PDO Indicators 3 and 4), and (b) higher quality and more relevant research
(PDO Indicators 1 and 2), and (c) for firms to utilize these outputs to improve productivity
for the sake of enhancing S&T-led growth (Intermediate Indicator B3)”.

(a.1.) Produce more and better qualified science and engineering graduates:
       PDO Indicator 3 exceeded the targets: The number of graduates in PhD, MSc, and
       BSc increased from 24,245, and 3,241 to 41,633, and 4,892, respectively, against the
       targets of 36,330, and 4,892, respectively, in the final year of the project (Figure 1).
       This includes students outside of the project, as well.
       Project Attribution: It is likely that MSI contributed to the increase in the number of
       science, technology and engineering (STE) graduates at all levels of tertiary education.
       The project contributed approximately 3,600 BSc, 57 MSc, and 31 PhD students in
       total during the project period. Compared to social science and humanities (SSH)
       where there was no project intervention, STE increased the number of graduates by
       more than five percent points from 2007 to 2012 (55% increase in SSH and 59%
       increase in STE). The new programs and most of the upgraded programs under MSI
       increased the number of STE graduates or at least kept the same level of the baseline.

      postgraduate

                                                    11
(a.2.) Produce more and better qualified science and engineering graduates:
       PDO Indicator 4 exceeded the targets. The percentage of employees with STE
       qualifications in firms active in technology development increased from less than 5
       percent per the baseline to 35 percent from 2007 to 2013.
       Project Attribution: This increase was observed only among students who were
       supported under the MSI project. 35 percent of the STE graduates (diploma or degree)
       under the project were employed in firms. The increase can be explained by the fact
       that the improvement was not only in the number of graduates but also quality of
       education provided under the project. Textbook revision and/or production more than
       quintupled. The share of PhD students supervised per researcher more than quadrupled.
       The share of students undertaking internships almost doubled. These activities likely
       contributed to the improvement of relevance which helped to increase employment
       rates among those who participated in the program. The improvement of both quantity
       and quality of STE students seem to have provided them with better opportunities in
       finding a suitable job. It also provided employers with a larger pool of better qualified
       candidates.

(b.1.) Produce higher quality and more relevant research:
       PDO Indicator 1 exceeded the target: The number of active researchers increased
       from 261 to 720, exceeding the target of doubling the baseline (Figure 2).
       Project Attribution: The outcome of this indicator is attributed mainly to the project.
       The project provided scholarships to students who wanted to pursue postgraduate
       education and supported their research through the competitive research grants. Some
       research supported by the competitive grant also provided young researchers an
       opportunity to continue their research activities. National Agricultural Research
       Organization (NARO) is one of the good examples to provide institutional support to
       future researchers. One of the research grants provided training to two PhD and four
       Master’s students through joint research. While they participated in empirical research
       and write scientific papers with NARO’s researchers, the students used the research
       techniques and findings for their theses. Additionally, NARO also hired young
       researchers to conduct more advanced researches. Other research institutions and
       universities conducted similar activities under Component One and contributed to the
       increase in the number of active researchers.

         Figure 2: Number of active researchers

                                                  12
(b.2.) Produce higher quality and more relevant research:
       PDO Indicator 2 was very close to achieving the target: Percentage of researchers
       publishing in internationally peer-reviewed journals increased from 2.0 percent to 3.5
       percent against the target of 4.0 percent (Figure 3).
       Project Attribution: Although this indicator achieved slightly lower than the target
       value, it should be noted that a positive trend in capacity building of researchers can be
       observed with other indicators. For instance, percentage of researchers publishing in
       international non-referred journals increased from 1.7 percent to 11.9 percent from
       2007 to 2012. Further, percentage of researchers publishing in nationally refereed
       journals and non-referred/non-academic journals increased from 2.0 percent to 14.7
       percent and 2.2 percent to 12.6 percent, respectively, during the same period. There are
       currently 88 papers, supported by MSI, in the pipeline for publication at internationally
       peer-reviewed journals. Given the fact that building research capacity in country takes
       years and positive trends in other indicators can be observed, this slight shortfall is
       minor. These indicators were closely and periodically monitored by UNCST. The close
       monitoring provided participating institutions with right signals which nudged them to
       focus on the quality of research outcomes.

(c)   For firms to utilize these outputs to improve productivity for the sake of
      enhancing S&T-led growth:
      Intermediate Indicator B3: This intermediate indicator consists of three sub-
      indicators: (i) technology initiatives lead to acquisition of new technology in at least
      30% of cases (target surpassed); (ii) technology platforms result in follow-on
      activities in at least 30% of cases (not met); and (iii) 15% of basic science and
      engineering students participating in internship programs (target surpassed).

       (i) Technology acquisition was successfully done by two out of five Technology
           Platforms under Window C of Component 1 (or 40% against the target of 30%).
           Milk booster (milk production enhancement) is currently in production and being
           marketed. A GPS cargo tracking technology was successfully tested and has been
           used in Kampala, the capital of Uganda (Box 1).

             Box 1: Technology Acquisition in Technology Platforms
               Molasses Urea Blocks (Dr. Fred Kabi, PI)
               Dr. Kabi developed a cattle feed which enhances milk production (the milk booster). It
               is currently being produced under the auspices of Agribiz Company. Each block of
               5kgs costs UgX 10,000/=. As result, they have also developed another feed for
               accelerating growth of calves (the Calf Accelerator). It is sold together with the milk
               booster.

               Automated Cargo Handling (Mr. Eisah Mayanja of NewWave Technologies Ltd)
               The cargo tracking technology was produced. The technology has worked for routes
               around Kampala. However, for longer routes e.g. to South Sudan, they were unable to
               have enough battery power to recharge the GPS trackers. The company is trying to


      (ii) 140 students (120 at UIRI and 20 in the private sector) benefited from internships
           out of 489 students in the programs in MSI. Hence, it is 28.6 percent which
           exceeded the target of 15 percent. This is a very conservative figure as these 140
           students got a long term internship for at least three to six months. There were
           others among 489 students who did internships only for a few months. However,
           the exact figures of such students were not recorded.

      (iii) There was no collaborative research conducted in Technology Platforms. This is
            because most of the first modules in Window C completed in 2010. Although
            some of the first modules (e.g., milk booster) completed in 2010 showed a keen
            interest in moving on to the second module that aimed to establish a full
            collaboration with industries, they did not have enough time to have a full
            collaboration with industries.
      Project Attribution: All these three specific activities are part of the MSI project.
      Hence, the outcomes above are directly linked to the project interventions.

45. In addition to these five indicators above, the fifth PDO indicator measures the level of
satisfaction towards the responsiveness of both UNSCT and UIRI. Satisfaction surveys were
periodically conducted among beneficiaries. Table 2 shows the results of three rounds of the
surveys.

46. Client satisfaction of UNCST’s responsiveness shows significant decline between 2009
and 2012. This is mainly because the final round of competitive funding was completed in
2010. UNCST’s visible, direct and frequent interaction with the scientific community
declined accordingly. Hence, beneficiaries showed less enthusiasm about UNCST services.
On the other hand, satisfaction towards UIRI’s services, including responsiveness, continued
to show improvement. These achievements are reflected from the number of services
requested and the amount of revenues/fees collected. The number of services requested to
UIRI sharply increased from 5 to 20 from 2005 to 2012. The amount of revenues/fees also
skyrocketed from almost nil in 2005 to UGX 67 million in 2012.

47. On the basis of the above analysis of the three main parts of the PDO, efficacy is rated as
Substantial (see summary table below under Section 3.4).

3.3 Efficiency
48. Efficiency is rated as Substantial for following reasons. First, a simple cost benefit
analysis shows that the internal rate of returns to the project was between 31 percent to 33
percent, and the net present value ranged from approximately US$ 69 million to US$ 81
million, depending upon unemployment rates. Secondly, there was improved internal
efficiency. For instance, faculty members produced more research outputs after the project
intervention. Further, the revenue generated by UIRI also increased through consulting
services with the private sector from almost nil to UGX 67 million due to the project
financial support. These improved internal efficiencies directly contributed to the PDO, i.e.,
improvement of research quality and relevance and utilization of the reach for productivity
improvement. Thirdly, the collected data indicates an improvement of external efficiency,
which can be evaluated by the degree of the relevance of education to the socio-economic
conditions. The data shows the increase in employment of STE skilled workers with diploma
or degrees (BSc, MSc, and PhD) from less than 5 percent in 2007 to 35 percent in 2013.
Lastly, it should be noted that the project was fully disbursed by the Closing Date. There
were minor shortcomings in efficiency, such as initial delays in procurement and
restructurings which could have been combined and carried out earlier. These delays and
additional administrative work reduced, to some extent, the efficiency in project
implementation. However, given the high levels of efficiency in terms of project
interventions, these minor shortcomings, reduce the overall rating for Efficiency to
Substantial.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory
Given High relevance and Substantial efficacy and efficiency, the overall rating for outcome
is considered as Satisfactory. See Table below for a summary of these ratings.

                         Outcome dimensions                             Ratings

49. A Split Evaluation was also undertaken as one PDO indicator was dropped during the
third restructuring in November 2012. The disbursement rate in November 2012 was almost
95%, and the PDO was rated as Satisfactory before November 2012. The weighted values
before and after the third restructuring were 4.8 (5*0.95=4.8) and 0.2(4*0.05), respectively.
Hence, the final weighted value is 5.0 (4.8 + 0.2), which is Satisfactory.

50. Considering all three ratings of relevance, efficacy, and efficiency, as well as the split
evaluation above, the overall outcome rating is rated as Satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
51. It usually takes years to see tangible outcomes and impacts from science and technology
researches. This project is not an exception, either. There are, however, some promising
outcomes which are likely going to have significant impacts on people’s life in Uganda.
Below are some examples of promising research outcomes. More detail information is
available in “Uganda Millennium Science Initiative Project - Book of Abstracts (UNCST,
2013)” (Annex 10).

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
52. Research grants were competitively selected by Technical Committee, and the selection
criteria was not only the quality of research proposal but also the relevance to the country’s
development, i.e., poverty reduction and social development. This sub-section illustrates
some of the research outcomes contributed to poverty reduction, equality in gender, and
social development

53. Poverty Impacts: Banana is an important crop in Uganda for food and income security.
However, in the last decade the country has witnessed a declining trend in banana production
and increasing demand for healthy planting material. The common farmer practice of using
suckers from gardens infected with the various pests and diseases has also played a big role
in their spread from one plantation to another thus causing a decline in banana productivity.
The aim of the research project was to contribute to food security, income generation and
livelihood improvement through scaling up the production of disease free tissue culture (TC)


                                                  16
banana planting material in Uganda. As a result of the research project, banana production
increased its efficiency, which will help income generation and security in near future.

54. Gender Aspects: Preferential treatment specifically to female students was not taken
because of the nature of the project which was designed on purely merit-based criteria.
However, affirmative action policies for female student were embedded in the STI education
system. The Science Education Policy provides government scholarships for only STE
courses at public universities and offers an additional 1.5 points for female students at the
time of enrolment. The effect of this is to increase the chance of female students getting
enrolled under government scholarship and for professional STE courses. There were gender
considerations in Window B projects according to institutional gender mainstreaming
policies of the universities under MSI. A case in point were the Biosystems Engineering
Programme at Gulu University and the Science, Mathematics and Technology Programme at
Kabale University, where Female students were particularly encouraged to apply.

55. Social Development: Solar radiation disinfection water treatment achieves 99.9%
reduction of the inoculated fecal contamination indicator organisms within six hours of
exposure to sunlight in transparent polyethylene terephthalate plastic bottles. The technology
was well received by participating households after sensitization and demonstration during
the study. Preliminary findings suggest that wider use of solar disinfection in rural and peri-
urban communities in Uganda merits further exploration and promotion. Further research will
provide the scientific elaborations for sustainable and affordable safe drinking water supply
at household level in rural and peri-urban Ugandan communities where the majority of the
poor live.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
56. As discussed in M&E Section above, UNCST published a number of statistical papers.
The preparation of such papers changed work behavior of UNCST officers in terms of
dealing with statistics. Their policy recommendations became more evidence based. Given
that the work at UNCST requires a long term vision with a big picture, the importance of the
change in staff’s work behavior is significant. This change characterized the current UNCST
that periodically collects statistics based on which it provides policy recommendations based
on facts.

57. UIRI has gained more credibility from the private sector due to rehabilitating the
laboratories and other physical facilities which improved its research quality. As a result,
UIRI was able to substantially increase its revenue through consulting services from the
private sector. The increased interactions with the private sector also helped students to find a
long-term internship.

58. Research culture has changed, too. Many professors and researchers in the project
welcome the change from conventional research grant distributions which are largely based
on the previous year’s budget allocations, to competitive funding, which is more merit based.
This promotes healthy competition among researchers and improves the quality of research.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
59. As part of the achievements, the research team produced patents (e.g., banana plantation)
and established a company to generate revenues through the obtained patents. However,



                                               17
establishing and managing a company requires a skill set different from what professors and
researchers currently possess. This is an unexpected outcome, and entrepreneurship by
researchers in science and technology fields is an area where future projects could provide
more support.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
60. A series of client surveys were conducted by a third party commissioned by UNCST.
They asked attitudes of clients towards the services UNCST provides. The objective the
surveys was to establish a trend and gauge whether or not there had been some improvement
in the level of satisfaction by clients with the services provided by UNCST. Below are major
findings of the surveys. It is noteworthy that UNCST openly accepted candid assessments of
the surveys and committed for further improvement in its services. More detail assessment is
available at UNCST (A Survey of Clients Attitudes towards Services Provided by UNCST).

(i)   One third of the clients were satisfied       2% of the respondents indicated that
      with the way in which UNCST was               they came to know about UNCST
      providing services. The majority did not      through its signpost;

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Significant
61. The project achieved or even exceeded most of the project targets and left many positive
impacts in the STI field in the country, e.g., functional competitive funding mechanism,
significant capacity development at UNCST, improved research capacity at universities and
research institutions, revised textbooks and updated curriculum more relevant to labor market,
etc. Most of the achievements will be maintained.

62. However, as of December 2013, there is no follow-up action expected from the
government. Hence, there is a risk that the currently functional competitive funding
mechanism may not continue although the mechanism itself can be used for allocation of
future research funding. The budget for UNCST is likely to shrink to the level where UNCST
cannot continue to publish their periodical reports presenting a lot of useful STI statistics.
The outreach activities may also be significantly cut. Although the government has been
considering a follow-up project or activities, nothing is yet to be formalized. Therefore, the
risk to development outcome is rated as Significant.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory
63. The project design was technically sound, taking into account lessons learnt from
similar projects in other countries. The successful project design was also partly due to the
fact that the project concept was developed through a series of consultation with stakeholders.
The project had been relevant from the beginning to the end of the project, not only in the
country but also in neighboring countries and those at a similar development level. This is
why there were visits from neighboring countries, including Tanzania, to learn about the
project design. This indicates that the project concept and design was sound.

64. The project also chose the right implementing agencies (UNCST and UIRI) and provided
them with enough support for capacity building particularly in M&E. This was due to
appropriate risk assessments which showed the need for capacity building at both UNCST
and UIRI.

65. A minor shortcoming was inconsistencies of project indicators between Financing
Agreement and Project Appraisal Document. There was no difference in substance. However,
the differences in wording of the project indicators caused administrative burden during the
project implementation and resulted in project restructuring.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory
66. The Bank team focused on the project outcomes and their impacts on the project
objectives during the project implementation. The frequent interactions with counterparts
and beneficiaries, through email exchanges, audio meetings, physical meetings, informal
missions, and formal missions every six months, were highly appreciated by the UNCST and
UIRI. Both the implementing agencies and the Bank team closely followed up on the
progress of project development indicators. According to UNCST, the Bank team was
instrumental in having the empirical evidence validated and enriched by stakeholders and
ensuring its practical application during project implementation. The Bank team strongly
encouraged UNCST to document its efforts and activities as publications. As a result,
UNCST started publishing a series of papers regarding statistics and policy analysis of STI.
The Bank team also encouraged and supported UNCST to prepare the National Science,
Technology and Innovation Plan.

67. As part of project transition arrangement, and especially given that the project had been
showing progress and tangible outcomes, the Bank team made extensive effort for sustained
funding so that the successful project activities may be continued after the project closing.
The Bank team met with the Minister of State in charge of Science and Technology, and
senior officials in the Ministry of Finance many times and discussed the importance and
benefits of the continuation of key project activities. The Bank team also recorded this in
Aide Memoires and expressed willingness to support follow-up activities. Although follow-
up actions are not yet confirmed as of December 2013, the Bank team made every possible
effort and remains open for discussions on potential future operations. The government and
the Bank team agreed to continue dialogues on this.




                                             19
68. A minor shortcoming was fiduciary management. There was no major issue such as
misuse of the project funds. However, continued delays of FM and procurement
documentation were observed. These delays could have been mitigated with more active
intervention by the Bank team. The Bank team could have had more actual visits to
beneficiaries to address fiduciary issues. Considering this minor shortcoming, the quality of
supervision at the Bank was rated as Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
69. The Bank performance in both Ensuring Quality at Entry and Quality of Supervision is
rated as Satisfactory. Hence, the Overall Bank Performance is rated as Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
70. Government showed a strong commitment to the project at the project entry. The
strong ownership and commitment to the improvement of STI in the country was reflected by
budget increase for STI, policy changes to focus more on STI, and restructuring of tertiary
education and research institutions at the project entry. The government prioritized STI in its
national policy, and STI became a cross-cutting agenda. Further, the government approved
“National Science, Technology Innovation Policy” in 2009 and its action plans (2012/13 to
2017/18) in 2012. The policy and action plans were prepared based on rigorous researches
conducted by UNCST. In addition, the government was very supportive, providing an overall
direction to the implementing agencies and the Bank team at every mission.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
71. UNCST and UIRI significantly improved their institutional capacity during the
project implementation. At UNCST, twenty four staff benefited from thirty one training
programs on various professional fields from procurement to financial management, program
management, M&E, grants management, etc. It is highly likely that these training
opportunities effectively contributed to the quality of overall project management. For
instance, training for grants management proved very useful in designing templates for the
documents for competitive funding. M&E training certainly contributed to the improvement
of data analysis. The identification of relevant training programs was mainly owed to the
UNCST management that analyzed the institutional capacity and made a strategic effort to
get its staff trained in targeted areas. In addition to the effective training, the responsiveness
of the UNCST staff contributed to the efficiency in the day-to-day management of the project.
Frequent visits by UNCST staff to beneficiaries (grant recipients) also showed their
commitment to the project.

72. UIRI, too, significantly improved its capacity. The number of staff increased from 44 in
2005 to 250 in 2012, and the number of services provided increased from 5 to 20 during the
same period. The capacity development reflects the strong commitment to the project. UIRI
periodically kept its records of project progress and presented them well at all official
missions.




                                               20
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
73. The Borrower performance of both Government and Implementing Agencies is rated as
Satisfactory. Hence, the Overall Borrower Performance is rated as Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
74. There are many critical lessons learned from the project. This section highlights three key
factors contributing to the project achievements.

   a) Rigorous Selection of Research Teams for Competitive Funding: The acceptance rate
      of the funding proposal was between seven and ten percent, depending on the rounds.
      This is highly competitive compared to thirty five percent in India and eighteen
      percent in Bangladesh. The quality of the selected proposals were very high with
      realistic targets, due mainly to the rigorous competition, in addition to the functioning
      technical committee with international representation that was tasked with the
      selection. The selected departments, universities, and research institutions were highly
      capable of implementing the approved proposals and indeed delivered largely
      expected outcomes. If a project aims to accelerate the improvement of research quality,
      proposals from departments and institutions should go through a very rigorous
      selection process. Such rigorous selection is likely to assure the effective utilization of
      resources and the quality of outcomes.
   b) Appropriate transition arrangement at project exit: STI cannot be fully improved by
      one project. Hence, building upon the achievements of in the STI field in the country
      is very important. In order to maintain the project achievements, a project exit policy
      such as gradual financial contribution from the government would be needed.
   c) Highly competitive selection for research grant with technically strong Technical
      Committee: Compared to similar projects, the competitive funding in this project was
      highly selective (approximately 10% of acceptance rate). Although the number of
      selected research is relatively small, the research outcomes are overall very
      commendable. There may be a case where even competitive funding needs to take into
      account support for weaker institutions for various reasons. While support can be
      given to weaker institutions in different ways, competitive funding should remain
      highly selective to maintain the overall quality of research if the project focuses on
      quality.
   d) Recognition of the need for a long term strategy to establish a partnership with the
      private sector: Establishing a partnership with the private sector takes time. Both
      universities/research institutions and the private sector need to develop a mutual trust
      and understand respective benefits. While quality improvements of graduates and the
      environment were observed where the partnership between the private sector and
      academia/researchers was established, realizing the full potential of such partnership
      in S&T takes time. It would be good to have a program, rather than a project, which
      consists of, say, three five-year projects as India does.
   e) Strong M&E capacity: During the project implementation, UNCST improved its
      capacity particularly in M&E. It published a number of papers financially supported
      by the project. The papers provide valuable insights to policy makers based on not
      only qualitative analysis but also rigorous quantitative analysis. Accumulation of
      technical knowledge made it possible for the Ministry of Finance to publish the
      national STI Policy and the Innovation Plan.



                                              21
   f) Procurement efficiency: As in other similar projects with competitive funding,
      procurement is almost always an issue at the beginning of the project. This is mainly
      because the beneficiaries, e.g., professors and researchers, are not familiar with the
      Bank procurement guidelines. The Bank projects provide them with training, but it has
      not been always successful. This project did not experience serious procurement issues,
      but procurement activities experienced initial delays due to the same reasons.
      Therefore, future projects with competitive funding would need to consider a more
      efficient way of handling procurement activities, by accepting the fact that professors
      and researchers do not have strong incentives to learn the Bank procurement
      guidelines.
   g) Strong management and oversight at implementing agencies: This project was
      fortunate enough to have a strong management capacity at both implementing
      agencies. The project activities were largely driven by the strong management teams
      which encouraged grant recipients. The thorough oversight of the project was
      successfully exercised with their strong technical skills and knowledge along with
      timely technical support from the Bank.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies
75. The borrower’s ICR prepared by the UNCST raised a concern about the lack of adequate
and sustained funding to maintain the research productivity and contribution to the economy
that has been initiated by the MSI project. UNCST is willing to continue the collaboration
with the Bank in the STI field.

Component One [USD 16.69 million] provides competitively-awarded grants through
three different windows, each dedicated to a specific purpose.

2. The targets for Component One were mostly achieved or even exceeded. The pool of
researchers expanded both in quantity and quality. Institutions strengthened their intake
capacity. The number of science graduates increased. Accordingly, active researchers, too,
increased and they almost tripled from the baseline. Publication in STI field increased,
and business community also committed to help improve student capacity through
internship. Some research outcomes at universities and research institutions helped
business community to acquire new technologies.

b) S&T Outreach: This is under Component Two. The outreach program was designed
to enhance public appreciation of science and technology and its contribution to national
development. The School Visits Program (SVP) was conducted by 30 role models
comprising of top scientists and researchers to provide positive and accurate information
on science and technology to students who are getting ready to make career decisions.
The SVP commenced in 2008 and reached 86 secondary schools across the country,
representing an audience of over 70,000 secondary school students. The program also
reached out to parents and teachers though the schools’ Parent Teachers’ Associations
(PTA).

In addition to SVP, the National Science Week (NSW) was conducted annually to
promote science and technology. Partnerships with academia and civil society were
strengthened; professional bodies were established and nurtured, such as Uganda Society
of Professional Chemists and Uganda Science Journalism Forum. Table below
summarizes the activities and outcomes of the NSWs.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

This annex conducts an economic analysis of the project and examines the benefits of the
project from the economic and financial perspective. It is organized as follows. The first
and the second sections discuss internal and external efficiency, respectively. Section
three presents the results of cost benefit analysis. Finally, Section four briefly discusses
fiscal sustainability of the project.

1. Internal Efficiency
Productivity of faculty seems to have improved as the project put a strong emphasis on
the improvement of research quality and quantity. Research outputs of the institutions
and programs supported by MSI have significantly increased since 2007 (one year after
the project approval). The share of faculty publishing internationally refereed journals
increased from 1.9 percent to 3.5 percent. The Table 3 shows the improvement of the
research outputs from 2007 to 2012. The share of faculty revising textbooks also
increased from 2 percent to 11 percent. The share of faculty applied for patents increased
from 1.5 percent to 2.4 percent. Table 3 presents the improvement of research outputs
between 2007 and 2012.

In addition to research outputs, UIRI increased the revenue through its own services from
almost nil before the project to UGX 67 million at the completion of the project. This
significant increase was possible because of the MSI’s financial contribution to
equipment and upgrading laboratories. The revenue generated could be utilized to expand
the services provided to the private sector.

2. External Efficiency
External efficiency of education can be evaluated by the degree of the relevance of
education to the socio-economic conditions. There was an improvement in employment
rates in the STI fields between 2007 and 2013. Statistics were collected through 450
firms during the 2012 survey conducted by UNCST. The collected data indicates an
increase in employment of STE skilled workers with diploma or degrees (BSc, MSc, and
PhD) from less than 5 percent in 2007 to 35 percent in 2013. The survey was conducted


                                                    39
specifically for those involved in the project. Therefore, the improvement of the
employment rates is, to some extent, attributable to the project.

3. Cost Benefit Analysis
There was no cost benefit analysis conducted at the appraisal stage, and the project was
not designed in a way to collect data required for cost benefit analysis. This section,
therefore, conducts a simple cost benefit analysis based on available data with several
assumptions.

The cost benefit analysis indicates that investment in this project was beneficial, and
that the project was worth investing. Internal rates of return (IRR) and net present
values (NPV) were calculated under different scenarios. IRR estimates from the analysis
ranges from a low of 31 percent to a high of 33 percent, depending on unemployment rate.
Similarly, NPV estimates ranges from approximately US$ 69 million to US$ 81 million,
depending on unemployment rate. The IRR and the NPV estimates are relatively high.
This is mainly because wages of graduates from tertiary education increased more than
threefold between 2005 and 2010. 3 This increase is significantly higher compared to
other education levels. For instance, wages of students with primary completion and
some secondary education increased only less than one and a half times and two times,
respectively, during the same period.

Following sections discuss the cost-benefit analysis in detail: (i) benefit steams, (ii) cost
streams, and (iii) limitation and assumptions.

Benefit Streams
Benefit streams used for the analysis are: (a) increased wage incomes resulting from
larger numbers of the youth completing BSc, MSc, and PhD in science and technology,
(b) enhanced labor earnings flowing from the better quality of STE education, and (c)
reductions in unemployment rates

For the benefit stream (a), the project produced approximately 31 PhDs, 57 MSc, and
3,660 BSc during the project period (UNCST 2013). They are those who enrolled in
respective education programs supported by the project and completed their degrees
during the project period. It is assumed that these completers would not have completed
their respective programs, had there been no project. The benefit of the completers of the
Bachelor’s degree is estimated to be the differential of the wage incomes of those who
completed the Bachelor’s degree and those who completed only secondary education.
The benefits of MSc and PhD completers are calculated in the same way.

The quality premium in the benefit stream (b), too, was taken into account for these
completers. The quality premium accrued from the improved education quality more

  As explained in the text, wage information for tertiary education includes those of students who
completed higher secondary education. Uganda Bureau of Statistics disaggregates education levels as
following: (i) No formal education, (ii) Some primary, (iii) Completed P7, (iv) Some secondary, and (v)
Secondary/Post -Secondary.


                                                  40
relevant to the labor market. Differences in wage incomes in the same degree levels
between 2005 and 2010 in Uganda National Household Survey, with assumptions
described below, were used as an indirect measure of the quality premium.

The benefit stream (c), the reduction of unemployment rates, is estimated based on the
household survey in 2005 and 2010 (Table 4). Unemployment rates of 5%, 10%, and
15% are used for sensitivity analysis.

Table 4: Unemployment Rate by level of education - Labor force population (age 15
to 64)




Source: Author’s calculation using Uganda Integrated Household Surveys in 2005 and 2010.

Cost Streams:
The cost streams consist of (a) total public expenditure, (b) estimated private education
expenditures which include only tuitions, accommodation, and food, and (c) the
opportunity costs of earning forgone for those who pursued higher degrees, i.e., BSc,
MSc, or PhD.

The total public expenditure was US$ 33.35 million from the government and IDA. The
private expenditures were estimated based on the information from Makerere University.
Annual tuitions for BSc, MSc, and PhD are estimated to be, on average, UGX 1 million,
3 million, and 5 million, respectively. Accommodation fees for MSc and PhD are
assumed to be UGX 840,000, and food expenses are estimated at UGX 240,000,
regardless of education levels. The opportunity costs are forgone earnings for BSs, MSC,
and PhD students. For instance, instead of pursuing BSc, students could have found a job
right after completing higher secondary education and earned money in the market. The
money which could have been earned after higher secondary education, in the case of
BSc students, is considered as an opportunity cost.

Limitation and Assumptions:
Data on tertiary education required for cost benefit analysis of this project is very limited
in Uganda, let alone for specific subjects such as science, technology, and engineering at
tertiary education level. Further, financial benefits of research outcomes were not
calculated in this analysis. Although the PAD discussed international evidences on
positive rates of returns to R&D, it usually takes years to yield and analyze actual
financial benefits of it. Similarly, quantitative analysis on institutional capacity



                                                 41
development was not conducted, either. Below is a list of several assumptions and
estimates made to conduct the cost benefit analysis.
     Those who received certificates under the project are not taken into account.
     Private costs (tuitions, accommodation, and food) are based on the data from
       Makerere University where more than half of research grants were provided.
     Wages used for BSc are secondary and post-secondary education combined. It is
       based on Uganda National Household Survey in 2004/05 and in 2009/10. In
       addition, these wages are not distinguished from Arts and Social Science students.
       Hence, the wage information used for the analysis is very conservative. Wages for
       MSc and PhD are 3 percent and 5 percent higher than those for BSc, respectively.
     The working life-time is counted from the time the student graduates to the time
       of retirement, age 60 years.
     The discount rate is assumed to be 15%
     Students gradually benefit (quality premium) from the project, for instance,
       through revision of textbooks and curriculum and new equipment. The full benefit
       is expected to be realized from 2017 because some of these improvements were
       just made in 2013.

4. Fiscal Sustainability
Fiscal sustainability of the project depends largely on the government’s willingness to
continuously support the MIS activities, e.g., competitive funding. The cost benefit
analysis above assumed that the quality of education would be at least the same level as
of today. Therefore, the programs would need to revise curriculum and textbooks,
upgrade scientific equipment, and provide research funds to continue the current research
in coming years. In order for the government to fully benefit from the project in the long
run, the achievements established by the project ought to be further built upon in
collaboration with academia and the private sector.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results
There were two major beneficiary surveys conducted by a third party, commissioned by
UNCST. One is a satisfaction survey on the quality of services provided by UNCST and
UIRI. The other is a survey of active researchers in science, technology and engineering
institutions in Uganda. The latter is to mainly evaluate the first PDO indicator. This
annex presents executive summaries of these two surveys.

1. A SURVEY OF CLIENTS ATTITUDES TOWARDS SERVICES PROVIDED BY
   UGANDA NATIONAL COUNCIL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (UNCST)

This was the third survey in a series that has been commissioned by Uganda National
Council for Science and Technology (UNCST) on the attitudes of clients towards the
services it provides. The purpose is to establish a trend and gauge whether or not there
has been some improvement in the level of satisfaction by clients with the services
provided by UNCST.

A questionnaire instrument designed by UNCST was administered 545 respondents. The
respondents were clients who have ever accessed services from UNCST or
interacted/participated in UNCST’s activities. The list of respondents was also provided
by UNCST. It was not possible therefore to interview new and foreign clients not
appearing in the list. The questionnaire responses were analyzed in SPSS to generate
descriptive statistics only.

The findings have revealed that the majority of UNCST’s clients are male professionals
in the age range of 30-50 years holding higher degree qualifications (Masters and PhD)
and are working in research institutions and universities which are concentrated in central
Uganda. About 90% of the respondents have a good knowledge of UNCST and have ever
participated in its activities and benefited from the services provided.

Generally the clients are satisfied with the services provided by UNCST although there
are areas of weaknesses that need to be strengthened in order to improve the quality of
service delivery. Respondents suggested that UNCST should be flexible in the methods
of service delivery and step up efforts to increase its visibility through more robust
publicity and communication strategies. UNCST needs to consider opening branches in
the other regions in order to take the services nearer to clients and scale up appreciation
of science, technology and innovation as drivers of national development and socio-
economic transformation.

2. SURVEY OF ACTIVE RESEARCHERS IN SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND
   ENGINEERING INSTITUTIONS IN UGANDA (2012)

In 2007, the Government of Uganda received funding from the World Bank to implement
the Uganda Millennium Science Initiative (MSI) project aimed at strengthening Uganda’s
scientific and technological capacity in order to achieve socio- economic transformation.
The lead institution that implemented the MSI project is the Uganda National Council for
Science and Technology (UNCST) mandated to develop, promote and coordinate Science



                                            45
and Technology polices and strategies and their integration in the national development
process.

The Uganda MSI Project was implemented with the cardinal objective of supporting
efforts of Uganda public and private universities and research institutions to produce
more and better-qualified science and engineering graduates, higher quality and more
relevant research, and to assist firms to utilize these outputs to improve productivity in
order to enhance science and technology –led growth in the country. The Project
consisted of two project components namely: competitive award of grants through three
windows and supporting Science and Technology Outreach Program and Policy
Coordination in the country. Five Project Development Objective (PDO) indicators were
formulated to measure the anticipated impact; and this included the PDO 1 which was
aimed at increasing the number or size and productivity of leading research groups by 50
percent measured in terms of publications, copy rights, patents and other intellectual
property assets.

The objective of the study was to collect data that will provide information for the
monitoring and assessment of project progress towards achieving the PDO1 indicators.
This is to be measured against the baseline conducted in 2009. The survey used the
evaluative research design and largely quantitative methods to collect data. The sample
was drawn purposively from the identified education and research institutions detailed in
the list provided by UNCST. Although we targeted 1000 researchers from the different
institutions around the country; for various reasons, only 720 respondents were
interviewed. Twelve research assistants and 4 supervisors with relevant experience in
conducting surveys were recruited and trained to collect data. This was followed by data
entry, analysis and report writing. The analysis entailed generating frequencies, charts and
tables and limited inferential statistics. Following are the salient and emerging issues.

  1. Results suggest that the researchers are on average within the most productive age
     brackets that is between the age of 35 and 40 years although with a gender
     imbalance disfavouring women. The majority of the research personnel have not
     attained a PhD and are largely at a Masters level. A few hold BA/BSc. and
     Diploma qualifications.
  2. There is current effort by researchers to pursue higher education which will build
     and increase research productivity.
  3. About 40 per cent of the respondents were employed on contract and not
     permanent basis and those on permanent basis are slightly more.
  4. There is even distribution in institutions undertaking Research and Development
     (R&D) regionally demonstrating that rural based research institutions are making a
     tremendous contribution to R&D as opposed to universities that are more urban
     based and largely conduct basic research as opposed to applied research.
  5. Researchers indicated that they spend most of their time conducting research
     compared to teaching, consultancy, management and others.
  6. It is revealed that the higher the qualification, the higher the chances to produce
     more outputs suggesting that targeting increased attainment of higher degrees is a
     key policy action required as this will increase research productivity.



                                            46
  7. It is demonstrated that government funding of research is still limited and most
      researchers rely on external sources to carry out research. In addition, higher
      education increases chances of accessing external funds for conducting research.
  8. The fact that externally trained researchers are more likely to access external
      sources of funds than locally trained researcher emphasises the importance of
      contacts and networks.
  9. There is limited involvement of students in research by researchers which is
      plausibly explained by the lack of or inadequate funding to meet tuition and
      stipends.
  10. There is limited involved by private organizations and NGOs in support of
      postgraduate education in Uganda.
  11. It is important to note that the higher the education level, the higher the chances of
      having had a publication in the different forms.
  12. It is revealed that the proportion of respondents who have had publications in the
      previous 4 years prior to the survey dates is low. Less than one third of the
      respondents had a publication in journals (only 35 percent had a publication in an
      internationally refereed journal, 14 per cent in an international non refereed/non
      academic journal, 15 per cent in a national refereed journal and 12 per cent in non
      refereed national journals). Only 12 per cent had published in textbooks and less
      than 3 per cent had patents, utility models, industrial designs or copyrights.
  13. There is more collaboration of respondents with partners from their own
      institutions and less with Ugandan universities, Uganda research institutions and
      regional universities.
  14. However, PhD degree holders have higher chances of working with Regional
      universities than those with BSc and MSc qualifications.
  15. With regard to the type of collaboration information sharing is the main form,
      followed by sharing results, co-authoring publications, joint implement of research
      at the same locations and jointly implemented research at different locations.
  16. A third of the respondents presented research findings to different audiences and
      the targeted audiences varied by education qualifications and whether one attained
      this qualification from within Uganda or not.
  17. Of the PhD holders who had presented results, the majority presented in
      international scientific conferences and a third presented in national scientific
      conferences. On contrary, less than a half of the MSc and BSc presented at either
      international or national scientific conferences.
  18. The majority of the respondents (41 %) undertake research which does not easily
      lend itself to commercialisation, with 59 per cent having an element of
      commercialisation but with varying depth within their research. A very small
      proportion (7 %) was fully confident that their research led to commercial
      applications that generated revenue.

Therefore:
  1. Training of researchers to attain PhDs could form a strategic policy action to
      further improve on the productivity of researchers.




                                            47
2. Ugandan universities should be encouraged to build capacity to increase science
    intake and production of scholars at the graduate levels given the existing limited
    capacity exhibited by small proportions of postgraduates.
3. Local institutions and organizations should be encouraged to provide local
    scholarships for students at postgraduate levels in local universities. In the same
    vein international organizations that sponsor higher education should be
    encouraged to consider sponsoring students within Uganda as well since the local
    unit cost per student will be lower – therefore increasing the number of
    beneficiaries.
4. Modalities should be put in place to enable even staff on contract basis to upgrade
    without losing their jobs.
5. Universities should be encouraged to conduct R&D as well as a way of improving
    Science and Technology (S&T) research output.
6. More time should be allocated to conducting research than especially teaching to
    increase the productivity of researchers who are lecturers.
7. Higher level of training is a pre-requisite not only to increasing productivity but
    also accessing research funds which in the end enhances research productivity. In
    the same vein it is important to maintain some level of training from without the
    country to support networking.
8. Higher education training should emphasise lecturers working together with
    students to develop their research capacities. In addition to government efforts,
    private organizations should be encouraged to support postgraduate studies by
    providing scholarship to cater for research, tuition and stipends.
9. The government, development partners and other relevant institutions should be
    encouraged to financially support publication of research results to increase
    dissemination and visibility.
10. There is a lot of research that needs to be translated into products that will
    culminate into patents, copyrights, textbooks, industrial designs among others.
    Product development should therefore be encouraged and funded.
11. There should be strategic and deliberate efforts to build regional and global
    networks to promote cross-breeding of institutional capacities.
12. There should be a strategic approach to encourage systematic training of personnel
    in especially the public sector that currently cherishes experience and not academic
    qualifications to encourage them to upgrade.
13. There should be specialised training to equip researchers in grants proposal writing
    skills. The training can equip researchers with the expected requirement by major
    funding institutions that insist on adherence to certain formats.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

Project Outcomes
1. The Uganda Millennium Science Initiative (MSI) Project was a successful
intervention in terms of relevance, effectiveness, efficiency and impact. The overall
project outcome4 is conservatively rated as moderately satisfactory5 as indicated by the
project progress tracking activities, the country portfolio reviews and the World Bank
supervision and implementation completion and results (ICR) missions, The project
achieved targeted values for PDO indicators 1, 3, and 4 and partially achieved PDO
indicators 2 and 5. This translates into 65% performance rating which is moderately
satisfactory. PDO indicator 2 marginally underperformed by 0.5 points on account of
over 39 project manuscripts still being in the publication pipeline of various
internationally peer reviewed journals at the time of project closure. PDO indicator 5 had
no target value but posted a decline by 1.9 points between 2007 and 2013 for UNCST
largely owing to the apparent lack of continuity of competitive research funding. This is
because the Government of Uganda opted to continue supporting the MSI activities
through the national STI policy (2009) and National STI Plan (2012) whose
implementation was still awaiting resource allocation from the national treasury at the
time of project closure. The modest performance of these PDO indicators and the absence
of a near term sustainability mechanism underlie the moderately satisfactory rating for
the project. It is worth noting that the PDO indicators which constitute the primary basis
for rating of project performance measured outcomes for which the project was only
partly accountable. Though they were clear and realistic, the PDO indicators focussed on
STI system-wide objectives such as doubling the number of active researchers, increasing
university STE outputs and increasing technology use in firms that depend on other
several efforts.

2. Besides shortcomings in achieving the targets for the PDO indicators, the
performance was satisfactory in other important aspects of the project: The international
technical committee and peer reviewers rated highly the scientific results from the grant
activities. The project beneficiaries and the wider stakeholder community in Uganda also
applauded the project during the various scientific conferences, policy dialogues and the
project results dissemination meetings. The MSI project was credited for having
increased the profile of science and technology in Uganda leading to its elevation to the
top of government agenda as indicated in Chapter 6 of the National Development Plan
(2010/2011-2014/2015). The policy studies that were conducted by UNCST and the
World Bank facilitated formulation of the national STI policy (2009) and the National
STI Plan (2011/2013-2017/2018). The project also facilitated the formulation of several

other sector policies that benefited from policy-relevant STI sector data and knowledge
resources generated by its activities. The studies also provided a platform for regular
engagement between the scientific research and policy communities through policy
dialogues. The MSI was a trailblazer and catalyst for future efforts towards STI financing
especially with regard to the competitive research grants. The project generated world-
class scientific breakthroughs with potential for progression into industrial products and
applications that will improve Uganda’s STI sector and economic outcomes in the
medium term.

Relevance, Effectiveness and Efficiency
3. The project remained relevant and continuously aligned its activities with
developments priorities in the STI sector and the Ugandan economy that are indicated in
the National STI Policy, the National Development Plan (NDP) and the Vision 2040. The
project effectively succeeded in meeting its development objective. However, there were
systemic challenges that affected timely delivery of results on specific projects
necessitating the provision of a no-cost extension of the project duration. The project
completion date was extended from 31 December 2011 to 31 December 2012 and finally
to 30 June 2013 to enable completion of the sub-projects. The MSI project achieved
3.25/5 of its project development objectives as reflected by the five project development
(PDO) indicators. These results were delivered within the original budget provision and
an acceptable timeframe. The project made savings that were re-invested in running an
additional (third) round of competitive research grants.

Impacts
4. The project generated other development impacts in addition to the impacts on the
PDOs: The project initially impacted the host and the implementing institutions and
subsequently impacted the STI system and the entire economy. The project pioneered a
new approach towards S&T financing which ultimately increased the visibility of
UNCST, UIRI and the host institutions for various sub-projects. The outputs in terms of
research reports, products and knowledge resources have greatly contributed to improved
systems capacity and national development. The productivity and global rating of
researchers, scientists and innovators has increased along with that for universities and
research institutions that benefited from the project. STI has started to take center-stage in
the national policy and development efforts. STI has started to enjoy public appreciation
by the youth and adults alike owing to the wide publicity it has received over the past six
years. The impact on employment, incomes and societal welfare are largely positive. The
project directly employed 250 researchers and over 600 technicians. It provided a salary
enhancement of 20 percent on their previous earnings from teaching and research
activities. The increased earnings are expected to translate into increased research
productivity and welfare improvements for their households. The experience acquired
from implementing the project is in the long-run expected to further improve their
employability and earning potential.

Sustainability
5. The MSI project has built systems, capital assets, infrastructure facilities and human
capacities that will continue to serve the STI sector long after project completion. The



                                             51
project principles and practices have been rooted into the beneficiary institutions. In view
of their relevance to organisational development, several beneficiaries have
institutionalised the MSI project activities to enable them become eligible for continued
funding through their institutional budgets. At national level, the MSI activities are
enshrined in the National STI Plan (2012/2013-2017/2018) for Uganda. The plan
capitalises on the achievements of the MSI project and provides a broad framework for
implementing the National STI Policy (2009).

World Bank Performance
6. The World Bank’s performance from inception, implementation and supervision has
been exemplary. The World Bank played an active role in project identification and
preparation under the task team leadership of Mr. Michael Crawford assisted by several
international STI sector experts. A comprehensive study on the STI systems status and
performance that was conducted by the Bank provided a sound basis for the design of the
MSI project. The study findings also guided stakeholder engagements on various aspects
of the STI system that later become components of the project. The World Bank played a
key role in providing the project preparatory facility (PPF) and establishing the
theoretical and empirical evidence supporting STI system financing. The World Bank
was also instrumental in having the empirical evidence validated and enriched by
stakeholders and ensuring its practical application in project design and implementation.
The interest that the World Bank expressed to the Government of Uganda to support the
project for the second phase is indicative of the World Bank’s long-term commitment
towards supporting the MSI project and the entire STI system in Uganda. The
Government of Uganda therefore considers the World Bank a key development partner
and will continue to engage the World Bank in discourses, studies and development
programs that seek to accelerate STI-led economic growth and transformation.

Government of Uganda Performance
7. Performance of Government of Uganda is established from the performance of the
Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development (MFPED), the Uganda
National Council for Science and Technology (UNCST) and the Uganda Industrial
Research Institute (UIRI). The MFPED was instrumental in project identification, design
negotiation and implementation. The Ministry successfully presented the project to
Parliament of Uganda for approval for borrowing from the World Bank. MFPED also
signed the Financing Agreement on behalf of Government of Uganda and has supported
the project implementation activities. The UNCST provided adequate facilitation,
coordination and supervision of the project activities. The UNCST established effective
monitoring, evaluation and audit controls to oversee project technical progress and
financial management in an integrated manner. The project consistently obtained
outstanding ratings for procurement and financial management by the World Bank, the
Public Procurement and Disposal of Public Assets Authority and the Auditor-General.
The rating of UNCST performance is therefore considered satisfactory. The UIRI was
instrumental in running student internships, technology testing and incubation services
using the rehabilitated institutional infrastructure. Growth in institutional capacity and
ability to attract clients and stakeholders puts UIRI’s performance rating at the
satisfactory level. The performance of the host institutions for the various sub-projects is



                                            52
also satisfactory considering that they were able to support the projects to successful
completion. The overall borrower performance is considered satisfactory.

Factors that Influenced Project Outcomes
8. The project outcomes were influenced by a number of factors including project
design, institutional capacity, macro-economic instability and other exogenous factors.
a) Framework Project Design: The MSI was designed as a framework project with in-
    built flexibilities in identification of priorities by the implementing partners. This
    enabled the selection and provision of grants to research projects across several
    scientific fields.
b) The Competitive Research Funding Model: The competitive research funding model
    was credited for its ability to stimulate high quality scientific research within
    Ugandan universities and research institutes. It was commended for catalyzing the
    formation and strengthening of strong senior and emerging research teams in these
    institutions.
c) Project Mainstreaming: Contrary to normal practice of establishing project
    implementation units (PIUs) the MSI project was mainstreamed within the UNCST
    and UIRI structures such that each staff was responsible for some aspect of the
    project that was related to their routine Division or Unit activities. This enabled
    sharing of responsibilities for project implementation and ensured the strengthening
    all round institutional capacities.
d) Procurement Planning: The consolidated procurement method that was used to
    procure scientific equipment presented one of the main challenges to implementation
    of the project at the beginning. This method had the potential to create economies of
    scale by enhancing negotiating power and reducing transaction costs. However, this
    method caused delays in procurement of scientific equipment for grantees due to
    delays in consolidating the procurement plans for the sub-projects, developing
    specifications and identifying capable suppliers for large amounts of specialized
    research equipment and reagents. The challenges experienced in regard to
    procurement planning and contract management mainly originated from the
    inadequacy of the national procurement systems that were addressed through policy
    and legal reforms. The PPDA law was amended to promote efficiency in the
    procurement process.
e) Changes in Project Scope: The project was originally designed to provide two rounds
    of grant funding. This scope was varied due to the need to better use the accumulated
    project savings obtained for exchange rate gains and efficient use of the project
    resources by supporting another round of competitive research grants. This decision
    increased the number of research sub-projects supported by the MSI project but also
    introduced challenges related to the duration of the third round projects and by
    implication the entire MSI project. This led to the project extension from the original
    competition date of December 2011 to December 2012 and finally to June 2013. The
    moderately satisfactory rating of the project is to a large measure attributed to the
    implementation issues arising from the expanded scope of the project.




                                            53
Lessons Learned
9. The Uganda MSI has provided many lessons on effective grant management in the
areas of project design, implementation and results. The lessons learned are expected to
inform strategies for future financing in this sector.
a) Estimation of project duration: The estimation of project duration was based on the
    best case scenario using the shortest possible critical path, with little or no slack
    periods envisaged between the difference stages of project implementation.
    Measurement of project duration should start from the date of commencement and not
    the date of grant approval. The critical path should factor in exogenous influences on
    schedules, procedures and processes along the project delivery path.
b) The competitive research funding model: The competitive research funding model
    was credited for its ability to stimulate high quality scientific research within
    Ugandan universities and research institutes. It was commended for catalyzing the
    formation and strengthening of strong senior and emerging research teams in these
    institutions. The lesson obtained out of this design was the need to encourage the
    formation of multi-disciplinary, cross-generation and intra-institutional research
    teams that could associate to enhance their research skills and prospects of winning
    larger research grants in the future.
c) Relative size of window A, B and C grants: The size of MSI project grants under
    Windows A and B was relatively larger than Window C. Window A projects received
    up to $800,000, Window B projects received up to $1.2 million and Window C up to
    $50,000. The skewed allocation of funds among the three project windows increased
    competition for the grants among researchers but also inadvertently rendered Window
    C virtually unattractive and less subscribed to by researchers and industrialists. Future
    initiative supporting Window C type of projects will require significant funding and
    specialized incubation facilities for product development and commercialization.
d) Institutional strengthening: The strengthening of the implementing and research
    hosting institutions was an outstanding result of the MSI project. Institutional
    strengthening ought to be perceived as a continuous process of institutional learning,
    expansion, and maintaining relevance to stakeholder expectations.
e) Procurement Planning: Procurement planning, timely execution and contract
    management appear to be areas of greatest project learning that ought to be focused
    on in the future. The national law on procurement was recently amended to address
    legally-induced procurement challenges. This is expected to provide a more enabling
    environment for timely project implementation. In similar future offerings of
    financing for S&T, extensive project preparation, especially in regard to procurement
    planning should be considered to allow for pre-inception mobilisation of requisite
    materials and services.

10. The MSI project successfully pioneered the competitive and comprehensive STI
financing instrument in Uganda. The lessons learned will facilitate further strengthening
of the Uganda’s STI system. UNCST is appreciative of the World Bank and the
Government of Uganda support and will continue to engage with them to look towards a
sustainable funding facility that can utilize the unique experiences gained from
implementing the MSI project.

Malaria Vaccine Studies in Uganda: Site Preparation, Infrastructure Development, and Capacity
Building for Clinical Trials
                                         Dr. Thomas Egwang
                                     Email: tgegwang@gmail.com

The major goal of the project was four-fold: (a) to upgrade the field laboratory in Apac District (b) to
gather baseline data on malaria in preparation for future malaria vaccine clinical trials (c) to design and test
novel malaria vaccine constructs in animals and (d) to build human capacity in malaria vaccine studies.
Field laboratory in Apac district was ill-equipped and only served as a collection centre for field samples
which were transported to Kampala. Under the MSI support, various types of laboratory equipment were
procured, a generator (back-up power) and VSAT (internet). This upgrade effectively transformed the
laboratory into a fully functional unit capable of supporting world-class malaria research and clinical trials.
In order to establish baseline malaria transmission data in Apac District, over 700 homes were mapped
using GPS, four cross-sectional studies were carried out, and over 500 study subjects aged one to 65 years
old followed up for malaria episodes in a longitudinal study. The study provided vital information about
malaria prevalence, incidence, and clinical definition, and confirmed the high intensity of malaria
transmission in the district. Current malaria sub-unit vaccines have two major limitations: poor
immunogenicity and short-lived immunity. With a view to overcome these shortcomings, the following
were designed: malaria plasmid DNA vaccines which encoded T cell epitopes from Bacillus Calmette–
Guérin (BCG) and tetanus toxoid (TT), 39 amino acids from Plasmodium falciparum SERA5 vaccine
candidate, and a human chemokine (RANTES or CCL20). Mice immunized with the SERA5/RANTES
plasmid showed increased T cell responses and controlled parasitemias after challenge infections while
mice immunized with the SERA5/CCL20 plasmid survived longer after challenge infections. Baboons
immunized with the plasmids had three-fold lower peak parasitemias when challenged. These data show
that the vaccine constructs are promising and should be developed further. Finally, with regard to capacity
building, five students training in various aspects of malaria immunology and vaccinology were registered
at Makerere University (Betty Mawagali, Sylvia Kiconco, Connie Agwang) and Nairobi Universities (Ruth
Mumo, Wycliffe Onkoba) resulting in five MSc degree awards. In conclusion, this project achieved all four

Solar radiation disinfection (SODIS) water treatment process involves filling transparent polyethylene
terephthalate (PET) plastic bottles with water for drinking, and exposing the bottles to full sunlight for at
least five hours for bacterial cell inactivation, and at least 10 hours to inactivate cysts. SODIS relies on the
germicidal ultraviolet radiation of sunlight, and the thermal infrared radiation of the solar energy to heat the
water. Studies have shown that SODIS achieves >99% reduction of the inoculated faecal contamination
indicator organisms (thermotolerant coliforms) within six hours of exposure to sunlight in transparent PET
plastic bottles. The technology was well received by participating households after sensitization and
demonstration during the study. The importance of maintaining a safe water chain within the household to
avoid contamination after disinfection was observed. Preliminary findings agree with those reported from
other countries and suggest that wider use of solar disinfection in rural and peri-urban communities in
Uganda merits further exploration and promotion. Further research will build on this work and provide the
scientific elaborations for sustainable and affordable safe drinking water supply at household level in rural
and peri-urban Ugandan communities using solar disinfection.

The ability of cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) to withstand drought stress has been recognized for
decades. Breeding for drought tolerance in cassava is currently difficult due to high genotype by
environment (GXE) interaction, the heterozygous nature of the crop, its long growth cycle, poor knowledge
of the crop’s diversity and the complexity of the control mechanisms of the trait. As such, little has been
achieved through conventional breeding methods but advances in plant biotechnology provide new
opportunities for efficient breeding. The development of gene-based markers relating to drought tolerance
will enhance the improvement of cassava for production in semi-arid areas. This project characterized local
cassava germplasm for drought tolerance, consolidated all publicly available Expressed Sequence Tags
(ESTs) and developed Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to drought tolerance in cassava. It
also contributed to both human and infrastructural capacity building.

Banana is an important crop in Uganda for food and income security. However, in the last decade the
country has witnessed a declining trend in banana production and increasing demand for healthy planting
material. The common farmer practice of using suckers from gardens infected with the various pests and
diseases has also played a big role in their spread from one plantation to another thus causing a decline in
banana productivity. The aim of the project was to contribute to food security, income generation and
livelihood improvement through scaling up the production of disease free tissue culture (TC) banana
planting material in Uganda. The project was implemented as a research for development (R4D) project
and involved graduate student research and training, and adaptive research with a private company, Agro-
Genetic Technologies Ltd (AGT). The key outputs were (i) an elite banana mother garden established at
Makerere University Plant Tissue Culture Laboratory (MAKTC LAB, Kabanyolo, (ii) optimised protocols
for rapid in vitro multiplication of farmer-preferred banana cultivars (iii) protocol for enhanced somatic
embryogenesis in recalcitrant East African Highland Bananas (iv) optimized molecular protocol for
indexing banana plants for viruses and status of banana viruses in Uganda and (v) enhanced human
capacity through training graduate students (2 M.Sc. and 1 PhD) in modern biotechnology and
infrastructural capacity for plant disease diagnostics and in vitro micropropagation. New equipment was
procured for MAKTC LAB and old ones repaired. Human capacity at AGT was enhanced through hands-
on training of technicians and sharing of virus indexing skills and knowledge. Knowledge in production
management of TC banana was disseminated to farmers through demonstration gardens in collaboration
with AGT. Production capacity at MAKTC LAB was improved from 6,000 (in 2009) to 120,000 TC
plantlets per year. Six scientific papers were produced for publication. The data generated from this project
is expected to guide future biotechnology-driven banana industry in Uganda.

molasses into a commercial dairy feed supplement. Scientists from Makerere University in partnership with
Kakira Sugar Works Limited, Kakira Out-growers Rural Development Fund (KORD) and Dairy
Development Authority (DDA) in a participatory manner tested the effect of molasses urea supplement
(MUS) on dairy cattle productivity among zero grazing farmers. One hundred Friesian dairy cows were
used to evaluate the effect of graded levels of MUS on milk productivity using four treatments (1) control,
representing farmers’ dairy management practice without the MUS supplement intervention (2) control +
0.5 kg/animal /day MUS (3) control + 1 kg/animal/day MUS (4) control + 2 kg/animal/day MUS. Data
were analysed using polynomial contrasts with linear and quadratic functions. Adoption of the intervention
was tested among zero grazing farmers to establish how farmers embraced the innovation. Milk yield
increased linearly with a quadratic trend. Increasing response in milk production at a decreasing rate
suggested that MUS supplementation was optimal at 1 kg/animal/day. The dairy supplement has now been
commercialized as “milk booster”. Adoptability analysis of the innovation indicated existence of variations
in milk yields across different farms even when farms were supplied with similar levels of supplementation
of MUS. It was concluded that complementary synergies between the private sector endowed with physical
resources such as equipment and feed resources can work together with public research institutions with
knowledge and skills to transform industrial molasses into a commercial molasses urea supplement needed
by dairy farmers as a solution for improving dairy cattle productivity. Even with good innovations in
animal nutrition, improvement in milk productivity is only possible if routine farm management practices
such as adequate basal feed supply, adequate watering, the right animal breeds and overall animal health
are adhered to. In practical terms, this implies that even with excellent livestock innovations, extension
services that that build good stockman ship at the farm level is indispensible. Despite success in producing
a commercial dairy feed supplement (MUS) in a PPP, the challenge of intellectual property rights (IPR)
still exists between private sector and researchers due to different incentive structures and weak legal
support to scientists in universities. It is concluded that despite its shortcomings, complementary synergies
between public and private sector is crucial in translating science into tangible sellable products. This is
necessary in eliminating barriers that have hitherto prevented smallholder dairy farmers from gaining
access to agricultural research innovations that are vital to boosting milk production during the dry season.

Status and Opportunities for Improving Rice Processing Industry in Uganda

Rice is the second most important cereal crop in Uganda. Despite the sharp increase in local production in
recent times, the country still imports rice worth US $ 35 million. Low market value of the locally grown
and processed rice is one of the major reasons for high quantities of rice imports. The aim of the project
was to identify critical points of entry for improvement of rice processing industry through evaluation of
methodologies and technologies in the post-harvest rice value chain from harvesting to milling that are
currently used by farmers and cottage rice milling factories in Uganda. Findings have shown that 98.9% of
farmers use obsolete and inefficient traditional practices and technologies for post-harvest rice processing
operations. The most common types of rice mills found in Uganda are the rudimentary and poor performing
englebergs (77.5%) and mill-tops (20.8%). There were 13 medium sized rice milling factories and Tilda is
the only big rice factory in Uganda having modern rice processing equipment. Continued use of these
obsolete technologies has negative effects on the quality of locally processed rice and causes high levels of
grain loss. The national average aflatoxin contamination in milled rice was 12.6ppb. This is below the
allowable limit of 20ppb set by the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) in human food and animal
feeds but failed to meet European Union standards of 4ppb in adult and 0ppb in baby foods. The average
physical grain loss in the entire post-harvest value chain excluding storage was 23.4% which translates to
annual financial loss of US$ 33.4 million. The study also showed that the average drop in market value of
milled rice was about 12.5% (US$ 15.4 million). Therefore, there was a need to address the low quality of
milled rice and the high post-harvest losses through research, direct development initiatives and policy.
Research needs to focus on improving postharvest processing technologies, increasing the utilization of rice
mill products and by-products, developing rice varieties which take into account consumer preference, low
shattering properties and improvement of cottage rice milling technologies.

The project investigated the viability of applying alternative production technologies for artificial African
catfish propagation to enhance sustainable fisheries for Uganda’s competitiveness in global commodity
value chains. The project was premised on the fact that Uganda’s bio-diversity was under severe pressure,
attributed among others to the harvesting of juvenile catfish from the wild habitats, to service baits for the
thriving Nile Perch export market. The study involved two fish farms: M/s Sun Fish Farms and M/s Umoja
Fish Farms that produce catfish fingerlings for seed and bait market. Nigerian catfish farms were visited to
learn appropriate technologies in the value chain management that could be adopted by local fish farms in
Uganda. Findings revealed that farmed baits (compared to wild) were preferred by fishers in thriving Nile
Perch industry because of their attractive colour on the hooks that result in high catches; the farms were
able to break-even but did not produce efficiently and effectively; Nigerian farms had perfected production
techniques resulting in low mortality rates. In addition, they had innovative marketing strategies such
selling live fish for roasting using the ‘shoot and kill’ approach. The study also identified the following
deficiencies in the two participating farms: high mortality rates, high cost of larval feeds, scarcity of quality
larval feeds, lack of skilled staff in hatcheries management, high power tariffs coupled with persistent
power failures. Major recommendations include: setting up mini-diagnostic laboratories at the farms for
disease outbreak controls; training of catfish out-growers in efficient feed and feeding management;
installing water conservation and reuse systems; value addition for table catfish by setting up smoker
chimneys; installing efficient energy saving equipment and solar power, and establishment of a vibrant fish
farmers association to assist in creating a reliable catfish market.


Automated Cargo Route and Vehicle Management (ACRAV) Investment in Computer-Based

The aim of the project was to design an information system that would make transportation of heavy goods,
using road transport, more effective by eliminating communication barriers between transport
companies/agents and their clients. For example, resources are not wasted on transporting empty trucks to
an area where another empty truck is within the vicinity which reduces fuel cost. Results have revealed that
transporters in Uganda would benefit more from the ACRAV information system if it provided a
collaborative portal that brings transit companies and agents together (by removing middlemen), thereby
presenting increased visibility and greater control of freight. The project developed a fleet management
system which will enable tracking of vehicles cheaply and keep a computerized update of the company’s
assets and liabilities. We found that it will be possible to use the ubiquitous telecommunications
infrastructure (80% national coverage) as a means of communication between the ACRAV information
system, transit companies and the agents, using SMS messages and data via the internet. It is recommended
that, for efficient growth of the economy of a land locked country, it is necessary to have an efficient
transport system that enables quick and cost effective delivery of goods from the ports of entry to their
destinations. Such a system requires efficient and on time access to information, as it is received, by the
various stakeholders so that they perform their duties as timely as possible.
