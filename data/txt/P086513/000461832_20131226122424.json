  Project for Uganda had an overall satisfactory outcome, with\n            satisfactory performances by both the Bank and the borrower.\n            The project remains highly relevant in objectives, design\n            and implementation. The project efficacy is rated as\n            substantial, as is its efficiency. Most of the intermediate\n            outcome indicators are deemed to have been achieved\n            completely, while the remaining indicators are partially\n            achieved. Critical lessons learned during the implementation\n            of the project were: 1) proposals from departments and\n            institutions should go through a very rigorous selection\n            process to assure the effective utilization of resources and\n            the quality of outcomes; 2) a project exit policy such as\n            gradual financial contribution from the government is\n            needed; 3) competitive funding should remain highly\n            selective to maintain the overall quality of research; 4)\n            recognition of the need for a long term strategy to\n            establish a partnership with the private sector; and 5)\n            projects with competitive funding need to consider a more\n            efficient way of handling procurement activities."}, "docdt": "2013-12-05T00:00:00Z"}
