      IEG Mission: Improving World Bank Group development results through excellence in evaluation.


About this Report
     The Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two
purposes: first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank’s self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank’s work is
producing the expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through
the dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEG annually assesses 20–25 percent of
the Bank’s lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those
that are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for
which executive directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
      To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEG staff examine project files and other
documents, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other in-country
stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
      Each PPAR is subject to internal IEG peer review, panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. The PPAR is also sent to the borrower
for review. IEG incorporates both Bank and borrower comments as appropriate, and the borrowers' comments are
attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has
been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.

About the IEG Rating System for Public Sector Evaluations
     IEG’s use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive
at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional
information is available on the IEG website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to be
achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project’s
objectives are consistent with the country’s current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in poverty reduction strategy papers, country
assistance strategies, sector strategy papers, and operational policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project’s design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or expected
outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: high, significant,
moderate, negligible to low, and not evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan or credit closing) toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: highly satisfactory, satisfactory, moderately satisfactory, moderately
unsatisfactory, unsatisfactory, and highly unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: highly
satisfactory, satisfactory, moderately satisfactory, moderately unsatisfactory, unsatisfactory, and highly
unsatisfactory.

Preface
This PPAR reviews the experience and achievements of World Bank support for science
and technology in the Millennium Science Initiative in Uganda. It was approved on May
25, 2006, became effective on March 2, 2007, and closed on June 30, 2013. The project
closed 18 months after the originally planned closing date of December 31, 2011, which
permitted an additional unplanned round of grants and completed the procurement of
scientific equipment for all grantees. The project was financed by an International
Development Association (IDA) credit of $30 million equivalent and the government
provided $2.8 million. This project was selected for a field-based assessment since it
focused on tertiary education and research. The information gained will be applied to an
evaluation of Bank support for higher education by the Independent Evaluation Group
(IEG).

This report presents findings based on a review of the Project Appraisal Documents, the
Implementation Completion and Results Reports, Implementation Completion and
Results Reviews, aide-mémoires, World Bank reports, and other relevant materials. An
IEG mission visited Uganda in 2015 between May 4 and 14 to interview government
officials, the staff of the Uganda National Council Science and Technology and Uganda
Industrial Research Institute, donor representatives, grantees, and other stakeholders (see
appendix C for list of interviewees).

The assessment aims to verify whether the operation achieved its intended
outcomes. The report provides additional evidence and data since project closure
for a more complete picture of the outcomes and factors that influenced them.

IEG gratefully acknowledges the logistical assistance and support of the staff in the
World Bank Kampala office, particularly Harriet Kiwanuka.

Following standard IEG procedures, a copy of the draft Project Performance
Assessment Report (PPAR) was sent to the relevant government officials and
organizations for their review and feedback. No comments were received.

Summary
Science and technology is a priority for the Ugandan government as it aspires to build a
knowledge-based economy through investing in homegrown science and technology
(S&T) graduates and research programs. At the time of project preparation, several
challenges were apparent such as few science programs, a particularly low number of
science and technology graduate students, limited national funding for science and
technology research, and no system to improve conditions for research.

Millennium Science Initiative Project

The objectives of the Millennium Science Initiative Project (2007–2013) were for
“Ugandan universities and research institutes to produce more and better qualified
science and engineering graduates, and higher quality and more relevant research, and for
firms to utilize these outputs to improve productivity for the sake of enhancing S&T-led
growth.”

The activities to attain the objectives included a science and technology funding facility
with three windows: outreach, institutional strengthening, and project monitoring and
evaluation (M&E). The principles of the funding facility were to support open,
transparent, and rule-bound competition for resource allocation as well as merit-based
selection of research proposals by the Technical Committee composed of eight
internationally recognized researchers—half of whom were Ugandan. The grants
supported research and created or upgraded science undergraduate programs with the
objective of increasing the number of science and technology graduates and more
relevant and better quality research. It was further expected that grants given to private
sector firms working in collaboration with university researchers would bring the two
groups together to solve areas of mutual interest, which would allow firms to utilize
research and employ graduates to enhance productivity.

The relevance of objectives was substantial given the commitment expressed by the
government in the National Development Plan (2010) for science and technology to
transform the economy. The project's objectives were also substantially relevant to the
2011–2015 Country Partnership Strategy, which was current at project closure and aimed
to increase private sector participation, strengthen human capital development, and
increase agricultural productivity.

The National Science and Technology Policy developed by the Uganda National Council
for Science and Technology (UNCST) was adopted by the government in 2009. UNCST
was also instrumental in developing the National Biotechnology Policy, which was
discussed in parliament in May 2015. The number of active researchers in Uganda more
than quadrupled over the life of the project from158 to 700 between 2007 and 2012. The
project supported student researchers who participated in research teams (57 graduate and
33 doctorate students). Research was aligned with priority areas within Uganda with a
particular focus on agriculture. During the project, enrollment of S&T students increased
with its support of more than 6,000 students through the establishment of new or
improved programs. Scientists visited 86 secondary schools in Central, Eastern, Northern,
                                            x


and Western Uganda over the course of the project. The School Visit Program brought
awareness of science- and technology-related careers to young people.

The project’s outcome is rated moderately satisfactory based on the substantial relevance
of the objectives and modest relevance of design, substantial achievement in increasing
the number of science and technology graduates, substantial achievement of producing
higher quality and relevant science and technology research, and modest achievement of
increasing firms’ utilization of these outputs. Efficiency was rated substantial with the
expected positive returns from upgrading technology and higher wages for more science
and technology graduates. While the project demonstrated efficiency with three, instead
of two, rounds of grants funded due to its effective use of additional resources as the
result of gains from exchange rate variations, the efficiency of the use of grant money
was not measured. To continue the advances made by the fund requires continuous and
predictable resources for research and program development, which have been absent
since the project ended. Thus the risk to development outcome is significant. The
performance of the Bank is rated moderately satisfactory. While technical and
implementation aspects at preparation and supervision were adequate, shortcomings
emerged related to design and M&E. The borrower’s performance is rated moderately
satisfactory. While the project received high-level government support, delays occurred
in follow-up actions by the Ministry of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development.
UNCST implemented the competitive grant fund well, but shortcomings arose in
procurement. Both government and implementing agency performance were moderately
satisfactory.

Lessons

Based on the experience of this project, several lessons can be drawn:
      While research funds are common in the member countries of the
       Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, it is also possible
       to establish and implement a world-class science research fund in a low-
       income country. This project has demonstrated a competitive funding facility
       that promotes science and technology, and the UNCST implemented it
       consistently with a high degree of transparency. The government did not interfere
       in the process. The Technical Committee awarded grants based on a clear
       selection process consistent with international good practices. This environment
       led to high-quality proposals, a high level of competition, and accountability for
       the grants.
      An appropriate cost-sharing agreement is needed at entry to facilitate
       sustainability. An IDA grant was provided to the government for nearly all
       operational costs. It was believed that this arrangement would pose no threat to
       sustainability as the government was committed to science and technology and
       provided high-level support during the project. In the end, the government did not
       provide its own resources to maintain the research funding facility or request
       continued funding from the Bank. While these decisions by the government are
       beyond the Bank’s control, the Bank has the ability to establish conditions upfront
       such as requiring the government to put more resources into the fund or requiring
       the government to take on an increasing share of resources each year.
                                         xi


   The promotion of a knowledge-based economy requires an integral
    approach, involving several ministries as well as the private sector. The
    project focused on the funding facility to promote science and technology as one
    component of the system. Simultaneously, additional efforts by the Bank—
    analytical work, other lending operations, and policy dialogue—addressed other
    aspects of the system. While the Bank advocated ministerial ownership of the
    topic and inter-ministerial coordination, it also worked on pipeline issues within
    secondary education and addressed research and linkages with the private sector.
    Despite these efforts, the national system remains weak and additional
    institutional strengthening is still needed to bring all elements of the system
    together. It is too early to know whether the new ministerial structure
    implemented in 2015 will have an effect on bringing these separate but integral
    pieces, together to work synergistically.
   A research fund is a viable mechanism to increase research and create
    programs for science and technology graduates, but its impact may be
    enhanced by extending capacity-building and technical assistance to
    grantees. Grantees benefited when they received capacity-building or technical
    assistance, suggesting the impact could be enhanced when financial grants are
    combined with technical support.
   Requiring data collection for grants may also yield better impact or at a
    minimum a clearer understanding of what was achieved. Ensuring the
    capacity building of grantee institutions to implement periodic tracer studies with
    consistent methodology may be a step toward providing relevant data to academic
    programs.
   Given the low numbers of Ugandan women scientists, a gender focus is
    warranted. Giving more prominence to gender could have further incentivized
    the supported programs and outreach activities to add activities to promote female
    participation and address the barriers. In addition, collecting gender-
    disaggregated data would have revealed the project’s contribution, which is
    unknown.

1. Background and Context
1.1    This Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) reviews the experience and
achievements of World Bank support for science and technology in the Millennium
Science Initiative of Uganda 2006–2013. This project was selected for a field-based
assessment since it focused on tertiary education and research. The information gained
from this field-based study will be an input into IEG’s upcoming evaluation of Bank
support for higher education.

Socioeconomic Context of Uganda
1.2     Economic growth in Uganda has been steady and robust since 2004 with the annual
rate of growth of gross domestic product (GDP) ranging from 6 percent to 10 percent,
except in 2012 when it declined to 3 percent (Word Development Indicators). Industry and
services, particularly financial services and construction, comprise two-thirds of recent
GDP, while the share from agriculture has declined from 27 percent to 15 percent. Poverty
has also declined in the past decade. The World Bank development indicators show a drop
from 51 percent in 2006 to 37 percent in 2013, while the government records a larger
decline of 31 percent to 19 percent (MFPED 2014). Persistent poverty continues
particularly among those living in the Northern region. One reason for this is the prolonged
conflict and restoration of peace only in 2006.

1.3     A high percentage of the government’s revenue comes from official development
assistance (ODA), although this is declining. ODA increased from $192 million in 1986 to
$1.7 billion in 2007. Relative to GDP, total ODA to Uganda stood at 5 percent in 1986, peaked
at 25 percent in 1992, and averaged 14 percent from 2004 to 2008 (World Bank 2011).
Domestic revenue collection is 13 percent of GDP, which is low compared with neighboring
countries (IEG and EU 2015). Donors financed approximately 30 percent of the government’s
annual budget between 2008 and 2009 through budget support of $800 million per year (IEG
and EU 2015).

1.4     Uganda has high fertility and population growth rates. The growing population
poses a challenge for the government to pay for the increasing numbers of people who
utilize health and education services, while at the same time trying to increase the quality
of these services (see paragraphs 1.7–1.9).

Education in Uganda
1.5      The education system includes preprimary, primary (compulsory seven years),
secondary (six years), technical or vocational, and tertiary (three or four years to obtain a
bachelors’ degree). After completion of primary and secondary school, students attend
technical or vocational school to gain technical or craft skills or go to higher education
institutions.

1.6    Enrollments at all levels have remained steady in the last five years (see table 1.1).
Previously, primary school enrollment expanded with the implementation of Universal
Primary Education policy in 1997. As a result, primary enrollment is now universal.
                                                    2


1.7    The government implemented the Universal Secondary Education Policy in 2007
which was designed to expand enrollment through a public-private partnership model,
reduce parental burden for school fees, and establish new schools. Data from the
Ministry’s Education Management Information System shows a five-fold increase in the
number of students enrolled between 2000 and 2012 (161, 396 students in 2007 to 751,
867 in 2012) and an increase in the number of schools (1,155 in 2007 to 1,919 in 2012)
(Barungi, Wokadala, and Kasirye 2015). The secondary enrollment rate has increased from
16 percent in 2000 to 27 percent in 2012.

1.8     Tertiary enrollment has ranged from 2 to 4 percent (see Table 1.1).1 At the tertiary
level, more students pursue degrees in social sciences and humanities rather than science
and technology (UNCST 2014a; NCHE 2010). Fewer women are enrolled in agricultural
sciences, medical sciences, engineering and technology, and natural sciences (ranging from
23 to 39 percent), while closer gender parity is found in social sciences and humanities (45
percent) (UNCST 2014a; NCHE 2010). Despite a number of private universities and
colleges, science and technology is mainly offered at public universities, a few of which
have science-related doctoral programs.

1.9     The basic education system is challenged by lack of quality and a low completion
rate. Student performance in mathematics and science has been poor in the Primary
Leaving Examination. For example, 42 percent of pupils received a passing score in
mathematics in 2009, but only 2 percent of them passed with distinction (UNCST 2014a).
Primary school completion remains low with about half of the students finishing.
1.10 With enrollments increasing at the secondary level, some worry that quality will
erode. Core science subjects are mandatory for all lower secondary students. Despite this
policy, all schools are not equipped with laboratories and equipment or are filled with
teachers competent in science and with knowledge of the curriculum. Less than half of
secondary students passed biology, while only a third of them passed chemistry in 2011,
with fewer than 5 percent of them earning distinction (UNCST 2014a). This suggests
further efforts are needed to implement and realize the government’s policy and have more
students equipped to pursue science and technology fields within higher education.

 UNCST has reported a higher tertiary enrollment rate of 9 percent in recent years (UNCST
2014a).

1.11 At the tertiary level, issues affecting quality are lack of qualified professors and low
pay, which forces professors to supplement their salaries with other work NCHE2010).

1.12 While a larger share of the government’s budget is directed to primary education,
the allocation per pupil is higher for tertiary in comparison to other levels. In 2012, the
government spent $415 for every student in tertiary, while a fraction of that amount was
directed to secondary ($103) and primary ($33) students (World Bank 2015). Tertiary
education predominantly benefits the richest—who receive up to 50 percent of subsidies
compared to 2 percent of the poorest (Guloba, Nyende, and Wokadala 2010).

Science and Technology in Uganda
1.13 Science and technology policy involves the coordination of basic science
education, tertiary education, research, development, and advanced training. It is governed
by several ministries (Finance, Planning, and Economic Development; Health, Education,
Commerce, and Agriculture), which has resulted in a fragmented system (MFPED 2009).
While UNCST has responsibility for coordination of science and technology, it has no
regulatory or management authority. Science and technology was assigned in 2015 within
the newly restructured Ministry of Education, Science, Technology, and Sports. It is
unclear how this will action improve the inter-ministerial coordination of science and
technology, as this change was recent.

1.14 Limited resources are devoted to research and innovation. Uganda devotes 0.4
percent of GDP to research and development, which is similar to countries such as Kenya
and Senegal but lower than Botswana, India, and South Africa (UNDP 2013). Most of the
financing (66 percent) for government research and development is provided by foreign
sources (UNCST 2014a). The private sector contributes a small amount to research and
development as most business are informal and few of them carry out research and
development (UNCST 2012a). In 2001, there were only 91 articles by Ugandan researchers
in international journals (MFPED 2009). This figure is low compared with the research
output of Southern African researchers (e.g., 928 articles in 2003) and West and Central
African researchers (3,069 in 2003) (World Bank 2014). No new patents were granted, and
nonresidents have filled most trademark applications in recent years (UNCST 2014a).

1.15 Studies have differing conclusions about the demand for science and technology
graduates by employers. Nearly all medical doctors found employment within a year,
while only half of the social scientist found employment (NCHE 2010. Yet, more jobs
were advertised for social scientists compared with science and engineering fields
(UNCST 2014a). This may suggest limited opportunities for science and technology
graduates despite the government’s keen interest in moving to a knowledge economy.

2. Objectives and Design
2.1      According to the financing agreement (World Bank 2007, 5) and the project
appraisal document (World Bank 2006, 9), the project’s objectives were for “Ugandan
universities and research institutes to produce more and better qualified science and
engineering graduates, and higher quality and more relevant research, and for firms to
utilize these outputs to improve productivity for the sake of enhancing S&T-led growth.”

Design
2.2      Components. The project has two components. Table 2.1 summarizes their main
activities. The first component provided grants within three windows: researchers, science
and technology programs, and technology platforms. The second component focused on
outreach, institutional strengthening, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E).

Millennium Science Initiative Funding Facility
2.3     The first component is the Millennium Science Initiative Funding Facilityand its
three Windows. The first window granted funds for senior and emerging researchers.
Investigators with established expertise and research backgrounds were qualified for senior
grants with a higher budget (about $800,000), while emerging researchers received a lower
level ($250,000). Budgets were commensurate with proposed research activities and
justified in the proposal. Approximately half of the resources could be used for equipment.
A prescribed number of students were to be part of each team. These grants and the funded
research activities were to conclude within three years.

2.4     The second window created new science and technology undergraduate education
programs or upgraded existing ones. The programs were expected to develop curricula
with internationally accepted levels of quality, create laboratories aligned with the
curricula, develop staffing plans, and recruit students, including incentives to attract them
into science disciplines and offer them remedial activities, if needed. All proposals were
required to address how the institution would sustain the program at the termination of the
grant.
                                              5


2.5     The third window tried to create linkages between academia and industry to
promote greater access to technology and skills. Technology platforms were to bring
together firms and partners from academia or public research institutes to identify areas
where technologies existed outside Uganda and could be transferred within the country or
identify solutions to problems firms faced. The goal was to adopt or adapt technology to
increase the company’s productivity. Feasibility studies to understand commercial viability
were permitted. Internships also were used to make university-industry linkages and
provide practical training for students. Grantees under this window could receive up to
$50,000, and thus, technology creation was not the aim.

2.6    Principles for the MSI Funding Facility were open, transparent, and rule-bound
competition for resources. Merit-based selection criteria by the Technical Committee
composed of eight internationally recognized researchers - half of whom were Ugandan.
Proposals were to have a close connection between research, training, and use of the
research output as well as accountability for the output.

Outreach and Policy Improvements
2.7  The second component addressed outreach, institutional strengthening, and project
M&E.

2.8     To increase the understanding and awareness of science and technology and its role
in national development as well as attract more students to science and technology
professions, the project established a series of school visits by scientists; implemented an
annual National Science Week; and conducted public information campaigns.

2.9     UNCST and the Uganda Industrial Research Institute (UIRI) received technical
assistance and financial resources to enhance their capacity. UNCST was given
responsibility for science policy nationally and the strengthening sought to transform
UNCST into a focused organization promoting practical ways for growth in science and
technology. For example, creation of policy research, collection of science and technology
data, and ability to provide advice to government.

2.10 UIRI’s mandate is industrial technology development and knowledge transfer. The
resource centers developed under the project were to provide consultancy and incubation
services to industry and firms. UIRI was also to strengthen its connection with other
complementary agencies such as the National Bureau of Standards that had responsibility
for enforcing and monitoring standards.

2.11 Results Framework. The Results Framework specified a mix of outcome and
output indicators (table 2.2) to measure attainment of the objectives. Key performance
indicators were changed through a Level-2 project restructuring in 2010. These changes
were designed to bring consistency between the indicators in the legal agreement and the
appraisal document, and to provide greater clarity to three key performance indicators and
one output indicator. Key performance indicators were: (i) productivity of researchers; (ii)
science and technology graduates; (iii) employing more S&T talent and technology; and
(iv) more careers in science and technology by A-level graduates. Process indicators were
used to assess project implementation such as effectiveness of and satisfaction with
                                                               6


UNCST and UIRI services; enrollment capacity of new programs; technical committee
seated and calls issued; ratio of proposals and selected grants; and research goals on track.

2.12 The revisions neither changed the targets of outcome indicators nor changed how
attainment of the objectives was measured. For these reasons, a split rating is not
warranted. One output indicator was dropped (i.e., more students entering selecting S&T
careers), which had limited attribution to project activities. However, other output
indicators that were unclear and not plausibly attributable to the project were not addressed
during the restructuring. The restructuring also did not drop indicators related to internship
programs when it was clear that the project would only fund one internship grant.

Relevance of Objective
2.13   Relevance of objective is rated substantial.

2.14 Science and technology is a priority for the government as it aspires to build a
knowledge-based economy. The 2009 National Science, Technology, and Innovation
Policy describes the government’s commitment to research. The 2010 National
Development Plan notes the government’s desire to transform Uganda into a modern and
prosperous country; it recognizes the role that science and technology plays in increasing
competiveness to add value to unprocessed products and inefficient firms. One aspect of
the government’s interest is increasing the value and productivity within agriculture.
Project objectives are particularly relevant because at the time of preparation there were
few science programs and a particularly low number of science and technology doctorate
students being nurtured to support the science and technology paradigm shift. The higher
education system also had few qualified professors. Less than 50 percent of the faculty had
a PhD (World Bank 2006). Internal funding for science and technology research was
limited, and no system existed to improve conditions for research. As a result, prior to the
project, only 91 articles were published in international scientific journals, and few patents
existed for local inventions (MFPED 2009).

2.15 The 2005–2009 Uganda Joint Assistance Strategy, current at project preparation,
included human development with specific science and technology indicators related to
tertiary education. The 2011–2015 Country Partnership Strategy at project closure was
consistent with the objectives and aims of this project. The country assistance strategy
sought increasing private sector participation, strengthening human capital development,
and increasing agricultural productivity. Thus, the objectives of the project were
substantially relevant to both the Bank and the government over the life of the project.

Relevance of Design
2.16 Relevance of design is rated modest. The design was simple—composed of
selected science and technology related activities that can be addressed through a grant
facility. However, shortcomings were found in the activities and the results chain.

2.17 The theory of change underlying the project was that competitively awarded grants
to conduct research and create new or upgrade existing programs could result in more S&T
graduates and better and more relevant research. Furthermore, it was assumed that grants
given to private sector firms in collaboration with university researchers would bring the
two groups together to solve areas of mutual interest, which would allow firms to utilize
research and graduates to enhance productivity. Given the low level of technology
development within industry, the strengthening of the UIRI and the grants can be viewed
as initial steps to promote private sector involvement and development. However, the
project did not include activities to actively facilitate the connection between the private
sector and researchers or new research programs, such as ensuring curricula were relevant
to firms, developing internship programs, or developing incubators within universities.

2.18 While secondary education was a concern of many government officials, pipeline
issues were addressed through other channels and may have spread the project too thin.

The African Development Bank had a secondary education project at the time of
preparation and the World Bank subsequently implemented a post-basic education
operation. Outreach activities were added to address the desire of the Ministry of
Education, Science, Technology and Sports to see linkages between secondary education
and the project. The outreach activities were fully integrated with the facility through the
involvement of the Technical Committee and grantees in the National Science Week and
the School Visit Program. For example, grantee scientists and their work were highlighted
during the annual National Science Week. Outreach activities were designed to promote
awareness and stimulate the interest of young people to pursue careers in science and
technology.

2.19 Institutional strengthening permitted both parastatal agencies (i.e., UNCST and
UIRI) to increase their capacity to implement their respective mandates as well as increase
visibility within the country. Design gave a limited role to the UIRIbecause this
organization was added at the request of the government at a later stage of preparation with
the sole purpose of institutional strengthening. With hindsight, greater involvement by
UIRI in project activities, particularly within Window C, may have been warranted given
the institute’s mission of socioeconomic transformation through enhanced technology use
and its connection with the Ministry of Commerce.

2.20 Gender balance was not addressed in the design despite few women scientists in
Uganda (UNCST 2014a). Persistent efforts are needed to change attitudes about women
having careers in science and technology (Hamer, Frinking, and Horlings 2005; Taeb and
others 2005) and address constraints such as unfriendly educational environments (AAUW
2001, Asiimwe 2008) and the lack of role models (Kwesiga 2002). Grants were not required
to address this aspect. At a minimum, the project should have tracked gender-
disaggregated data to understand if more women were leading research and studying
science and technology.

2.21 The project's objectives, components, and outcome measures were generally
logically linked, but weaknesses were found in the results chain. Most of the key
performance indicators measured science and technology in Uganda rather than measures
attributable to project interventions. For example, data related to undergraduate and
graduate enrollment in S&T, and the numbers of researchers, publications, patents and
intellectual property were countrywide. Given the limited nature of the grants, indicators
restricted to measuring impact may have been more appropriate, such as S&T enrollment
through grants, publications arising from grant funding, and number of scientists supported
with grants. It is notable that the Results Framework contained an employment indicator,
but the one selected (i.e., increasing the number of S&T graduates within technology
firms) was not aligned with grant activities and thus outside the project’s scope. A more
appropriate measure may have been tracer studies of the students who benefitted from
grant funding or the percentage of the grant-supported graduates who were employed in
S&T fields within six months. No indicator was established to identify results of the
research grants during the life of the project. Instead, only process-related aspects of the
grants were tracked. As a result, researchers viewed the completion of the research as the
result.
                                              9


2.22 The intermediate outcome and output indicators generally aligned with the project
activities. However, an assumption within the Results Framework was that grants would
establish internship programs between technology firms and universities. This did not
become a reality as only one grantee implemented an internship program connected to
industry and the technical college. Thus, some of the indicators within the Framework
were not relevant to the project (i.e., 15 percent of S&T students participate in internship
programs 15 percent of interns receive employment offers upon graduation) and were not
revised during restructuring. The prominence of the private sector and technologically
advanced firms within the Results Framework was another assumption. Given the limited
level of technology development, the project’s emphasis on these firms may have been an
incorrect assumption, as the more likely beneficiaries of Window C were small- and
medium-size enterprises.

3. Implementation
3.1     The project was approved on May 25, 2006, became effective on March 2, 2007,
and closed on June 30, 2013—18 months after the original date of December 31, 2011,
which permitted an additional unplanned round of grants and completion of procurement
of scientific equipment for all grantees. The project was restructured (Level 2) and neither
development objectives nor key outcome targets were changed.

3.2     The project was implemented by UNCST, which had responsibility for
coordination and implementation. The agency was led by an executive committee with
oversight of the project. Staff from UNCST had day-to-day responsibility for all facets of
project management, but the selection of grants was the responsibility of the Technical
Committee. The committee’s mandate was to ensure the peer review process was high
quality, transparent, and competitive. While UIRI was also part of the project, it had no
role in project management.

3.3     The project fully disbursed the $30.00 million IDA credit. The credit covered all
project costs and financed both foreign and local expenditures, up to agreed limits for each
disbursement category. The government provided $2.81 million through resources to the
implementing agency, which was slightly less than the total amount anticipated at appraisal
($3.35 million). At the time of project preparation, the government requested, and IDA
agreed, that IDA resources would cover total project costs. This arrangement was believed
to pose no threat to project sustainability. In hindsight, while this financing arrangement
permitted experimentation to see whether a research fund facility is a viable mechanism for
Uganda, it did not facilitate ownership. Subsequently, the government neither provided its
own resources nor did it request follow-up funding by the Bank, as it had promised before
the third call for grant proposals was initiated.

3.4     The project was rated satisfactory by the Bank on implementation progress and
progress on achieving the development objective in nearly every Implementation Status
Report. Disbursement took place at a pace close to the planned schedule. The IDA credit
was fully disbursed. As table 3.1 shows, slightly more resources than planned went to the
first component (grants), as three rounds of grants were provided rather than the two
planned (World Bank 2013).

3.5     The project took some limited measures to advance women within science and
technology. For example, the chair of the Technical Committee was a women scientist,
which was a conscious decision of the task team leader. She and other female members of
the Technical Committee were a visible part of each National Science Week. UNCST also
conducted outreach activities to women scientists to increase the number of female
applicants since the first call yielded few. According to respondents, women were part of
research teams and enrolled in the supported programs; however, project monitoring did
not track their number.

Implementation Experience
3.6     The MSI Fund was well implemented. The grant selection process was highly
competitive. Across the three calls less than 10 percent of proposals were selected (table
3.2). Respondents consistently described the process as clear and transparent, which
reflected the high caliber of the Technical Committee’s members—four international and
four Ugandan scientists. The Technical Committee reviewed all proposals. Those
shortlisted presented full proposals and made presentations to the committee, which had
autonomy to make its decisions with no interference from the government.

3.7     A mid-term review was conducted in September 2010, at which time over half of
the project funds had been disbursed ($17 million). Across the two rounds of grants, $23.2
million had been awarded.
                                             11


3.8    The Bank team engaged actively in science and technology policy dialogue with
the government over the course of the project, including on the issue of the inability of
secondary schools to implement science curriculum mandates. The dialogue also revolved
around broader issues such as funding for science, technology, and innovation in the
national budget and the need for ministerial responsibility and coordination of science and
technology. The Bank produced several economic and sector works (Brar and others 2011;
Nanyonjo 2007) specific to Uganda which facilitated policy dialogue. During
implementation, there was an active donor education roundtable with rotating leadership,
coordinated by the Bank.

Implementation of Monitoring and Evaluation
3.9     UNCST was responsible for conducting policy studies and collecting and
monitoring project performance indicators. Project indicators and policy studies were
collected either by UNCST staff or consultants. Consultants prepared surveys related to the
size and productivity of active research teams, client satisfaction with UNCST and UIRI
services, and the impressions of high school students about science and technology careers.
The survey of students included the districts of Apack, Arua, Buliisa, Gulu, Homa,
Kampala, Lira, Luwero, Masaka, Masindi, Mubend, Mukono, Nadasongola, and Nebbi.
UNCST supervised all survey collection.

3.10 The Implementation Supervision Reports rated M&E as satisfactory over the
course of the project. Efforts were made during preparation to define terms to ensure
consistent application of which tertiary education programs constitute science and
technology (i.e., natural sciences, engineering programs, and medicine) as well as who was
considered a researcher and what measured his or her productivity. Baseline data collection
were predominantly completed during preparation and finalized within a few months of
project effectiveness. Outcome indicators were routinely updated, which permitted
assessment of attainment of objective during implementation. Important sources of data,
previously unavailable, were collected over the course of the project. Since project closure,
UNCST has continued to update annual surveys and publish annual science and
technology statistics. The quality of the data collected was high—data collected by
UNCST was consistent with those collected in the field during IEG’s mission.

Safeguards
3.11 The project was classified as category “B” under OP/BP4.01 Environmental
Assessment as the result of concerns about laboratory safety, safe disposal of waste, and
potential construction of laboratories. The OP/BP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement safeguard
policy was also invoked to mitigate potential negative impact in the unlikely event of land
acquisition. This was a precautionary measure because the types of grants to be selected
were not known at preparation. No new land was acquired related to the new programs
established with grants.

3.12 The National Environmental Management Agency was consulted during
preparation as the entity responsible for monitoring laboratory safety. An Environmental
and Social Management Framework was prepared by the government and specified
mitigation measures for potentially negative impacts from project activities.
                                             12


3.13 Satisfactory ratings for safeguard compliance were noted in Implementation
Supervision Reports throughout the project, and no issues were identified in project
records nor reported by respondents. The National Environmental Management Agency
determined that the implementing agency met all the requirements of the Environmental
and Social Management Framework. The implementing agency had to ensure grantees
adhered to the framework with collaboration from the National Environmental
Management Agency. These requirements were incorporated into the project operational
manual. Respondents from the implementing agency and grantees reported compliance
with them.

Fiduciary
3.14 The Bank assessed financial management and procurement capacity. The Country
Financial Accountability Assessment showed improvements in Public Financial
Management Systems. The assessment conducted for this operation concluded that the
financial management arrangements satisfied the Bank’s requirements, as long as the
implementing agency maintained appropriate staffing throughout the project.

3.15 The project implementation plan and operations manual were developed and
finalized during preparation. They provided details about financial management and
procurement often not developed prior to project effectiveness, which established a solid
foundation for fiduciary management. For example, the flow of funds and financial
reporting cycle were outlined, including the responsibilities of grantees. Formats for
submission of an annual budget, work plans, and interim financial reports were developed.

3.16 Ratings within implementation supervision reports were satisfactory for fiduciary
compliance. During the course of the operation, financial statements were submitted on
time, were unqualified, and of acceptable quality. The first annual budget was adequate,
but subsequent ones improved. Regular internal audits were carried out. A few instances of
insufficient project funds to pay suppliers suggest the need for better financial planning.
There were also instances of poor fund management by grantees, such as payment of
allowances in lieu of hiring new staff without the required approvals. Disbursements
between UNCST and grantees were smooth.

3.17 After the unplanned third round of grants was awarded, the project faced a serious
issue of financial resource constraints. The implementing agency had to determine
available excess funding from previous rounds and estimate the gains made from exchange
rate fluctuations in order to make a realistic assessment of the number of grantees that
could be covered. Because there was likely to be a shortfall, the third round was initiated
with the understanding the government would request additional IDA financing for the
project and not utilize existing funds. However, the government did not provide additional
resources nor make a request to the Bank.

3.18 During preparation, the procurement assessment detected several weakness in the
procurement capacity of UNCST. A concern was expressed about the level of experience
of the procurement staff who had no prior experience with World Bank procurement
procedures or those of other similar international organizations. To remedy this concern,
the project preparation facility provided intensive capacity building through a consultant
                                            13


experienced with World Bank procedures. Staff participated in procurement training in
Washington, DC and at the World Bank’s offices in Ghana.

3.19 Despite the support provided, procurement challenges surfaced, specifically long
delays. Most grantees did not feel their institutions had the capacity to undertake
procurement. Thus, UNCST implemented all procurement, as grantees assumed that
central procurement would be more efficient and bulk ordering would result in cost
savings. Even though additional procurement officers were hired, delays occurred during
each grant round. They decreased with the third round. Some of the delays were outside
the control of the implementing agency, such as the time (six months) for the Tax Office to
clear scientific equipment, which were tax exempt. In many cases, grantees did not provide
the specificity of detail to complete the orders, and some grantees were tardy with their
requests. Because the implementing agency decided to procure for all grantees together,
grants were uniformly delayed because the weakest link set the pace. While all respondents
pointed out the shortcomings in procurement and the negative impact of the delays created
for grantees, they felt the delays should have been anticipated in the planning timeline
given the complexity of the task of ordering specialized scientific equipment. Even so,
procurement was predominantly rated satisfactory by the Bank, with a few ratings of
moderately satisfactory.

4. Achievement of the Objectives
Objective 1: Produce more and better quality S&T graduates
4.1      The achievement of this objective is rated substantial. The project supported two
activities to produce more and better quality S&T graduates: outreach activities and grants
(both Windows A and B). Evidence of the implementation of these activities and their
impact is presented below.

Outputs
4.2     Outreach activities. National Science Week was held annually during the course
of the project. This fora brought together grantees, leading scientists, policy makers, and
youth. The first event was held in Kampala and later events included other areas of the
country, such as Busia, Gulu, Kabale, Kabarole, Mbarara, and Tororo. Activities included
a National Conference for Researchers, science competitions, youth science activities (e.g.,
tree planting and various science camps), exhibitions, and policy dialogues. Interviewees
reported this activity brought excitement and enthusiasm about the importance of science
and technology.

4.3    Scientists visited 86 secondary schools in Central, Eastern, Northern, and Western
Uganda over the course of the project. The School Visit Program was intended to bring
awareness to youth of science- and technology-related careers. A survey to measure
perceptions of secondary students was conducted before the project implemented its
outreach activities. A follow-up survey was done in the same schools but with a different
group of students. This revealed an increase in more positive attitudes by secondary
students toward studying S&T. There were regional and gender attitudinal differences
(UNCST 2010b). While 85 percent of students surveyed enjoyed studying mathematics
and science, more boys than girls rated themselves as excellent and very interested in
                                             14


mathematics and science. More than half of students selected these areas for A-level
subjects.

4.4    Grants. Senior and emerging research grants required a specified number of
students participating in the research. These grants supported 57 masters and 33 PhD
students. Grant resources covered the students’ stipend and tuition. R research topics
covered the fields of health, biomedicine, agriculture, engineering, conservation, veterinary
pathology, chemistry, and information science. Thus, the grants not only supported the
students’ academic studies, but also gave them practical research experience.

4.5      Not all of the student researchers were able to graduate during the grant period;
however, by the time of the IEG mission, most of them were reported to have graduated.
The duration of the research grant was not sufficient for students to complete their studies.
Grantees told the IEG mission that the scientific equipment arrived at the final stage of the
grant, and they had to find ways to deal with this. Several grantees reported to the IEG
mission that they had to obtain funding for PhD students to complete the research at other
institutions (often outside Uganda), which was an unforeseen expense. Other students had
to wait to complete their research.

4.6     The project also supported university grants to establish new or upgrade existing
S&T programs. Ten grants were awarded—four new programs and six upgraded programs.
Half of these grants benefitted one institution—Makerere University, which has the largest
share of science and technology programs. New bachelor degree programs at Gulu,
Makerere, and Busitema universities included textile engineering, biosystems engineering,
and biotechnology. Two programs at Kabale and Kyambogo universities trained secondary
teachers in mathematics and science curriculum. Updated programs at Makerere and
Mbarara universities included physics, medicine, surveying, and pharmaceutical sciences.
As part of the grant applications, universities made a commitment to maintain the program
once the grant ended. All of these programs have continued since the ending of the MSI
project in June 2013 (see table 4.1).

4.7     Every program has increased or maintained the number of students enrolled every
year except for one, which suggests sustained program capacity above the target of 70
percent established at preparation. The physics program at Makerere University
experienced a drop in enrollment as the University expanded other programs, but
enrollment stabilized and increased in recent years. The program that trained diploma
students to become secondary mathematics and science teachers experienced a decreasing
number of students as tuition assistance ceased at the end of the grant. This lack of
assistance had particularly negative consequences on female and poorer students, as they
were the first to drop out. While the program started out as distance learning, it has been
merged within a teacher education program at Kabale University. (See appendix B for
graduates of MSI-supported programs.)

4.8     Curricula were developed by grants. All programs were, and continue to be,
accredited by the National Council for Higher Education. The accreditation process is
meant to validate that the program’s content is of high quality based on international
standards and relevant to Uganda’s needs. However, no one reported to the IEG mission
that curricula were developed in collaboration with the private sector, which could have
provided an advisory or review function of practical relevance or involvement in internship
programs.

4.9     Laboratories were established, faculties were trained, equipment was supplied, and
infrastructure was developed. Several universities established partnerships with other
universities in Europe, South Africa, and the United States. Respondents noted that visits
to these schools were an important means of support and provided a model for program
development. These additional sources of technical assistance combined with the grant
resources were reported to be particularly effective in enhancing quality.

4.10 A minority of programs established linkages with the local community. For
example, the medical program at Makerere University partnered with local health clinics.
Representatives from Gulu University promoted extension, outreach, and training
programs. However, the topic of local development was not commonly discussed among
                                                      16


the grantees interviewed by the IEG mission. There was no requirement for grantees to
provide students with community service opportunities, provide technical assistance to
local government or other institutions, or develop linkages with the private sector.

4.11 Nationally, there is an increasing enrollment trend of S&T students in Uganda
(table 4.2). During the project period, more than 10,000 bachelor students, nearly 500
masters students, and over 300 doctorate students enrolled in science related fields. The
project contributed by supporting 33 PhD, 57 masters of science, and more than 6,000
bachelor of science students, based on data collected during the IEG mission (see table
4.1).2 Clearly, the biggest project impact was the increase in the number of new science-
related undergraduates by about two-thirds.

Outcomes

4.12 The growth in science and technology fields between 2008 and 2012 outpaced
those in the social sciences and humanities (table 4.2). The largest rate of growth was in
PhD scientists (79 in 2008 to 402 in 2012). At the bachelor’s degree level, science and
technology enrollment more than doubled (12,498 in 2008; 29,392 in 2012), with a
decrease in those enrolled in humanities. Science and technology masters enrollment also
rose, although not at the rate of growth experienced at the other levels (1,178 in 2008;
1,634 in 2012). Given the time it takes students to complete a doctorate, all of these
changes cannot be solely attributed to project activities. The government provides a
scholarship program and in recent years has prioritized support for students studying
within science and technology. Donors and other bilateral aid agencies, such as Sweden
and the European Commission, have also provided student scholarships.

4.13 During the project, tracer studies were not conducted; however, grantees reported
they had completed one since project closure. Respondents from three different university
programs wanted to know if their students were employed and in what fields to assess
program effectiveness. All students were employed within six months, according to their
reports. Respondents believed that tracer studies, along with the time and resources to
complete the studies, should have been part of the grant process. This type of evaluation

2
    Students were supported through research or program grants.
                                             17


was not costly, as they utilized student associations and social media to track students.
Formal internal university reports documenting these tracer studies were not shared with
IEG, thus the strength of these reports is unclear. The project did not collect data showing
the percentage of the grant supported graduates that were employed in S&T fields within
six months.

Objective 2: Produce higher quality and relevant research
4.14 The achievement of this objective is rated substantial. There were three activities
that the project supported to produce higher quality and relevant research: the Better
Research Program, grants to researchers, and institutional strengthening of UNCST.

Outputs

4.15 Better Research Program. UNCST provided training in writing grant proposals
prior to each call. The program had a high level of participation with 303 researchers being
trained. Researchers from all the public and leading private universities and major research
institutes (i.e., agriculture, crops, and fisheries) participated. Respondents told the IEG
mission that the Millennium Science Initiative was the most competitive process they had
ever experienced. The quality of the proposals increased in each round, according to
UNCST staff. IEG randomly selected and reviewed one-third of the grants across the three
calls. Review of this sample confirmed the high quality of the initial application and
closing reports. Principal investigators reported to IEG that their grant writing skills
improved through the Better Research Program. They also reported that since the MSI
grant process, they secured funding from the Gates Foundation, other donors, U.S.
National Institutes of Health, and other programs. These claims are consistent with data
collected by UNCST showing that 32 Ugandan researchers in 2012 received funding of
more than $50,000—a marked increase over the 9 received in 2007 (UNCST 2013).

4.16 Institutional strengthening of UNCST. During the course of the project,
Uganda’s National Policy for Science and Technology (MFPED 2009) was developed by
UNCST and was adopted by the government in 2009. UNCST was also instrumental in
developing the National Biotechnology Policy. Policy studies, such as on science
technology and innovation (UNCST 2010a), were developed and disseminated at a two-
day policy workshop. Another policy study explored the topic of increasing participation
of women in science and technology.

4.17 Training and capacity development were provided for 45 UNCST staff. Training
was related to project implementation and management as well as S&T topics to improve
staff capacity to implement its institutional mandate.

4.18 Science and technology statistics and publications begun during the project have
been updated and published annually. For example, UNCST has continued collecting
country-level data related to the number of researchers, publications, and intellectual
property.

4.19 Research Grants. Twenty-five grants to senior researchers (about $800,000) and
emerging researchers ($250,000) were awarded. Principal investigators commented
                                             18


positively on the size of the grant, noting most of the aims of the research were achieved
and capacity was built through the acquisition of scientific equipment. Researchers told the
IEG mission that lack of resources and equipment were a constraint. With grant resources,
they were able to upgrade laboratories, buy scientific equipment, and engage in more
specialized research such as biogenetics. Every researcher stressed the importance of
scientific equipment to sustainability as procured items remained in use. Capacity to
maintain the specialized equipment was an identified constraint. Without this knowledge,
expensive equipment may fall into disrepair and need to be replaced. The project
operational manual noted that grantee institutions should have capacity and responsibility
to maintain procured equipment.

4.20 Research was aligned with priority areas within Uganda with a special focus on
agriculture studies (see table 4.3). Critical sectors for science and technology investment
included environmental science and engineering, ecology science, food and agriculture
science, health, and civil and transportation engineering (World Bank 2011). Agricultural
research was highlighted in Uganda’s National Development Plan (2010) to boost
production and productivity. Consistent with the plan’s emphasis on animal and crop
disease, research grants focused on making cassava more disease-resistant and growing
crops that can tolerate dry and drought conditions. As recommended by previous IEG
evaluations (IEG 2007), the research focused on staple food products in order to meet
dietary needs of Ugandans from crops such as maize and cassava, rather than export crops.

4.21 Some of the research outputs from the grants included malaria vaccine design and
assessment that is expected to develop new vaccines; identification of genetic markers in
the Nile perch; new crop varieties; model to assess climate variability and environmental
degradation of Lake Victoria; human papilloma virus disease prevention and surveillance
with applications for future health care education; cattle feed to enhance milk production;
protocols for rapid multiplication of bananas; new diagnostics tools for domestic animals
and poultry; new construction materials developed from local resources to improve
chemical stabilization, strength, and durability; and creation of new models for scaling up
access to wireless services (UNCST 2014b; World Bank 2013).

4.22 During the first round of grant selection, project records indicated few quality
proposals for engineering fields or from women scientists. Through the Better Research
Program, efforts were made to reach researchers in these disciplines as well as women
scientists.

4.23 By a number of measures, research increased since the beginning of the project.
The number of active researchers in Uganda more than tripled (i.e., 158 to 700) between
2007 and 2012 (UNCST 2012a,c,d). Uganda researchers demonstrate capacity in the areas
of infectious disease, food science, tropical medicine, and biotechnology (World Bank
2011), which align with areas funded by the project. Publications from Makerere
University, which received a large share of grants, rose between 2011 and 2012 (based on
citation database tracking), which suggests dissemination of knowledge to a worldwide
audience (UNCST 2014a). The research output in the East African region, which contains
Ugandan researchers, grew by 12 percent between 2003 and 2012 along with highly cited
articles,3 which suggest that both the quantity and quality of research performance in the
region has improved (World Bank 2014). While it should be recognized that the
government increased its financial support for science and technology between 2005 and
2010 (UNCST 2014a), Ugandan research is almost entirely donor-funded (World Bank
2011). The project’s contribution included 23 research grants that supported 250 scientists
(i.e., principal researchers as well as student researchers within research teams and their
thesis and dissertation research) (UNCST 2014b).

4.24 Several research grantees established formal and informal partnerships with foreign
universities and research centers. The aim of most partnerships was knowledge exchange.
More researchers in Uganda are publishing in international peer-reviewed journals. Over a
four-year period, articles increased from 2 to 4 percent (World Bank 2013). The project
contributed to this increase: every research grantee who met with the IEG mission reported
that at least two publications in peer-reviewed journals had resulted from the grant.

4.25 While the operational manual permitted intellectual property application from the
knowledge generated from grant-related research, none of the principal investigators
reported applying for patents or other forms of intellectual property for the research
affiliated with the grant. Ugandan regulations were viewed as a barrier to intellectual
property rights. Researchers said there are challenges in obtaining intellectual property
rights, particularly when the government funds research. This constraint was previously
noted in relation to the uncoordinated legal frameworks for the commercialization and
protection of innovation (World Bank 2011). Thus, fewer patents or intellectual property
rights have been registered in recent years and none from Ugandan researchers (UNCST
2014a).

Outcomes

4.26 The IEG mission asked grantees to describe what was accomplished from the
research. The IEG mission spoke with over one-third of principal investigators. They
consistently reported new knowledge and the development of new research capacity as the
achievements. For example, drought resistant varieties of plants were identified as well as
the genome sequencing for various crops. Most researchers viewed publications as the
measure of success. Every research grantee who was interviewed provided publications

3
  Articles that meet the threshold for being considered among the world’s top 10 percent or those in
the 90 percentile in terms of citation count.
                                             20


arising from the grant-funded study. While fewer grantees tried to connect the knowledge
that was generated to users—policy makers, researchers, extension workers, farmers, or
others such as health care workers and the private sector, analysis of grant completion
reports shows practical impact from the research completed (e.g., new vaccination
development; new crop varieties; applications for future health care education; cattle feed
that enhanced milk production; new diagnostics tools; new construction materials
developed from local resources that improved the chemical stabilization, strength, and
durability; and creation of new models for scaling up access to wireless services (UNCST
2014b).

Objective 3: Utilize S&T by firms to improve productivity
4.27 The achievement of the project’s objective is rated modest. Two activities were
supported to attain it: institutional strengthening of UIRI and grants. The evidence of the
implementation of these activities and their impact is presented below.

Outputs

4.28 Institutional strengthening of the UIRI. As a result of the project investments in
UIRI, resource centers such as technology development, microbiology laboratory,
chemistry laboratory, and engineering workshop were established or upgraded. From these
centers, UIRI can provide support and incubation services, prototyping, and market testing
to small- and medium-size firms. These centers gave hands-on training to over 1,500
people, including students through the relationships UIRI developed with universities
(UIRI 2014). The centers have been used to develop low technology cottage industries for
rural areas and support more incubators. During the IEG mission, examples were shown of
UIRI’s work with new firms in cosmetics (e.g., lotion, soap), food production and
processing, craft (i.e., paper making, necklaces), and coffee roasting. The technology
center has aided the development of new technology such as low cost medical diagnostic
tools and mobile apps for police officers (UIRI 2014). The resources that UIRI has
generated from these services annually have been $33,602 (UNCST 2012b). In the past
year, UIRI has provided incubation services to 31 new firms.

4.29 Innovations Grants. Six grants were awarded to finance collaboration between
industry and researchers. One grant established a student internship program between a
technical college and a medium-size firm. This program supported 40 students during the
two years of the grant and has continued each year to provide 10 students with an
internship. Three grants funded feasibility studies to determine commercial viability for
fishery, salt, and rice processing. No further commercialization efforts were made by these
three grantees with their own resources. One grant tested the effect of supplements on milk
production in cows. Another grant created a prototype for automating cargo for a transport
firm. Technology transfer or adoption was only evident within two of the grants, based on
interviews and project documents.

4.30 While the project collected data on the employment of science and technology
graduates, and on firm’s innovation, any changes were not plausibly attributable to the
project. Thus, the utilization of science and technology outputs (i.e., research and
graduates) by firms supported with grants is modest.
                                             21


5. Efficiency
5.1     On balance, efficiency is rated substantial, but there is no measure of the
efficiency in how grant resources were utilized.

Economic and Financial Efficiency
5.2     The appraisal document did not conduct an economic analysis. Instead, the
economic justification for the investment was based on the positive returns that would be
expected from upgrading technology. The annual project investment costs were compared
to the losses experienced by the fisheries industry from the European Union’s ban on
Uganda’s fish exports ($36 million in 1998 and the value in 2006 of more than $48.1
million). These losses resulted from lack of institutionalization of technology. The
appraisal document suggested the expenses for MSI or investment in science and
technology was a fraction of the losses experienced and had the potential to spark
technology upgrading or new business opportunities. The Quality at Entry Review
conducted by the Bank commented on the weak economic analysis that was conducted at
appraisal.

5.3     A cost benefit analysis was conducted at closure. The internal rate of return was
estimated to be between 31 and 33 percent with the net present value ranging from $69
million to $81 million. The assumptions were appropriate and included an unemployment
rate ranging from 5 percent to 15 percent; public and private expenses for the number of
students supported by the project; estimation of wages for a person working until 60 years;
and a discount rate of 15 percent. Moreover, more science and technology graduates have
been employed (UNCST 2014a) and their wages have risen more dramatically than those
who have not completed secondary or post-secondary education. However, the percentage
of grant-supported graduates who obtained employment in S&T fields within six months is
unknown.

5.4     High rates of return (ranging from 10- to 0 percent) at the firm and industry level
are seen in research and development in member countries of the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) (World Bank 2006). Agricultural
research and development was the main focus within grants (table 4.3). It has even higher
estimated rates of return and the average rate across all types of commodities was 81
percent (World Bank 2006). This suggests the operation’s investment in research and
development provides value for money, but IEG could not assess the efficiency in how
grants were utilized.

Administrative and Organizational Efficiency
5.5     Other aspects that demonstrated project efficiency were the full disbursement of the
IDA credit, three rounds of grants funded instead of the two planned due to the efficient
use of resources, and gains from the exchange rate.

5.6    Despite procurement delays, the decision to centralize procurement with the
implementing agency was reasonable. International competitive bidding likely created cost
savings in the purchase of scientific equipment. In contrast to other countries, such as
                                              22


Indonesia and Vietnam, complex challenges emerged when procurement was decentralized
to higher education institutions (IEG 2015a,b). Procurement delays created a serious risk to
attaining development objectives within the Indonesia Managing Higher Education for
Relevance and Efficiency Project (IEG 2015b), which was not the case in this operation.

6. Ratings
Outcome
6.1     The outcome rating is moderately satisfactory. Relevance of objectives are rated
substantial, while design is modest. The government has prioritized science and technology
within its strategies. Achievement of the first objective to increase the supply of S&T
graduates was substantial. Achievement of the second objective to increase research is
rated substantial, while the achievement of the third objective to facilitate firm’s utilization
of S&T outputs was modest. Ten academic programs were created or /upgraded. There has
been an increasing enrollment in science and technology students in Uganda with the
project supporting over 6,000 students. Efficiency is rated substantial. This outcome rating
is consistent with minor shortcomings in preparation, design, and implementation.

Risk to Development Outcome
6.2     Several factors mitigate the risk to maintaining the improvements made and the
development outcomes. First, the government remains committed to increasing its
investment in science, technology, and innovation to achieve a knowledge-based
economy. Science and technology has now been assigned ministerial responsibility within
the newly restructured Ministry of Education, Science, Technology, and Sports. While
questions remain about the inter-ministerial coordination of science and technology, the
move signals the importance that science and technology holds for the government. It also
has a relationship with South Africa where it can tap into technical assistance from
research organizations and universities.

6.3      Second, the capacity of both parastatal organizations (UNCST and UIRI) has been
strengthened and both continue to implement their respective mandates well. UNCST
publishes annual reports and collects science and technology statistics. These data provide
a useful yardstick to determine whether Uganda is transforming into a knowledge-based
economy. UNCST has promoted practical ways for growth in science and technology,
provided policy advice to the government, and is advancing lobbying efforts for a
biodiversity regulation. UNCST has experience implementing a competitive funding
facility; this knowledge remains within the staff. UIRI’s resource centers developed under
the project continue to be used to provide incubation services to industry and firms as well
as training.

6.4     Third, university programs funded by grants have been sustained. As part of the
grant application process, universities had committed to maintaining the program once the
grant ended. This process was initiated during the grant—a decreasing percentage of
resources were provided each year in the grant. Another aspect of project sustainability is
the increased capacity of principal investigators and student researchers. Many principal
investigators utilized the experiences gained in participating in competitive grant process
                                             23


to pursue external resources such as the U.S. National Institutes of Health, Gates
Foundation, and other bilateral agencies

6.5    Finally, Uganda will be part of a follow-up Bank project—the Regional Center of
Excellence. Through a grant application process, universities can solicit additional funding
to expand and improve programs. The experience previously gained will likely help
universities participate in the follow-up operation.

6.6     Without continued annual funding at a level consistent to MSI, some reversals to
gains were made during the project. While the appraisal document estimated the fiscal
impact for the government to sustain the MSI Funding Facility to be 0.2 percent of
government expenditures in 2011/2012, the government has not continued the fund at the
same level. It has continued a science and grant fund via UNCST but at a reduced scope
and level of financial support. Better Researcher Program, National Science Week, and
other outreach activities ceased at project closure. The operating budget of UNCST cannot
support these programs. The government has not maintained the level of resources to
appropriately fund science and technology research. As well, considerable pipeline issues
in post-basic education remain. Until these issues are resolved, remediation services may
need to be provided by higher education institutions to facilitate a larger pool of students
equipped to study science and technology at the tertiary level. The overall science and
technology system remains fragmented and needs strengthening. In view of these factors,
the risk to the development outcome is rated significant.

Bank Performance
6.7    Overall bank performance is moderately satisfactory.

6.8     Quality at entry is rated moderately satisfactory. Wide stakeholder consultations
were initiated to understand the needs and ideas of various constituent groups across
science and technology as well as develop government buy-in. The task team leader (TTL)
arranged a special lunch and conference for members of parliament who were on the
Committee on Science and Technology and Social Services. The initial design was shared
with stakeholders, and after their feedback, design was revised.

6.9     The project benefited from the Bank’s prior experience implementing science and
technology funds in other countries such as Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and the República
Bolivariana de Venezuela. These lessons were used during preparation. For example, the
importance of competition and transparency as well as the size of the grants need to be
sufficiently large to allow researchers to compete at international levels. The grants need to
cover a variety of expenses: training, salaries, equipment, and stipends. International
science and technology experts also provided advice during preparation. These
consultations ensured the activities were aligned with areas of highest priority for Uganda
and helped to develop a research fund consistent with international best practices, but
gender could have been more prominent within project design.

6.10 Preparation was thorough, not just technical design, but also the implementation
aspects. A number of activities were completed during preparation, which facilitated rapid
implementation. These activities included the development of a detailed project operational
                                            24


manual; project implementation plan; detailed plan of project costs and schedule of
implementation activities; announcement of research grants; calls for proposals; modalities
for announcement of research grants; procedures governing calls for proposals and
procurement; contracts; and baseline data. The members of the Technical Committee were
selected after a large consultation process between the Bank and Project Advisory Group.
Nearly every implementation detail was described in the project implementation plan and
operational manual completed prior to effectiveness. Because of this level of detail, the
manual was the tool for answering questions from implementing agency staff and grantees
that arose during implementation. However, there were shortcomings in relation to M&E.

6.11 The Bank team was proactive and sought additional resources. A grant from the
Japanese government facilitated the restructuring and strengthening of UNCST and UIRI,
extensive stakeholder consultations, and other project preparation activities. The aim of
capacity building was defined. Capacity development included training on project
management, procurement, financial management, as well as technical knowledge related
to M&E and science and technology. This strengthening was designed to facilitate project
implementation.

6.12 The Bank conducted all necessary assessments. Risks were appropriately identified
as well as mitigation measures, except in the case of the fund’s sustainability, which was
neither identified nor mitigated. The fiduciary assessments identified weaknesses,
including procurement, which were subsequently addressed with technical support or
appropriately mitigated.

6.13 At the time of project preparation, the government requested, and IDA agreed, that
IDA resources would cover total project costs. This arrangement was believed to pose no
threat to the sustainability of the project. In hindsight, while this financing arrangement
permitted experimentation to see whether a research fund facility is a viable mechanism for
Uganda, it did not facilitate ownership.

6.14 Bank management provided active supervision of the preparation and did not rush
the process. The manager signaled the early need for the Bank team to provide additional
support with Bank procurement procedures, given the implementing agency’s
unfamiliarity with them.

6.15 Quality of supervision is rated moderately satisfactory. There were two TTLs over
the course of the operation. The second was based in Uganda. The transition was smooth
between the TTL who prepared the project and supervised it during the first year and the
other TTL. The Bank team provided active supervision and support throughout the life of
the project. TTLs routinely diagnosed issues and bottlenecks and proposed multiple
options for the implementing agency to consider. During implementation, Bank staff gave
feedback on the interim financial reports to offer greater clarity on how to present and
organize information. Bank staff also provided suggestions to ease tracking and streamline
procurement processes and mitigate a negative impact on project implementation aide-
mémoires, and supervision reports were candid and insightful on implementation strengths
and weaknesses. Ratings were also used as an appropriate signal to the implementing
agency. Monitoring and evaluation data were routinely used to measure attainment of the
objectives and gauge project implementation. TTLs visited grantees and participated in
                                             25


every National Science Week. There was an evident focus on the development outcome
among the Bank team. Even so, shortcomings were found in M&E which were not fully
addressed during the 2010 project restructuring. Likewise, this restructuring was late in the
project cycle to initiate the changes.

6.16 The Bank team engaged actively on science and technology policy dialogue with
the government over the course of the project. This dialogue discussed pipeline issues that
needed to be addressed, such as the secondary schools’ inability to implement the science
curriculum mandates, and broader issues such as funding for science, technology, and
innovation in the national budget and the need for more ministerial responsibility and
coordination of science and technology. The Bank produced several economic and sector
works specific to Uganda, which facilitated policy dialogue (Brar and others 2011;
Nanyonjo 2007).

6.17 Sustainability of the fund was advocated during supervision by the Bank team. It
conducted multiple follow-ups with the Ministry of Finance, Planning, and Economic
Development related to the process of making the request for additional funding.

Borrower Performance
6.18   Overall borrower performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

6.19 Government performance is rated moderately satisfactory. There was high-level
government participation in project preparation, and the government was committed to
advancing science and technology. It satisfied all conditions for effectiveness. The
Ministry of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development completed the requisite actions
during preparation including institutional strengthening of the implementing agencies, and
it selected UNCST to manage the project. It correctly avoided the creation of new
structures given an existing government entity with the mandate for coordinating science
and technology policy across ministries, and it ensured that high-level staff filled key
positions.

6.20 The operation received a high level of government support. The president of
Uganda participated in the project launch. The vice president participated in the first
National Science Week. The minister of finance participated in a project-closing event. A
National Science Technology and Innovation Policy was brought to the cabinet by the
Ministry of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development. The government has
prioritized more scholarships to science and technology students, as these disciplines were
viewed critical to national development.

6.21 There were, however, some shortcomings in the government’s performance.
Borrower contributions were in-kind recurrent expenses for the UNCST, slightly lower
than anticipated. There were delays in follow-up actions from the Ministry of Finance,
Planning, and Economic Development, and it did not request additional IDA financing for
the third round of grants, even though the third round was initiated after the government
expressed its commitment to do so. It did not follow up on the Bank’s expression of
interest to provide additional financing to sustain the Funding Facility and allow the
government more time to incrementally allocate budget resources. It took considerable
                                             26


time (six months) to clear the procured scientific equipment that was tax exempt from the
Tax Office. Several instances of delays in clearing aide-mémoires and responding to
actions needed follow-up attention. There was delay in appointing members of the
Executive Committee of UNCST after terms ended.

6.22 The implementing agency performance is rated moderately satisfactory. During the
course of preparation, UNCST was reorganized and a new Executive Secretary was
appointed after the retirement of the previous one. The Technical Committee was
established immediately upon effectiveness.

6.23 UNCST staff were part of the Project Advisory Group, which was charged with
completing all facets of project preparation. Within the opening weeks of the project, calls
for proposals were disseminated to the S&T community, and those received were
expeditiously and transparently processed. The first call under the operation was
announced by the president of Uganda at the February 2007 project launch. The first round
of grantees was announced during the first National Science Week in September 2007,
within six months of project effectiveness. The calls for grants were well advertised to
solicit the interest of researchers. Additional efforts, such as a breakfast forum with
industry as well as advertisements, were made to raise awareness among potential Window
C applicants.

6.24 While fiduciary management was adequate, shortcomings were found in both
financial and procurement management. Closer monitoring and guidance were needed by
the implementing agency of grantees given instances of poor fund management.
Procurement was delayed during every round, which had negative implementation
implications as grant timelines were tight and delays were unanticipated. While delays
persisted despite additional procurement staff, they were not solely attributed to the
performance of the implementing agency given contributing factors beyond its control.

6.25 Overall, UNCST did an excellent job implementing the competitive grant fund.
Proposal writing workshops were held prior to each call by the implementing agency. The
process was efficient, transparent, and well organized. As a result, visitors from other
countries such as Tanzania came to learn from Uganda’s experiences. Safeguard
compliance was monitored and ensured. Project indicators were continuously collected and
used to assess implementation progress. The Technical Committee made site visits to
grantees. Grantees also rated the performance of UNCST favorably.

Monitoring and Evaluation
6.26   The quality of monitoring and evaluation is rated substantial.

6.27 M&E Design: The appraisal document provided a detailed plan for monitoring and
evaluation. Anticipated uses for the project’s data included determining whether the
project objectives were likely to be achieved, while other measures gave information to
stakeholders in S&T- related ministries and agencies. A clear timeline for data collection
and analysis was established along with explicit assignment of responsibility. The type of
instrument that would be developed to generate project indicators was clearly identified.
Baseline data were collected during preparation for several key performance indicators.
                                              27


Definitions of key indicators and the survey plan were prepared to generate comparable
data.

6.28 The project's objectives, components, and outcome measures were generally
logically linked, but with weaknesses. M&E activities were designed to measure progress
and attainment of objectives, as well as collect broader data related to national science and
technology. This was an attempt to address the paucity of national data and information on
science, technology, and innovation in Uganda that was noted during project preparation.
Policy studies related to science and technology were also included. However, this resulted
in limited outcome data to measure each objective.

6.29 Most of the key performance indicators measured science and technology in
Uganda rather than that attributable to project interventions. For example, undergraduate
and graduate enrollment of S&T students, researchers, publications, patents and
intellectual property rights were measured across the country. Given the limited nature of
the grants, indicators restricted to measuring the impact of the grants may have been more
appropriate, such as S&T enrollment through grants, publications arising from grant
funding, and number of grant-supported scientists. It is notable that the Results Framework
contained an employment indicator, but the one selected (i.e., increasing the number of
S&T graduates within technology firms) was not aligned with grant activities, thus outside
the scope of the project. A more appropriate measure may have been tracer studies of the
students who benefitted from the grant funding or the percentage of grant supported
graduates employed in S&T fields within six months. The private sector and
technologically advanced firms were prominent within the Results Framework. Given the
limited level of technology development, the project’s emphasis within these firms may
have been an incorrect assumption, as the more likely beneficiaries of Window C were
small and medium enterprises. No indicator was established to identify results of the
research grants during the life of the project. Instead, process-related aspects of the grants
were tracked. Gender disaggregated data were not designed, nor collected. As a result, it is
unclear the contributions the project made to advance women’s enrollment in science and
technology programs

6.30 M&E Implementation: UNCST effectively monitored project indicators
throughout the project. Within eight months of project effectiveness, baseline data were
collected on all key performance indicators. Refinements to baseline data continued the
following year, as the first round of surveys were implemented. Consultants prepared
surveys related to the size and productivity of active research teams, client satisfaction with
UNCST and UIRI services, and high school students’ impressions of science and
technology careers. UNCST supervised all survey collection. Project data were routinely
monitored to assess implementation progress. An independent assessment was made by
visiting experts familiar with the implementation of science and technology research funds.
This was done to assess implementation progress of the fund. Comments from these
experts indicated the grant program was implemented consistent with international best
practices—transparent and a high level of competition. The quality of M&E was high as
data consistency was found with the data collected by UNCST and during IEG’s mission.

6.31 M&E Utilization: Science and technology statistics and publications begun during
the project have been updated and published annually. For example, UNCST has continued
                                               28


collecting country-level data related to the number of researchers, publications, and
intellectual property. These publications provide trend data on science and technology
within Uganda. UNCST has used this data in performing its mandate of policy advice to
the government.

7. Lessons
7.1       Based on the experience of this project, several lessons can be drawn.

         While research funds are common in OECD countries, it is also possible to
          establish and implement a world-class science research fund in a low-income
          country. This project has demonstrated a competitive funding facility that
          promotes science and technology, and the Uganda National Council for Science
          and Technology implemented it consistent with a high degree of transparency.
          There was no government interference in the process. The Technical Committee
          awarded grants based on a clear selection process consistent with international
          good practices. This created high-quality proposals, a high level of competition,
          and accountability for the grants.
         An appropriate cost-sharing agreement is needed at entry to facilitate
          sustainability. An IDA grant was provided to the government for nearly all
          operational costs. It was believed that this arrangement would pose no threat to
          sustainability as the government was committed to science and technology and
          provided high-level support during the project. In the end, the government did not
          provide its own resources to maintain the research funding facility nor did request
          continued funding from the Bank. While these decisions are beyond the control of
          the Bank, the Bank has the ability to add conditions upfront such as requiring the
          government to put more resources into the fund or requiring the government to take
          an increasing share of resources each year.
         The promotion of a knowledge-based economy requires an integral approach,
          involving several ministries as well as the private sector. The project focused on
          the funding facility to promote science and technology as one component of the
          system. Simultaneously, additional efforts by the Bank—analytical work, other
          lending operations, and policy dialogue—addressed other aspects of the system.
          While the Bank advocated ministerial ownership of the topic and inter-ministerial
          coordination, it also worked on pipeline issues within secondary education and
          addressed research and linkages with the private sector. Despite these efforts, the
          national system remains weak and additional institutional strengthening is still
          needed to bring all of the elements of the system together. It is too early to know
          whether the new ministerial structure implemented in 2015 will have an effect on
          bringing these separate, but integral pieces, together to work synergistically.
         A research fund is a viable mechanism to increase research and create
          programs for science and technology graduates, but its impact may be
          enhanced by extending capacity-building and technical assistance to grantees.
          There were benefits when grantees also received capacity-building or technical
          assistance, suggesting the impact could be enhanced when financial grants are
          combined with technical support.
                                         29


   Requiring data collection for grants may also yield better impact or at a
    minimum a clearer understanding of what was achieved. Ensuring the capacity
    building of grantee institutions to implement periodic tracer studies with consistent
    methodology may be a step toward providing relevant data to academic programs.
   Given the low numbers of Ugandan women scientists, a gender focus is
    warranted. Giving more prominence to gender could have further incentivized the
    supported programs and outreach activities to add activities to promote female
    participation and address the barriers. As well, collecting gender-disaggregated data
    would have revealed the project’s contribution, which is unknown.
