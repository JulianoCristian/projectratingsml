ESTREITO TRANSMISSION PROJECT
SUMMARY
1.        Central Eletrica de Furnas S A. (Furnas) has applied for a loan
of US$39 million equivalent to help finance Stage II of the 533 MW Estreito
hydroelectric and transmission project. The estimated cost of the total
project, including interest during construction, is US$lh million equiva-
lent. Assistance in financing Stage I of the project and interest during
construction was provided by a Bank Loan, No. 403-BR, of US$57 million
in February 1965
11.       The Estreito hydroelectric plant is now under construction on
the Rio Grande about 500 km from Rio de Janeiro and 400 km from Sao Paulo
and Stage II of the project would provide the 345-kv transmission facili-
ties from Estrelto to the cities of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo.
iii.      This report is a supplement to the previous appraisal report
No. TO 459a. and contains the final plan for the transmission facil2tles,
revised cost estimates, the standard to be used by the Bank to analyse any
change in the tariff regulations which would adversely affect the rate of re-
turn, and the latest information on the financial aspects of the Borrower
iv.       The project would be suitable for a Bank loan of US$39 million
equivalent for a term of 25 years, including a 5-year grace period.

THE ESTREITO TRANS'HISSION PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTICN
1.        Central Eletrica de Furnas S.A. (Furnas), a corporation owned
principally by the Federal Government, has applied to the Bank for a loan
of US$39 mllion equivalent to help finance the Estreito transmission project,
including US$6 million for interest during construction, the total cost of
Iwhich is estimated at US$55.5 mll.ion.  The project would provide transmission
facilities at 345-kv to serve the cities of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo
from the 533 MW Estreito hydroelectric plant now under construction on the
Rio Grande about 500 km from Rio de Janeiro and 400 km from Sao Paulo.
2         The loan would be supplementary to Bank loan 403-BR of US$57 million
made to Furnas in February 1965 to help finance the construction of the
Estrelto hydroelectric plant and the minimum transmission facilities needed
to connect the plant to the existing transmission grid    At that time, no
decision had been reached on the voltage level of the long lines needed to
supplement the existing transmission grid so as to carry the full output of
the Estrelto plant. Furthermore, it was not necessary to start the con-
struction of the transmission facilities at the same time construction of
the hydroelectric plant was started
3.        This report will therefore be a supplement to the previous report
No  TO 459a   It will primarily consider the required additional transmission
facilities but will treat the hydroelectric project financed by loan 403-BR
and the new transmission facilities as a single project.
4         The report wll1 also present information on a revised basis for
power rate determination, and the latest iformation on the financial aspects
of Furnas. Information on the Borrotwer, the power market and procurement
procedures is as set out in the appraisal report No TO 459a of February 12,
1965   During the past year work on the civil works contract for the dam,
which is not financed by the Bank, has proceeded on schedule    Other activities
consisted principally of advertising internationally for major items of
materials and equipment    Disbursements on loan 403-BR were US$1,984,000 as of
October 31, 1966.
5.        This report was prepared from information gained during a mission
consisting of Messrs R.L. Bloor and John Bruen which visited Brazil in
September-October 1965, on information obtained by Mr. Bruen on a return
visit in December 1965, and on data subsequently submitted by Furnas

II. PLAN FOR THE TRANSNiISSION SYSTEM
6.        Canambra, a consortium of American and Canadian engineering firms,
has been planning a power expansion program for the south central reglon of
Brazil for the past several years under the auspices of the United Nations
Development Programme   It has found that a group of hydroelectric plants,
of which the Estreito plant is one, can be built on the upper Rio Grande with
especially favorable characteristics as regards location with respect to
markets and construction costs. Canambra has also planned a transmission
system from these plants to the principal market centers consisting of the
cities of Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, and Belo Horizonte
7.        At the time the Canambra studies started, Furnas was already
committed to 345-kv lines from the Furnas plant to Sao Paulo and Rio de
Janeiro on the basis of prior studies by a firm of consulting engineers
One line to Sao Paulo has been operating for about two years, another has
recently been completed, and a line to Rio is under construction    Canambra
considered whether the additional lines needed for the upper Rio Grande group
of plants should be designed to operate at a higher voltage level, but con-
cluded that the continuation of the 345-kv level would be the most economical
solution.
8         Effective and planned generatimng capacity included in the upper
Rio Grande group of hydroelectric power stations is shown in the following

9.        Transmussion facilities are in operation at 345-kv, between Furnas
plant and Sao Paulo and Furnas plant and Belo Horizonte, and 345-kv facilities
are planned to be in operation as follows

In addition to the lines shown above, all of the generating plants in the
group will be interconnected by relatively short transmission lines to be
built as each plant is added to the group  WfJhen the system is completed,
there wll. be 3,900 IW of generating capacity and a transmssion system with
three lines to each of the cities. Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Belo
Horizonte, together with substations in these cities and at intermediate
points along the system. Exclusive of the two generating plants now in
operation, and the transmission facilities complete or under cornstruction,
the cost of the system is estimated at US$315 million for generation and
US$135 mllion for transmission    The design of the system has been based on
extensive engineering and economic investigations by Canambra to program con-
struction of facilities so as to most economically meet the estimated demand
for energy
III. THE PROJECT
10.       The Estreito hydroelectric and transmission line project will con-
sist of a rockfill dam and a 533 WM powerhouse (firm annual capability in    go |
driest period of record 2.8 billion kwh) now under construction on the Rio
Grande and transmission facilitles as follows (see map)
a.   A 345-kv line 140 km long from Estrelto to the Furnas 900 MW
hydroelectric plant on the Rio Grande owned by Furnas.
b.   A 345-kv line 35 km long from Estrelto to the Peixoto 230 MW
hydroelectric plant on the Rio Grande, owned by the Federal
Government
c.   A 345-kv line about 500 km long from Furnas to Rio de Janeiro



d    A 3h5-kv line about 400 km long from Estreito to Sao Paulo.
e    138-kv tie lines in Rio de Janeiro.
f.   Three new substations and the expansion of ten existing sub-
stations with related communication equipment.
U1        The estimated cost of the project includLng interest during con-
struction on the existing Bank loan, is US$140 million equivalent. The portion
proposed for Bank financing covers all materials and equipment which will be
purchased under international competitive bidding. Brazilian firms will com-
pete for some of this and it is estimated that they may be successful in
securimng contracts covering about one-third of the total amount   The amount
of the proposed loan of US$39 million is about equal to the estimated inter-
national procurement component of the additional transmission facilities with-
out interest during construction (bee Stage II below). The Borrower requested
a loan of US$39 ml.lion which was intended to include interest during con-
struction   However, the Borrower also proposed a reduction in the estimate
for Stage I of the project by an amount about equal to this interest    Such
a reduction in the estimate at the present time is considered premature, hence
the amount available for interest during construction on both loans would be
US$9 million, as provided for under loan 403-BR.

The cost estimate for the new Stage II is based on recent cost experience on
very similar work, contains reasonable allowances for contingencies, and
should be adequate.

Purnas' expansion program which is shoam under "Application of Funds" in the
tabulation of paragraph 39 below.

IV. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Tariffs
13.       The regulations governing power operations and tariffs are contained
in the Water Code of 1934 and subsequent amendments and decrees, including
in particular a decree dated February 26, 1957, and three decrees dated
November 4, 1964   Prior to 1964, tariffs were based on the use of historic
values of investment and became increasingly unrealistic as inflation developed,
causing many utilities to incur operating losses for several consecutive years.
The 1964 decrees reflected a major change in Government policies by allowing
utilities to revalue their investment, and thus making it possible for utili-
ties to apply for tariffs which would yleld adequate returns
14.       Under the existing regulations, tariffs are reviewed and approved
by the Waters Division every three years or at shorter intervals, at the
initiative of the Waters Division or the utility    Utilities are permitted to
apply for tariffs which would yield revenues covering (a) operating costs,
(b) straight-line depreciation of gross fixed assets in operation, excluding
land and land rights, at annual rates of up to 8 percent for thermal plants
and up to 5 percent for all other facilities including hydro plants, but with
no minima in either case, (c) a reversion provision of up to 3 percent, or
an amortization provision of up to 5 percent, on the total gross fixed assets
in operation, also without minima, and (d) a return of 10 percent on the re-
munerable investment   Remunerable investment is defined as gross plant in
service (excluding assets acquired through contributions in aid of construction)
less depreciation and reversion or amortization reserves, plus reversion or
amortization funds and an allowance for working capital consisting of
operating inventories, the equivalent of two months billing, and cash (up to
the value of the reserve for depreciation balance) excluding cash representing
contributions in aid of construction. Shortfalls in achieving the return of
10 percent in the three-year tariff period may be recovered, in principle, in
the subsequent three-year period. Another provision in the regulations,
however, permits tariff adjustments for recovering shortfalls to be made at
more frequent intervals.
15        Between tariff revisions, the following surcharges may be added by
utilities on their current tariffs without permission of the Waters Division
(a) monthly, for compulsory increases in wages, social benefits, cost of
fuel and purchased power, and (b) semi-annually, for increases in foreign
debt service due to changes in the foreign exchange rate
16.       Tariff adjustments for the revaluation of the balance sheet accounts
can be made as often as economic correction factors (coefficients), showing
the variations in the purchasing power of the currency, are published by the
National Economic Council    The coefficients are issued annually about two
months after the end of each year for the use of industry in general    They
are applied by utilities to up-date the values of plant in service, depreci-
ation and amortization or reversion reserves, and certain local currency
loans for the National Development Bank and/or Eletrobras    Foreign currency
components of the book value of fixed assets are converted into local currency



- 7 -
at the rate of exchange in effect at the time the assets are acquired.
Foreign debts are revalued on the basis of the current rate of exchange.
The amount by which the revaluation of fixed assets exceeds the revaluation
of reserves and loans is set aside as a revaluation reserve which is subject
to a 5 percent tax.
17.       In addition to the tariffs, two surcharges are being levied on the
consumer's electric bill by the Federal Government to help finance power
expansion in the country   In the case of the distribution companies rev,eAed
in connectlon with appraisals for Bank loans, the combination of these
surcharges have amounted to between 40 percent and 50 percent of tne average
tariff in 1965. The proceeds of one of these surcharges, the "sole" tax
which was created in 1954, are allocated among the Federal, State and iMuni-
cipal authorities. This tax, the rate of which varies according to classes
of consumers, is presently based on an average price per kwh computed periodi-
cally by the National Council of Water and Electr;c Energy   Another surcharge,
similarly computed and assessed, is the "compulsory loan", introduced in
November 1962 and which is to terminate in 1968. The proceeds go to Eletrobras
which in turn invests such funds in various power projects in the form of
loans or share capital   Eletrobras issues to the consumers, for the amount
of the "compulsory loans" paid, debt certificates carrying an interest rate
of 12 percent and redeemable in 10 years. A third surcharge which is the
social security tax, is 8 percent of the tariff.
18        The implementation of the revaluation provision was not entirely
satisfactory during the initial year, 1965, due not only to the understandable
complexities involved with the transition, but also to the permissive
character of several important provisions of the new regulations. RevaJuation
was not then compulsory, the legislation provaded for maximum rates of
depreciation and amortization but no minimum rates were prescribed and recovery
of shortfalls in earnings at intervals and for periods shorter than three
years was only optional. In addition, there was undertainty among utilities
in regard to interpretation of certain provisions of the regulations and
long delays were experienced in a number of instances before tariffs were
actually adjusted to reflect revaluation of assets.
19        The Bank was particularly concerned with two possible consequences
of the permissive character of the regulations. Different tariff policies
could be followed which in the case of interconnected utilities, might well
lead to conflicting principles being used in calculating the apparent cost
of important blocks of power and could result that important economic
decisions might be based on erroneous assumptions. While efforts were
being made by Government to implement sound and, in certain instances,
relatively high tariffs, there existed the possibility that, in compliance
with the same regulations, utilities might be allowed to revert in the
future to inadequate tariff levels.
20.       These questions iwere brought to the attention of the Government
early in 1966. It was suggested that regulations should be tightened to
ensure that a minimum and uniform level of tariff performance be required
from all utilities in the future. The Government indicated that it was



- 8 -
dware of this problem and was planning to continue improving the implemert-
ation of the regulations   It was not prepared at the time to propose
corrective legislation to Congress. Pending such legislation, however, it
was suggested that the Bank should define in a more detailed and specific
rate covenant than those in the agreements for earlier power loans, the
rranimumi level of financial performance it expected utilities to achieve,
and that the Government would support the extension of this type of a rate
covenant to as many other utilities as possible, mainly through Eletrobras.
21        During the negotiations of Furnas' existing tariff covenant, however,
the representatives of the Brazilian Government objected that the detailed
covenant proposed might conflict with Brazilian law. Pending clarification
of this point, negotiations were suspended   Conversations continued and
the Government informed the Bank recently that legislation had been enacted
by Congress which will (1) make the revaluation of utilities' assets
compulsory, a measure which alleviates much of the Bank's concern, (2)
reduce by one half the level of electrification taxes and (3) extend the
surcharge on compulsory loans to 1973, provide for their annual revaluation,
interest at 6 percent and a 20-year term.
22.       Negotiations between the Government and the Bank over the quest,on
of tariffs finally resulted in the following
(1) The Government and Furnas agreed to a covenant under which
(a) as provided by the Brazilian legislation, tariffs will
be set so as to produce revenues at a level consistent with
sound financial and public utility practices, using straight-
line depreciation which shall be not less than that based on
the useful lives of depreciable assets in operation, and (b)
as permitted by the Brazilian legislation, assets will be
revalued and tariffs will be correspondingly adjusted at least
once every calendar year.
(2)  A change in legislation whlich shall adversely affect the setting
of tariffs at the level stated above, shall be an event of default.
(3)  In a letter to Furnas the Bank will define the standard it
would use to analyse a change in legislation for the purpose
of (2) above   This standard shall be whether revenues from
the sale of electricity are sufficient to (a) cover all of
the Borrower's operating expenses, including straight-line
depreciation of gross revalued fixed assets in operation, at
rates basea on the useful lives of assets and (b) produce a
reasonable annual rate of return on the revalued average net
fixed assets in operation (which under presently foreseeable
conditions would be of the order of 10%).
23.       Furnas is probably the only utility in Brazil which took immediate
advantage of the new regulations    The first revaluation, based on 1963
coefficients, was completed shortly after the regulations were made effective
at the end of 1964, and new tariffs were placed in effect in February 1965
Soon after the issuance of the 1964 coefficient it completed its second



-9-
revaluation and obtained the corresponcming additional tariff increase in
July 1965. In determining the level of its tariffs, Furnas was allowed
to provide for depreciation at the maximum permitted rate of 5 percent and
for amortization at 3 percent. It was also allowed to provide for income
taxes ualike most utilities, which will compute the permitted return before
taxes. As a result, the tariffs introduced in July 1965 were about four
times the 1964 tariff. In addition, adjustments for compulsory wage increases
and for increases in foreign debt service were promptly put into effect as
and when necessary.
24.       Revenues for 1965 have only reached about the minimum level
required under the existing tariff covenant but they have fallen short
of the higher objectives contemplated by Furnas in setting tariffs for
1965.  Several reasons account for these results   Despite Furnas' prompt
action, the inadequate 1964 tariffs continued to apply for several weeks at
the beginning of 1965 and the fully adjusted 1965 tariff applied for only
half of the year. Due to inflation during the year the actual year end
value of assets was greater than the estimated value which had been used
for computing tariffs in mid 1965. On the other hand and although Furnas
had both capacity and energy available due to a good water year, it was
not able to market all of its power. The load requirements of Sao Paulo
Light, its only customer, fell off due to Government restrictions to curb
inflation and to certain features of the tariff structure of Furnas. In
July 1965 the demand charge, which accounts for about 90 percent of Furnas
revenues, was Cr$9,254 per kw per month equivalent to US$60 00 a year, and
has been computed to recover the investment cost in the 900,000 kw installed
capacity of the Furnas plant on sales based on an estimated demand of only
560,000 kw. (Furnas' energy charge is very nominal, about one U. S. mill)
25.       Another feature of the tariff is a ratcheted demand provision which
means that a highest recorded demand in a given month establishes the
minimum charge for the next eleven months. This tariff structure does
not encourage the use of full capacity available. If Furnast demand charge
had been calculated on the basis of the larger amount of capacity available
with provisions for purchasing secondary and peaking power, the utilities
connected to the Furnas grid might have been induced to purchase power
from Furnas instead of operating some of their high cost generating plants.
If Furnas had marketed all of its available power its demand charges could
have been considerably lower and its total revenues greater    During
negotiations these matters were discussed and Furnas has indicated that it
is aware of the problem and will take these matters into consideration as
its system becomes more integrated.
26.       Centrais Eletricas de 1inas Gerais (Cemig) which has rights to
50 percent of the output of the Furnas plant did not begin purchasing power
in 1965 as contemplated although facilities and power were available. The
reason for not purchasing power from Furnas is due to the considerably
higher level of Furnas' tariff in comparison with alternative sources.
Cemig doubled its own tariffs and surcharges early in 1965 based on assets
revalued only with the 1963 coefficient. It did not revalue again when
the 1964 coefficient was issued because this would have about doubled the



- 10 -
value of the fixed assets and would require further increases in tariffs
and surcharges which Cemig feared would impede its load growth. Furnas
on the other hand took full advantage of the regulations with the result
that Furnas' wholesale tariffs were greater than Cemig's retall tariffs.
Cemig has already agreed in connection with its loan 442 BR to a covenant
to fully revalue its assets and lower its depreciation charge to 3 percent
and eliminate its amortization charge   Furnas has indicated that starting
in 1968, when Cemig will begin purchasing large dmounts of power in order
to meet its future load growth, it will be able to lower its tariffs as a
result of lowering its depreciation rate of 5 percent to a normal rate
based on the useful lives of its gross depreciable fixed assets in operation
estimated to be 2-1/2 percent and also eliminate its 3 percent amortizataon
This is based on the assumption that Cemig's purchases of power -will result
in full utilization of Furnas' generation plant thereby making it possib' e
to lower Furnas' tariff without jeopardizing Furnas' required rate of
return (see paragraph h3). As a condition of effectiveness of the Cemig
loan and the proposed loan, Furnas and Cemig have recently signed a sales
contract for the sale of Furnas power to Cemig beginning in September 1966.
Furnas has also agreed in a side letter to include shortly a sales contract
with Sao Paulo Light Company and in the future to negotiate contracts with
other customers which it may serve. Such contracts are to be submitted to
the Bank for review and comment
27.       In compliance with the existing loan agreement, Furnas has again
revalued its assets on the basis of the 1965 coefficient and has applied
for tariff increases which were approved beginning in June 1966 which again
include provisions for depreciation charges at 5 percent and amortization
charges at 3 percent   The forecasts in this report assume that in 1967
Furnas would use the same basis as in 1966 but from 1968 onward it would
seek to achieve a 10 percent return on its renumerable investment after
reduced charges for depreciation and elimination of amortization
Financial Position
28.       Furnas' financial statements have been audited by Arthur Andersen
and Company since 1958 and these arrangements have been satisfactory.
Furnas has already agreed in connection with loan 403 BR, to continue
employing outside auditors acceptable to the Bank    In compliance with a
provision in the agreements covering Loan 403 BR, Furnas has entered into
a contract, also with Arthur Andersen and Company, to reorganize the
accounting department and train the accounting personnel
29.       As far as foreign exchange expenditures and sources of funds
are concerned, the financial projections have been cast in terms of the
official exchange rate as of December 31, 1965, of Cr$2,220 to US$1.
As far as local currency is concerned normal increases in operating costs
due to expanded operations have been considered but no provision has been
made for the loss of the value of the Cruzeiro after 1965 as most of the effects
will have been provided for under existing tariff regulations and adjust-
ments for inflation mentioned in paragraph 15.

30.       The estimated financial position of Furnas as of December 31,
1965 is presented in the following statement and in Annex 1. The final
figures which have recently boen received show no significant
departure from the estimates except for a transfer of assets from work in
progress to plant in service, the effect on the attached forecasts would
possibly be a larger increase in the tariff level assumed for 1966. It
was, therefore, not deemed necessary to prepare a new set of forecasts.
Two balance sheets have been prepared to indicate the effect of the revalu-
ation which will be recorded in 1966    The first reflects the value of the
assets, capital and liabilities based on the revaluation made in February
1965 using the 1964 coefficient. The second showis the result of revaluat;on
based on the 1965 coefficient of 1 27 issued in February 1966.

- 13 -
31.       As a result of revaluation, f-ced assets would increase to
Cr$438.86 billion, bringing total assets to Cr$h98.84 billion. Gross
plant in service would increase from Cr$312.29 billion to Cr$381.59
billion or about 22 percent. This is less than the coefficient of 1.27
would suggest, because of two factors    the relatively large portion of
gross plant in service which was financed with foreign exchange loans
would increase by only 20 percent, reflecting the change in the exchange
rate from Crt1,850 to Cr$2,220 per dollar, also, the plant includes a
small amount of capital expenditure incurred during 1965 and which is
not subject to revaluation. The increase of the depreciation reserve to
Cr$16.43 billion would result from the revaluation on the basis of the
1965 coefficient of the revalued depreciation reserve balance outstanding
at January 1, 1965 plus the depreciation charges for 1965 on gross plant
in service at year end. Work in progress would increase to Cr$73.70
billion reflecting revaluation of the balance outstanding at January 1,
1965. This revaluation procedure is the same as used for gross plant in
service, but its results are not used for tariff purposes until the
assets so revalued are transferred to gross plant in service.
32.       The expected 22 percent imcrease in long term debt to Cr$340.32
billion reflects the change in the foreign exchange rate used to value
foreign loans and the revaluation of the local currency loans on the
basis of the new coefficient. The amortization reserve would increase
to Cr$ll.55 billion, in the same proportion, and for the same reasons
as the depreciation reserve. The balance of the revaluation process
would be reflected in a Cr$16.02 billion increase in share capital from
the present Cr$120 billion to Cr$136 billion, to be made in 1966 within
four months of the revaluation.   This increase will be subject to a
5 percent revaluation tax in 1966.
33.       The present share capital, of Cr$120 billion is divided equally
between common and preferred. The distribution of shares among the
shareholders as of December 31, 1965 is shown as follows*

34.       On December 28, 1965, Furnas' capital was increased from
Cr$37.08 billion to the present Cr$120.00 billion. Shares were issued
for Cr$24.45 billion on account of the previous 1964 revaluation. The
balance of Cr$58.47 billion was entirely subscribed by Eletrobras which
paid in 10 percent and committed itself to cancel a corresponding amount
of its long term loans to Furnas as soon as these loans are revalued on
the basis of the 1965 coefficient. This action was recently completed.
35        In 1965 Furnas incurred two new loans one with Eletrobras and
the other with the Bank   Eletrobras which is practically the only supplier
of local funds to Furnas, both in the form of share capital and loans,
entered into a contract on December 31, 1965 with the National Bank for
Economic Development (BNDE) to assume BNDE's three outstanding loans to
Eletrobras. BNDE will be reimbursed from Eletrobras' Federal Electricity
Fund to cover this transaction   Furnas' obligations under these loans
wlll not change except a quarter of one percent guarantee tax to eletro-
bras on outstanding balances will be eliminated
Past Earning Record
36        Income statements for the first two full years of operation,
1964 and 1965, are shown in Annex 2   Sales of kwh in 1965 were about
0 9 billion kwh under Furnas' estimates made late in 1964 and less than
the number of kwh sold in 1964 for the reasons given in paragraphs 24 and
25 Gross income, however, increased from Cr$15 8 billion in 1964 to
Cr$47 5 billion in 1965, reflecting the tariff increases already described
in paragraph 23. The rate of return on remunerable investment at the end
of 1965, but valued in terms of the 1964 coefficient would be about 7 6
percent after charges of 5 percent for depreciation and 3 percent for
amortization   Calculated on the basis of the existing covenant, the return
would be about 10 percent (Average revalued net fixed assets in operation
and using depreciation charges of 2.5 percent)    This illustrates that
Furnas' tariffs in 1965 were adequate and as soon as its plant is fully
utilized its high deprecS.ation and amortization charges could be reduced.



Proposed Financing Plan
37.       A forecast of Sources and Application of Funds for the period
1966-1971 inclusive is shown in Annex 3. During the six-year period
Furnas would complete (a) the transmission line from the Furnas hydro
plant to Rio de Janeiro, (b) the Estrelto plant financed in part by
Bank loan No. 403 BR, and (c) the Estrelto 2nd Stage transmission
facilities to be financed in part by the proposed Bank loan. Furnas is
expected to begin construction on future expansion including the Fumas
hydro plant units 7 and 8 in 1970.
38.       The six-year construction program would total Cr$412.39
billion. Capital expenditure requirements would total Cr$375.38 billion
of which Cr$109.89 billion, or about 27 percent of the total funds re-
quired would be for the Estrelto 2nd Stage transmission to be financed
in part by the proposed Bank loan. It is expected that Cr$37.01 billion
would be required for interest during construction or about 9 percent of
the total requirements.
39.       The followinng is a summary of these requirements, and the
sources from which they are expected to be met:

tribute new share capital of Cr$46 billion or about U percent of the require-
ments. In connection with Loan 403-BR, the Government agreed to provide all
the funds necessary to complete the Project, which already included the com-
pletion of the Estreito 2nd Stage transmission. Eletrobras would continue to
be the Government agent for providing the necessary funds. Forecasts of cash
dividends to Eletrobras of about Cr$80 billion have been considered, but
Furnas and Eletrobras may weLl agree that stock dividends should be paid in-
stead, and reduce accordingly the capital contributions to be paid by Eletrobras



- 17 -
42.      Borrowings would total about Cr$240 billion,or 58 percent of the
requirements   The proposed Bank loan of Cr$86 58 billion, or US$39 million
equivalent, would be about 21 percent of the requirements. It is assumed to
have a term of 25 years including a grace period of 5 years with an interest
rate of 6 percent   Other borrowings include
(1)  The balance of U S AID loan of Cr$24 77 billion equivalent
to finance the foreign costs of the Furnas Transmission Pro-
ject, having a term of 23 years, including a 3-year grace
period with an interest rate of 5 5 percent
(2)  The balance of IBRD loan 403-Br dated February 28, 1965, of
Cr$125 96 billion equivalent, or about 31 percent of the
requirements, to finance in part the Estreito 1st Stage,
having a term of 25 years including a 5-1/2-year grace period
with an interest rate of 5 5 percent, and
(3)  Eletrobras loan of Cr$2 33 billion having a term of 15 years
including a 3-year grace period with an interest rate of 12
percent
Estimated Future Earnings
43       Forecast Income Statements for the period 1966 through 1971
inclusive are shown in Annex 2   A depreciation rate of 5 percent and
amortization rate of 3 percent will be used through 1967 which will cause
the tariffs to be maintained at a high level. Beginning in 1968 tariffs
are expected to be lowered to a more normal level with relatively little
change in net operating income as a result of the Furnas plant being fully
utilized   Tariffs in 1970 are expected to temporarily increase due to lhe
investment costs of the Estrelto project being included for the first time
in calculating the required 10 percent rate of return and because all of
the generating units of the Estrelto plant will not be in full operation
In 1971 when the plant is fully utilized the tariffs are expected to
return to a normal level due to increases in sales
44       As shown on the Sources and Application of Funds Statement, net
operating income would cover total interest, including capitalized interest,
1 85 times in 1966 declining to 1.33 times in 1969 just before the Estrelto
plant is placed in operation    The coverage would then rise to an adequate
level of 2 20 times in 1970 and increase to 2 33 times in 1971.
45       Total debt service would be covered by internal cash generation
2.17 times in 1966 declining in 1968 and 1969 to a low of 1.22 times, when
the AID and Eletrobras loans begin to be amortized, and then rising to
2 02 times in 1970, which is adequate. The effect of meeting amortization
payments on the two Bank loans in 1971 would reduce the coverage slightly to
1.94 times



- 18 -
46.       Furnas will be able to allocate yearly 5 percent of its net
profits to legal reserves as required by law, pay dividends of 10 percent
of the par value of both its common and preferred revalued capital stock
and bonuses
Future Financial Position
47        Annex 1 shows forecast balance sheets as of December 31, 1966
through 1971 inclusive   Furnas' total fixed assets are expected to increase
from Cr$439 billion as of December 31, 1965 to Cr$747 billion by 1971 or
about 1 7 times   Long term debt is expected to increase from Cr$340 billion
to a maximum of Cr$460 billion by 1969 and then to decrease to Cr$439
billion by 1971   Equity is expected to increase from Cr$153 billion to
Cr$310 billion by 1971, or about 2.0 times.
48.       Under the terms of the existing debt limitation covenant in Bank
loan 403 BR, Furnas' total long-term debt is limited to 66-2/3 percent of
its total fixed assets. Certain terms in this covenant have been amended
during negotiations, principally to include short-term debt not incurred in
the ordinary course of business as part of the debt controlled by the
covenant. Annex 2 shows that under the proposed financing plan, debt will
be 62.7 percent of total fixed assets in 1966 rising to 64 6 percent in
1968 and declining to 58 8 percent in 1971.
49.       Furnas' estimated yearly working capital position during the
period under review is adequate    The estimated working capital position
as of December 31 for any given year reflects the worst condition for
the 12-month period Actual experience shows that Furnas accrues large
amounts of cash during the first three quarters of each year wxhich is
more than ample to meet the heavy outlays of cash for dividends, bonuses
and debt service which all come due in the last quarter of the year.
V. CONCLUSIONS
50        In February 1965 an appraisal was made of the Estrelto Project
(No TO 459a), covering the Estreito hydroelectric plant and the minimum
transmission facilities required to connect the plant to the existing
transmission grid, and services and equipment for technical and managerial
improvement. At that time no decision had been reached on the voltage
level of the long transmission lines which were needed, and furthermore it
was not necessary to commence construction of the transmission facilities
at the same time as the hydroelectric plant.
51        This report is therefore a supplement to the previous report and
covers Stage II of the Estrelto Project, consisting of transmission facili-
ties to connect the Estrelto hydroelectric plant to the load centers of Rio
de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. The Project is techmncally and economically
sound and its estimated cost and the proposed construction schedule are
reasonable (paragraphs 2, 3, 10 and 11)

52.       Furnas, which operates under the regulations of the Water Code,
as administered by the W4aters Division, is one of the few utilities which
has taken full advantage of the new tariff regulations issued in November
1964 (paragraphs 13, 14 and 23).
53        The Government and Furnas have agreed to satisfactory arrangements
to the existing tariff and debt limitation covenants which are intended to
bring about uniformity in the covenants applyimng to Brazilian utilities
(paragraphs 21, 22 and 48).
