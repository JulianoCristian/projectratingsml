PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
IURMA
GRAIN STORAGE PROJECT
(Credit 1092-BA)
EVALUATION SUINARY
ObLoctives
The project was to  develop  an  integrated program for upgrading
paddylrice marketing operations of the Agricultural and Farm Produce
Trading  Corporation  (AFPTC)  mainly by  providing  Improved  storage and
transport facilities; drying, grading and pest control equipment; and
training and technical assistance.   The main  component, accounting for
about 902 of project costs, vas  construction  of  20 new paddy stores, of
which 15 were to be constructed from local timber and the rest from
imported prefabricated steel structures.
Implementation Experience
The project had a slow start, mainly due to problems with supply
of building materials.   This  led to  a  2-3  year delay in new storage
construction and the credit closing date had to be extended from September
1985 to  September  1986.   The project  eventually  met  or exceeded all
appraisal targets except for pilot  drying plants, which were not installed
due to high costs, and training, which was far short of expectations due to
late formulation of the training program by APPTC, lack of sufficient
tailor-made courses abroad and the shortage of local training facilities
and staff. The project has contributed to roduction in paddy end rice
storage losses and transport cost savings.
Results
The reestimated economic rate of return (ERR) of the whole project
is attractive at about 222 compared to the opportunity cost of capital of
10.   However, this  is due   to   high ERRs  (over 502) of storage
rehabilitation and rice wagon rohabilitation.  The ERR for the now storage
component,  which  accounts  for  about   902  of project  investments  at
completion as at appraisal, is much lower at about 142.
sustai4Ailit
Provided reasonable standards of operation and maintenance are
mat, sustainability is virtually assured throughout the assumed economic
life of the storage facilities and oquipment.



- Iv -
Findlns
The main lessons which emerge from the proj-et's impleme_ ttlon
experilee are as  followsi   (a)  the  problem  of shortages of building
materials, partly due to the econamy-wide problem of foreign exchange
scarcity, and complicated procurement procedures In the country, both of
which delayed construction of new storage, ws much greater than envisaged
at  appraisal;  (b)  the problem   of shortage  of technical personnel,
particularly In construction and peat control activities, also turned out
to be greater than envisaged at appraisal; (c) such greater attention meeds
to be given to training  componenta  both during appraisal and supervision;
(d) pricing refozm continues to be a difficult area as evidenced by lack of
adjustmont in the grain price structure to give farmers greater incentive
to deliver drier, botter quality paddy, though the Government agreed to do
this under the project; and (e) adequato provision should be made for
officiont Integration between storage and milling
Other points of Interest aroe
-    Pilot mechanical grain  driers were  not  purchased  due to costs
considerably  exceeding  SAR  estimates  and  doubts  about  the
importance of mechanical drying as most of the paddy is bought In
the dry season and moisture content Is within tho prescribed
limits.
-   Private stores rented by AFPTC  did  not utilize project funds for
Imported wire netting (bird screens).
-    The project has  Introduced  new  and  Improved technologies wilch
have facilitated better storage management and continuous milling
operations.

GRAUI STORAGE PiOJtECT (CREDIT 1092-BA)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Overview
1.        This overview is primarily based on the PCR for the Grain Storage
Project (Cr. 1092-BA) prepared by FAO/CP and submitted to the Bank in November
1987. The PCQ presents a detailed review of project implementation and impact
and the Region agrees with the PCi's findings and conclusions. This overview
is divided into two sections: Section A, which is based on the PCR,
summarizes the important aspects of project implementation and impact; and
section B, which complements and elaborates some parts of the PCR relating to
implementation issues and lessons learned, utilizing information from
documents (listed in the Preface) other than the PCR.
A. Project Implementation and Impaect
2.        Proiect Ob3ectives and Components.  The project was designed to
reduce paddy louses, improve rice transportation, and improve rice quality by
reducing paddy quality deterioration, thus helping to lower paddy marketing
costs and increase rice export volume and price. The project was to be imple-
mented in three divisions of lower Burma-Irrawaddy, Rangoon and Peg".  The
main project components were: (a) construction of new paddy stores at 20
sites totalling 100,000 tons to increase permanent storage capacity in the
project area; (b) rehabilitation of 500 paddy and rice stores owned by
Agricultural and Farm Produce Trade Corporation (APPTC) with a total capacity
of about 500,000 tons, 120 small wooden jetties, and 60 railway rice wagons;
(c) provision of grading and storage management equipment for 600 procurement
centers and new stores; (d) implementation of a drying pilot project in three
townships to establish feasibility of further mechanization procedures in
paddy processing; (e) provision of pest control equipment and supplies;
(f) provision of a transshipment store for rice to facilitate shipment by
rail; (g) provision of technical assistance and in-service and overseas
training; nd (h) monitoring and evaluation. The first component was the most
important, accounting for about 90S of project costs.
3.        Project Cost and Financing.  The project was to be implemented over
a four-year period fr'u 1981 through 1984. Total project cost was estimated
at K 258 million (US$39.1 million equivalent) with a 30S foreign exchange
component. Excluding taxes and duties, the project cost was US$30.4 million
equivalent, of which IDA credit of SDR 17.9 (USW23.0) million was to finance
about 751 and COB the rest.
4.        Project Implementation.  Tke project had a slow start mainly due to
problems with supply of building materials, delays in recruitment of



- vi -
consultants and lengthy internal procedures for procurement of imported
construction materials and equipmnt.  Although IDA Credit becam  effective in
Mai 1981, construction of major civil works did not begin until the end of
1983. By September 1985, the original credit closing date, disbursement was
only about S02 of the appraisal estimate. The credit closing date was
extended to September 1986. Disburseent picked up rapidly in this period.
By January 8, 1937, the date of final disbursement, SDR 16.2 (Us$20.8) million
(902) of the Credit had beet disbursed; the rest was cancelled. Delayed
construction of new stores due to problems in availability of building
materials and delays in equipment procurement were the principal reasons for
slower than anticipated project implementation. However, the project
eventually achieved mcst of its targets (see Table 1).
5.        Chanses in Project Scope and Dersign. Relatively minor changes were
mede in the project during implementation. Of these, the deletion of the
pilot drying project was significant. At appraisal, pilot drying plants were
to be provided for three townships. A the cost of the equipment turned out
to be three times higher than appraisal estimates, the OS decided to cancel
the component. Other changes included non-importation of screening material
(bird proofing) for about 150 private stores due to a lack of demand and non-
purchase of 600 handwinnowers at procurement centers due to high imported and
local prices.
6.        Status of the Proiect ot Completion.  The total project cost at
completion was K 243 million (US$30.6 million equivalent) or 94X of the
appraisal cost estimate in Kyat terms and 78Z in dollar terms. Major factors
contributing to lower costs were lower unit costs of new stores and storage
rehabilitation, shortfalls in overseas training and technical assistance, and
deletion of drying pilot project and of bird proofing materials for private
stores. Costs in dollar terms were lower than those in Kyat terms due to the
devaluation of the Kyat by about 172 during the project period (FY 81/82 to
86/87).
7.        Despite the implementation delay and shortfalls in some appraisal
targoets, the project has achieved some successes. It has contributed to
reduction in paddy and rice storage losses and transport costs savings. Based
on surveys carried out by the Post-Harvest Technology Application Center, it
is estimated that new storage under the project has led to savings in
quantitative storage losses of 4.3Z (compared to 1.89S expected at appraisal)
and qualitative storage losses of 12.152 (compared to 8.5Z expected at
appraisal). Storage rehabilitation has reduced quantitative and qualitative
losses from 62 to 42 and from 42 to 32 respectively as expected at
appraisal. The project has also helped introduce a number of new and improved
technologie and upgraded through training staff capabilities to sustain the
higher level of technology. The reestimated economic rate of return (ERR) of
the whole project is attractive at about 222 (see further paro. 20). The
status of major individual components of the project at completion is briefly
discussed below and shown in Table 1.

8.        New Storage Conatruction.  Of the 20 paddy stores to be constructed,
15 were to be constructed from local timber and the rest from imported
prefabricated steel structures. The shortage of cement, timber and iron rods
required for foundation works hampered construction progress and by end 1984,
the original project completion date, only 10 timber stores had been
constructed requiring the extension of the project. By end of 1986, however,
all 20 stores had been couissioned. One of the main criteria for site
selection of thp storage depots was closeness to the new rice mills which were
to be constructed under ADS (12 mills) and OECF loans (8 mills) in order to
allow integration of storage and milling. After considerable delays of the
ADD project due to procureont probles, all 20 new rice mills were
operational by end 1986 (see further par&. 24).
9.       At appraisal, tht financial cost per ton for new storage under the
project wes estim-ted at US$241 and US$310 equivalent. for the timber and
prefabricated steel godowns, respectively. Actual average construction cost
for the timber godowne, however, amounted to US$147 equivalent per ton, mainly
due to lower than expected cost of civil works. Actual average cost per ton
for the prefabricated steel godowns aounted to about US$330 equivalent.
10.       Rehabilitation of Storage. Jetties and Rice Wagons.  The targets for
this component were exceeded (see Table 1). The actual average rehabilitation



- viii -
cost of paddy stores was K 14,800 per store or about K 15 per ton compared to
the appraisal estimate of K 13,200 (1980 prices) per store. A significant
feature of impleuntation of this component was the non-utilization of funds
for improvement of 150 private owned stores rented by AFPTC. AFPTC had agreed
to advance one year's rent to enable the owners to obtain the required local
building materials while the project was to provide about US$650 per store for
importation of wire netting (bird screens). The private owners, however, did
not make use of this facility and no funds were disbursed under the
component. Another significant feature was that due to delays in the
reallocation of funds by the Covernment, project funds financed rehabilitation
of only 78 of 120 wooden jetties and 30 of the 60 rice wagons envisaged at
appraisal. The rest (see Table 1) were financed by AFPTC and Surma Railways
Corporation (sRC) respectively from their own resources.
11.       Grading, frying and Pest Control.  By January 31, 1982, the COB was
to review the paddy grading criteria to give farmers adequate financial
incentives to deliver paddy of better storability and quality. Action on this
was delayed until December 1985 when AFPTC propesed a sharp increase in flat
rate deductions for excessive moisture and impurity levels and an upward
adjustment of prices for cleaned and properly dried paddy. But this proposal
was not approved at the ministerial level. As a result, the quality of paddy
purchased by AFPTC is not considered to have improved over the pre-project
level. However, all grading and storage management equipment, except hand
winnowers, whose cost was considered to be too high, were bought as envisaged
at appraisal.
12.       The appraisal aim of testing the economic and social acceptability
and effectiveness of mechanical drying through three pilot drying plants was
not met. The price quoted for a continuous flow drier by the acceptable
bidder was over US$200,000, which was three times more than the project
allocation for the component. Though IDA agreed to finance the purchase, the
COB deoided against it since there were doubts about the importance of
mechanical drying as most of the paddy is bought in the dry season and
moisture content is within the prescribed limits.
13.       Though pest control equipment and supplies were purchased for 28
central squads in the pro  ct area, the establishment of squads ezpected by
June 1, 1982 was delayed until January 1984 due to nonavailability of
technicians, and this delay in posting had some adverse effects on the paddy
loss reduction progrem during this period.
14.       Transshipment  Store.  Due to late arrival of materials and shortage
of technicima, the construction of the store was completed by October 1985,
about two years behind schedule.
15.       Technical Assistance and Trainin8.  Only 22 of the 30 man-months of
technical assistance envisaged were urilized for preparation of detailed
design and specifications, tender documents and bid evaluations; supervision
of the construction of prefabricated steel stores; and installation and
testing of mechanical equipment in storage depots. The structural engineer
completed his task over a 12-month period but the mechanical engineer left
after 10 months having only completed the test run for the first site. The



- ix -
other sites were successfully completed by the AFPTC engineers in
collaboration with the engineers and foremen of the equipment suppliers.
16.       The implementation of the training component was disappointing
(Table 1). The formulation of the training program by AFPTC was delayed by
two years. Later, the main reasons for shortfall in overseas training were
apparently the lack of fluency in English of the staff to be trained and
difficulties in identifying appropriate overseas institutions and courses.
Local training has hampered by a shortage of teaching staff and facilities and
the failure of AFPTC to organize specific courses prior to credit closing
date. Training given by supplier representatives was mostly carried out as
specified. Scarcity of sufficiently trained storage managers and pest control
officers remains a problem added to the produce quality problems faced by
AFPTC.
17.       Kanagement and IDA Performance.  Overall, the performance of AFPTC,
the main executing agency, was satisfactery. The shortfall in the training
component, however, militated against adequate upgrading of staff capabilities
in pest control and storage management. The Construction Corporation (CC),
which carried out the construction of new stores under contract with AFPTC,
was not always able to cope with the additional workload in a timely manner,
which delayed project implementation. In particular, construction of the
transshipment store suffered a long delay (par&. 14), partly due to the CC's
lack of technical expertise in erecting structures of this nature. The
performance of BRC was fully satisfactory. Though some delay in equipment
delivery occurred, the Thai contractors performed to the full satisfaction of
AFPTC.
18.       Both unaudited and audited financial statements lagged far behind
schedule. The audited report for FYm1/82 was delayed 27 months and those for
mY2183 and FY83/84 32 and 23 montus, respectively.  The reports for FY84/85
to 86/87 have not yet been completed. The main reason for delay has been the
workload in AFPTC and Central Auditor General's office.
19.       While the project concept was sound, ezpectations of IDA staff at
appraisal relating to speed of storage construction and training program
proved to be over optimistic. IDA supervision of the project was also
irregular. Over the five-year project period, only seven supervision missions
took place. The interval between the first and the second mission was nearly
16 months and another gap of 14 months occurred between missions 4 and 5.
More frequent missions in the early stages of the project may have reduced
implementation delays.
20.       *kono hc Impact.  The PCR reestimates the ERR in 1987 constant
prices.  Tbi      for storage rehabilitation and vice wagon rehabilitation are
over 502 as estimated at appraisal but substantially lower for the new storage
component (142 vs 282 at appraisal) and for the whole project (about 222 vs
29Z at appraisal). Despite substantially greater quantitative and qualitative
storage losses saved (para. 7), delayed benefits by 2-3 years and 502 lower
paddy equivalent economic prices have reduced ERRs at completion compared to
those at appraisal. While the ERR for the whole project (about 22Z) is quite
attractive compared to the estimated opportunity cost of capital of 102 in



-x-
Burma, this ERR is heavily influenced by very high ERRs for storage and rice
wagon rehabilitation. The ERR for the new storage component, which at
completion accounts for about 90X of project investments as envisaged at
appraisal, is much lower at 14S. Undoubtedly, the dramatic decline in world
rice prices (Thai 52 brokep; f.o.b. Bangkok) from about US$ 553/tonne in 1981
to US$ 210/tonne in 1987 and projected US$ 249/tonne in 1990 (the price used
in the PCR) in 1987 constant values has been the major reason. However, the
impact of this factor was pronounced because of 2-3 years' delay in
construction of new storage. By the time the new stores were operational
(1985/86),the dramatic decline in rice prices had occurred. If the
construction program had been on schedule, project economics would have
benefitted from the relatively higher prices in 1982-84.
B. Implementation Issues and Lessons Learned
21.       Macroeconomic Issues.  The shortages of both imported and local
building materials considerably affected the new storage construction program
(paras. 4 and 8) and reduced its economic viability (para. 20). This was
partly the result of the economy-wide problem of foreign exchange scarcity.
Complicated procurement procedures in the country were another factor. Both
these problems turned out to be greater than envisaged at appraisal. Learning
from this experience, provision for directly imported construction materials
is included in the follow-on project-Burma, Grain Storage and Processing
Project (Cr. 1707-BA). The problem of availability of technical personnel in
the country also turned out to be greater than anticipated at appraisal. This
was demonstrated by the delay in construction activities by the CC (para. 17)
and in posting of pest control squads (para. 13).
22.       Training Component.  The disappointing implementation of the
training component (para. 16) underscores the need for much greater attention
to this activity both during appraisal and supervision. At project
completion, there is an urgent need for a su'. cantial steppinr up of AFPTC's
training effort in store management, grain ijfestation and pest control and
maintenance of mechanical grain handling equipment.
23.       Grading Price Structure.  The adjustment in the grain price
structure to give farmers greater incentive to deliver paddy of better
storability and quality was not done by the Government (para. 11). Thus paddy
purchased by AFPTC continues to have a relatively high foreign matter or
ima_ture grain content, a factor contributing to the discounts applied to
export prices.
24.       integration of Storage and Milling.  Although the SAR had stressed
the integration between rice storage and milling (para. 8), adequate physical
linkages between the two had not been provided for. Paddy had to be manually
transferred to the mills. While this practice has some merits in the Burmese
context due to its labor-intensiveness, the wage cost per ton for porterage
amounted to K 2 while costs for conveyor belt transport were estimated to be
only K 0.3-0.5. Moreover, transfer has to take place often in heavy rains and
with manual operation the paddy gets wet causing qualitative deterioration.



- xi -
Vbstly out of its own funds, APPTC hea  now installed mecanical transfer
equipment at most sites. Finncial constraints, however, have impeded the
completion at the remaining sites. Therefore, in future projects of a similar
nature, funds for mechanical transfer system should be included from the
start. This was implemeted in the follow-on project- Burma, Grain Storage
and Processing Project (Cr. 1707-BA).



BURMA
GRAIN STORAGE PROJECT (CR.1092-BA)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. BACKGROUND
A. Introduction
1.1     The Grain Storage Project, for which  Credit  1092-BA for  USS23.0
million was approved on Jan 6, 1981, was to be implemented over a four-year
period. The proJect was identified during appraisal of the Lower Burma
Paddyland Development I Project (IDA Credit 642-BA) and was intended to
enhance the benefits from rice production in the project area by helping to
overcome post-harvest constraints affecting public sector graln procurement
and handling.
B. Aariculture in Burma
1.2     Burma has a population of  about  36.8  million  (1985)  which  Is
growing at a rate of around 2.2%. Since 1973, GNP per capita has risen at an
annual rate of about 3.8% and reached US$190 in 1985.   Agriculture  is the
dominant sector of the economy; it contributes about 44% of GNP and engages
about two-thirds of the labour force. Agricultural production accounts for
about 80% of the country's merchandise exports (1984).
1.3      During the 1960s and early 1970s, the agricultural sector developed
rather slowly with output increasing at only 1.6% per tnnum. Oue to a number
of policy reforms in 1973/74, which improved incentives to farmers and
reduced the Influence of public sector planning in the farming sector,
agriculture gained omentum and grew at an average annual rate of 7.5%
betweeN1974175 and 1985/86.
1.4     About 10.4 million ha, equivalent to 15%  of  the country's total
area, are under cultivation of which about 1.2 million ha are under
irrigation. Approximately 9.7 million ha are classified as fallow and
cultivable waste land and 32.2 million ha (about 50% of the total) are
forests. Foodgrains occupy the major proportion of the cropped area.
1.5      Paddy production increased substantially from just over 8 million
tons In 1970 to 14.4 million tons In 1985/86. The main reason for this
considerable growth was GOB's successful paddy intensification programme,
known as the Whole Township Prograume (VTP) which had been launched in
1975/76. At present (1986/87), there are nearly 5 million ha under rice
cultivation of which 0.8 million ha or 16% are under irrigation.



- 2 -
1.6      Within the  framework  of  this  programme,  sufficient  productive
inputs, mainly improved seeds and fertilizers, were made available in a
timely manner and the extension service was considerably strengthened and
expanded. As a result, HYVs now cover over 50X of the country's paddy area
and yields in townships covered by WTP reached 3.2 tons/ha in 1984/85
compared to 2.4 tons/ha of paddy in non-programme townships.
1.7      Practically  all  paddy is grown in the wet season (mid-May to mid-
October) and harvested and threshed during the dry months between November
and January. After drying the paddy for one to two weeks, farmers store
paddy for their own use in bamboo cages or bins. The marketable surplus is
sold either to the Agricultural and Farm Produce Trade Cotforation (AFPTC)
or in the open market, normally within the farmer's township.
C. Agricultural and Farm Produce Trade Corporation
1.8      AFPTC is the Goverment's paddy procurement agency and every farmer
is obliged to sell a minimum quota to this agency at a fixed price. The
quota for each farm family is negotiated and fixed at village level, based
on GOB guidelines. As a result, approximately 60% of the marketable surplus
is bought by AFPTC and 40% is sold on the open market.
1.9      In  the  past years, AFPTC's paddy procurement price was on average
about 40% below the free market price.  The  difference  between  the  fixed
procurement  price  and the free market price is, however, much higher (over
501) for better quality rice. Consequently farmers tend to sell only the
poorest quality rice to AFPTC. Since the agency is also in charge of rice
exportation, the generally low quality produce affects its chances to
successfully compete on export markets.
1.10     Differential  procurement  prices  are applied according to quality
and moisture content. Overall quality control and grading performance,
however, Is still fairly low due to lack of adequately trained personnel and
grading equipment. In addition, price discounts for quality/moisture content
are apparently not strong enough to encourage farmers to deliver pawdy of
higher quality and storability to AFPTC.
1.11     Locally the GOB sells rice  through  cooperative  stores  at  fixed
prices in rationed quantities of 13 kg per adult and 6.5 kg per child per
month, mainly in rice deficit townships. In 1985/86, over 1.6 million  tons
of controlled rice were sold. Higher income families procure better quality
rice on the open market, whilst farmers retain their own production and
therefore do not buy in the ration shops.
1.12     Exported  rice  fetches  fairly  low  prices mainly due to its high
proportion of brokens. Better storage ard grading would improve the
situation. In 1985/86 a total of 0.75 million tons have been exported at an
average price of USS154.8 per ton as compared to world market prices of
approx. USS210.



1.13    AFPTC's  permanent  storage  capacity  Is  still  rather   limited,
amounting  to   less   than   45%  of  procurement. Therefore  the  agency
requisitioned in the past - for very low annual rents - private storage
godowns for another 35% of its requirements whilst the remainder of the crop
had to be stored in temporary sheds which do not protect paddy adequately
from moisture and pests.
1.14    Transportation  of paddy/rice is by water and land in nearly equal
proportions. Water movement is carried out mostly by private barges and
sampans whilst land move-ient is mainly by private truck and the Road
Transport Corporation (RTC). Rail transport, although cheaper, still suffers
from numerous constraints.
0. PCR Information Source
1.15     An FAOfWorld Bank Cooperative Programme mission visited the country
In June 1987 to assist with the revision of a draft PCR prepared by AFPTC.
This report is based on the findings of the mission and on project documents
and reports prepared by GOB and the World Bank during project preparation,
appraisal and implementation.
11. PROJECT FORMULATION
A. Preparation and Appraisal
2.1      The project was identified durin  the appraisal of the Lower Burma
Paddyland Development I Project (IDA Credit 642-BA, June 1976) and financing
for project preparation was provided under the same  project.  For  detailed
project  preparation, the GOB engaged Sanyu Consultants, Nagoya, Japan, in
December 1977. By October 1978 the consultants submitted their draft final
report. The proposed project complemented three earlier projects implemented
with IDA support, namely, the Seed Development Project and two Lower Burma
Paddyland Development Projects. It aimed at reducing paddy losses and the
Improvement of rice transportation and of rice quality mainly by improving
public swetor marketing facilities and operations.
2.2      The project was  located  in the southern part of the country and
covered the Irrawaddy, Rangoon and Pegu Divisions which are together known
as the  Lower  Burma Region. Public  sector  rice procurement in the area
mounted to 2.4 million tons in 1979/80, which represents 35% of production
in this area, and was expected to increase to 2.6 million tons by 1982/83.
2.3      Although  IDA  provided guidance  to  the  consultants  throughout
preparation, their report still left a number of open questions which had to
be  resolved at appraisal, which was carried out by IDA In November/Oeceer
1978. The concept of the project as conceived at appraisal was similar to
the  one  prepared,  but  differed  in  various  technical  aspects. Diverse
opinions between IDA and GOB on the design of paddy stores required two IDA
follow-up missions to prepare the final SAR which was presented in November
1980.



- 4 -
2.4      At appraisal, the  permanent  storag*  capacity  In  the  area  was
1,277,000 tons, most of it in poor condition, resulting in physical and
qualitative losses which were estimated to result in a loss of about 10% per
year in the value of rice stored. In non-permanent stores, financial losses
were estimated to reach 20% over a five month storage period.
2.5      Increasing procurement by AFPTC was estimated to require additional
new storage capacity of 228,000 tons by 1982/83. Rice milling capacity was
found to be adequate in the Rangoon and Pegu Divisions whilst new rice
milling capacity of about 19 TPH would be required in the Irrawaddy
Division. AFPTC planned projects with ADB and bilateral financing would
provide this capacity.
2.6      Due  to  an improvement in the logistics operation, it was expected
that paddy transport requirements of AFPTC would not change despite
increased  procurement.  Rice  transport  requirements,  however,  would  be
affected by the increased procurement and were estimated to increase by
about 190,000 tons.
B. ProJect Description
2.7      The project was to devetop an integrated  prograume  for  upgrading
AFPTC's paddy/rice marketing operation mainly by providing improved storage
and transport facilities, drying, grading and pest control equipment, as
well as training and technical assistance.
2.8      The project as appraised included the following components:
a) new storaLe capacity of 100,000 tons at those 20 sites in 10
townships wnere also new rice mills would be installed with ADB or
Overseas Economic Cooperative Fund (OECF) support;
b) rehabilitation of about 500,000 tons of storage capacity owned by
AFPTC ain about 120 small wooden jetties;
c) qradina  and  storage  mana ement      i   t for  600  procurement
centres and the new stores;
d) Dest control equipment and supplies;
e) a Oryina Pilot ProJect in three townships;
f) traininq in Burma for 1,280 persons (305 man-months) and overseas
for 38 persons (70 man-months);
g) rehabilitation of 60 rice wagons;
h) a trans-shinment store for rice with 3,000 ton capacity;
i) monitorina and evaluation; and
j) technical assistance In finalisation of new storage design and in
early project implementation.



2.9      Project costs were estinmted  at US$39.1 million over a 4-year
period. The AFPC would be the main executing agency and the Construction
Corporation (CC) would be the main construction contractor. The economic
rate of return for the whole project was estimated at 29X.
C. Neootiations and EffectivMss
2.10    Loan negotiations were initially scheduled to take place In April
1979. Nainly due to the need to reformlate the storage component,
negotiations were delayed and finalised only in November 1960. As particular
eonditions for credit effectiveness, it was specified that:
a) A Project Coordination Comittee had to be established.
b) A Project Implementation Unit had to be established by AFPTC and a
Project Director appointed.
c) The Sorrrower was to cause the Construction Corporation (CC) to
assign the responsibilitles for coordinating all aspects of the
civil wor*s of the new paddy stores and of the rice trans-shipment
store to a Project Coordinator with qualifications acceptable to
the Association.
d) The execution and delivery of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement, on
behalf of the Borrower and AFPTC respectively, had to be duly
authorised or ratifi d.
2.11    No special difficulties arose at negotiations and the Credit became
effective on 4 Nay, 1981.
III. IMPLEMENTATION
A. ProJect Start-up
3.1     The project had a slow start mainly due to the difficulties in  the
supply of building materials. Although the Credit becam  effective in My
1l96, construction of nmjor functional works did not begin until the end of
193.



-6-
B.  Chanmes in Prolect Resign
3.2      There was no formal aid-term review of the project. However, during
the course of project implementation, several technical changes took place:
- In the case of one godown, the location had to be changed. The low
soil bearing capacity at Ngapudaw  required  a  shift of  site  to
Letpadan which was agreed to by IDA during Septeber 1985.
- Provision was made for importation of screening material for about
150 private stores. Due to a lack of demand, no such improvements
took place.
- Due to delayed disbursements by Boverruent to AfPTC, only 78 out of
the 120 jetties earmarked for rehabilitation were improved under
the project. AFPTC, however, out of its own funds, rehabilitated
approximately 70 additional ones.
- Pilot drying plants were to be provided for three townships.
Subsequentlys it was decided to purchase only one continuous drier
which was approved by IDA in October 1983. As the cost of the
equipment was three times higher than appraisal estimates, BOB
decided to cancel the component.
- The project provided for 600 hand winnowers at the various
procurement   centres.   Prices, both  imported  and  local, were
considered  to  be too  high.  The  item  has  subsequently   been
eliminated from the project and funds reallocated.
C. General Imlementation Exgerlence
3.3      Appraisal  estimated  that  the  main  physical components would be
completed by September 1984 with a project closing date of Septem6er 1985.
Due to the initial delays in implementation, by that time only USS11.3
million of the envisaged US$23.0 million had been disbursed and only about
SO% of the main components were completed.
3.4      With  increasing availability of construction material and improved
experienc  of  the  Construction  Corporation, work  progress  accelerated
considerably thereafter and the project achieved most of its physical
development targets. However, the  local and  overseas  training  of AFPTC
personnel still fell substantially short of schedule. The Implementation
achievements are summarized below:

by one year and closed in September 1966 and the accounts closed in January
1987.

New Storaqe Construction
3.6      It was envisaged that twenty paddy stores with a total capacity of
100,000 tons would be constructed over  a 3-year period, increasing  the
permanent storage capacities in the project area by about 8%. Fifteen of
these stores would be constructed from local timber and another five from
imported prefabricated steel structures.
3.7     Timber codown.  Each depot would consist of two buildings,
adequately spaced, each with a storage capacity of 2,500 tons, sub-divided
into five  equally-sized coipartments. According to the SAR schedule, the
construction of a first batch of six timer godowns was to be  started  In
FY81/82. However,  the CC could only manage to collect some of the
construction material. Thus, by October 1982 only the foundation work for
five sites had been initiated.
3.8     The  shortage of cement, timber as well as iron rods required for
the foundation works, continued to haper construction progress. Thus by
March 1985, civil works for only ten timber godowns had been completed
requiring the extension of the project. Subsequently, considerable efforts
were made to obtain the outstanding quantities of cement and timber locally.
Furthermore, IDA approved the purchase of iron rods from abroad as these

were not available locally. Consequently, it was possible to finalise all
civil works within the extended deadline as shown below:

3.9     Steel codowns.  Besides these fifteen storage depots locally  built
In timber.ftie pr`ifabricated  steel  depots were imported which were In
design and dimension similar to  the  timber. structures.  The SAR  states:
Experience  gained  from  the  construction and use of a limited number of
steel godowns under this project may prove useful for future projects when,
because of timber shortage or other reasons, this technology becomes
preferable".
3.10     It was foreseen that two of these  pilot  steel  stores would  be
completed in FY 1982/83 and the remaining three in FY 1983/84. However, work
was considerably delayed mainly due to shortage of building materials for
foundation works an initial problms with the foreign supplier. Completion
dates of the godown and the coumissloning dates of the mechanical handling

3.11     As specified, each of the 20 stores was  provided  with  mechanical
equipment for loading and unloading of paddy through belt conveyors. In
addition, pre-cleaning equipment was installed at the intake side as well as
a system of forced aeration to help control temperature and moisture
conditions and reduce the risk cf quality deterioration. A diesel generator
has been installed on all twenty sites to supply the required electricity
for the equipment and the aeration system.
3.12     One of the main criteria for the  site  selection  of  the  storage
depots was to locate them side-by-side with the new rice mills which would
be constructed unler ADB and OECF loans, In order to allow Integration of
storage  and milling. At appraisal it was understood-that under an AOB loan,
twelve new rice mills would be sited at some of the IDA-financed godown
sites whilst in the remaining eight, OECF-financed mills would be located.
3.13     Whereas  no  difficulties  were  encountered  concerning  the joint
operations with the OECF, procurement probl-ms resulted in considerable
delays  of  the ADB project. As a result, the ADO loan had to be extended to
31 December, 1986. The last delivery of ADB milling equipment took place in
November 1985 and all new mills were operational by the end of the project.
3.14     Although  the  SAR had stressed the integration between storage and
milling, no attempts were made to provide for adequate physical* linkages
between the godowns and the mills. Therefore, paddy had to be manually
transferred to the mills. Within the soclo-economic content of the  country,
this highly labour intensive practice has been acceptable. On a per ton
basis, however, wages amounted to K2 for porterage whilst costs for conveyor
belt transport for the same operation were estimated to be only in the range
of K0.3 to KO.5. Moreover transfer often takes place in heavy rain  so  that
the paddy gets wet causing qualitative deterioration. Mostly out of its own
funds, AFPTC has now installed mechanical transfer equipment at most sites.
Financial constraints, however, have impeded the completion at the remaining
sites. Therefore, in future projects of a similar nature, funds for
mechanical transfer systems should be Included from the beginning.
3.15     The  financial cost per ton of storage capacity for the new storage
under the project was estimated to be USS241 and USS310 for the timber and
prefabricated steel godowns, respectively. Average construction cost for the
timber godowns, however, amounted to only USS147 per ton, mainly due to
lower than expected cost of the civil works component, especially the
foundations. The final averag e cost per ton for the prefabricated steel
godowns munted to about US$330. Annual paddy throughput is estimated to be
about 10,000 tons per store.
Storage and Jetty Rehabilitation
3.16     The  project was to rehabilitate about 500 AFPTC-owned paddy stores
with a total capacity of 500,000 tons, mainly by providing imported roofing
sheets, wire netting and local hardwood, at an average cost of USS2,000
(K13,200 - 1980) per store. By the end of the project, 621 paddy stores with
a  total  capacity  of  approx. 540,000  tons  had  been rehabilitated at an
average cost of about K14,800 per store or about K1S per ton.



- 10 -
3.17    This increase in the storage rehabilitation  component  was  agreed
upon by IDA. The progranme was carried out by AFPTC's storage rehabilitation
groups and the overall quality of work was found to be good. Operators of
rehabilitated stores Indicated that their quantitative losses were reduced
from about 6% before rehabilitation to about 4X.
3.18     About 150 AFPTC rented project stores were to be improved under the
project. AFPTC had agreed to advance one year's rent to enable the owners to
obtain the required local building materials, whilst the project would
provide the imported wire netting for approximately USS6SO per store. The
private owners, however, did not make use of this facility and no funds were
disbursed under the component. It is not clear why this facility was not
used.
3.19     AFPTC was also entrusted  with  the  rehabilitation  of  about  120
wooden  jetties which  provide river access to stores and paddy procurement
centres. Over the project period a total of 150 jetties were built, of which
78 (5 in Rangoon and 73 in Irrawaddy Division) were financed with project
funds and the remainder directly by AFPTC.
Grading and Storage Manaoement
3.20     At  negotiations  it was  agreed  that  by January 1982, 608 would
review the grain price structure to give farmers a greater incentive to
improve the quality of paddy. Unfortunately action on this issue was delayed
until December 1985 when AFPTC proposed a sharp increase in flat rate
deductions for excessive moisture and impurity levels and an upward
adjustment of prices for cleaned and properly dried paddy.
3.21     These measures were, however, not approved at ministerial level. As
a result, the quality of paddy purchased by the organization remained at the
pre-project level. The situation was aggravated by the lack of proper
grading at procurement.
3.22     To  increase grading efficiency, a hand huller, a hand winnower and
a sample board were to be provided for 600 procurement centres. The  hullers
and sample boards were purchased. However, international and local costs
were found too high to warrant the purchase of hand winnowers and the item
has been dropped from the protect and monies reallocated. All store
mnag_ment equipment was bought. Also as envisaged, pest control equipment
for 28 central squads in 14 consolfdated townships in the project area were
supplied and used once the squads were established.
3.23    As per appraisal report by May 1, 1981, at least one  pest  control
squad, consisting of one inspector and two technicians, would be stationed
in each of the 14 consolidated townships in the project area; and by June 1,
1982, two such squads would be stationed in these townships. Only in
January, 1984 28 squads were stationed in the consolidated townships. This
delay in posting the squads wad due to non-availability of technicians in
time and has negatively affected the loss reduction  progrme  during  this
period.

3.24     In order  to  ter,  the economic  and  social  acceptability  and
effectiveness of artificial drying, the project provided pilot drying plants
in three selected townships, to be located one each in the upper, middle and
lower delta area. In each location, two alternative designs of driers, i.e.
a cup and cone continuous flow drier and a bin type batch drier, would be
tried. Both would be husk fired.
3.25    With  IDA concurrence,  it was subsequently decided to concentrate
the pilot drying sub-proJect in Nyaungmya rather than installing small pilot
driers at three different locations and only instal a continuous flow drier.
ICS for the equipment was floated on 1 October, 1984 and closed on 29
October, 1984. The price quoted by the acceptable bidder was over US$200,000
which was three times more than the project allocation for the component.
Although IDA agreed to provide the additional funds, GOB at ministerial
level finally decided against the purchase of the drier, as high moisture
levels in paddy are mostly due to poor post-harvest techniques at fam.u level
and can be remedied more cost effectively by simple sun drying.
Transportation
3.26     To  improve rice  transportatior  and  reduce transport costs, the
rehabilitation of sixty rice wagons and the operation of  four unit  trains
were included in the project. AFPTC was to purcho'te the required spare parts
and provide them to the Burma Railways Corporation (BRC) which would carry
out the repairs and be responsible for the operation of the trains.
3.27     A  total  of  USS223,600  had been allocated, mainly to provide new
brakes and bearings for the double bogie wagons. During implementation, it
was found that additional parts such as buffers and draw gears, brake
cylinders, beams and rods would be required and that funds would be only
sufficient to refit thirty wagons. The shortfall wis made up by BRC's own
resources.
3.28    The first unit train went into operation on 15 February, 1983, the
second on  1 June, 1983, the third on 15 July, 1983 and the fourth on 1st
September, 1983. The contract between AFPTC and BRC expired In September
1985.  During   this  period, approximately  134,000  tons  of rice  were
transported annually compared to less than 100,000 tons without the project.
Annual transport savings were calculated to be about K4.5 (USS0.7) per ton..
After expiry of the contract, trains no longer operated as unit trains on a
fixed schedule, but rather on an ad hoc basis whenever required. This change
did not seriously affect the efficiency of the operation.
Trans-shipment Store
3.29     A  rice  trans-shipment  store with  3,000 tons capacity was to be
con#-*ucted under the project. The work was to  be  carried out  by  the
Cont.ruction Corporation (CC). Bids for the procurement of construction
material and steel structures were floated in July 1982 and the contract
with the successful bidder signed In April 1983. The first consignment of
materials arrived in November 1983 and the last in July  1984. Due  to  the
late arrival of materials and the lack of technicians, the construction of
the store could only be completed by October 1985.

Training
3.30     The SAR envisaged that 38 staff from AFPTC would  receive  overseas
training for a total of 70 man-months and that local in-service training
wou1d be provided to 1,280 persons through 80 courses of one week's
duration. In fact, only 15 staff were trained abroad and 371 received local
training.
3.31     Initially AFPTC was slow in utilising the training component, later
on, however, serious attempts were made to expose staff to overseas
training. The main reasons for the short(all In training were apparently the
lack of fluency in English of the staff to be trained and difficulties in
identifying appropriate overseas institutions and courses. Local training
has been hampered by a shortage of teaching staff and the failure of AFPTC
to organize specific courses prior to credit closing date; training given by
supplier representatives, however, was mostly carried out as specified.
3.32     Scarcity  of sufficiently trair*d s,sorage managers and oest control
officers has added to the quality problem f ed by AFPTC.
Technical Assistance
3.33     Thirty   man-months  of  technical  assistance  in  structural  and
mechanical engineering were foreseen under the project. The purpose was to
assist in the preparation of tender documents, specifications and bid
evaluation and to help supervise the construction of the first prefabricated
steel godowns as well as the installation and test operation of the
mechanical equipment in storage depots. The consultants were to be engaged
by AFPTC by 1st July, 1981.
3.34     The  experts took up their assignment in November 1981. Whereas the
structural  engineer  completed  his  task  over  a  12-month  period,   the
mechanical engineer left after 10 months having only completed the test run
for the first pilot site. At the time of his departure, the other four sites
were under installation. These sites were successfully completed by the
AFPTC.engineers in collaboration with the engineers and foremen of the
equipment suppliers (Serli Jucker - Bangkok). Thus only a total of 22 man-
months of technical assistance had been utilised.
E. Prolect Cost. Financina and Disbursement
ProJect Costs
3.35     Total  project  costs  were  estimated  at  K258  million  (USS39.1
million). Actual total project costs were K243 million, or 94% of the
appraisal cost estimates. Tables 1 and 2 show total project expenditures
during FY81/82 to 86/87 and the comparison between project cost estimates
and actual costs. The cost comparison by components is given below:

3.36    Major  factors  contributing  to  the reduced costs were lower unit
costs of  the  prefabricated  stores  and  storage  rehabilitation, reduced
overseas training and technical assistance, and the deletion of the bird
proofing material for private stores and of the drying pilot project. Total
savings were K15 million. Due to the above cost reductions and the
devaluation of the Kyat by about 17% during the project period  (FY81/82  to
86/87), total costs in USS terms were 30.6 million, or 78% of the appraisal
cost estimates.
Financino and Disbursements
3.37     The proposed  IDA credit was USS23 sillion (SOR17.9 million) which
would finance 100% of foreign exchange costs (USS11.6 million) and 61% of
local costs (USS11.4 million), net of duties and taxes. Total IDA financing
would cover 76% of the total cost estimates net of duties and taxes (US$30.4
million) nd 59% of project cost estimates Including duties and taxes
(US$39.1- million).  Because  of  the  reduced  project  costs,   the   Kyat
devaluation and an unused balance of USS2.2 million, actual IOA financing
was only US$20.8 million, or 90% of the appraisal cost estimates as shown
below:

3.38     Actual  total  IDA  financing was 82 X of total project costs net of
duties and taxes (USS25.3 million) and 68X of total project costs including
duties  and  taxes  (USS30.6 million).  However, in terms of SOR, total IDA
financing was 16.2 million or 91% of the appraisal estimates, and the
undisbursed portion of the credit cancelled.
3.39     Due mainly to delayed construction of new stores and procurement of
equipment, disbursements lagged far behind the appraisal estimates during
1981/82 - 1983/84. However, they picked up rapidly during the remaining
project period as shown below:

F. CoLMllance With Covenants
3.40     SOB  did  not  comply  with  covenants  in  the Development Credit
Agreement (OCA) in the following respects:
i) Under Section 3.07 (A+B), it was stipulated that by 1 June.  1982,
two adequately staffed and equipped pest control squads would be
stationed in each of the 14 consolidated townships in which
facilities were to be located. It was not until January 1984 that
this condition was complied with.



- 15 -
II) By May 1981, AFPTC was to furnish IDA, for review, an annual plan
for overseas training (Section 3.08 OCA). The submission and
subsequent review by IDA was delayed until June 1983 reflecting the
slow implementation of the training programme.
iii) AFPTC was held to review by January 1982 Its current paddy grading
criteria and make recomuendations so as to ensure that farmers had
adequate  financial  incentives  to   deliver   paddy   of   better
storability and quality (Section 3.09 OCA). IDA agreed to extend
the date for compliance to July 1983. However, it was not until the
end of 1985 that IDA was provided with the required review which
included recommendations for revised discounts on a variety and
grade basis and, in fact, no price adjustments took place over the
project period to improve financial incentives to farmers.
iv) Other delays it complying with covenants were encountered in
respect of the agreement between AFPTC and BRC on the operation of
unit trains (Section 3.13A, OCA), the agreement between AFPTC  and
CC on  the  construction  of  stores   Section  3.14 OCA), and the
recruitment of engineering consultants  Section 3.16 OCA).
IV. PROJECT IMPACT
A.  Intended Impact
4.1      The major Impact  Intended  by  the  project  was  a  reduction  in
quantitative  and  qualitative  storage  losses. It was assumed that the new
stores constructed under the project would replace temporary storage
facilities  thus  reducing  quantitative  losses  from  2.5%  to  0.61%  and
qualitative losses from 9.5% to 1% resulting in savings of 1.89% and 8.5%
respectively, equivalent to annual savings of USS5.1 million at full
development. The rehabilitation of existing paddy stores would reduce
quantitative losses from 6% to 4% and qualitative losses from 4% to 3% which
would result In additional storage loss reduction valued at US$1.2 million.
These reductions In losses would result in enhanced export earnings of
USS6.7 million per year from 1985 onwards.
4.2    - The rehabilitation of rice wagons and the construction of a trans-
shipment store at Thazi would contribute net savings of US$0.7 million per
year from 1982-86. In addt.ion, the location of the new stores would help to
reduce uneconomic transport of rice and thus result In indirect savings of
transportation  costs. Other  benefits, which, however, had   not   been
quantified, were expected to arise from improved short-tern storage of rice,
infrastructural Improvements, staff training, investdmnt in equipment for
grading and a paddy drying pilot project. In addition, it was anticipated
that gradually the quality of rice would improve, which would help secure
export markets for the country.

B. Actual Impact
4.3      AFPTC procurement  considerably  exceeded  appraisal  expectations.
mainly due to higher than expected production as shown below. AFPTC paddy
purchases In the project area amouhted to an average of 79% of total AFPTC
procurement during the project period.

4.4      Major  benefits  attributable  to the project were the reduction In
storage losses resulting from the construction and rehabilitation  of  paddy
stores  and  transport cost savings due to the rehabilitation of rice wagons
and the construction of a trans-shipment store at Thazi. The reduction in
storage losses is measured in both quantitative and qualitative terms and is
based on results of surveys carried out by the Post Harvest Technology
Application Centre and experience gained in Burma. Because grading at
procurement  centres, storage  management and  pest  control   have   been
relatively poor, storage losses remain high. Over the average storage period
the estimated quantitative losses range from about 2.2% in permanent stores
to 6.5% for temporary stores and up to 8.5% in open pile stores, while the
estimated qualitative losses range from 1.35% for paddy in permanent stores
to 13.5X In temporary stores and 211 in open pile stores. The impact of the
storage rehabilitation component confirmed SAR assumptions.
4.5      Based on the revised figures quantitative storage losses have  been
reduced through the construction of new stores from 6.5% to 2.2% and
qualitative losses from 13.50% to 1.35% resulting In savings of 4.3% and
12.15% respectively. As anticipated the rehabilitation of existing paddy
stores resulted im a quantitative reduction of losses from 6% to 4%  and  of
qualitative losses from 4% to 3% as shown below:

4.6      Based  on  100,000 tons of new storage capacity nd 540,000 tons of
rehabilitated storage capacity, and, an annual stock turnover of 2 times and
1.5 times respectively total quantitative losses saved are estimated to
reach 24,900 tons per year and  total  qualitative  losses seved  to  reach
32,450 tons per year. Thi: is more than double the appraisal estimates of
12,000 tons for annual quantitative losses and 14,900 tons for annual
qualitative losses saved.
4.7      Quantitative  losses  are valued at the ex-godown paddy price which
is presently estimated at K588.4/ton (Table 3). The value of qualitative
losses are based on present AFPTC's transferred price f.o.b., Rangoon, at a
paddy equivalent of K819/ton. The above prices are 50% lower than those
estimated at appraisal. The total value of savings is estimated at K41.2
million annual'y, or about 20% lower than the appraisal estimate of K50.2
million mainly due to the 50% reduction in f.o.b. and ex-godown prices for
rice and paddy.
4.8      In ddition to the reduction in storage losses, the  rehabilitation
of rice wagons and the construction of a trans-shipment store at Thazi has
all%cV"V AIM-1C 6; ssift   ant  134,00  tians of  rice  from  road  to  rail
transport resulting in transport cost savings which are estimated at about
K4.5 million during FY83/84 to FY84/85 (see Table 9).
C. Technological Chanue
4.9      The   project   has   introduced  a  number  of  new  and  improved
technologies. The introduction of newly designed timber stores with an
enlarged   capacity   of  2,500  tons  sub-divided  into  five  compartments
facilitated considerably -storage management, secured continuous milling
operations over an extended period and together with the appropriate
location of the stores has contributed substantially to transport cost
savings.

4.1     Trhe installation of forced  aeration  systems  has  proved  to  be
effective in reducing quality deterioration even under adverse climatic
conditions with elevated paddy moisture. The provision of mechanical
handling equipment has eased labour constraints during the peak procurement
season and allowed speedy loading of the stores. Store floors, however
should have been sloped towards the discharge chutes to facilitate feeding
of the conveyor.
4.11     The provision of prefabricated steel godowns has reduced demand for
scarce local timbers. The new construction technology however required
specially trained manpower which was not available. Operational experience
so far has been very limited, but indications are that storage losses are
marginally lower than in the case of the new timber structures. There Is
however concern that temperature build-up in steel structures, especially
near the outside walls might lead to heat damage of paddy.
4.12     A number of staff were  trained  in  new  technologies  and  their
application. Although staff training fell short of SAR estimates, it is
considered that some upgrading of staff capabilities has been achieved.
4.13     The concept of 'Unit Trains' in combination with the  establishment
of a rice trans-shipment store has substantially enhanced the efficiency and
cost-effectiveness of the operation. The flow of rice from surplus to
deficit areas has improved and substantial transport cost savings have been
achieved.
V. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
A. Imlementino Agencies
5.1      As  envisaged  at appraisal, the AFPTC - the main beneficiary - has
been the main executing agency. In compliance with the agreement the
Corporation   had  established  a  Project  Implementation  Unit  (PIU)  and
appointed the Construt1ion Corporatioas e main cuntracwr.
5.2      Overall, AFPTC's performance was satisfactory. The  initial  delays
in projtect implementation were mainly due to factors outside the agency's
area otflufluence and were partly compensated by a speedy implementation
program in the subsequent years. The agency succeeded ir building up a
sustairAble prograe of paddy/rice procurement, storage and  transportation
based on the improved assets provided under the project. The lack of
training, however, 'eft AFPTC with insufficient staff adequately qualified
in such important fields as pest control and storage management and
operations.



- 19 -
S. Contractors and Suppliers
5.3      As  envisaged  at  appraisal,  the  Construction  Corporation  (CC)
carried out the construction of new stores under contracts with AFPTC.
5.4      Although  CC  had  recruited  a   Project   Coordinator   and   had
strengthened its workforce, the agency was not always able to cope with the
additional  workload   in   a   timely   manner,   which   delayed   project
implementation. Especially the trans-shipment store in Thazi suffered a long
delay, partly due to CC's lack of technical expertise to erect structures of
this nature.
5.5      As agreed at appraisal, the Burma Railways Corporation (BRC) was to
rehabilitate 60 rice wagons and operate them as contractor for AFPTC as unit
trains for rice haulage between Rangoon and Thazi/Mandalay. BRC repaired the
wagons as stipulated and even supplied spares, for which project funding was
insufficient, from its own stocks. In the two year contract period unit
trains were operating on schedule and rolling stock well maintained. The
performance of the contractor has been good throughout.
5.6      For  the  supply  of mechanical  equipment for all godowns and the
provision of prefabricated steel structures for the five steel godowns a
contract had been signed between AFPTC and the suppliers Berli Jucker Co.
Ltd., Bangkok. Due to late  delivery  of  components  from  sub-contractors,
however, equipment was delivered late and the flooding of the production
plant caused delays in the delivery of prefabricated stock elements.
5.7      Although the Contractor agreed  to  provide  technical  superfisors
from Western countries for the entire installation period, these supervisors
came only during the beginning of the installation works and the training
period. Most of the actual installation works were carried out by the Thai
supervisors and local Burmese engineers, to the full satisfaction of AFPTC.
C. Auditina and Reporting
5.8      A  small  unit  headed by the Project Director was set up under the
project for overall administration, including reporting. The quarterly and
annual reports have been prepared with some delay. Accounting was the
responsibility of the AFPTC Finance Department and the auditing was done by
the   Central   Auditor  General's  Office  (CAGO). Special  accounts  were
established under the project. However, both the unaudited and audited
financial statements lagged far behind schedule, particularly the latter.
The main reason has been the work load In AFPTC and CAGO. The audited report
for FY81/82 was delayed 27 months and those for FY82/83 and FY83/84 were
delayed 32 and 23 months, respectively. The remaining audited reports for
FY84/85 to 86/87 have not yet been completed.

VI. IDA PERFORMANCE
6.1      The basic concept of the project, i.e. to reduce paddy/rice storage
losses and transportation costs through the provision of improved storage
facilities and rolling stock was sound, as was the project design to
integrate storage and milling to the optimu degree possible.
6.2      It was  however  too optimistic  to  assume  that   the   storage
construction  prograime  could be completed within three years after project
start-up. It should have been realised at appraisal that local building
material constraints were too serious to allow speedy implementation of the
component. Furthermore, the cumbersome  tendering  and  ordering  procedures
should have been taken into account contributing to delays especially in
ICB. Also, the training progr_e has been too ambitious considering the
prevailing  language difficulties and shortage of local training facilities.
More emphasis should have beedn given to a training progra_me for trainers.
6.3      Supervision of the project from IDA has been  irregular. Over  the
five-year project period, only seven supervision missilns took place. The
time span between the first and the second mission was nearly 16 months and
another large gap of 14 months occurred between missions 4 and S. Especially
the lack of guidance in FY81/82 might have contributed to the slower than
expected start of the storage construction progra_e.
VII. FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
A. Financial Analysis
7.1      The internal rates of return (IRR) have been re-calculated for  the
two typical new storage models, the individual components and the whole
project. The analysis has been carried out in 1987 constant prices. Past
expenditures were adjusted to 1987 prices by using 6DP s deflator factors.
Present costs of road/rail transport and handling were used. Present
estimated prices of ex-godown paddy at K588.4 per ton and AFPTC's transfer
price for f.o.b. at K819 per ton paddy equivalent (see Table 3) were used
for the calculations of quantitative and qualitative storage losses
respectively. The financial cost and benefit flows are presented in Tables 4
to S. The re-estimated IRRs are suarised below:
IRR ()
SAR                 PCR
Whole project                               21                12.4
New storage component                       14                 8.8
Typical new timber store                   15.5                9.7
Typical new prefabricated store            11.1                6.7
Storage rehabilitation                    over 50            over 50
Wagon rehabilitation                      over 50            over 50



- 21 -
7.2      The re-estimated IRRs range from only 6.7% and  9.7%  for  the  two
typical new stores, and 8.8% for the new storage component, but to over SOX
for the storage and wagon rehabilitation components. IRR of the whole
proJect is only 12.4%. Negative factors contributing to low IRRs are mainly
the dolay in benefits by about 3-4 years for the new storage component and a
50% reduction in the equivalent paddy prices at ex-godown and f.o.b.
B. Economic Analysis
7.3      The analysis has been carried out in  1987  constant  prices.  Past
expenditures excluding taxes and duties were adjusted to 1987 constant
prices by using GOP deflator factors. Foreign exchange costs were valued at
the official exchange rate of USSl.0 a K6.5 and the local costs were
converted into border prices by using the SCF of 0.80. Unskilled labour was
valued at the weighted average of seasonal wage rates of K6.5/man-day.
Conversion factors (CF), calculated on the basis of foreign exchange and
local costs,  have  been used  in  the analysis which are presented in the
relevant tables. For the projected 1990 equivalent paddy prices, (in 1987
constant paddy equivalent) values of K790/ton ex-godown and KB14.9/ton
f.o.b., Rangoon, were used to assess the quantitative and qualitative
storage losses respectively (Table 11). These prices are SOX lower than the
appraisal estimates of Kl,455/ton and Kl1,652/ton respectively.
7.4      Tables 12-17 present economic cost and benefit  flows  of the  two
typical new paddy storage models, the individual project components of new
stores, storage rehabilitation, rice wagon rehabilitation and the whole
proJect. The re-estimated economic rates of return (ERR) are sumharised
below:
ERR (O

Whole project                               29             21.6
New storage component                       28             14.1
Typical new tiaber store                   29.4'           15.3
Typical new prefabricated store             23             11.4
Storage rehabilitaiton                   over 50          over 50
Rice wagon rehabilitation                over 50          over 50
7.5      The re-estimated ERR of the whole project is good at 21.6% compared
with the estimated opportunity cost of capital at 10. The ERRs of the
storage rehabilitation and rice wagon rehabilitation are very satisfactory
and the ERR of the new storage ccponent is acceptable at 14.1%. Despite the
substantial increases in the quantitative nd qualitative storage losses
saved., delayed  benefits  and  50%  reduction  in prices of paddy are major
negative fctors contributing to the lower ERRs.

VIII. SUWMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
8.1      The  project  aimed to improve rice storage and tra.sportetion wW"
the main objective of reducing quantitative and qualitative losses '.f pfy
and  rice, thus enhancing local availability and improving export eorn
The project included the construction of rew paddy stores of ?.00,000  or-S :;t
20  sites  in  Lower Burma,  of one 3,000-tcn trans-shipment store, af   tih
rehabilitation of 500 stores with a total capacity of 500,000 tons owAm-c by
AFPTC, and 120 small wooden jetties as well as the repair of 60 railway rice
wagons.
8.2      The project was also to provide  grading,  storage  management  and
pest control equipment and supplies, as well as technical assistance, in-
service and overseas training, and project monitoring and evaluation. A
drying pilot project in three townships aimed to establish the feasibility
of further mechanization procedures in paddy processing.
8.3      Although with considerable delays, due mainly to late  delivery  of
construction   materials,   the   project  achieved  most  of  its  physical
development targets. However, the training component has fallen considerably
short of expectations. This can be partly attributed to the lack of
sufficient tailor-made courses abroad and the shortage of local training
facilities and staff. However, the shortfall did not seriously affect
overall project performance. Pilot grain driers were not purchased due to
costs considerably exceeding SAR estimates. Furthermore, it was felt that
these driers are not essential as most of the paddy is bought in the dry
season ana thus moisture content is within the prescribed limits without
requiring additional drying. The Government failed, however, to adjust paddy
prices to provide stronger incentives for quality paddy production. Thus the
quality  of  the  paddy  purchased  by  the   Corporation   remained   below
expectations, affecting export market performance.
8.4      Due   to   the   delayed   construction/rehabilitation  of  stores,
experience with these facilities has been limited. However, a re-evaluation
of the losses incurred in the 'without' and 'with' project situation shows
that estimated losses saved are higher than the appraisal estimates. Total
value  of  the  reduction  of  storage  losses is estimated at K41.2 million
annually or about 20% lower than the appraisal estimates of  K50.2  million,
due  mainly  to  a 50% reduction in f.o.b. and ex-godown prices of paddy and
rice.
8.5      At  appraisal,  total  project  costs  were  estimated  at  US$39.1
million.  The  IDA  Credit  was to provide SOR 17.9 million (US$23 million).
Because of the reduced project cost and a Kyat devaluation, IDA financing
was only US$20.8 million or 90% of the SAR estimates.
8.6      Due  mainly  to  delayed  benefits  by  about 3-4 years for the new
storage construction and 50% reduction in the equivalent paddy prices at ex-
godown and f.o.b., the IRR of the whole project is only 8%. The re-estimated
EERs range from 6.7% for a typical prefabricated store, over 8.8% for a new
timber store, to over 50% for storage and rice wagon rehabilitation. The re-
estimated ERR of the whole project is acceptable at 14.6%.

Lessons Learned
8.7      The principal  lessons  learned  from  the  implementation of  the
project were the following:
a) Prior to project inplementation, assurances should have been
obtained frou the various Government agencies to procure and/or
provide  equipment and construction material of appropriate quality
and quantity and complete civil works In a timely manner. Project
benefits would thus have been achieved much earlier.
b) In projects of this nature, high priority should be given to
storage manage-ent including grading and pest control, to reduce
substantial quantitative and qualitative losses and institutions
involved should ensure a timely and proper implementation of the
component through properly trained staff.
c) Price discounts have a strong influence on the quality of produce
delivered. Assurances should have been obtained that the required
financial incentives would be provided from the beginning of the
project to ensure adequate supply of quality grains.
