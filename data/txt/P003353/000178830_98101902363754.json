new\n            permanent storage capacity of 100,000 tons, rehabilitate 500\n            AFPTC-owned stores, 120 small wooden jetties and 60 railway\n            rice wagons, develop and implement a drying pilot project,\n            and provide technical assistance and staff training. The\n            major direct benefit would be the net reduction of paddy\n            storage losses valued at about US$6.3 million annually which\n            would result in additional net foreign exchange earnings of\n            about US$7 million per annum. The project would provide\n            employment of about 180 man-years of skilled labor and 600\n            man-years of semi-skilled labor. At full development, the\n            project would offer permanent job opportunities to 250\n            skilled workers. The main project risk would be that the\n            construction of new stores might be slower than predicted.\n            The project, however, is well within the implementation\n            capacity of the agencies concerned."}, "docdt": "1980-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
