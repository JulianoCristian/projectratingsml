Lessons learned on sector\n            policy, identify the importance of metering for a successful\n            energy commercialization, highlighting that interventions\n            should start at the point of interaction with end-customers,\n            for distribution of electricity, gas, and heat. Moreover,\n            since a small investment project is not an appropriate\n            vehicle to implement major energy sector reforms, it does\n            need to be supported, as in this case, by adjustment\n            operations with significant energy sector reform components.\n            Regarding lessons on country issues, it is worth noting that\n            in this project, a multi-year Institutional Development Fund\n            (IDF) for accounting reform, in addition to assistance from\n            USAID, encouraged the Government to adopt national\n            accounting standards, based on international standards, with\n            training provided at the national level. It is thus\n            suggested that during the country financial management\n            assessment, consideration be given on whether to use an IDF\n            grant, combined with funding from other donors. In addition,\n            the importance of a competent Project Implementation Unit\n            set at the early stages cannot be underestimated, evidenced\n            by its strong, unifying role in the midst of continued\n            staffing changes in implementing agencies, and line\n            ministries, which could have somehow hindered implementation."}, "docdt": "2002-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
