INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOIMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
SOCIETE NATIONALE D'EXPLOITATION ET DE DISTRIBUTION DES EAUX
WITI THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
FOR A THIRD WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Societe Nationale d'Exploitation et de Distribution des Eaux (SONEDE)
withi the guarantee of the Republic of Tunisia for the equivalent of US$23.0
million to help finance a project for water supply. The loan would have a
term of 25 years, including 5 years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent
per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Tunisia" (EMA-51a) was distributed to the Executive Directors on August 14,
1972. A basic economic mission visited Tunisia in February and March 1973
and is now finalizing its report following discussions with the Government.
The main conclusions of this report are reflected below. Country data sheets
are attached (Annex I).
3.        Tunisia's development has been hampered by scarcity of natural re-
sources including water. Much of the country is arid or semi-arid, and agri-
culture is highly dependent on rainfall. Minerals are mostly of low quality
and, apart from phosphates, limited in quantity. In the mid-1960's, petro-
leum was discovered and has since become an increasingly valuable source of
revenue and export earnings. Industrial development has been handicapped by
the small size of the domestic market, as well as a lack of skills and expe-
rience. Tourism has developed rapidly and workers' remittances have become
a significant item in the balance of payments. Per capita income increased
by 4.4 percent annually between 1961 and 1972 to reach a level of $379.
Tunisia has enjoyed a large amount of external aid and has used this to ex-
pand economic and social infrastructure, broaden the industrial base, increase
the rate of growth, and make available a wide range of social and welfare serv-
ices to a large part of the population. Like most developing countries, how-
ever, it has not yet found a way to eliminate unemployment and poverty and to
achieve a balanced distribution of consumption among income groups, between
urban and rural areas, and among regions.
4.        Government strategy in the 1960's relied heavily on central planning
of investment and resource allocation, with the public sector playing a major
role in production as well as providing infrastructure and services. Foreign
exchange shortages and preoccupation with restraint of inflation led to re-
course to a pervasive system of official price determination and administra-
tive controls. An unusually long series of poor crop years due to shortage
of rainfall slowed down growth of output. Many of the investments in public



-2-
enterprises proved to be uneconomic and private initiative in most sectors
except tourism and petroleum was discouraged. Growth was relatively slow
until 1969, but was combined with a high degree of domestic price stability.
5.        The Government's present development strategy was introduced after
1969 and forms the basis of the current Fourth Plan, 1973-1976. The principal
objectives are (a) accelerating growth based on export-oriented industries,
mainly by encouraging private initiative, reducing direct Government involve-
ment in procluction and relaxing administrative regulations; (b) easing the
country's unemployment problem by creating new jobs primarily in the expanding
industrial sector, but also by encouraging worker emigration, reducing popula-
tion growth and improving education and training; and (c) maintaining internal
and external financial stability. The target rate of GDP growth is 7.1 percent,
providing for a 5.4 percent growth rate in per capita private consumption. In-
vestment is projected to increase by 70 per,cent above Third Plan levels. Na-
tional savings are to finance three-quarters of investment. Exports of goods
and services are projected to grow at 8.8 percent per year at constant prices
and imports at 12.2 percent. An increase in net external capital flows of
almost 100 percent over 1969-1972 average levels would be required, with ex-
ternal capital providing 23.5 percent of total investment; the debt service
ratio would be held to below 20 percent. The Plan targets may be conservative
in terms of both growth and savings potential, and are affected significantly
by the impact of the changed petroleum and phosphates situations on the
Tunisian economy (paragraphs 7 and 8).
6.        The annual growth rate of the gross domestic product over the decade
1961-1970 was 5 percent. A remarkable upsurge has taken place since 1970,
with GDP growing in real terms by 9 percent in 1971, and 18 percent in 1972.
The improvement can be attributed in part to exogenous factors such as good
weather, leading to record cereal crops and a three-fold increase in olive pro-
duction, in part to important growth in several areas (tourism, petroleum and
emigrant workers' remittances) which previous policies had fostered, and in
part to the general reorientation in Government policy since 1969, generating
renewed self-confidence and initiative in the private sector. By 1972, the in-
vestment rate was 23.6 percent of GDP compared to 20.8 percent in 1970; domestic
savings were 21.1 percent of GDP compared to 16.3 percent in 1970, reducing
Tunisia's dependence on external borrowing from 31.6 to 13.6 percent of in-
vestment. The balance of payments has improved steadily since 1967, with the
current account deficit dropping from about $114 million up to 1967 to $44
million in 1972. The traditional negative net foreign exchange reserve posi-
tion was reversed in 1968, and at the end of 1973 net foreign assets amounted
to $256 million, covering 5.5 months of commodity imports.
7.        Following the very rapid expansion of the economy in 1972, the growth
rate slowed last year to an estimated 2.8 percent. Agricultural output fell
by 11.6 percent from the very high 1972 level, increases in production of
cereals and livestock offsetting only part of the expected drop in olive pro-
duction. Growth may be about 9 percent in 1974. The Government is attempting
to maintain its past success in controlling inflation, though there will be
increased pressures arising from the higher level of investment, the build-up
of foreign exchange reserves and the increased cost of imports. In the medium



- 3 -
term, and assuming no major recession in developed countries, Tunisia's gain
from the rise in petroleum and phosphate prices should more than offset fore-
seeable adverse external developments on tourism earnings, workers' remit-
tances and other exports. Export earnings from petroleum are now projected
to increase fourfold from $98 million in 1973 to some $368 million in 1976,
and phosphate prices have also risen sharply. As a result, small surpluses
in the current account of the balance of payments, and a rapid build-up of
reserves, may be expected over the next several years. A substantial reduc-
tion in the net rate of emigration, originally projected at 20,000 per year,
could have serious repercussions on unemployment and income, particularly in
rural areas, unless energetic measures are taken to increase labor absorption
in other sectors.
8.        The increased foreign exchange reserves and Government surplus ex-
pected from higher export pri'ces and consequent tax revenue do not call for
a basic revision in development strategy but suggest that Tunisia could step
up its efforts to achieve higher investment and growth rates and increased
employment, and to depend less on emigration and foreign aid. The main con-
straints are likely to be the speed at which policies and institutions re-
spond to the challenge and projects are prepared and executed. The new
orientation since 1969 and the improved economic situation provide the Gov-
ernment with an opportunity to step up efforts to achieve its declared social
objectives, including greater impact on employment.
9.        Tunisia has made some impressive social gains.    By 1971, primary
school enrollment had reached 73 percent and secondary enrollment 42 percent
of the relevant age-groups. Public health services have been greatly expanded
with many provided free, a family planning program introduced and social secur-
ity services provided to an increasing proportion of the labor force. Public
social expenditure, both current and capital, has increased at the rate of
9.3 percent per year and accounted for 14.5 percent of GDP in 1970. Nonethe-
less, major social issues remain. Further progress is needed in land reform.
Wide regional and income disparities are persistent and there has been a grow-
ing concentration of productive activities in urban areas. Job creation has
not kept pace with the growth of the labor force, and in 1972 the unemploy-
ment rate was estimated at 14 percent.
10.       Agriculture, the dominant sector in the economy, provides nearly
half of total employment, 30 percent of merchandise exports and 17 percent of
GDP. Food processing industries account for another 5 percent of GDP and over
a third of value added in manufacturing. Agricultural production jumped in
1971 and again in 1972, largely as a result of favorable weather, and the
potential for further growth is clear. While large infrastructure invest-
ments were made during the last decade, current policy emphasizes projects
that make a rapid and direct contribution to production and recognizes var-
ious constraints on agricultural development: absentee ownership and insecur-
ity of tenure, inadequate access to agricultural credit, the need to devote
more resources to extension services and agricultural education, and under-
utilization of irrigation investments. D 40 million has been allocated to a
rural development program to be executed by the provincial administrations.



-4-
11.       During the 1960's manufacturing production in Tunisia increased by
7 percent annually. There was a remarkable 30 percent further increase in
1972 due in part to a record year for the olive oil processing industry.
The early thrust of industrialization was supplied by large import substitu-
tion projects in the state sector. These suffered, however, from the limited
domestic market and shortages of experienced staff and management. Under the
Fourth Plan, private manufacturing investment, particularly in textiles,
fertilizers and metals transformation, is expected to average D 25 million
per year between 1973 and 1976, compared with D 12 million in 1972, and to
account for two-thirds of total investment in manufacturing. Foreign private
investors have been offered incentives and are expected by Tunisia to contri-
bute through finance, know-how and overseas marketing, in creating competitive
industries producing a wide range of exports. Tunisia's preferential trade
agreement with the EEC, currently being renegotiated, also gives it some ad-
vantages. Preinvestment work, and the preparation of programs for re-equipment
and mode:nization in priority subsectors,have been started.    Tunisia aims to
develop petroleum-based industries and production of phosphoric acid and other
phosphate derivatives for export, while possibilities for metal manufacturing
for export are being explored. The Plan further foresees the establishment of
a small-scale industry fund to encourage growth and decentralization of such
industries.
12.       The development of tourism is relatively recent.    Foreign-visitor
arrivals in Tunisia reached 780,000 in 1972, with an annual rate of growth of
30 percent - higher than any other Mediterranean country. Earnings from
tourism are now the most important source of foreign exchange, reaching US$143
million in 1972. The Government actively supports expansion through incentives
to private hotel promoters and has recently embarked on a long-term tourism
infrastructure program.
13.       Since the early 1960's Tunisia has received large amounts of external
capital. Official aid amounted to an average of US$19 per capita per annum,
almost half from the United States, mostly in the form of program loans and
PL 480 commodity aid. Other major lenders were France, the Federal Republic
of Germany, Italy, Kuwait and the Bank Group. Project loans, particularly for
public enterprises, accounted for 58 percent of total disbursements in 1969-
1972. Most aid has been obtained on concessionary terms: from 1969-1972, the
average terms of borrowing from bilateral sources were 2.3 percent interest and
27 years to maturity, including 9 years of grace; from multilateral sources
5.4 percent interest and 28 years to maturity, including 6 years of grace.
For private borrowing (about $40 million annually), average terms were 6.0
percent interest and 9 years to maturity. Direct foreign private investment
in Tunisia has been limited. However, mainly as a result of increasing out-
lays on petroleum exploration and development, it has risen from an average
of $ 19 million per annum in the late 1960's to $ 4O million in 1972.
14.       Tunisia's total external public debt was $1,108 million (of which
$693 million were disbursed) at the end of 1972. Disbursed debt is estimated
to have been $862 million at the end of 1973. The debt service in 1973 is
estimated to have been 12.7 percent of exports of goods, non-factor services
and workers' remittances. The ratio is expected to fall significantly by 1976,



-5-
following recent petroleum and phosphate price increases. Government policy
on future external borrowing in the light of its new balance of payments po-
sition is still under review. Tunisia is capable of servicing substantial
additional debt on harder terms than it has received in the past.
PART II - BANK GROUP OIPERATIONS IN TUNISIA
15.       Starting in 1962, Tunisia has received a total of sixteen Bank loans
and ten IDA credits amounting respectively to $166.6 million and $65.7 million,
net of cancellations and refundings. Annex II contains a summary statement of
Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as of March 31, 1974T and notos
on the execution of ongoing projects.
16.       While there have been problems in project execution, as in the rail-
wavs, agricultural credit and family planning projects, on the whole project
implementation has been satisfactory. Important institutional improvements
have bee,L achieved. In both the transport and public utilities sectors, in-
dependenv agencies have been created or strengthened. The main Tunisian de-
velopment finance company, BDET, has been placed on a sound footing.
17.       In accordance with Tunisian priorities, past Bank Group lending has
emphasized support for long-term investments in infrastructure. Lending for
transport, power and tourism infrastructure, has accounted for 38 percent of
Bank/IDA commitments in Tunisia. Lending for urban and social development,
including water supply, education, family planning and the Tunis urban plan-
ning and public transport project, has accounted for a further 33 percent.
Industrial and hotel financing through Banque de Developpement Economique de
Tunisie (BDET, formerly Societe Nationale d'Investissement) comes third with
21 percent. Agriculture and fisheries have received 8 percent of total com-
mitments.
18.       One more project, for the training of hotel personnel, is expected
to be presented to the Executive Directors this fiscal year. Future lending
is expected to support the further reorientation of the Government's economic
policies towards rapid growth in a more open, export-oriented economy, meas-
ures to create employment and to achieve a more equitable income distribution,
and institutional change and reform. The proposed lending program will em-
phasize agriculture including rural development, industry - especially small-
scale industry - and urban and social development. The most important impact
is hoped for in agriculture, requiring substantial inputs of manpower and
technical assistance to support the creation of new institutions which can
reach the rural poor. Over the next several years, it is expected that a
number of projects will be presented which address the problems of land re-
form, organization for agricultural and rural development, and integration
of agricultural with other aspects of rural development in such areas as the
Medjerda and Nebhana Valleys, Sedjenane and Central Tunisia. Lending to
medium-size industrial companies through the development finance company,
BDET, will continue, but at a declining rate as BDET diversifies its sources
of funds. It will be supplemented by direct industrial lending, first for a



- 6-
project in phosphate mining, and later in other priority subsectors, now being
studied with Bank technical assistance, in which Tunisia has a comparative
advantage and a potential for promoting small-s;cale industries. Urban and
social development will be furthered by the present project, as well as by a
first operation in the sewerage sector involving important organizational
changes, while a third education project will also be presented.
19.       Tne Bank Group accounted for almost 20 percent of disbursements of
official aid to Tunisia between 1969 and 1972 and is expected to maintain its
share, with that of the US declining and that of other, particularly Arab,
sources of funds rising. The Bank Group's shares in total debt outstanding
at the end of 1972 and in debt service during 1972 were 18 percent and 7 per-
cent respectively. Over the rest of the decade, the Bank Group's share in
total external debt is not expected to vary much; its share in debt service
will probably rise to approach the share of debt outstanding.
20.       IFC has invested in a fertillzer plant, in BDET, in COFITOUR (a
company to promote and invest in tourism projects) and in RYM (a large hotel
development). It has also made a small equity investment in the promotional
company "Sousse Nord", which is to prepare plais for an integrated tourism
resort development in the Sousse area, one of those in which tourism infra-
structure is being financed jointly by the Bank, IDA and Kreditanstalt fur
Wiederaufbau (KfW). IFC's Board of Executive Directors approved an equity
investment of $621,000 in Industries Chimiques du Fluor, which will produce
aluminum fluoride from local fluorspar for export, on May 7, 1974. IFC's
net commitments in Tunisia total $14.0 million with the inclusion of this
investment.
PART III - WATER SUPPLY IN TUNISIA
21.       Tunisia's water resources are located inland at considerable dis-
tances from the main population centers. The cities of Tunis and Sfax and the
important area around Sousse must be supplied by sources between 90 and 165
kilometers away.   Groundwater sources are used throughout the country; signi-
ficant sources of surface water exist only in the north. Total resources are
very limiited and demands for irrigation and potable water are expected to
exceed the total available supplies of fresh water in part of the country by
1930, and throughout the country by 1990. Potable water from groundwater
sources in the southern half of the country already has a salinity level higher
than thiat considered the maximum desirable for human consumption by the World
Hlealth Organization. Studies are therefore underway on methods of treating
brackish water, possibilities of blending and the tolerance of crops to differ-
ent salinitv levels of irrigation water. Later, the reuse of treated sewage
and eventually large-scale desalination will have to be considered.



-7-
22.       The Directorate of "Hydraulique et Amenagements Ruraux" (HAR) of the
Ministry of Agriculture is responsible for the overall management of Tunisia's
water resources. Societe Nationale d'Exploitation et de Distribution des
Eaux (SONEDE) is an autonomous public utility created with Bank support in 1968
to manage the production and distribution of potable water (see para 29). BAR
-nd SONEDE have agreed on the allocation of known resources to potable water
And to irrigation, with priority being given to the quantity and quality of
water required by SONEDE. SONEDE recently has accelerated the provision of
water to individual houses and plans to supply all settlements having popula-
tions of 500 or more. The remaining population lives in isolated dwellings
not readily served by public water distribution systems; they may ultimately
be supplied by systems of public wells and fountains.
23.       In 1966, the Government asked the Bank and the Kingdom of Sweden for
assistance in financing various water supply works. A study by technical con-
sultants, Societe Generale des Techniques Hydro-Agricoles (SOGETHA), helped
define a program of works which became the basis of the 1968-1973 National
Water Program. In support of this program a Bank loan (581-TUN) of $15 mil-
lion and a Swedish credit of $5 million were made in 1969 for joint financing
of a first project consisting mainly of major supply works for the most densely
populated areas, Tunis and the Sahel region. In 1970, an IDA credit (209-TUN)
of $10.5 million and a Swedish credit of $3.5 million were made for joint fi-
nancing of a second project to be executed over broadly the same period (1970-
1973), principally for supply works for fast-growing tourist areas and cities
not covered by the first project. SONEDE was the borrower and beneficiary
under the Bank loan and IDA credit; together, the two projects constituted
the bulk of the works in its 1968-1973 Program. In addition, SONEDE is the
executing agency for the water supply component of the Tourism Infrastructure
Project (Loan 858-TUN and Credit 329-TUN) jointly financed with KfW. SONEDE
is also executing a program of miscellaneous works and renewals with some
bilateral financing from Sweden, USAID and the Federal Republic of Germany.
24.       Tunisia's 1973-1976 Plan foresees improved supply and distribution
facilities for Sfax, a program of extensions to existing distribution systems
and the commencement of a program for supply of water to all settlements having
a population of over 500.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
25.       The proposed Bank loan would assist SONEDE in the financing of the
major components of its 1974-78 investment program. The need for these works
was already apparent when Credit 209-TUN was approved and it provided funds
for preparation of the Sfax component, the major item in the proposed project,
as well as for remedial works there to meet the most urgent needs.



- 8 -
26.       The project was appraised in October-November 1973.   Negotiations
were held in Washington in April-May 1974. SONEDE was represented by Mr. T.
Delloua, Deputy Director General and the Government by Mr. T. Ennaifer
(Mfinistry of Planning). A report entitled "Appraisal of a Third Water Supply
Project - Tunisia" (No. 369a-TUN dated May 6, 1974) is being distributed se-
parately to the Executive Directors. A loan and project summary is attached
as Annex III.
27.       The main component of the proposed project would improvre water supply
in Sfax, Tunisia's second largest city with a population of 260,000 in 1972.
Rapid urban development has outstripped the capacity of present water sources;
in addition, the distribution system is wearing out and undersized. Large
numbers of consumers now suffer unreliable supply. Only 37 percent of the
population in Sfax is presently connected to the distribution system, while
thousands of applications for connections are outstanding and many potential
consumers have not thought it worthwhile to apply. The proposed project would
involve drilling of wells near Kasserine, construction of a well-field collection
system and production reservoirs, a 165 km transmission pipeline to Sfax, distri-
bution reservoirs and improvements to and extensions of the existing distribution
system. The large villages of Agareb and Mahres, which lie along the route of
the Sfax pipeline, would be connected to it; in these two villages and a third,
Menzel Chaker, mains and distribution systems would be provided or improved.
28.       Other components of the project would serve to bring piped water sup-
plies to many low-income groups in urban and rural areas for the first time.
In addition to extensions in Sfax, distribution networks in other urban centers
would be extended. The project would further provide for the supply of water
through both standpipes and house connections to 93,000 inhabitants of 62 rural
centers as part of SONEDE's program to supply water to settlements of over 500
inhabitants. Finally, a study would be carried out to compare the costs in-
volved in using water of increasing salinity with other alternatives, since
Tunisia will increasingly be faced with the need to use such water. In the
next five years, the population served by SONEDE is expected to increase by
600,000.
Project Execution
29.       The project would be carried out by SONEDE.   Since its foundation,
SONEDE has steadily built up its operating efficiency. Its management has
become cost-conscious and performance-oriented. The utility employs 2,100
people with satisfactory conditions of service. The only training need is
at foreman level and SONEDE is making arrangements with the Government train-
ing agency to meet this need. SONEDE's accounting system is comprehensive
and efficient and its accounts are audited by an international firm of auditors,
assisted by a local firm. Use of the local firm alone is being considered in
view of its satisfactory performance.
30.       SONEDE will retain an engineering consultant to prepare the detailed
design and tender documents for the Sfax component. SONEDE will carry out the
salinitv study with the assistance of consultants. SONEDE personnel, assisted



by consultants, will prepare the tender documents for the extensions and rural
centers components of the project and will supervise the construction of the
entire project.
31.       The first tenders will be called in 1974 and the rest in mid-1975,
with the bulk of construction taking place in 1976 and 1977. The Sfax compo-
nent and the works in the various rural centers will be completed in 1978.
Project Cost
32.       The total project cost is estimated at D 18.5 million ($42.6 million).
The foreign exchange component is estimated at $24.2 million, or 57 percent of
the total cost. Price contingencies have been established assuming an increase
over past low inflation rates for local purchases, to 5 percent per annum, and
inflation rates on imported goods and services of 14 percent in 1974, 11 per-
cent in 1975 and 7.5 percent per annum thereafter. The estimates take into
account the impact of recent developments in energy prices. The cost of the
main components is set out below:

Financing Plan
33.       The project financing forms part of SONEDE's total financial require-
ments to carry out its 1974-78 investment program. Total requirements are
estimated at D 40.3 millions ($92.7 million), 1/ of which the proposed project
will require D 18.5 million ($42.6 million), or 46 percent. The proposed Bank
loan would provide D 10.0 million, equivalent to 25 percent of the estimated
funds required for the total investment program, and 54 percent of the esti-
mated cost of the project. Net internal cash generation under new tariffs to
be introduced in 1974 should produce D 14.2 million, or 35 percent of the
total requirement. Borrowing for the next major projects would provide D 1.7
million. Consumer contributions are expected to total D 4.3 million over the
1/   Exclusive of residual expenditures on earlier IBRD/IDA projects and
their related financing.



- 10 -
period.  The Government would provide the remaining D 10.2 million.    This con-
tribution comprises budget allocations based on forecasts in the 1973-1976
national plan, and full reinmbursement by Government of SONEDE's expenditure
under the tourism infrastructure project (see para. 23). However, the Gov-
ernment's net contribution to SONEDE over the period will be small as it will
be largely offset by taxes and duties relating to the project, a tax on all
water sales and interest payments on IDA furds relent by the Government to
SONEDE amounting, in all, to some D 9 million.    Assurances were obtained that
the Government will make available promptly any funds needed to meet cost
overruns on the project (Guarantee Agreement, Section 2.03).    The Government
is obliged bv law to rnake good any sl-ortfall in fincincing required by SONEDE
for its investment program.
Financial Position of SONEDE
34.       SONEDE's capital comes mainly from the Government by way of fixed
assets hanided over at its formation and cash contributions to development
prograins between 1968 and 1973.  Over the ;ast five years it has consistently
earned a modest return of about 4 percent cn net fixed assets.    Under the last
agreement with the Association, SONEDE has undertaken to earn a rate of return
of 5 percent each year from 1973 to 1975, and 6 percent thiereafter, and these
commitments have been reaffirmed in the proposed Loan Agreement (Section 5.06).
In 1973 the target rate could not be achieved because of lagging sales due
partly to lack of supplies. Water sales are IIow projected to increase by 50
percent over the six years to 1979 with the increasing amount of water becom-
ing available.  Over the same period, however, the value of total fixed assets
and the annual charge for depreciation are expected to double, suggesting a
rapidly rising marginal cost of water, as new more costly sources of water
must be introduced, often at great distances from points of consumption.
Meeting peak demand in tourist areas is particularly costly.
35.       In order to achieve the target rate of return, SJNEDE has obtained
Government approval to introduce higher tariffs beginning in July 1974.     The
present tariff was established in 1968 and provides uniform rates for large
or small quantities consumed and for all parts of the country.    Three classes
of consumer are distinguished:   general including hotels, large industrial,
and public, with the first category paying more than twice the price charged
at public standpipes.   SONEDE has now agreed to raise the average rate from
$0.54/1000 gallons (61 millimes/cubic meter) to $07V1,000 gallonis (84
millimes/cubic meter), an increase of 38 percent (Loan Agreement, Section
5.06). It also proposes to restructure the tariff to direct the increase to
hotels and industry, and, via a progressive tariff, to other large consumers.
The new tariff level approximates the rising marginal cost of water. The
rates charged to two-thirds of domestic consumers would not be changed. The
impact on hotels and industry would be negligible in relation to their total
costs.
36.       The revenue generated by the new tariffs should permit SONEDE to
generate about 50 percent of its foreseeable investment needs from internal
resources up to 1982. Financial projections for SONEDE suggest that the
utility should be able to maintain its debt service coverage ratio well above



the level of 1.5 which it has undertaken to maintain (Loan Agreement, Section
5.05). SONEDE will also continue to consult with the Bank before making new
investments outside the project or its present tentative investment program
of more than D 1,000,000 in a single project, or D 2,000,000 in any one year
(Loan Agreement, Section 5.04).
Procurement
37.       Major civil works contracts and equipment contracts, except flow
regulators requiring standardization and minor purchases of equipment and
materials, will be put to international competitive bidding in accordance with
Bank Group guidelines. Civil works for small and widely-scattered works will
be put to tender based on local advertising and competitive bidding. A prefer-
ence margin of 15 percent or the level of customs duty, whichever is less, is
proposed for domestic manufacturers of equipment.
Disbursement
38.       The Bank loan would be disbursed over five years.    Disbursements
would be made against the c.i.f. cost of imported equipment and materials;
85 percent of the ex-factory cost of locally manufactured equipment; 25 per-
cent of all eligible civil works conrracts, representing the estimated foreign
exchange expenditure component; and the full foreign exchange costs of consult-
ants' services for design and supervision of the works and for the salinity
studv. The Bank has approved a contract for the provision of consultants'
services to SONEDE by SOGREAH (France) for detailed design and preparation of
tender documents for the Sfax component of the project. Retroactive financing
of not more than $200,000 would be provided for such services starting from
May 1, 1974, since the engagement of consultants to carry out this work was
required without delay to maintain the timetable for project execution (Loan
Agreement Schedule 1).
Project Justification
39.       The water supply situation in Sfax is continually deteriorating as
the maximum capacity of present sources falls further behind growing demand.
At some point, this is likely to hamper the further development of the city.
It already poses important health risks. The project works will meet demand
until at least 1981. While they are expensive, this reflects the large dis-
tance between well-field and point of consumption, and the proposed works are
the least costly method of supplying water to the city. The national program
of extensions, and the supply of rural centers, will bring increasing numbers
of mainly low-income consumers within reach of piped water supplies for the
first time. SONEDE's new tariffs will permit low-income, low-consumption
households to pay less for water than will more affluent larger consumers.
The social benefits will complement the housing effort of the Tunisian au-
thorities in rural areas and may help to slow rural-urban migration. The
health benefits from piped water supplies are particularly important for
these groups of new consumers. The tariff also penalizes excessive water
consumption and reflects the rising marginal cost of supplying water. Since



- 12 -
Tunisia will increasingly be forced to use water of higher salinity levels,
the study of economic costs of higher salinity will provide valuable data
for evaluation of future projects and decision-making on water use and
development.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTIHORITY
40.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and Societe Nationale
d'Exploitation et de Distribution des Eaux, the draft Guarantee Agreement
between the Republic of Tunisia and the Bank, the Report of the Committee
provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement
and the text of a draft resolution approving the proposed loan are being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
41.       Features of the Loan and Guarantee Agreements of particular interest
concerning SONEDE's rate of return and tariffs are referred to in paragraphs
34 and 35. Implementation of tariffs yielding an average revenue of not less
than 84 millimes per cubic meter of water delivered to consumers would be a
condition of effectiveness of the loan.
42.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
43.       I recommendl that the Executive Directors approve the proDosed loan.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION -
Cr. 94: Second Education Project; US$13 million credit of September 16, 1966;
Closing Date: (original) December 31, 1970; (current) December 31, 1974.
Physical execution of the project is almost completed. All project
schools have been accepted by the government from the contractors, virtually
all equipm.ent and furniture have been purchased, and most of it has been de-
livered and installed. Despite early dtelays in the appointment of UNESCO
experts and their counterparts in the lducational Planning Unit, an interim
report, including a diagnosis of primary and general secondary educAtion and
a preliminary analysis of higher education, has been prepared. However, the
report does not cover vocational and technical training, education finances
and management, and administration of the education system. To allow for
the utilization of savings and the completion of the technical assiatance
program, a further extension of the present Closing Date is likely to be re-
quired.
Ln. 573:  Port Development Project; US':8.5 million loan of November 29, 1968;
Closing Date: (original) December 31, 1972; (current) December 31. 1974.
Project works have been completed at a total cost slightl, above ap-
praisal estimates, due mainly to unexpected price increases and unforeseen soil
conditions, which delayed construction. Savings in foreign exchange of about
$0.2 million are being used to finance a ports master plan study whose execu-
tion is about to begin. The Closing Dzte has been extended to permit comple-
tion of the study.
Ln. 581:  First Water Supply Project; US$15 million loan of January 16, 1968;
Closing Date: (original) December 31, 1973; (current) December 31, 1974.
Cr. 209:  Second Water Supply Project; US$10.5 million credit of June 30, 1970;
Closing Date: December 31, 1974.
The first project is proceeding well after initial delays and com-
pletion is expected in May 1974, about a year later than estimated originally.
The Closing Date has therefore been extended. Final project costs tire expected
to be about 6 percent below appraisal estimates (but 7 percent highor in dollar
terms because of devaluation). The second project is 12 to 18 months behind
schedule due in part to initial delays in final design and to pipe manufacture
constraints. More recently, progress has been slowed by a dispute between a
contractor and the project authority. Discussions have taken place with a
view to settlement of the dispute and to resumption of normal progretss on the
contracts affected. Final costs are forecast to be similar to original es-
timates, though about 20 percent higher in dollar terms. Because of the delays
in execution, it is expected that the Closing Date will have to be extended.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding
that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.

Ln. 606: Railways Project; US$8.5 million loan and US$8.5 million credit,
Cr. 150: both of June 4, 1969; Closing Date of loan: (original) December 31,
1973; (current) December 31, 1975.
The project has been delayed both by floods (one year) and by finan-
cial difficulties (one year). It is now expected to be substantially completed
by December 31, 1974. The financial problems were caused by non-payment of
freight charges by the railway's largest customer, the state-controlled Sfax-
Gafsa Phosphate Company; operational deficits, due to low rates and fares; and
higher than estimated prices of rolling stock. The Government has taken over
the Phosphate Company's pre-1973 arrears and the Company itself is expected to
improve its payment record, phosphate prices having recently risen sharply.
Government has also undertaken to reimburse railway losses for 1972 and 1973.
A new cost-based tariff was introduced on January 1, 1974; traffic and oper-
ating results, however, have not improved as expected, and continuing Govern-
ment contributions to the railways and further tariff increases will be re-
quired. A reallocation of the proceeds of the loan and credit permitted the
placing of all outstanding orders; cost increases of about $6 million for
items in the original list of goods are being financed by utilizing a Spanish
line of credit. The credit has been fully disbursed; the Closing Date of the
loan has been extended to the end of 1975 to permit completion of project
execution.
Cr. 238: Population Project; US$4.8 million credit of April 5. 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
After a slow start, resulting in a 24-month delay, there has been
some progress in this project, but many problems remain. A new Director
General has recently been appointed to the National Office for Family Planning
and Population.  Preliminary designs; have been completed and final design of
project facilities is progressing well. Construction on the Tunis Maternity
Hospital is expected to start in October 1974. Construction costs for the
urban maternity hospitals are estimated at more than twice the amount es-
timated by architectural consultants at appraisal; one maternity hospital
and two rural maternity centers are being eliminated from the project. The
total cost of the revised project is now estimated at more than $13 million
in place of the $7.7 million estimated at appraisal. Supervision of the
physical execution of the project is being intensified.
Ln. 746: Ilighways Project; US$24 million loan of June 9, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
Project execution, which fell behind schedule initially due to
lengthy Government procedures and changes in key personnel, is now proceeding
satisfactorily. The estimated cost of the project has increased significantly,
mainly as a result of dollar devaluation. One major road section may be elim-
inated from the project. The Government has been requested to provide supple-
mentary funds to permit completion of the other project components.

Ln. 779:  Agricultural Credit Project; US$5 million loan and US$3 million
Cr. 263: credit, both of July 12, 1971; Closing Dates: July 31. 1975.
Disbursements are behind schedule, especially for lending for dairy
farms since the cost of imported cows has risen and there is competition be-
tween Bank/IDA and other cheaper funds. A severe flood in March 1973 also
affected project progress. Consultations are underway with a view to accel-
erating the progress of the project.
Cr. 270: Fisheries Project; US$2 million credit of September 24, 1972;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
After unsuccessful efforts to design a completely new and economical
vessel, it was decided to concentrate on improving construction techniques,
materials and design of the existing traditional inshore fishing boat. As a
result of substantial cost increases due to factors unrelated to the project,
the number of boats which can be procured will be reduced by about 50 percent.
However, demand for boats at the higher prices remains strong as fish prices
have also increased substantially. A procurement dispute delayed award of the
contract for marine diesel engines; this has now been resolved. Bids have been
requested for supply of boat hulls, and IDA has encouraged extension of the
existing technical assistance contracts.
Ln. 858: Tourism Infrastructure Project; US$14 million loan and US$10 million
Cr. 329: credit, both of September 28, 1972; Closing Dates: December 31, 1977.
The project experienced initial delays because of the time required
to adopt legislation establishing the public land corporation which is to ac-
quire land in the project zones for resale to investors. The development
studies for the six project zones, being executed by consultants, are almost
on schedule. Invitations for bids for some project works have been issued.
A study of Government incentives for investment in tourism is underway. New
heads of the National Tourist Office (ONTT) and the project unit have been
appointed.

Ln. 648:  Third Development Finance Company Project; US$10 million loan of
December 24, 1969; Closing Date: (original) December 31, 1973;
(current) June 30, 1974.
Ln. 798:  Fourth Development Finance Company Project; US$10 million loan of
February 9, 1972; Closing Date: March 31, 1976.
Ln. 881:  Fifth Development Finance Company Project; US$14 million loan of
February 20, 1973; Closing Date: March 31, 1978.
Disbursements under Ln. 648 are almost complete; those under Ln. 798
are slightly behind schedule, while disbursements under Ln. 881 are ahead of
schedule. Business greatly exceeded projections in 1973 and is continuing at
an accelerated rate. Persistent problems are the substantial amount of arrears
of hotel borrowers and the lack of valid mortgage security for certain sub-
loans; these are being closely watched. The dependence of BDET (ex-SNI) on
the Government and the IBRD is expected to be reduced by BDET's raising con-
siderable funds from local and other foreign sources and by discussions in
progress on Government-BDET financial arrangements. A request for a sixth
loan is under consideration.
Ln. 937:  Tunis District Urban Planning and Public Transport Project; US$11
Cr. 432:  million loan and US$7 million credit, both of October 5, 1973;
Closing Dates: December 31, 1976.
Due to delays in appointment of consultants and in recruitment of
Tunisian staff for the Tunis District, the loan and credit for this project
have not yet become effective. As the offer of the Tunisian supplier fell
within 15 percent of the international reference price agreed with the Bank/
IDA, the public transport company (SNT) has decided to award him the contract
for supply of project buses.
