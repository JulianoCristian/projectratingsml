APPRAISAL OF
A THIRD WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
TUNISIA
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        Water resources in Tunisia are far away from main population cen-
ters and are so limited that demand for potable water and irrigation water
wi]l exceed fresh water supplies in part of the country by 1980 and the
whole country by 1990. In Sfax, the second largest city, water has been
scarce for some years, and existing sources are sufficient to meet demand
ouly at the 1969 level. Rapid urban development is outstripping construc-
tion of water supply and distribution systems, and existing systems are
vorn out and undersize. The result îs that water reaching consumers is
unreliable in amount, with 85% of consumera suffering pressure losses in
summer, and in purity, with some possible contamination by sewage. Only
one-third of the population is connected to the distribution system and
3,800 applications for connection are outstanding, excluding numerous
parties who sec no point in applying for a non-existent service.
ii.       Three large villages wîthin a 45 km radius of Sfax also have in-
adequate water distribution systems. Agareb and Mahres have limited systema
supplied by local wells of insufficient capacity and Menzel Chaker has an
insufficient system already connected to the transmission main. Many rural
centers with over 500 inhabitants lack a public water supply system or have
a primitive system. Finally, most water resources have a higher salinity
than that of the water now distributed, and the consequences of using such
saline water have not been fully investigated.
iii.      To help alleviate some of these problems, a project is proposed
for partial Bank financing. Two previous projects covering works within
the 1968-73 National Water Program were financed under Bank Loan 581-TUN,
IDA Credit 209-TUN, and Swedish International Development Authority credits.
This third project forms part of the 1973-76 Program. Societe Nationale
d'Exploitation et de Distribution des Eaux (SONEDE), the national water
authority, was responsible for carrying out the first two projects and
will be responsible for the third one. SONEDE is eminently capable of
handling this responsibility, and will be assisted in design and supervi-
sion of the third project by consultants employed in accordance with the
Bank Group's "Guidelines for Uses of Consultants".
iv.       The proposed project includes a component to improve water supply
in Sfax. This involves: drilling of wells; construction of a well-field
collection system and transmission reservoirs, a transmission pipeline to
Sfax, and distribution reservoirs; and improvements and extensions of the
existing distribution system. It also includes provision of mains and im-
provement of distribution systems in Agareb, Mahres, and Menzel Chaker, as
well as extensions of distribution networks in other urban centers, to bring
water to low-income residential areas. The project further provides for a



- ii -
program to bring water to about 93,000 inhabitants of 62 rural centers through-
out the country. Finally, it includes a study of the economic implications
of using potable water containing the maximum salinity level permissible under
World Health Organization standards.
v.        The project cost will be US$42.62 million, including physical and
price contingencies. The foreign exchange cost of the project is US$24.19
million, or 57% of total cost. SOVEDE will borrow US$23.0 million from
the Bank, 54% of total cost, to help finance the project. This is slightly
less than the foreign exchange cost, vith the difference representing cer-
tain civil works to be carried out by SONEDE's own staff or by specialized
concractors. Retroactive financing is proposed of US$200,000 of fees for
the consulting firm undertaking the detailed design for the Sfax component.
The balance of the project cost will be covered by SONEDE's internal funds.
vi.       Major civil works contracts and all equipment contracts will be
put to tender based on international competitive bidding in accordance with
the Bank Group's "Guidelines for Procurement". A preference margin of 15%
or customs duty, whichever is less, is proposed for domestic manufacturers.
Other civil works contracts for small and widely-scattered works will be
put to tender based on local advertising and competitive bidding. Most
construction works will take place in 1976 and 1977. Works in Sfax will
be completed for the high consumption season of 1978, in the three villages
in 1977, in the rural centers in 1978, and extensions in 1976.
vii.      SONEDE is committed to maintaining tariffs which will produce a
reasonable rate of return (5% in 1973-75 and 6% thereafter). Lagging sales
attributable to water shortages and other factors have caused revenues to
fall short of target in 1973. To ensure increased revenue, SONEDE proposes
to raise the average price of water from US$0.54/1,000 gallons (61 millimes/
m3) to US$0.74/1,000 gallons (84 millimes/m3) and to restructure the tariff
to direct the increase to large consuners, tourist establishments, and in-
dustry; rates charged ta two-thirds of domestic consumers and for supply
through public standpipes would not be increased. Further tariff increases
are expected to be needed, however, due to likely inflation. Rates required
are forecast to be not very different from the long-term marginal cost of
water in Tunisia, where each additional source harnessed is progressively
more expensive. These tariffs would not produce much more than the presently-
agreed rate of return of 6% after 1975, but should enable SONEDE to generate
about 50% of its considerable investment needs from 1975 to 1982.
viii.     The main elements of the proposed project represent the least-
cost solution from among several alternatives. For Sfax, new systems will
allow more efficient supply so that suppressed and current demand can be
served and development of the city can proceed as an industrial center, the
regional capital of the south, and an alternative destination for people
now migrating to Tunis. For Agareb and Mahres, improving the distribution
system and connecting it to the transmission line, and for Menzel Chaker,
upgrading and expanding the distribution, will provide improved access to
water for their residents. Extensions bringing water to low income con-
sumers will allow them to take advantage of SONEDE's program for credit



- iii -
financing of connections. For 62 rural centers, supply and distribution
works vill be constructed which might help to reduce migration to urban
centers and vould complement the Government's present housing efforts in
rural communities. The study of potential use of water of higher salinity
than that used now vill provide data for evaluating future projects and
making water supply decisions. Quantification of costs and benefits of
using and treating this water is of utmost importance since Tunisia will
increasingly have to consider using it as a possible future source of
potable water.
i..       Agreement having been reached during negotiations wîth the Govern-
ment of Tunisia and SONEDE on certain issues, the project is suitable for a
Bank loan of US$23.0 million to SONEDE for a 25-year term, including 5 years
of grace.






TUNISIA
APPRAISAL OF THE THIRD WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      In 1967, the Government of Tunisia asked the Bank and the Government
of Sweden, represented by the Swedish International Development Authority
(SIDA), for assistance in financing various water supply works. A Bank Loan
(581-TUN) of US$15 million was signed in 1969, together with a Swedish Credit
of US$5 million towards financing the most urgently needed works of the 1968-73
National Water Program to be carried out by Societe Nationale d'Exploitation et
de Distribution des Eaux (SONEDE) the national water authority. Details of the
Loan, project cost and procurement status appear in Annex 1.
1,02      In 1970, a Credit (209-TUN) was signed by the International Develop-
ment Association for US$10.5 million together with a SIDA Credit of US$3.5 mil-
lion for a second water supply project designed to meet the requirements of
the tourism and industrial centers under the National Water Program (see Annex
1). The appraisal report for the second project noted that further major works
would be required following completion of the 1968-73 Program and the Credit
provided funds for project preparation for some of these works, including those
at Sfax which represent the major component of the works dealt with in this
report.
1.03      The first project consisted mainly of major supply works for the
most densely populated areas (Tunis and Sahel region). The second project
was princïpally for supply works for fast-growing tourist areas and cities
not covered by the first project, together with some works postponed when the
first project was considered. Both projects were scheduled for execution over
broadly the same period (1970-73); together they constituted the bulk of the
works for the 1968-73 National Water Program.
1.04      To complement these two projects towards which the Bank group con-
tributed financing, SONEDE is executing a program of miscellaneous works and
renewals with the aid of some bilateral financing assistance from Sweden,
US-AID and the Federal Republic of Germany. The Bank is also assisting in
the financing of a tourism infrastructure project (Loan 858-TUN and Credit
329-TUN) which includes a water supply component as well as works in the
sewerage, roads, electricity and telecommunications sectors (Annex 1).
1.05      The 1973-76 Development Plan foresees a program of extensions to
existing distribution systems, the commencement of a program for supply of
water by SONEDE to all settlements having populations of over 500, and im-
proved supply and distribution facilities for Sfax, the country's second
largest city. The proposed loan would assist SONEDE in the financing of all
of these works.

1.06      In September, 1973, a supervision and pre-aDprai3al mission comnposed
of Messrs. Thys, Williams, and Cosgrove visited Tunisia. The mission found
that projects under the existing Loan} and Credit, although slightly behind
schedule, were proceeding well. The mission also found that SONEDE had com-
pleted most of the preparatory work required for the appraisal of a third
water supply project.
1.07      An appraisal mission compnsed of Messts. Willians, Cosgrove a,;d
Duvivier visited Tunisia in October and November, 1973. The mission reviewed
thC  program cf works prepared by SONEDE and together with SONEDE prepared a
p<'2!age of worke suitable for Bank financing.  This report is based on the
mÎssion's findings and on information obtained from the Governnent, SONEDE
and its consultants.
Il. THE SECTOR
A.   Tunisia
2.01      The Republic of Tunisia covers an area of about 164,000 km2, about
one-third the size of France, and has about 5.5 million inhabitants, of which
about 2.5 million live In rural areas.  It has scant natural resources, mainly
phosphate and a little oil. Manufacturing has developed in the past ten years
and tourism and repatriated earnings have become important sources of foreign
exchange. Agriculture which represents about one-sixth of total GDP remains
the principal source of employment. Per capita income is about US$380. Most
of the population and economic activities are concentrated in the coastal
areas and in the north, the southern part of the country being almost wholly
desert.
B.   Water Resources
2.02      Water resources are scarce and located at considerable distance
fron the main population centers. Surface waters are only found north of
the Tebessa mountains (see Map 1) where precipitation is of the order of
500 mm/year.  The northern rivers have irregular flows and the water in most
of them is brarkish and unfit for human consumption. The most important
source is the Medjerda River whose northern tributaries have water of good
quality. If the flow of these rivers were regulated, they could provide a
reliable supply of 200 million m3/year. Groundwater recharge occurs at a
rate of 870 million m3/year, but, similar to the surface waters, its quality
is often reduced by salinity which makes it unfit for consumption and even
for irrigation. Almost all of the groundwater found south of a line passing
through Kasserine and Kairouan has a salinity higher tlian 1.5 grams/liter.
This concentration is considered by the World Health Organization (WHO) to be
the maximum permissible for human consumption.
2.03      Because the total water resources of the country are so limited,
the demands for irrigation and for potable water will exceed the total avail-
able supplies of fresh water in part of the country hy 1980 and throughout the



country by 1990. Studies are currently under way on the possibilîties of
î.rrigatîon with brackish waters, on possible mixîng of brackish water with
water of better quality to produce greater quantities of water with higher
but still acceptable degrees of salinity, and on irrigation with raw or
treated sewage. In the future, available sources of supply may be supple-
mented by recycled treated sewage or by the desalination of brackish or sea
water.
2.04      The Directorate of Hydrau±ique et Amenageinents Ruraux (HBAR) of the
Ministry oL Agriculture has the responsibility for the overall management of
water resources of the country.  BAR and SONEDE have agreed on the allocation
of the country's known water resources betweer those to be used by SONEDE for
poLu:le water and those to be used by the Ministry of Agriculture for irrigation.
In carrying out the study of the allocation of these resources, priority was
given to the quantity and quality of water require& frer SONEDE.
C.   Potable Water Supply
2.05      The production and distribution of potable water are the respons-
ibility of SONEDE, an autonomous public utility established for this purpose
on July 2nd, 1968. The creation of SONEDE has accelerated the provision of
water to individual houses, particularly in the small urban centers and semi-
rural areas. As indicated in Annex 2 the population of the areas served by
SONEDE is expected to continue increasing, from 3.31 million in 1971 to 4.35
million in 1982. By 1978 SONEDE will be supplying all settlements having
populations of 500 or more. The remaining rural population, constituting
28% of the country's total population, lives in isolated dwellings which
cannot readily be served by public water distribution systems. They may be
ultimately supplied by systems of public wells and fountains.
2.06      During the 10 year period to 1982 the number of connections is ex-
pected to increase by 130% from 157,000 to 362,000 and the total consumption
by 86% from 76.8 million m3 to 143.2 million m3. The difference between the
rates of increase of consumption and the number of connections is explained
by the fact that most of the new extensions and projects will be serving low
consumption, low income faniilies.
2.07      Existing major potable water systems are shown in Map 1.  The main
population centers are on the coast where water is scarce, and the main sources
of fresh water are located inland at considerable distances. This accounts
for the relatively high cost of water supply in Tunisia. The Tunis area
(990,000 inhabitants, consuming 46% of total water supplied in the country)
is fed ma:Lnly from dams about 120 km distant; Sousse and the populated Sahel
area (population 400,000) from groundwater catchment areas west of Kairouan,
about 90 km distant; and Sfax (population 370,000) from springs and wells near
Kasserine (165 km). The growing tourist areas in southern Tunisia (Djerba
Island) are supplied with slightly saline water from boreholes up to 120 km
distant. Bizerte and the other îndustrial cities in the area (population
200,000), however, have groundwater catchment areas fairly near, and the main
tourist area of Nabeul and vicinity (150,000) is stipplied from local wells
which will be supplemented by waters from the Tunis supply system following
completion of a connecting pipeline in 1974.



2.08      A major study by consultants financed initially by a Bank engineering
credit, has produced a Master Plan for the northern water resources of Tunisia,
and this envisages major storage works and a canal to transport mixed fresh
and brackish water east to Cap Bon. Some of this water may be purchased from
the irrigation authorities by SONEDE for potable water supply for Tunis and
the Sahel from 1980 onwards.
III. THE PROJECT AREA
A.   Location of Project
3.01      The major components of the project provide for the supply of
water to the City of Sfax whizh is located on the eaMt coast of Tunisia about
240 km south of Tunis (Map 1) and to the smaller centers of Agareb, Mahres,
and Menzel Chaker which are adjacent to Sfax. The rural centers included in
the project are located throughout Tunisia (Map 2) and the extensions to be
financed under the loan are a part of SONEDE's ongoing program of expansion
of urban systems throughout the country.
B.   Sfax City
3.02      The city of Sfax is the second largest in Tunisia with a population
of 260,000 in 1972. As the country's major port, it handles exports of
phosphates from the Gafsa mines, olive oil, alfalfa, and salt, and brings in
over 40% of the country's fish catch. It has the second largest industrial
manpower after Tunis, employed mainly in the processing of phosphates, olive
oil and leather, and also in the metal, construction and food industries.
3.03      Population of the city and suburbs is believed to have increased
at 3.9% annually in recent years and is expected to reach 490,000 in 1986.
Sfax attracts immigration from its hinterland, but suffered a small net mi-
gration loss (1966-70), almost certainly to Tunis. With further industrial
development - for example, a new fishing port project - Sfax should develop
into a complete regional capital to stem the drift of polulation and economic
activity to Tunis. To do this it will need improvement and reinforcement in
infrastructure services particularly water supply and sewerage.
C.   Existing Water Supply and Sewerage
3.04      Sfax is presently supplied with potable water from wells and galleries
near Sbeitla, through a transmission pipeline of 165 km. The capacity of this
main is now being increased from 240 1/sec to 320 1/sec under IDA credit 209-
TUN.  Local aquifers in the Sfax area yield waters of high salinity (between
3 and 10 grams/liter) that can be used only by certain industries. The total
present resources would have been just sufficient to meet the 1969 demand.
The distribution system (Map 3) is also obsolete; 25% of the network is more
than 40 years old with pipes that are generally undersized.



3.05      Because of these inadequate supplies and inefficient distribution,
total consumption in Sfax has remained stagnant around its 1968 level (Annex 3)
despite the steady increase in population and signuficant development of the
town. The specific consumption per domestîc consumer has decreased from 265
m3 per year in 1968 to 181 m3 per year in 1972. Per capita consumption in the
city is ncw at 20 m3/year compared with 38 m3/year in Tunis and 23 m3/year for
the total population served in Tunisia. The percentage of population connected
in Sfax is presently 37% compared with 73% in the capital. While housing has
increased at an average rate of 1,500 new dwellîfgs per year for the last ten
years, only 1,150 dwellings on average per year were connected to the water
distribution system. The present figure of 3,800 outstanding requests for
cornection gives only a conservative indication of the unsatisfied demand;
many potential customers did not officially apply for a connection, since they
are aware that supply is limited and pressure insufficient.
3.06      The overall deficiencies of the water suppl.y system were confirmed
by an intensive survey carried out by SONEDE throughout its various categories
of customers as well as in the unserved population. Because much of the exist-
ing distribution system has piping of insufficient diameters which has been
weakened by corrosion and choked with tubercles of rust, the connected popula-
tion experiences frequent cuts in supplies, and pressure in Most of the network
has dropped to critically low levels even when the supply is available. About
63% of the customers suffer from insufficient pressure at peak hours all year
round while this percentage rises to 85% in summer; 25% experience frequent
cuts in supply; 63% of the customers rely on additional sources of supply,
mainly rainwater cisterns. More than 70% of the unserved population has
indicated willingness to be connected when the supply is provided. Public
equipment related to water is also insufficient with only 8 fire hydrants for
an inhabitated area of 25,000 acres.
3.07      Water losses in the existing distribution system could be reduced.
Unaccounted-for water is now 30% of the volume produced. Part of this is
'water used for public purposes such as street and sewer flushing. In addition
some water may actually be used but not metered since many individual meters
of inadequate size are presently working beyond their range of accuracy and
a high percentage of meters are completely clogged (17% as surveyed in 1972).
The remainder of the unaccounted-for water is probably lost through leakage.
3.08      SONEDE intends to reduce losses to 23% or less of the quantity
produced for Sfax, by improving the distribution network and the metering.
Old and undersized pipes will be replaced under the project and leak detec-
tion teams which operate throughout the country will undertake intensive
surveys in Sfax. Large quantities of new meters have been ordered and will
allow for the replacement of old or undersized ones, the metering of public
consumption previously unaccounted for, and replacemient of collective meters
in apartment buildings by individual ones.  SONEDE is also bringing into
operation a new meter maintenance workshop with more than double the capacity
of the former one.

3.09      Most of the heavily populated areas of Sfax are already served by
sanitary sewers which discharge through a number of outfalls to the sea. The
newer developments which are less densely populated are served by septic tanks.
A visual inspection of the City indicates that the existing sewers and septic
tanks are functioning adequately, although there is no sewage treatment; this
is confirmed by a study carrîed out by consultants, Bureau Central d'Etudes
pour l'Equipement Outre-Mer (BCEOM) whose report recommends the construction
of collector sewers to intercept the existing sewers and carry the sewage
to a central point for treatment before discharge to the sea.
D.   Agareb. Mahres and Menzel Chaker
3.10      These three large villages are located wîthin a 45 km radius of the
center of Sfax. The villages of Agareb and Mahres are presently served by
limited distribution networks supplied by local wells of insufficient capacity.
Under this project their distribution systems wi1l be improved and connected
to the transmission line supplying Sfax. The distribution system of Menzel
Chaker is already connected to the transmission main but will also be upgraded
and expanded as part of this project.
E.   Rural Centers
3.11      A nationwide survey has identified 282 rural communities (popula-
tions exceeding 500) without public water supply. Only a few have primitive
and limited distribution systems. A program of approximately D 6.5 million
has been drawn up to bring water to these centers by developing local sources
or connecting them to main supply lines located nearby. A new loan from SIDA
will allow SONEDE to supply 47 centers in the "Governorates" of Sousse and
Nabeul. The proposed Bank financed project would cover 62 centers in the
rest of the country. Annexes 4 and 5 show respectively the forecast water
consumption in these centers and the populations to be served by the whole
program, on the assumption that 40% of the inhabitants will have house con-
nections within 10 years. SONEDE is completing individual engineering studies
for each community.
IV. THE PROJECT ENTITY
A.   Background
4,01      The borra!yer oe the proposed loan would be SONEDE, the national
water supply authority. SONEDE was formed in 1968 to replace the former
agency, Regie de Distribution des Eaux (RDE), in order to build up the
financial and managerial resouirces needed to develop this sector adequately.
SONEDE is owned by the Government, and is responsible to the Ministry of
Agriculture, but has the status of an autonomous public enterprise; it is
the borrower or beneficiary under both the previous Bank Group investments
in the sector (Loan 581-TUN and Credit 209-TUN), as well as the executing
agency for the water component of the tourism infrastructure project (Loan
858-TUN and Credit 329-TUN).



-7-
B.   Organization and Management
4.02      Annex 6 shows the organîzation structure of SONEDE.  The Board of
Directors comprises nine public officials and two non-official representa-
tives. Day-to-day management is delegated to a General Manager, with sub-
ordinate managers for Finance and Administration, Engineering and New Works,
and Operations. SONEDE is committed under existing agreements to consult
with the Bank Croup before making any changes in its senior personnel or
its organization structure.
4.03      SONEDE now employs some 2,100 staff, with conditions of service
whtch should be adequate to recruit and retain qualified personnel as needed.
There are no significant staffing gaps, and the only training need is at fore-
man level. SONEDE is seeking the aid of the Office de l'Emploi et de la
Formation Professionelle, a Government labor agency, to meet this need.
C.   Operations
4.04      Since its formation, SONEDE has steadily built up its operating
efficiency, overcoming the defects inherited from PDE. Consultants installed
new procedures, metering and billing have been improved, leak detection teams
trained and expanded, water wastage at public standpipes has been reduced,
and stores administration reorganized. The management has become cost-conscious
and performance-oriented, helped by newlv-created sections responsible for
statistics, organization and methods, internal audit and cost accounting
(paras. 4.07 and 4.09). SONEDE is eminently capable of carryinp out and ad-
ministering the project; its reporting systems for the previous two projects
are exemplary.
4.05      Despite SONEDE's achievements, there is still scope for further
progress, Unaccounted-for water continues higli at over 30%, though this
figure is believed to be artificiallv inflated by inaccurate bulk metering
facilities; the real losses are partly unavoidable with long supply lines
and worn-out distribution networks (as in Sfax) and partlv due to a short-
a-e of meters to replace those stopped or under-recording.  SONEDE has
19,000 meters on order and is contracting for a further 40,000; a new meter
repair shop is also nearly ready (para. 3.08).
D.   Investment Program
4.06      SONEDE's investment program for the nine years 1974 through 1982,
of which the present project is a part, calls for the expenditure of over
D 84 millior -- nearly double the cost of the assets which SONEDE inherited
in 1968, and reflecting the harnessing of ever more costlv sources of supply.
The program may be summarized as follows:

Total                                          84
E.   Accounts and Audit
4.07      SONEDE's accounting system is comprehensive and efficient.  A
computer, owned bv a service bureau but staffed by SONEDE's own programmers
and operators, handles financial accounting, billing, payroll and statistics.
Budgeting procedures are efficient, but subsequent budgetary control needs
strengthening and SONEDE is working on this. A cost accounting section moni-
tors the cost-effectiveness of each section and activity.
4.08      SONEDE inherited an inadequate and dispersed consumer accounting
system; the accounts for Tunis consumers, for example, were kept by the elec-
tricity company until nearly a year after SONEDE's formation. The clearing-up
operation has been difficult and time-consuming, involving conversion to con-
tinuous billing, harmonizine the billing to a uniform cycle for the whole
country, and aRreeing all the disputed accounts of public authorities and
government departments.
4.09      Besides an examination of its accounts by a government controller,
SONEDE is corinmitted under existing loan agreements to an external audit.
This has been carried out so far bv an international firm of auditors.
assisted by local auditors, but there are indications that future audits
will be entrusted to the latter alone. The Bank will keep this matter under
close review. An internal audit section has been set up in SONEDE but is
not yet fully operational.
V. THE PROJECT
A.   Description of Project
5.01      This project consists of a number of sub-nrojects to improve water
supply to Sfax, its neighboring municipalities, and a number of rural centers,
as well as works which form part of a program of waterworks extensions.
Annex 7 gives the components in detail and a summary follows:



- 9 -
(a)  drilling of wells 165 km inland from Sfax; construction of a
well-field collection system and transmission reservoirs, a
transmission pipeline to Sfax, and distribution reservoirs
adjacent to the city (Map 1);
(b)  expansion and renewal of parts of the existing distribution
system in Sfax which are in extremely poor condition (Map 3);
(c)  supply mains and distribution system improvements in the
adjacent towns of Agareb, Mahres and Menzel Chaker;
(d)  a package of routine extensions of distribution networks
(including meters) which form part of an ongoing national
program;
(e)  a program to bring water to approximately 93,000 dwellers in
small rural communities not now supplied (Map 2);
(f)  a study of the economic cost of distributing potable waters
which contain different levels of salinity.
5.02      The Sfax supply works will be designed to meet the peak summer
demand until about 1980 and the average demand until at least 1981 even if
the maximum possible sales are achieved (see Graph of Sales and Production,
Annex 3). The pipeline itself will be designed for higher pressures than
those to be expected during the initial stage and thus can be used as part
of the supply works which would meet the needs of Sfax until 1990. The cap-
acity of the wells which will supply the system has been proven. The supply
works and distribution lines in the rural centers are expected to have suffi-
cient capacity to meet demand until ten years after their completion. The
extensions in Sfax and the other cities are assumed to be used at or near
their capacity from the time of their construction.
B.   Construction Schedule
5.03      Tenders will be called for materials to be used for the extensions
during the summer of 1974 and for the rest of the works in mid-1975. Most
civil works contracts will be awarded during 1975, and the bulk of the con-
struction will take place during the years 1976 and 1977. The various ele-
ments of the Sfax project will be completed in time to meet the high consump-
tion season of 1978. Works in the various rural centers will be completed
during 1978 (Annex 8).
C.   Project Cost
5.04      The total project cost is estimated at US$42.62 million (D 18.53
million) including allowances for physical and price contingencies (Annexes 9
and 10). The foreign exchange component is estimated at US$24.19 million or
57% of the total cost. The basic cost of the Sfax headworks, transmission
main andi distribution system improvements is estimated to be US$19.82 million
(72% of total construction cost); the rural water supply component is esti-
mated to cost US$2.90 million or 10.5% of the total construction cost.



- 10 -
The cost estimates are based on December 1973 construction costs. Price con-
tingencies have been established assuming a local inflation rate of 5% through-
out the project period, with inflation on imported equipment assumed to be
14Z in 1974, 11Z in 1975 and 7.5Z thereafter. Project costs are summarized
below.

D.   Proposed Amount of Bank Loan
5.05      The project would be financed by a Bank loan of US$23.0 million
which represents 54% of the total project costs. The amount of the loan is
slightly less than the total estimated foreign exchange costs of US$24.19
because it is proposed that the Bank not finance any part of the small local
contracts for civil engineering works or pipe installation for the extensions
and the rural centers (para 5.12). The terms assumed for the loan are a
period of 25 years including 5 years' grace, with interest at 7-1/4%. The
period proposed is conventional for water supply loans and the grace period
corresponds to the duration of the project.

5.07      Under "Borrowings" in the preceding table, "Other Loans" are loans
assumed to be raised in 1978 for the first stage of the next major projects.
Government contributions are based on forecasts in the 1973-76 Plan, plus
full reimbursement of expenditure under the Tourism Project (see para 1.04).



- 12 -
The Government's contributions would be largely offset by revenues from taxes
on water sales (nearly D 2 million in the period), other taxes and duties
relating to SONEDE's investments during the period (some D 6 million) and
over D 1 million in interest on the previous IDA credit relent to SONEDE.
Under existing legislation and SONEDE's by-laws the Government is obliged
to make available any shortage of funds needed by SONEDE under its invest-
ment program. During loan negotiations, it was agreed that the Government
will make available any funds needed to meet project cost overruns. The
increase in SONEDE's cash balances shown in the table will be needed for
further investment after 1978.
F.   Project Administration and Execution
5.08      An engineering consultant will be retained by SONEDE to prepare the
detailed design and tender documents for the Sfax project during the first
half of 1974. The personnel of SONEDE, assisted by consultants to be engaged,
will prepare the tender documents for the extensions and rural centers com-
ponents of the projects and will supervise the construction of the entire
project. Although much of the salinity study can be carried out by SONEDE's
personnel, expert assistance will be required. During loan negotiations,
agreement was reached with SONEDE that the engineering consultants and the
experts for the salinity study will be employed in accordance with the Bank
Group's "Guidelines for Uses of Consultants".
G.  Land Acquisition
5.09      The Sfax pipeline, which is the major component of the project, will
be constructed parallel to the existing Sfax supply within a right-of-way
which is the property of SONEDE. Most of the remaining pipelines and works,
including those for the extensions and the rural centers, will be installed
within the street allowances. During negotiations, agreement was reached
that the Governnent will ensure that procedures available under law for
expropriapion or for the right of temporary occupancy will be applied for
the benefit of SONEDE if they are requested.
H.   Procurement
5.10      The principal works for the construction of the Sfax transmission
main would be grouped into one contract for the supply of pipe (estimated
cost US$8.14 million) and two contracts for the installation (US$5.43 million),
which would be awarded after international competitive bidding in accordance
with Bank "Guidelines". This would permit SONEDE to select the least-cost
combination of pipe material and installation costs. Because of the urgency
to complete the transmission main and provide additional water to Sfax, the
tender documents would require each contractor to lay pipe on at least two
fronts. Tenders for the supply of pipe for the Sfax, Agareb, Mahres and
Menzel Chaker distribution systems and the Sfax headworks, and for the supply
of pipe for the national program of extensions and the rural centers (com-
bined value US$6.63 million) would be the subject of three tender calls.
During loan negotiations, agreement was reached with SONEDE that such group-
ing and procedures will be observed. These contracts for the supply of pipe,
and contracts for the procurement of other equipment and materials (including



- 13 -
flow meters) whose value exceeda US$30,000, vould-also be awarded following
international competition in accordance with Bank Group guidelines. In order
to permit standardization, flow regulating devices valued at US$300,000 would
be purchased from SONEDE's present suppliers at ruling market price. Other
equipment and materials costing less than US$30,000 would be awarded locally
subject to an aggregate of US$300,000 in accordance with normal procurement
procedures of SONEDE, which are satisfactory.
5.11      Certain civil works, including the installation of pipe for the
distribution systems in Sfax, Agareb, Mahres and Menzel Chaker are of varying
nature, are small in magnitude, and require much familiarity with local con-
struction methods and customs. These works, having an estimated value of
US$2.37 million, would therefore be constructed under several contracts after
local advertising and competitive bidding in accordance with the normal pro-
cedures of SONEDE. For such contracts exceeding US$230,000 bidding documents
will be submitted to the Bank for approval prior to their issue to contractors,
and awards would be made in consultation vith the Bank. During loan negotia-
tions, agreement was reached to this effect with SONEDE.
5.12      Finally, works involved in the program of water supply for the small
rural centers and the ongoing national program of extensions to existing sys-
tems may be carried out by specialized contractors working in close collabora-
tion with SONEDE or even by SONEDE's own personnel. For this reason no dis-
bursements from the loan would be made against these civil engineering works.
5.13      As in the case of the previous Loan and Credit, it is proposed that
a margin of preference of 15% or customs duties, whichever is less, should be
allowed for domestic manufacturers.
I.   Disbursement
5.14      The proposed Bank loan of US$23.0 million would be disbursed over
5 years (including retroactive financing of not more than US$200,000 of for-
eign exchange expenditure of the consulting firm) as follows:
(a)  Equpment and Materials - the c.i.f. cost of imported equipment; the
(US$11.89 million)         ex-factory cost of locally manufactured
equipment.
(b)  Civil Works              - 25% all civil works contracts (except
(US$2.05 million)          those for extensions and rural centers),
representing the estimated foreign exchange
component.
(c)  Technical Services       - the foreign exchange costs of consultants for
(US$0.87 million)          design and supervision of the works and the
salinity study.
(d)  Unallocated              - for physical and price escalation contingencies.
(US$8.19 million)



- 14 -
On completion of the project any undisbur8ed balance would be cancelled. An
estimated semi-annual disbursement schedule 18 given in Annex 11.
J.   Environment and Health
5.15      Since most of the proposed vorks vill be located underground and
within the right-of-way occupied by existing works, the construction of the
proposed project will have negligible permanent effects on the ecology of
the regions concerned.
5.16      The provision of increased supplies of water will help to eliminate
health hazards from drinking water from unsafe sources of supply, will improve
the cleanliness of the centers and homes served and in general raise the stand-
ard of living. As noted in para 3.09, the existing sewage collection facili-
ties are adequate, the BOEOM study recommending the construction of inter-
ceptors and sewage treatment in order to reduce pollution of the sea. The
1973-76 Plan foresees the beginning of construction of severage works in Sfax
and a study vill be completed shortly by consultants recoumending an organi-
zation to deal with wastewater pollution on a national level. Financing of a
first sewerage project for Tunisia is foreseen for FY75. The Government has
already requested Bank financing of the completion of plans for Sfax severage
and it is proposed to provide for this as part of the overall sewerage project.
Since Sfax is an industrial city rather than a tourist resort, the short delay
until completion of construction of sewage treatment facilities is acceptable.
VI. FINANCE
A.   Background
6.01      Although SONEDE has a broad measure of autonomy, certain financial
decisions are subject to Government approval. These include the budget, the
code of staff employment conditions, major procurement, and tariffs.
6.02      Practically all vater supplied by SONEDE is charged by meter.  Un-
til 1970, there was a minimum charge representing 15 m3 of vater per month,
but this was abolished as penalizing the poorest consumers. Recovery of
charges from private consumers is well organized and operates effectively;
recovery from public bodies has in the past presented difficulties (see
para. 6.07). There is a Government tax of 4.3% on water sales, borne by
the consumer.
6.03      Consumers also pay quarterly charges for maintenance and meter
rent. New consumers are required to pay the cost of the initial connection,
an advance deposit against future water bills, and a capital contribution
towards the cost of the distribution network. Domestic consumers may, how-
ever, pay part of the initial charges by installments over 10 years.

B.   Past and Present Position
6.04      SONEDE's Income Statements, Cash Flow Statements and balance
sheets 1969-72, together with projections of these annual statements from
1973 to 1982, are shown in Annexes 12-14.
6.05      The Income Statements show that SONEDE has consistently earned a
modest surplus, equivalent to about 4% on net fixed assets. Sales of water
have however lagged behind forecasts; they increased only 18% between 1969
and 1972, whereas the number of connections increased by about 38%. This
shortfall is attributed variously to water shortage and low pressures (es-
pecially in Sfax and Tunis), defective meters, bad weather (including the
disastrous floods of 1969, which affected later billings, and the wet sum-
mer of 1972), the introduction of individual meters for apartments instead
of block meters, and to a certain extent, reduced waste at public standpipes.
The abolition of the minimum charge (para. 6.02) has also reduced revenues
from sales. The operating ratio (operating expenses as a fraction of revenues)
has however remained fairly constant at about 80%.
6.06      The balance sheets show that SONEDE's equity comes mainly from
the Government, either by way of RDE's fixed assets handed over in 1968
(less related loan debt), or in cash; the Government has paid a sun of
D 10.6 million as its agreed contribution to the cost of the 1968-73 pro-
gram. The transferred assets were valued provisionally at take-over and
a commission has been working to inventory and value these properly. Dif-
ficulties over title have held the work up, but completion is forecast for
June 1974; total asset value is not expected to differ much from the provi-
sional figure. Depreciation of fixed assets is at realistic rates, averag-
ing abourt 2.6%; part of this (relating to consumer-financed extensions) is
written off the consumerst contributions instead of being charged as an expense.
6.07      Accounts receivable are high, the largest component being arrears
due froam government departments and municipalities (D 2.7 million in 1972).
The Government is committed under previous loan agreements to facilitate
prompt payment of all water bills due from public authorities. Current
billings to government departments are settled fairly effectively under im-
proved budgetary provisions implemented during 1969/70, but earlier arrears
have persisted, and the municipalities are invariably short of funds. In
1973, however, a major effort was made; outstanding balances were agreed
between SONEDE and Ministries concerned, and D 840,000 was appropriated by
the Government against the arrears (both state and municipal), paid in the
for-m of 3-year bonds at 3%. SONEDE is pressing for further appropriations
to eliminate these arrears completely. During loan negotiations, it was
learned that progress is being made toward the elimination of these arrears
during 1974.
6.08      SONEDE's working capital (current assets less current liabilities)
has declined since 1969, the current ratio falling from 1.64 to 1.17, mainly
because of rising balances of accounts payable. Most of the rise is however
attributable to contract installments due for payment and accumulating con-
tract retentions relating to SONEDE's capital investment program; capital
expenditure grew from D 2 million in 1969 to D 7 million in 1972 and is



- 16 -
still growing. About D 1 million of liabilities represents a sum due to
the Government in respect of pre-1968 revenues of the former RDE, for which
SONEDE is acting as liquidator. SONEDE's cash balances have been adequate
for day-to-day operations, but the enterprise will have difficulty in main-
taining solvency without substantially larger revenues 4see para. 6.11).
C.   Tariffs
6.09      The present tariff for water was established in 1968 as a condi-
tion of Loan 581-TUN, and represented an average increase of about 90% over
the previous rates. Details are as follows:
Approx. % of
consumption                                                             US$
(1972)                                              Millimes/m3  1000 gals
86      General customers, incl. hotels               68          0.60
4      Industrial                                    45 /a       0.40
10      Public (municipality services,
mosques and public standpipes)                30          0.26
/a   Applies to three industrial customers only.
There are also some sales of untreated water for irrigation at low rates.
6.10      This tariff produces an average revenue per m3 (including irriga-
tion water) of about 61 millimes. Apart from the distinction between con-
sumer categories, rates are uniform for large or small quantities consumed
and for all parts of the country. In tourist areas especially, the cost of
meeting soaring peak demand is becoming progressively out of line with rates
charged and SONEDE is committed under Credit 209-TUN to studying the possibility
of higher seasonal or otherwise discriminatory rates. This study has been merged
with the general tariff review referred to below.
6.11      Under Credit 209-TUN, SONEDE is required to earn a rate of return
of 5% in 1973-75 and 6% thereafter. Although final figures are not yet avail-
able for 1973, it is certain that the 5% target will not be reached in that
year because of lagging sales (see para. 6.05) and an immediate rate increase
is indicated. Moreover, after 1973, even though water sales are projected to
increase by 50% in the next six years with the increasing amount of water
available, the value of total fixed assets and the annual charge for depre-
ciation are estimated to double in the same period, suggesting a rapidly
rising marginal cost of water and indicating that the rate increase needs to
be substantial. SONEDE has therefore undertaken a comprehensive tariff study
to direct the increase as far as possible to those most able to bear it.
6.12      The tariff study prepared by SONEDE covered the years 1974-77 and
concluded that, to meet the rate of return covenants during this period, an
average tariff of 84 millimes (in lieu of 61) would be required.  Apart from



- 17 -
the increase in the average tariff level, SONEDE's study considered various
alternatives for a revision of the tariff structure. The proposal finally
approved by the Government would charge the new rates shown below, as from
mid-year 1974:
Old            New
Millimes/m      Millimes/m3
Tourism                              68             150
Industrial                        45 or 68          70
Domestic                             68         (  68 for lst 160 m 3
(     year, then
Standpipe sales                      30         (  90 for excess
(
Public Services                      30
6.13      The new structure has merit in that it recognizes the high cost of
meeting peak tourist demand (which SONEDE calculates to be about 130 millimes/
m in capital costs alone); the increase would add about 50 millimes per bed/
night to hotel costs. The increase to industry would add less than 1% to
most industries' costs; and the proposed domestic tariff would charge more
for high consumption, while leaving unchanged the rates for small consumers
(about two-thirds of the residential consumers).
6.14      The new tariff represents a 38% increase over the present tariff.
'lowever, part of 1974 has already elapsed without a tariff increase and thus
it would produce the required rate of return only on average over the period
1974-77--whereas, under the Credit Agreement covenant, the required rates of
return are minimum rates, to be achieved or exceeded in each individual year.
For this reason, and to allow for likely inflation the average tariff is fore-
cast to rise to 94 millimes/m3 in mid-1976 and to 108 millimes/m3 in 1981.
Annex 15 lists the assumptions for the projections.
6.15      Such tariffs would produce the covenanted rates of return after
1974 but not much more. On the other hand, they would enable SONEDE to gen-
erate about 50% of its foreseeable investment needs during the years 1975-82
from internal sources, in addition to meeting its full debt service. This is
a commendable level of performance. During negotiations the Government re-
quested and it was agreed that for rate-of-return calculations the fixed
assets resulting from investments, which SONEDE is carrying out as part of
the Government's social program, i.e. supplies to rural centers and urban
extensions to low-income consumers, would not be included in the rate base.
No other change in the existing rate of return covenant is sought.
6.16      An average tariff of 84 millimes/m3 would be consistent with the
estimated long-term marginal cost (at today's prices) of water produced by
SONEDE for the country as a whole--namely, between 76 and 113 millimes/m3,



- 18 -
depending on what rate of discount is used (Annex 16). However, this cal-
culation does not take account of the cost -- as yet unquantifiable -- of
water which SONEDE must begin obtaining from irrigation resources in the
1980's, so that the true marginal cost would be somewhat larger. This
would indicate the need for an even higher tariff now, to signal to the
consumer the growing scarcity of resources, so as to defer future invest-
ment as much as possible. SONEDE's proposed tariff structure does, in
fact, reflect this -- consumption outside basic sanitary requirements is
charged at higher rates up to 150 millimes/m3. The implementation of the
new tariff would be a condition of effectiveness of the loan.
6.17      Debt service coverage (i.e., the ratio of net operating income,
before depreciation and interest, to total debt service for the same year)
is at least 2.4 times to 1982, and the debt/equity ratio should also remain
satisfactory during this period (Annexes 13 and 14). Existing loan and
credit agreements already contain limitations on capital expenditure with-
out prior consultation with the Bank, as well as limitations on incurrence
of debt. Under the latter, SONEDE shall not incur any debt (except for the
projects covered by the agreements) without the Bank Group's approval unless
net revenues at the time of incurrence, before depreciation and interest,
are at least 1.5 times the maximum future annual debt service on the pro-
posed loan and existing debt.
VII. JUSTIFICATION
A.   Project Justification
7.01      The project is justified because:
(a) it enables SONEDE to meet social objectives by bringing water
to many more people in low-income groups and in rural communi-
ties;
(b)  the health benefits from a safe and adequate water supply will
reach an even wider population;
(c) all components of the project will be constructed at least cost;
(d)  SONEDE's national program, towards all parts of which the pro-
posed loan would provide finance, would be supported by a tariff
which contains a strong element of income redistribution, besides
penalizing excessive consumption; and which moreover reflects
the marginal cost of water;
(e) individual sub-projects are justified by the benefits measured
in qualitative terms. These benefits are discussed in paras.
7.02-7.07.



- 19 -
B.   Sfax Component
7.02      Water supply to Sfax is continuously deteriorating as the rapid
developmient of the city outpaces the construction of supply and distribution
facilities. The supply system operating at its maximum capacity is unable
to meet the demand (paras. 3.05-3.07). This is reflected in the graph of
production and sales (Annex 3) which clearly shows that sales lag behind
water demand. Average per capita consumption is presently 55 1/cd which
is very low. The average consumption in the Tunis region is 102 1/cd and
even this is not high by the standards of more developed countries. The
proposed project will allow supplies to catch up with the large suppressed
demand and to satisfy future demand. Avetage per capita consumption is ex-
pected to reach 115 1/cd in 1986 and the percentage of population connected
to increase from the present 37% to 78% irL 1986. The increased pressures
throughout the system will also eliminate the dangerous health hazard from
possible infiltration of sewage into the water supply system.
7.03      There are no significant sources of water of potable quality in
the vicinity of Sfax. The present source of supply is groundwater located
near Sbeitla in Central Tunisia, about 165 km from Sfax, and additional
groundwater sources are available in the saame general region which should
be adequate to meet the needs of Sfax until 1990. The only other possible
sources of supply would be the transfer of water from the north (para. 2.08)
or desalination of seawater or brackish water from the Sfax aquifer. A cal-
culation of the relative marginal costs (Annex 17) indicates that the cost
of water from either source would be substantially higher, at any rate of
discount, than that of water from the aquifers in central Tunisia.
7.04      SONEDE has no option but to proceed with this project if it wishes
to alleviate water shortages and reduce health hazards in Sfax and permit
the continued development of Tunisia's second largest city as an industrial
center, the regional capital of the south, and a source of migration relief
for Tunis.
C.   Rural Centers
7.05      The project will also cover some of the most urgent parts of
SONEDE's program to serve rural centers. It will finance supply and dis-
tribution works in 62 centers of which a few have presently a primitive
water system and most have no organized system at all. This rural compo-
nent is specially justified as one of the principal measures which might
reduce urban migration; it is a necessary complement to the present housing
effort of the Tunisian authorities in the rural communities.  It will mainly
serve low-income, low-consumption households who will pay less than the aver-
age tariff and thus benefit from the higher rates paid by industry, tourism
and large consumers, as well as from the income redistribution effect of
Government capital contributions from national revenues.



- 20 -
D.   National Program of Extensions
7.06      The consumers first connected to the SONEDE systems were largely
those of greater means. The national program of extensions will bring water
to low income consumers who can take advantage of SONEDE's program for credit
financing of connections (paras. 2.06 and 6.03).
E.   Salinity Study
7.07      Finally, the economic study of distributing water of higher salinity
will provide data for evaluation of future projects and decision making in the
water sector. It is indispensable to quantify costs and benefits of using and
treating waters of higher salinity levels since Tunisia will increasingly have
to consider this as a possible future source of potable supply.
F.   Economic Rate of Return
7.08      It is not possible to disaggregate the benefits of the project com-
ponent comprising network extensions throughout the country. As regards the
rural centers component and the Sfax component (including in the latter the
further works needed to achieve full utilization of the pipeline), if bene-
fits are measured by the incremental revenues arising, at the proposed aver-
age tariff of 84 millimes/m3, the rate of return is 8.8% with financial costs
adjusted for taxes and at constant prices. This rate of return is modest and
reflects:
(i) the long and costly distance between the points of supply and
utilization in Sfax; and
(ii) the relatively higher cost of supplying low-income consumers.
7.09      Nevertheless the rate of return is probably approximately equal to
the opportunity cost of capital in Tunisia, and the tariff is consistent with
the long-term marginal cost of water in Tunisia (para. 6.16 and Annex 16), so
that pricing policy appears to be on the right lines.
VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
8.01      During loan negotiations, agreement was reached with SONEDE that
it will:
(i)  employ consultants for the project in accordance with the
Bank Group's "Uses of Consultants" (para 5.08);
(ii)  arrange major procurement contracts into groups and apply
procurement procedures in accordance with prior agreement
(paras 5.10 and 5.11);



- 21 -
and with the Government that it will:
(M) make available to SONEDE equity contributions and funds to
meet project cost overruns (para 5.07);
(ii) facilitate land acquisition or occupation by SONEDE (para 5.09).
8.02      In addition, certain undertakings obtained under Loan 581-TUN and
Credit 209-TUN are repeated in substance in the legal documents for this
project, relating to:
(i)  consultation about staffing and organization (para 4.02);
(ii)  audit (para 4.09);
(iii) payment of public water bills (para 6.07);
(iv)  financial rate of return (paras 6.11 and 6.15);
(v)  debt service and capital expenditure limitations (para 6.17).
8.03      The implementation of the new tariff referred to in para 6.16 will
be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan.
8.04      On the basis of agreements reached during negotiations on the issues
referred to above, the project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$23.0 million
to SONEDE for a 25-year term, including 5 years of grace.






Annex 1
TUNISIA
THIRD WTER SUPPLY PRO JECT
PREVIOUS LOANS AND CREDITS
Loan 581-TUN National Water Supply I (1/16/69) US$ 15.O Million
This loan is toward a US$ 32.8 million national water supply program
of investments covering the period 1968-1973. SIDA simultaneously granted
a credit of US$ 5 million toward the financing of this series of projects.
As of Jan. 31, 1974, the amount disbursed was $8.97 million; the project
will be completed about 12 months later than originally forecast partly due
to manufacturing problems concerning asbestos pipe. It has been recommended
that the closing date for the Loan be postponed accordingly.
Credit 209-TUN National Water Supply II (6/'30/70) US$ 10.5 million
A second group of water supply projects was identified early in the
implementation of the first investment program described above. The estimated
total cost of the second series of projects which were to be carried out during
the same period as the first series was US$ 19.2 million of which SIDA agreed to
contribute $3.5 million. As of Jan. 31, 1974, the amount dlisbursed by IDA was
$2.86 million. Project delays have been accentuated by a dispute with a con-
tractor, but discussions are in progress to settle the dispute. 'The Bank
has recently been informed that the contractor's performance is improving.
Loan 858-TUN and Credit 329-TUN Tourism Infrastructure (2/28/72)
The estimated total cost of sewers, water, roads, electricity, telecom-
munications, planning and promotion under this project is us$ 55 million of
which $8.18 million is for water supply and $16.64 million for sewerage.
Detailed engineering is now proceeding and it is expected that the first con-
tracts will be awarded in the Spring of 1974.

TUNISIA THIRD WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Sfax System
(a) Future Demand
1.         A survey of water supply needs in Sfax carried out by SONEDE in
1972 included a detailed analysis of the consumption patterns of the whole
population (connected and not connected) and the potential specific demand
of all categories of consumers. The results were compared with specific
consumption for the years 1966-1968 (when demand was fairly well satisfied)
in order to determine future specific demnand. These specific demands were
related to the various types of dwellings.  Simultaneously the trends  in
housing and urban development of Sfax during the past years were studied
together with town planning policies and options in order to predict the
future development of the city. By app.jing the specifie demands to the as-
sumed development of Sfax residential consumption was calculated. Projections
of administrative and industrial consumptions were added to the residential
consumption to give the total future needs of the town. The same information
was used to prepare the distribution network master plan. This plan aims to
increase the percentage of population colnected from 37% to 78% in 1986,
implying a program of 2,800 new connections per year compared with the forecast
of 2,000 new houses built each year. The resulting projections appear in Annex 3
as the curve of theoretical demand.
2.         The project will satisfy suppressed water demand and future demand
in Sfax until at least 1981. It will also meet the needs of 9 localities already
connected to the transmission system. Two adjacent centers will also be
connected to the system and their distribution network developed. Thle project,
utilizing future sources of supply and with supplementary works, will satisfy
the needs of Sfax until at least 1990.
(b) Headworks
3.         In addition to the existing supply from Sbeitla (springs and wells
yielding 320 1/sec), a new well field in Djilma will supply 400 1/sec.   The
new wells will tap the Djilma-Ouled Asken-Hadjeb El Aioun aouifers that have
been subject to several studies including pumping tests.  These aquifers yield
water with an average salinity of 1.45 grams/liter as compared with the existing
supply to Sifax with a saliriity varying between 1 gram/liter and 1.45 grams/liter.
A total of 9 new wells will be put in operation of which 2 still have to be
drilled, while the other 7 drilled previously for investigations have to be
equipped. New collection works include:
42.5 km of 300 mm pipes
13.5 km of 800 mm pipes
1   storage tank of 250 m3
9   well pumps and transformer stations



Annex 7
Page 2 of 5 pages
The water collected will finally be fed into a 1500 m3 storage tank at the
head of the transmission line at elevation + 370 m.
(c) Transmission Line
4.         Throughout its length from the headworks to Sfax the new pipeline
will run parallel to the existing line following the route imposed by several
passes across mountain ridges. During the first years the line will operate
under gravity with a nominal capacity of 400 1/sec and will be able to handle
a peak flow of 620 ]/sec. The strength of the pipe will however be selected
to operate at higher pressures than are required at this stage. It will be
pressurized by booster pumps to increase its nominal capacity to 850 l/sec
(peak flow 11i5 l/sec) whLn additional sources of supply are brought into
operation after 1980. The new line will include:
10.9 km of 1100 mm pipes
109.5 km of  800 mm   "
6   km of  600 mm
6.4 km of 500 mm"
7.6 km of  400 mm
8    pressure breakers
(d) Sfax Distribution
5.         SONEDE has worked out a complete Master Plan for the distribution
system on the basis of its 1971-72 customer survey, a review of Sfax's past
and future development, and a comprehensive technical analysis of the existing
system. The proposed project will finance the first phase of the Master Plan.
The first phase has two principal components:
(i)  Improving pressure  in the lower network covering the center
of the town including the "Modern Quarter", the "Medina" and
the "R'bats". It involves recalibration works and replacement
of the oldest pipes that would break under the new higher
pressures. The lower network will be extended to the port by
a 300 mm pipe for bunkering ships in transit from and to Libya.
(ii) Improving and developing the higher network covering the
industrial zone and residential suburbs. These areas are
presently supplied by mains stretching out from the center of
the lower network which is thus overloaded. This bad pattern
will be changed by creating external belts of mains in the suburbs
directly connected to the transmission pipeline. The distribution
network will be particularly developed in the suburb of Gremda.
6.         Total quantities required in the works are:



Annex 7
Page 3 of 5 pages
2 km of 800 mm pipe
7.4 km of 600 mm pipe
5.2 km of 500 mm pipe
5.2 km of 400 mm pipe
4.4 km of 300 mm pipe
7.9 km of 250 mm pipe
4.6 lm of 200 mm pipe
0.8 km of 150 mm pipe
20. km of 100 mm pîpe
10.9 km of 80 mm pipe       3
3 reservoirs of 5,000 m
The material of the distribution pipes will be cast iron.  For the transmission
line the choice between prestressed concrete and cast iron will be made after
tendering.  Water treatment will be limited to chlorination as at present.  The
water supplied by the underground aauifers of Sheitla and Djilma is of reasonable
quality and biologically safe.
(e) Adjacent Towns
7.         The towns of Agareb and Mahres are presently supplied by lccal wells
of insufficient yield. They will now be connected to the transmission line.
Their distribution networks and the network of Menzel Chaker will be developed.
Works include:
5.8 km of 300 mm pipe (asbestos or cast iron)
14.5 km of 250 mm
23.4 km of 200 mm
12.7 km of 150 mm   "m
2   reservoirs of 250 mn3
1   reservoir of 1,000 m
1   pressure breaker
(f) Future Developments
8.         Other sources of supply will be put into operation at later stages
and are not included in the project. They will however use the new transmission
pipeline to bring the water to Sfax. The main features of these sources are:
Average Yield     No. of      Additional
Wells      Transmission Line
Sbiba         100 1/s           3             58 lm
Gamouda       150 1/s           5              16 km
Hadjeb        150 1/s           4              19 km



Annex 7
Page 4 of 5 pages
These sources having water of similar quality to water from Sbeitla, it will
be possible to add a limited amount of water fron the Sfax aquifers which is
of higher salinity and by mixing maintain the average salinity of the total
supply at an acceptable level. The Sfax aouifer would thus provide 110 1/sec
through existing wells which are not presently in use. The second stage of
the Master Plan of the distribution system in Sfax will concentrate mainly on
the suburbs. Additional mains will be placed to complete the external belts
and connect them with the center of that town and also to th  supply line to
Mahres; 3 storage tanks having a total capacity of 35,000 m will be built
with provision made for supplying them eventually by a desalination plant.
Other Programs
(a)  Extensions Program
9.         The project will finance the purchase of the materials and
maintenance equipment necessary for the l975-76 extensions program.  It
includes 800 km of pipes (mostly small diameters of 80 mn and 100 mm)
and special fittings.
(b) Rural Centers
10.        Until 1972 SONEDE was responsible for the supply oL water only to
those settlements having the legal status of municipalities. Under the 1973-1976
Plan SONEDE has been given the responsibility for the supply of water to all
settlements having populations of over 500. The Plan provides for the supply
of water to these ruralsettlements as well as the extension of services and  an
accelerated program of connections to residences in communities already served
by SONEDE.  Works to be executed in the 62 rural centers list to be partly
financed by this loan include:
33 storage tanks of various sizes (50 to 1,000 m3)
15 wells to be drilled and equipped
2 springs to be developed
111.6 kon of 80 mn pipes
78.1 km of 100 mm pipes
78.5 km of 150 mn pipes
14   km of 200 mm pipes
3   km of 300 mm pipes
(c) Salinity Studies
11.        During the 1980's the quantity of water available will be closely
related to the auality, and in particular the salinity, of the water resources
which are available. It is possible that the entire population may be faced
with continuous consumption of waters having salinity levels at the maximum
of 1.5 grams/liter recommended by WHO. It is questionable whether WHO intended
this maximum recommended level to be used continuously on a national scale,
although there is little physiological and public health data relating illness
to the chemical quality of water. The Bank has drawn this matter to the
attention of WIHO. In addition, because of the cost of treating water by
industry to make it suitable for industrial use, and because of the economic

cost resulting from the accelerated deterioration of household plumbing
systems (in particular hot water systems) it is felt that a study of these
factors is warranted and a sum has been included in the proposed loan for
this purpose.
12.     The study would compare the economic cost of using water of various
degrees of salinity with the cost of alternative solutions - for example,
dual distribution systems or treatment to reduce salinity.  The outline of
the study should be established by experts in consultation with SONEDE, though
the field work can be done by SONEDE's own staff.

TUNISIA - THIRD WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
ASSUMPTIONS FOR FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
Projections of Sales
1.     SONEDE had made projections for every center, based on the "service
ratio" it was hoped to achieve by 1981 for each of the three grades of
locality - provincial capitals, district capitals and "other communities".
The "service ratio" is expressed as:
No, of connections x assumed no. of persons per connection
Total population
2.     Thus, for "other communities",  the target was 50% as against 20/a now.
From this formula, SONEDE calculated the number of connections which must be
built to achieve a given ratio by a given date; the total connections which
would then be in service were apportioned between the various consumer cate-
gories, based on (incomplete) statistical trends; and each category multiplied
by the forecast "unit consumption" of that category, to give total sales.
3.     Projections made in this manner tend to be weighted by the figure selected
as the "assumed number of persons per connection" at the present time, which is
difficult to ascertain and subject to conflicting estimates. Moreover, SONEDE's
results showed a sales curve rising rather more steeply than the previous trend,
and which it was felt reflected  the possible rather than the probable.  Accord-
ingly the mission adjusted the projections downwards, deducting a provision for
contingencies rising to 5% in 1981. Finally, the growth percentages for Tunis,
afax, and the rest of the country respectively were tested and modified in the
light of the ongoing and future improvements and extensions likely to stimulate
consumption in each region; in the case of Sfax, final forecasts reflected a
special study of likely demand trends in that area.
4.     On the basis of a 1972 survey and the forecast development of Sfax City,
SONEDE worked out as part of its Master Plan for the city, the potential demand
for water in that supply system,, shown graphically in Annex 3 as the curve of
"theoretical demand". This graph shows a considerable lag of actual sales behind
theoretical demand, accentuating until 1977, and indicating the important suppressed
demand to be caught up. Two different sales forecasts are illustrated on the graph -
the first, identified as "possible sales", catches up the theoretical demand
within h years with a jump of 150%. Arnother approach, marked "probable sales",
anticipates a slower growth of 100% over the first four years, gradually rising
to the level of the theoretical demand thereafter. In the light of past trends
and the possible moderating effect of a tariff increase on potential water sales,
the second approach has been used as the basis for financial projections.



Annex 15
Page 2 of 4 pages
5.     The projections now show:
(a) For the Tunis region, continuation of the existing growth rate of
4.81 to 1974, then a sharp jump to 8% in 1975 and 1976 following
the renewal of obsolete mains to improve pressure and the completion
of supply works in the first project; then an annual growth of 5.8%,
regarded as easily attainable.
(b) For the Sfax region a rise in sales in 1975 when the second project
works are completed, followed by static consumption until 1977 (since
supply constraints exist);  from 1978, however, improvements in supply
under the proposed project permit the long-standing suppressed demand
to be satisfied and an average annual growth of about 16% is assumed
until 1982. This will still faU welU short of the "theoretical
demand" calculated by SONEDE.
(c) For four years, growth in other communities is forecast to rise from
the present 5.5% a year, to over 7%, with SONEDE's program of extending
rural supplies. After this period, sales growth is expected to revert
again to just over 5; annually.
6.     The average annual growth rate for total sales between 1972 and 1982 is
forecast to be 6.*, compared with 6.7% 1966-72 and 10.32 1962-66.  It is believed
this estimate is reasonable, even with a substantial tariff increase, given the
b ack-log of demand and the constraints on consumption in recent years.
7.     The tariff assumed is as set out in para 6.14 of the main Report.
Income Statement
8.     The following summarizes the assumptions for items appearing in the
Income Statement projections, other t1-n water sales.
(i)   Other Fees and Income
Based on average fee as follows:
D
Rent of meter        2.500
Mtce charge          1.250
3.750 plus taxes, or say D4 per
connection calculated on the midyear average number of connections
which in turn is assumed to grow at 22,500 a year, less 2,000
abandoned annually.
(ii) New Connections
22,500 a year at 1973 average cost, increased by price escalation
as shown below for the various cost components.



Annex 15
Page 3 of 4 pages
(iii) Water Sales Tax
Included both as a revenue and as an expense (since it
affects accounts receivable) at an assumed rate of 4.3%.
(Iv)  Personnel
1974 needs were assessed by a special study in the context
of the new statute and increased by 5.75% annually for
increments, variations in the base rate, and additional
personnel. This is believed adequate in the closely
controlled climate for employee remuneration in Tunisia.
(v)   Fuel and Energy
Vehicle fuel increasing in quantity by 3% a year, pumping
power based on consumption growth outside Tunis; all subject
to price increases of 20% every two or three years for fuel,
and of 5-7% annually for electricity. 1/
(vi)  Chemicals
Based on evolution of production, distinguishing between
different zones using different chemicals, with price escalation
for chlorine of 14% in 1974 declining to 7½ % in 1976 and
after, and for other chemicals of 5% annually.
(vii) Water Purchases
From 1980 bulk purchases are estimated to become necessary
(para 2.08) at an assumed price of 60 millimes/m3.
(viii)Materials
Quantities based variously on estimated volume of new connections,
lengths of main extensions foreseen and an allowance of about
0.5% of fixed assets for maintenance. Price escalation for
fittings as for chlorine under (vi) above, and for other
materials at 5% a year.
(ix)  Taxes
Calculated in detail according to nature.
(x)   Expenses Transferred to Capital
This represents the cost of extensions included in the foregoing
items.
(xi)  Other Uxpense Headings
Assumed to increase at 1-2% a year, plus price escalation at
varying rates up to 7% a year.
1/ Despite increases in the world price of oil (of which Tunisia is
a net exporter), fuel oil costs are not a significant componen-t
in the energy tariff, and oil is being gradually displaced by
natural gas for power generation.



Annex 15
Cash Flow Statements and Balance Sheets                      Page 4 of 1& pages
9.     Government contributions projected after 1973 are based on the 4-Year
Plan (1973-76) and include the SIDA credit for rural centers passed on to
SONEDE as a grant, as well as reimbursement of costs under the Tourism Project.
Consumer contributions from new customers are of two types - a fixed fee per
meter of frontage up to 100m, and the actual cost of any mains extension re-
quired beyond that length; the first is projected on the average fee paid by
small frontagers, times the expected number of new connections, and the second
on a statistically derived percentage of SONEDE's total extension program - all
subject to annual depreciation in the balance sheet.
10.    Accounts payable are variously projected as below:
(i)   Suppliers - one month's capital expenditure and two months'operating
expenses (except personnel, taxes and depreciation).
(ii) Retention money - 7-1/2% of work in progress at the yearend or the
previous yearend, whichever is greater.
(iii) Consumer Deposits - increasing at D5 per new consumer.
(iv) RDE Liquidation Account - paid off in 1976.
(v)   Miscellaneous - static for 3 years, then increasing by 7% annually.
11.    Stocks are deemed to increase by D200,000 by 1975 and thereafter to
increase by 2-1/2% for price escalation on new purchases. Long-term accounts
receivable mainly represent credits for new connections and small extensions;
70% of these charges are assumed to be subject to such installment arrangements.
Under "Accounts Receivable"T, private consumers' arrears are assumed to vary only
in proportion to the increase in clientele and in tariffs; public authority
arrears are deemed to be brought down to four months' billings by the end of 1975,
the reduction being effected by 3-year bonds maturing in annual tranches. Other
receivables are projected as slowly increasing, and a Bad Debts Provision is
maintained to a maximum of 157. of private customers' arrears (including current
maturities of installation credits) and 1OC of public accounts.
12.    Fixed assets are not revalued, partly because of the deflationary effect
of technical obsolence, over and above depreciation, and partly because of the
substantial accretions of new works at current costs. Depreciation is projected
at about 2.5% of mid-year assets, after allowing for disposals; that portion of
depreciation attributable to consumer-financed extensions is written off "Consumnr
Constributions", instead of being charged as an expense.
13.    SONEDE is assumed to borrow for the major projects (Tunis, Sfax, Sahel)
from 1978 on, at the rate of 52-1/2% of project costs. Terms assumed are for
repayment over 20 years at 8%.

Notes
"Investment Costs": Cost of SONEDE's own investments required to produce the
volume of sales forecast to be attained in 1990.  Prices are at 1973 levels and
exclude taxes. Distribution network extensions included except where consumer-
financed. From 1980 on, however, SONEDE will have to obtain a growing portion
of its water needs from irrigation sources, using major works which are not yet
identified (but to which SONEDE will have to contribute part of the cost, either
in capital or by purchase of water). This cost cannot yet be quantified and
would have to be added to the calculation above.
rtOperating Costs't: Calculated at 10 millimes/m3 (approximately present incremental
cost).
"Incremental Sales": Are those above the maximum attainable in each area following
completion of projects now in progress.






Annex 17
TUNISIA - THIRD WATER STJPPLY FROJECT
LEAST-COST SOLUTION
A. Cost of Production of Water in Sfax with Proposed Project
1.     The proposed project will meet the demand of Sfax until 1984, using
probable sales (see Annex 3).  The transmission pipeline, however, will not
be used at its full capacity until 1991 after additional sources of supply
have been connected in the meantime to the pipe. These additional sources
have been identified in the vicinity of the pipeline near Sbiba, Hadjeb and
Gamouda.  Future works required include new wells, pipes, re servoirs and t he
second stage of development of the Sfax distribution network.
2.     Capital costs included for calculation purposes cover the whole of the
headworks and transmission to Sfax. Future capital costs cover drilling of
12 wells, 3 storage tanks, 127 km of pipeline and 5 booster stations. Incre-
mental operating costs have been calculated on the basis of previous costs
and SONEDE projections of recurrent expenditures. All costs are at constant
(December 73) prices and exclude taxes and customs duties (15%). No shadow
pricing is employed in the calculations; unemployment in the construction
industry in Tunisia does not justify shadow prices for labor.
3.     On this basis, the capital cost of theSe production facilities is D 11.7
million with operating costs of 1h millimes/m
B. Comparison of Alternative Solutions
4.     Alternative supply schemes include desalination plants in Sfax and
transmission of water from the proposed canal in Northern Tunisia through
Sousse to Sfax. Capital cost of desalination plants would be over D 20.0
million while operational cost would be at least 60 millimes/m3. Transmission
of the water from the North would moreover require an increase in the size of
the canal in Northern Tunisia, as well as a long transmission line with pumping
stations from the canal to Sfax via Sousse.  The capital cost of additional works
required for Sfax's supply alone would be at least D 11.7 million, in addition
to the investments required for the supply to Sousse; operational costs solely
for the transmission would be over 30 millimes/m3. In addition, the massive
investment program and the operational costs of the proposed Northern water
network would increase the delivered cost of water significantly.   Thus, at
any discount rate, the proposed project with its subseauent development is the
least cost solution.
