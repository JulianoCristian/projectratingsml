MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF ZAIRE
FOR AN EDUCATION SECTOR REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.      The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed development
credit to the Republic of Zaire for SDR 37.1 million (US$49.0 million equivalent)
is submitted for approval.  The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms
with 40 years maturity to help finance an education sector rehabilitation project.
The project would be cofinanced by Belgium (US$5.9 million equivalent) and France
(US$3.7 million equivalent).
2.      Background.  Despite significant achievements (gross enrollment rates
reached 76% in primary and 22% secondary education, in 1986/87), the Zairian
primary and secondary education system is plagued by underfinancing. Public
spending for education, barely 10% of the total state budget at present, has been
falling for fifteen years, while external assistance is limited, and declining.
The education sector has therefore come to rely increasingly on users'
contributions, which currently represent 60% of total education expenditures --
probably close to the limits of payment capacity. Total resources available to
the education sector are skewed against primary education (where unit costs of $24
are among the very lowest in Sub-Saharan Africa), and overwhelmingly absorbed by
the salary bill at the expense of nonsalary recurrent inputs.
3.    The management of primary and secondary education is weak at all levels,
from the central services of the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education
(DEPS) to the schools. Planning and programming capacities are particularly
deficient. Decentralization -- a necessity in a vast country with roughly 15,000
schools -- does not operate well. 95% of the students are enrolled in public
schools, two thirds of which are managed under the mandate of religious
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs); such schools are often better off
financially and administratively. The project has been designed to build on the
current strengths of private sector involvement in education. Initial primary
school teacher training is inadequate, in-service training is practically
nonexistent, and supervision is insufficient.
4.    The quality and internal efficiency of primary and secondary instruction are
declining and primary level enrollments are leveling off. The immediate reasons
for this deterioration include: (a) an acute shortage of textbooks and basic
learning materials, especially at the primary level; (b) a demoralized, underpaid,
and underqualified teaching corps, with high turnover and absentee rates; and (c)
ill-equipped and ill-maintained facilities.
5.    Confronted with the degradation of the sector, the DEPS has initiated a
number of corrective measures such as curriculum development and a more efficient
teachers' pay system. The DEPS has also recently designed a comprehensive long-
term sectoral strategy which identifies clear and attainable priorities and
indicates the conditions needed for sustainable development of the sector, based
on public and private initiatives. The strategy sets enrollment objectives, with



- 2 -
a priority for basic educationi and more emphasis on short technical secondary
studies, and provides mechanisms to reduce repetition; it also makes specific
recommendations on cost containment, realistic financing plans, and resource
mobilization. This strategy consti'tutes the policy framework that the proposed
project would both embody and assist.
6.     Rationale for IDA Involvement.  Sustained development in Zaire depends on
maintaining an adequate and stable macro-framework. It also requires the
rehabilitation of physical and social infrastructure. IDA's country dialogue is
currently focused on reaching agreement on a macroeconomic program, following the
mixed implementation record under the first SAL. Nonetheless, IDA's involvement
in rehabilitating the long-neglected education sector will be highly beneficial
under any macroeconomic scenario: the project supports policy measures aimed at
increasing budgetary allocations to the sector to alleviate past underfunding, and
at shoring up the legal framework for NGO participation to reduce uncertainties
and improve the delivery of educational services. Efficient and equitable
education services not only permit direct productivity gains, but also help to
alleviate poverty and are critical to long-term progress on the status of
population, health and nutrition, and women. The proposed operation would build
upon previous IDA involvement in the sector (Educational Technical Assistance and
Training Project -- Credit 1519-ZR), and would complement the ongoing Higher
Education Rationalization Project (Credit 1839-ZR). In particular, it will
intensify efforts to strengthen planning activities in the DEPS, and bolster
collaboration between the DEPS and the Ministry of Higher Education (DESURS) to
harmonize control of student flows and resource allocation policy in the two
education sub-sectors.
7.      Pro-1ect Oblectives.   I'he project has two main objectives: (a) to help the
Government to restore the conditions for a balanced long-term development of a
more viable and adequately financed education sector, by taking the necessary
measures proposed in the sectoral strategy; and (b) to stop the deterioration of
quality in primary education, and to boost it by taking immediate steps to
increase the availability of key educational inputs.
8.      Policy Measures include:  (a) mobilization of incremental budgetary
resources for recurrent expenditures in the sector, (b) creation of the Sectoral
Strategy Committee (CSS), with representatives from both education ministries,
which will monitor sectoral developments, (c) control and adjustment of enrollment
(through admission, transition, and examinations), according to educational
priorities and financial constraints, (d) organization of a progressive scaling
down of repeater rates at the primary level, (e) redefinition of the conditions of
school management by NGOs (in particular church networks), and (f) regular
preparation of sectoral public expenditure programs (PEPs) and public investment
programs (PIPs).
9.      Prolect Description.  The project would have three components:
(1)   Support to the Government's sectoral strategy through (a) technical
assistance to the CSS, and (b) strengthening of the DEPS' planning and
programming capabilities (including PEPs).



- 3 -
(2)   Promotion of quality, efficiency, and coverage of education, with first
priority to primary education, through: (a) the provision of basic textbooks and
teacher guides, (b) in-service training associated with textbooks, (c) rehabili-
tation of the local education environment (multi-level classrooms in rural areas,
two pilot teacher training schools, and pilot incentive schemes for teachers) in
Haut-Zaire, and (d) construction of about ten primary schools on the crowded
periphery of Kinshasa.
(3)   Institutional reinforcement by:  (a) rationalizing working conditions of
the central administrative staff (office consolidation, training, computer-
ization, and support to the office of statistics), and (b) improving work
4        conditions at local levels (training and equipment of administrators and
supervisors).
10.   The project, to be carried out over six years, is designed in two parts.
The first provides for essential educational inputs and other basic sectoral needs
--a kind of deferred maintenance.   A joint mid-term review of project
implementation, including the execution of agreed sectoral measures, would precede
the second part. The estimated project cost is US$66.8 million equivalent,
including US$1.3 million taxes, with a foreign exchange component of US$48.7
million (73%). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule
A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events
and the status of Bank Group operations in Zaire are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A map is attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 8124-ZR, dated
February 7, 1990, is being distributed separately.
11.     Agreed Actions.   The Government has already allocated incremental
resources to the DEPS 1990 budget, for financing recurrent expenditures. The CSS
has already been created, and the list of books eligible to be produced in the
first part of the project is ready. Conditions of effectiveness are that (a) the
CSS be staffed, (b) the new legal framework encouraging NGOs' participation in
school management be completed, (c) Belgian and French contributions to the
project be secured, (d) the project advance account be opened, and (e) an
operational plan for the implementation of the incremental budget allocation be
prepared for the period 1990-93. The DEPS will prepare and update each year a
three-year rolling sectoral public expenditures program, which will be transmitted
to the Association, for comment and agreement. The DEPS will take appropriate
measures to regulate enrollment and repetition at the primary level. Disbursements
on sub-components of the second part will be determined at the mid-term review
planned for September 1993, and will be contingent upon: (a) satisfactory
implementation of the sectoral strategy, (b) satisfactory execution of the
incremental budgetary allocation in 1990-93, renewal of the allocation in the
1994-96 PEP, and preparation of an operational plan for the implementation of the
allocation for this period, (c) preparation of a list of textbooks to be printed,
and (d) new regulations to more efficiently organize student transition from
secondary to higher education.
12.     Justification and Risks.  The project will ultimately boost student
achievement at all levels, and help to restore Zaire's human capital base. The
risks stem from the fact that Government may not make sufficient budgetary
allocations to the sector, either for sectoral or macroeconomic reasons or because



of DEPS' weak managerial perfornance. The project addresses these risks by
strengthening the Ministry's pliannings programming and budgeting capacities with
external assistance, equipment, and training and by sectoral policy measures.
Other risks are associated with textbook distribution in a large country with poor
communication. Relying on well-organized church networks will help reduce this
risk (as it has in the ongoing project).
13.   I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Association ant recommend that the Executive Directors approve
the proposed credit.
