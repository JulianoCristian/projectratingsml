MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:   Project Completion Note on Zaire -
Education Sector Rehabilitation Project (Credit 2213-ZR)
Attached is the Project Completion Note on Zaire Education Sector Rehabilitation
Project (Credit 2213-ZR) prepared by the Africa Regional Office.
The Credit, approved in 1991, became effective in 1992. Disbursements were suspended
when Government failed to meet its debt obligation to IDA in 1993 and the country was placed on
non-accrual status. Macro-economic problems and lack of counterpart funding made project
implementation impossible. In 1994 the Credit was closed and the undisbursed balance canceled.
Only 5 percent of the Credit was disbursed, a large part of which was to refund project preparation
expenditures and pay for technical assistance.
The note describes the checkered history of project preparation in the face of a
deteriorating macro-economic and political situation with IDA attempting to maintain a minimum
level of lending in the country. Project documentation was initially circulated to the Board,
withdrawn, reappraised as part of the core lending program and again presented to the Board. At
that time riots broke out, foreigners were evacuated but 15 months later in a still difficult political
and economic situation IDA waived a number of conditions in order to have the credit become
effective. However, little implementation took place thereafter and the project was never formally
supervised.
The PCN concludes that is was unwise of IDA to have waived the conditions of
effectiveness and that in the face of a deteriorating country situation, IDA should have adopted a
wait and see attitude instead of proceeding with this project. The history of this project illustrates
the dilemmas the Bank faces in dealing with difficult country situations. It was not for lack of trying
on the Bank's part that this project had to be closed.
Since little was disbursed and disbursements subsequently were suspended the project
is not rated.
The PCN is satisfactory. No audit is planned.

PROJECT COMPLETION NOTE
REPUBLIC OF ZAIRE
EDUCATION SECTOR
REHABILITATION PROJECT
(Credit 2213-ZR)
1.    The credit for the Zaire Education Sector Rehabilitation Project (CR. 2213-ZR) in the
amount of SDR 15.0 million, was approved by the Board on March 5, 1991 and became
effective on June 30, 1992. As with other projects in Zaire, disbursements were suspended on
July 15, 1993 following the Government's failure to meet its debt service obligation to IDA
and the country was placed in non-accrual status on November 15, 1993. Due to the macro-
economic situation and lack of counterpart funds, project implementation became impossible
and the project could not achieve its development objectives. On April 25, 1994, the Credit
was closed and the undisbursed balance in the amount of SDR14.3 million was canceled. Only
5 percent of the credit had been disbursed and 40 percent of this amount was to refund
expenditures on project preparation.
2.     The project was appraised in June-July 1989. At that time, Zaire was undertaking
economic adjustment with Bank support. The Bank was also keen on supporting specific social
sector adjustment measures. Project preparation took place in parallel with a social sector
project (PASS) (FY92) which was designed to be the "umbrella project" in the social sectors.
Adjustment measures linked to the education sector were related to the rationalization of the
education system. The design and implementation of the Government's Education Sector
Strategy for Zaire was linked to the project design. This was to be done by directing more
resources towards the sector with an emphasis on primary education and spelling out specific
education priorities. The project objectives were to: (a) stop the deterioration and improve the
quality of primary education, by taking immediate steps to increase the availability of main
educational inputs; and (b) help the Government implement its sector education strategy to
restore the conditions needed for long-term balanced development of a more viable and
adequately financed education sector. The project was to focus on: (i) supporting the
Government's Education Sector Strategy by providing technical assistance to implement the
strategy and for strengthening the Ministry's planning, programming and budgeting function
including public expenditure programming; (ii) improving the quality, efficiency and coverage
of primary education through the provision of textbooks, in-service teacher training,
construction of 5 primary schools in Kinshasa and piloting a set of improvement measures in
the Haut Zaire region; and (iii) institutional strengthening of the Ministry of Education at the
central as well as peripheral levels which included computerization, office consolidation, and
training.
3.    Total costs were initially estimated at US$71.0 million, with IDA financing of
US$49.0 million. The project was to be implemented in two parts, the first providing for
essential educational inputs corresponding to a core program (amounting to US$28 million of
IDA financing) which was "adjustment proof" and focused on the most urgent needs. The
second part was to be launched after satisfactory implementation of sectoral measures. By late
1989, the adjustment process was off-track, but project processing continued and in February



Project Completion Note - Zaire Education Sector Reihabilitation Project           2
1990 the Board package was distributed. A few days later though, a decision was taken not to
present the project to the Board due to tlle continuously deteriorating macro-economic
dialogue, including the specific measures linked to the education sector. The adjustment
programn was discontinued in mid-1990 due to problems of weak governance, economic
mismanagement, and lack of ownership.
4.    In August 1990, the Bank decided to stop all quick disbursing operations. In view of
this, the scope of the project had to be reduced. A "re-appraisal" mission took place in
September-October 1990 where the project was re-configured. The project was no longer
linked to the overall macro-economic context. It became what was called at the time a project
that was part of the Bank's core lending program for Zaire. The project was to respond to the
urgent needs of the sector. IDA funding allocations were revised downward significantly and
therefore project costs were re-visited. This was done by following an approach to ensure that
only the indispensable activities necessary to avoid further deterioration of the education
system would be financed. Project objectives remained the same as described in paragraph 2.
However, the size of all components was revised downward except for the support to the
policy framework and overall project management. The textbook sub-component remained the
most important investment. However, it was reduced in size -- instead of covering the whole
country it would cover only 11 key sub-regions (one in each region). Due to the withdrawal of
Belgian financing for technical assistance (US$5.9 million), the Bank thought it was necessary
to increase its share of TA financing in the textbook and payroll units (SECOPE) of the
Ministry of Education. The recruitment of this technical assistance also became a condition of
negotiations. Total project costs were estimated at US$29.7 million and IDA would finance
SDR 15.0 million (US$21.0 million). Other donors (FAC, UNDP, UNICEF, WWF) were
expected to contribute about US$5.6 million The balance of US$3.1 million was to be
financed by the Government. Project preparation absorbed a lot of resources 81.9 staff weeks
as project preparation took more than two years. Appraisal took 38.1 staff weeks, and
negotiations took 42.3 staff weeks due to the fact that the project was appraised and negotiated
twice and two reports were prepared (Table C).
Project Implementation
5.     Shortly after Board presentation of the downsized project in March 1991, military-led
riots broke out in several parts of Zaire, which led to widespread looting and the evacuation of
most foreigners, including the UNDP technical assistance and the Belgian experts working in
the Ministry of Education. As one of the conditions of credit effectiveness was to recruit
internationally an economist to support a committee on education sector strategy which was to
be established under the project, effectiveness was delayed until June 1992. Furthernore, in
order to declare the credit effective at the time two conditions were waived which were: (a)
the recruitment of the resident economist; and (b) no firm commitments were obtained
regarding the French co-financing for the project.
6.     Following effectiveness, project activities moved slowly because of the difficult
political and economic circumstances which followed thie 1991 riots. These included non-
payment of civil servant salaries, scarcity of counterpart funding, liquidity problems in banks
which made it impossible to utilize what little counterpart funds were available, hyper-
inflation, and the continuing absence of technical staff formerly provided under bilateral
agreements. Additional riots in January 1993 further complicated project implementation
because of widespread looting and deterioratinig security. The project office was looted and
two cars were stolen.

7.     Sixty percent of actual disbursements (US$640,000) took place during project
implementation. The other 40 percent (US$440,000) was the refunding of the PPF. During
the short period of project implementation, most of the IDA financing (67%) was for technical
assistance (US$430,000) and 22% was for operatilg costs (US$145,000). The two main
reasons for these low disbursements after effectiveness were: (i) the project unit was becoming
weaker in terms of implementation capacity due to a lack of funds and competent staff; and (ii)
the continuously deteriorating political situation. Efforts were made to get the project off the
ground by tapping the managerial expertise of the ongoing IDA-financed Economic
Management and Institutional Development (PRAIGEFI) Project to prepare bidding documents
(which were never finalized). As the PRAIGEFI project was going to close, an arrangement
was made with staff from the on-going PASS project to provide assistance on Bank procedures.
However, since the financial relationship between the Bank and the Government of Zaire
continued to deteriorate project activities came to a standstill by mid-1993.
8.     On July 15, 1993, disbursements were suspended, following the Government's failure
to meet its debt service obligations to IDA. On November 5, 1993, Zaire was placed in non-
accrual status. Project implementation became impossible and projects could not achieve their
development objectives.
Project Achievements
9.     Most achievements for this project took place prior to credit effectiveness under PPF
financing. Those were mainly the elaboration of "fiches pedagogiques" (pupil profiles) and the
distribution of textbooks and other educational manuals. Certain teaching materials were
purchased. An initial urban pilot training program as well as on-going training programs were
put in place for teachers. Activities also continued in the Directorate of Infornation Systems
to computerize some key ministerial divisions. However, there were considerable delays in the
Planning and Statistics Directorate in issuing the 1990-91 statistical abstract. The first part of
the rehabilitation was finished for the Ministry which enabled the Directorate of Pedagogy (in
charge of implementing the bulk of project activities) to have adequate office space. Virtually
no activities took place after credit effectiveness. The international economic advisor got as far
as identifying potential members of the sectoral strategy committee to follow-up on the
implementation of the education strategy. The Ministerial Decree appointing the members of
the committee had been finalized and the process was well advanced in terms of recruitment of
two education planners. On the more positive side, the payroll unit of the Ministry of
Education (SECOPE) continued through 1992 its remarkable work in terms of managing,
counting, and paying teachers, as well as starting a comprehensive inventory of schools. This
was to be used by the project itself and by PASS for the allocation of basic pedagogic
materials.
10.   As the overall political situation deteriorated, the project supported the idea of greatly
enhancing the role of NGOs in the education sector as it was deemed that this would be the
only effective way to implement the project. Certain NGOs were contacted, however nothing
materialized.
Conclusions and Lessons Learned
11.   No formal Bank supervision missions ever went to the field to supervise this project,
because travel to Zaire was considered hazardous during the period of project implementation,
and later because of the suspension of disbursements and the country's non-accrual status.
However, a special Bank mission which visited Zaire in November 1993 recommended that



Project Completion Note - Zaire Education Sector Rehiabilitation Project                   4
this project remain open to try to provide textbooks and educational materials to primary
schools. It could have been used as one of the Government's vehicles to maintain a minimum
level of educational quality during those difficult times once disbursements could be resumed.
However, the decision was made to cancel the credit in April 1994 as part of a country-wide
program to close projects which could no longer meet their objectives.
12.    The main lesson learned from this project is that, since the Bank had foreseen the
deteriorating country situation, it should have adopted a wait and see approach instead of
processing this project rapidly. In addition, the Bank was unwise to have waived certain key
conditions of effectiveness (the recruitment of the resident economist and the French co-
financing) in a rush to declare the credit effective 15 months after Board presentation. In view
of these factors, virtually no activities took place after effectiveness.
