and\n            Reintegration Project aims to a) provide sound post-conflict\n            reintegration options to ex-combatants who have joined the\n            ranks of the unemployed after the signing of the cease-fire\n            agreement; b) help rehabilitate physical and social\n            infrastructure; and c) support macroeconomic stability. The\n            Bank's involvement will address the immediate\n            post-conflict needs of the country; and provide the\n            development leadership needed for reengagement of the\n            international community in a country in the delicate and\n            troubled Central Africa region. Building on ongoing\n            Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR)\n            activities in the country, this project will also help\n            formulate a comprehensive Demobilization and Reintegration\n            Program (DDR) in Congo by setting up necessary framework to\n            build on donors' support for the DDR program. The\n            project will contribute to ongoing efforts to consolidate\n            peace and strengthen security in the Republic of Congo,\n            while offering sound reintegration options to ex-combatants\n            who joined the ranks of the unemployed after the signing of\n            the cease-fire agreement. The credit will complement support\n            provided by other donors and the Bank's ongoing\n            Post-conflict Grant for the Reintegration of Women and Youth."}, "docdt": "2001-07-06T00:00:00Z"}
