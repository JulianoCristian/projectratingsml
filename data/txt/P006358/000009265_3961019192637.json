Final project costs were US$373.4 million, with\n            US$194.4 million disbursed from the Bank Loan. According to\n            the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) and the Loan Agreement\n            (LA), project objectives were the financial rehabilitation\n            and improved commercial performance of the Federal Railway\n            System; and increased transport efficiency in the two export\n            corridors of Parand and Goias- Minas Gerais. To support the\n            project's objectives, loan proceeds were to finance:\n            (i) a policy development and institutional component which,\n            through the use of action plans, would address company-wide\n            and sectoral issues; and (ii) an investment component which,\n            through strategically located investments, would improve\n            transport operations in the two export corridors."}, "docdt": "1996-03-01T00:00:00Z"}
