at its financial rehabilitation and at improving its\n            commercial performance.  In addition, it will involve; (ii)\n            two rehabilitation and improvement projects designed to\n            increase transport efficiency in the Parana and Goias-Minas\n            Gerais export corridors. The policy and institutional\n            development component includes action plans for\n            rationalizing the railway's operations and network;\n            upgrading tariffs, marketing and cost control; improving\n            operations and maintenance efficiency; strengthening\n            planning and management systems; and improving transport\n            coordination in the Southeast corridors.  The two corridor\n            projects essentially include the rehabilitation and\n            improvement of the most critical sections of main lines, of\n            yards, of workshops and of intermodal facilities."}, "docdt": "1985-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
