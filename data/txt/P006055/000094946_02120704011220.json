rated\n            satisfactory, sustainability likely, and the institutional\n            development impact is substantial. Several lessons are drawn\n            from the project. The major lesson is that by creating an\n            enabling environment, and responsive institutions to\n            interface with the private sector, investments derived\n            significant contributions in terms of mining exploration,\n            and job opportunities. Yet another positive example points\n            at the importance to approach sector reform in an integrated\n            way, for example as it concerns the development of mining\n            rights, and environmental management capacity, instead of in\n            a piecemeal manner. Once again, lessons reemphasize the\n            importance of Government commitment, which was politically\n            supportive both at the federal, and provincial levels. And,\n            it is worth noting the strong sector work prior to\n            preparation, which effectively paved the way for reforms,\n            allowing sufficient time for a thorough project design, and\n            a well-defined coordination between the federal, and\n            provincial implementing units. Likewise, the strategy\n            adopted to implement the institutional capacity building,\n            was particularly successful, based on the institutional\n            mandate, designed with the participation of most\n            stakeholders, that included a participatory diagnostic,\n            responsive to provincial specificities."}, "docdt": "2002-11-01T00:00:00Z"}
