The\n            purposes of the restructuring are: (i) to modify three\n            project development indicators, (ii) to reallocate loan\n            proceeds; and (iii) to extend the project closing date by 12\n            months from December 31, 2011 to December 31, 2012. The\n            Project FESP is financed by a US$220 million loan that was\n            approved by the Board of Executive Directors of the World\n            Bank on November 21, 2006 and has been effective since\n            September 6, 2007. To date the Project has disbursed\n            US$184.66 million, with a remaining undisbursed balance of\n            US$35.21 million. The targets of three out of six Project\n            Development Objective (PDO) indicators were fully achieved\n            in 2010. These include the following: (i) measles\n            eradication; (ii) congenital rubella eradication; and (iii)\n            reduction of tobacco prevalence among the population of 18\n            to 64 years old. Progress with these indicators reflects the\n            Borrower's intensive work on epidemiological\n            surveillance of vaccines and tobacco control, both of which\n            have been supported by the Project through a Public Health\n            Activities (PHA) output based mechanism. The Project has\n            made significant progress in Public Health Activities\n            implementation. In 2010, implementation of PHAs increased by\n            almost 100 percent as compared with the cumulative amount\n            PHAs executed in the last three years of the Project.\n            Progress made demonstrates that management by results is now\n            accepted by the provinces as an effective instrument for the\n            implementation of public policies."}, "docdt": "2011-09-02T00:00:00Z"}
