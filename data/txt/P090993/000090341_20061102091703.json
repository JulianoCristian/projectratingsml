Health Programs; reduce\n            the population's exposure to principal risk factors\n            associated with collective illness; and improve the\n            stewardship role and appropriate regulatory environment of\n            the nation's public health system. The project\n            components are: 1: The activities financed by this component\n            seek to improve capacity at the national and provincial\n            level to carry out the essential public health functions\n            that are at the core of health stewardship and necessary for\n            the success of key public health programs. This component is\n            divided into two subcomponents, one geared to strengthen\n            functions at the national level and the other at the\n            provincial level. 2: Activities financed by this component\n            seek to i) improve efficiency and equity of the provision of\n            medical supplies necessary for the success of priority\n            public health programs; and ii) contribute to a rapid and\n            organized response from the health sector in the case of a\n            health emergency. This component is divided into two\n            subcomponents: to strengthen inputs management and\n            performance monitoring for priority public health programs,\n            and to improve preparedness and response to a potential\n            Avian Influenza epidemic, and other health emergencies and\n            natural disasters. 3: Activities to be financed under this\n            component will aim to provide supervision and monitoring of\n            Project implementation, to ensure its transparency, and to\n            create positive externalities in the area of governance\n            applicable to the whole health sector."}, "docdt": "2006-10-23T00:00:00Z"}
