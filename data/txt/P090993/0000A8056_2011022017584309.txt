                         The Project's development objectives are to: (i) increase the coverage of ten prioritized Public Health Programs; (ii) reducepopulation's exposure to principal
                         risk factors associated with collective illness; and (iii) improve the stewardship role andappropriate regulatory environment of the Nation's public health system.

                         The following PDO indicator goals were fully achieved in 2010: (i) measles eradication; (ii) congenital rubella eradication; and (iii) tobacco use reduction. These indicators reflect the
                         intensive work that the country is doing in epidemiological surveillance of vaccines, and the tobacco control. Regarding tobacco, the National law that prohibits smoking in public

                         Regarding intermediate indicators, significant steps have been made in the 'Healthy Communities and Municipalities' Programs, which have all been deemed as satisfactory in their
                         implementation. Project management remains Moderately Satisfactory due to the procurement rating (MS) as well as the partial achievement of PDO indicators.
                         A Governance and Accountability Action Plan (GAAP) is being implemented by UFI-S for all Bank Projects, including the FESP.
                         The Project maintains a highly satisfactory rating of both safeguards including full achievement of Indigenous Peoples Plans as well as full completion of the environmental
                         safeguards, including a sophisticated environmental evaluation of hospitals that has been performed in more than twelve key hospitals in the country.
