                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project's development objectives are to: (i) increase the coverage of ten prioritized Public Health Programs; (ii) reducepopulation's exposure to principal risk factors
                         associated with collective illness; and (iii) improve the stewardship role andappropriate regulatory environment of the Nation's public health system. The Project aims to
                         support Argentina's Federal HealthPlan and its objectives to reduce mortality and morbidity associated with collective illness.

                         Overall Project implementation remains in a moderately satisfactory progress, due to the partial achievement of Project Development Objective (PDO) indicator goals. The following
                         three out of six PDO indicator goals were fully achieved in 2011: (i) measles eradication; (ii) congenital rubella eradication; and (iii) tobacco use reduction. These indicators reflect the

                         intensive work that the country is doing in epidemiological surveillance and tobacco control. The National law that prohibits smoking in public spaces and other Provincial regulations
                         has contributed to reduced tobacco use. The Project is actively supporting both programs through outputs and results based financing activities. The PDO indicator related to the
                         accreditation of provincial public health functions and programs is likely to achieve its final target in 2012, based on the pilot experience implemented in Tucuman Province.

                         The Mid Term Review (MTR) mission conducted in March 2011, reviewed the Project implementation status, discussed the main Project challenges and achievements, and agreed
                         on the next steps needed for achieving PDOs, which included a project restructuring. The project was restructured in September 2011, including: (i) a Project extension of 12 months
                         (current closing date is December 31, 2012); (ii) reallocation of loan proceeds for the completion of the national Lab and blood bank infrastructure works currently underway under
                         Category 1 of the Loan; and to support the MOH strategy aimed at increasing coverage of the National Blood Program, the HIV Program and the Reproductive Health Program under
                         Category 2 of the Loan. (iii) the modification of certain indicators, as a means of effectively reflecting the Project's significant efforts and achievements. The following two PDO
                         indicator goals were adjusted in order to reach it final targets by the end of the Project: i) 50% increase in voluntary blood donations (VBD) by 2010; (ii) the certification of 17 of 19
                         Provinces in the interruption of Chagas vector transmission.

                         The Project continue having a highly satisfactory progress in both safeguards, including full achievement of Indigenous People Plans (IPPs) as well as full completion of the
                         environmental safeguards, including a sophisticated environmental evaluation of hospitals that has been performed in more than 30 key hospitals in the country. Regarding
                         intermediate indicators, significant steps have been made in the 'Healthy Communities and Municipalities' Programs, which have all been deemed as satisfactory in their
                         implementation. A Governance and Accountability Action Plan (GAAP) is being implemented by UFI-S for all Bank Projects, including the FESP.
