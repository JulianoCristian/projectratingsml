                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project's development objectives are to: (i) increase the coverage of ten prioritized Public Health Programs; (ii) reducepopulation's exposure to principal
                         risk factors associated with collective illness; and (iii) improve the stewardship role andappropriate regulatory environment of the Nation's public health system.
                         The Project aims to support Argentina's Federal HealthPlan and its objectives to reduce mortality and morbidity associated with collective illness.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Progress on achievement of the project objectives is Moderately Satisfactory, since three out of the Project's six PDOs were fully achieved in 2010, and the other three are still in
                         progress. The PDOs achieved are the following: (i) measles eradication; (ii) congenital rubella eradication; and (iii) tobacco use reduction. PDO indicators that are still in progress

                         interruption of Chagas vector transmission.

                         While the accreditation (the fourth indicator) is set to achieve its final target due to the satisfactory evaluation of the instrument for sub- national accreditation in the pilot Province of

                         Tucuman, the fifth indicator (VBD) has not reached its 50% goal despite the significant progress made since its baseline number (6% in voluntary donations in 2006 vs 24% in 2009),
                         reflecting an annual increase of 40% per year. The goal defined for the entire Region of the Americas was to achieve 50% of voluntary blood Donations for 2010, a goal that
                         Argentina adopted as its own, without a realistic evaluation of the efforts required, given its baseline number and the project’s duration. Argentina asked the Bank to modify the goal of
                         this indicator during the Mid Term Review.

                         The sixth indicator, the certification of the interruption of vector transmission of Chagas in 17 out of the 19 Provinces, is at risk of not being achieved by the end of the Project, due to
                         the priority placed by the country on focus the Vector-Borne disease program in control the Dengue-Fever disease control program, which become a priority in response to an
                         epidemic that struck the country during the project period, resulting in more than 300 deaths over the last two years. Dengue Fever did not exist in Argentina during the Project design
                         period. The MOH proposed the Bank to replace this Vector-Borne indicator for one that more appropriately reflects the current epidemiological situation in Argentina, and the
                         Government's effort to support Dengue control.

                         Regarding intermediate indicators, significant steps have been made in the 'Healthy Communities and Municipalities' Programs, which have all been deemed as satisfactory in their
                         implementation.

                         The Mid Term Review mission reviewed the Project implementation status, discussed the main Project challenges and achievements, and agreed on the next steps needed for
                         achieving PDOs, which include a project restructuring. Project Restructuring is in the approval process, and is expected to be approved by the Bank in September 2011, and Project
                         modifications will be reflected in the next ISR. Restructuring includes: (i) a Project extension, (ii) the reallocation of loan proceeds and (iii) the modification of certain indicators, as a
                         means of effectively reflecting the Project's significant efforts and achievements.
