satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory,\n            and the Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: financing public health functions\n            instead of vertical programs (HIV/AIDS, immunization, etc.)\n            allows for the improvement of the delivery of vertical\n            programs while strengthening health systems overall. In\n            federal settings where provinces have a large degree of\n            autonomy, the signing of 5-year umbrella agreements between\n            federal and state levels outlining each party's\n            responsibilities protects against political risk. The\n            inclusion of an emergency contingency component in\n            investment operations is an effective approach to address\n            emergencies. Realistic risk assessment regarding\n            implementation capacity will ensure the needed support is\n            built into project design. Project evaluation methodologies\n            need to be defined during preparation to ensure the needed\n            information is available. The Governance and Accountability\n            Action Plan (GAAP) provides a common fiduciary tool to\n            address overall systemic accountability issues. Its joint\n            design with the Government will increase ownership and\n            effectiveness. In addition, agreed supervision plan and\n            regular close supervision by the Bank's fiduciary team\n            has substantially reduced implementation risk since its introduction."}, "docdt": "2013-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
