A. SUMMARY

This paper proposes the restructuring of the Essential Public Health Functions
Project (Loan 7412-AR, P090993). The purposes of the proposed restructuring are: (i) to
modify three Project Development Indicators, (ii) to reallocate Loan proceeds; and (iii) to
extend the Project closing date by 12 months from December 31, 2011 to December 31,
2012.


B. PROJECT STATUS

The Essential Public Health Functions Project (FESP) is financed by a US$220
million loan that was approved by the Board of Executive Directors of the World Bank
on November 21, 2006 and has been effective since September 6, 2007. To date the
Project has disbursed US$184.66 million, with a remaining undisbursed balance of
US$35.21 million.

The Project's Development Objectives (PDO) are to: (i) increase the coverage of ten
prioritized Public Health Programs; (ii) reduce the population’s exposure to principal risk
factors associated with collective illness; and (iii) improve the stewardship role and
appropriate regulatory environment of the national public health system. The Project aims
to support Argentina’s Federal Health Plan and its objectives are to reduce mortality and
morbidity associated with collective illness.

Progress on most key outcomes and intermediate indicators is consistent with the
targets set out in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD). The following, are the most
relevant achievements and key issues:

   -   The targets of three out of six PDO indicators were fully achieved in 2010. These
       include the following: (i) measles eradication; (ii) congenital rubella eradication;
       and (iii) reduction of tobacco prevalence among the population of 18 to 64 years
       old. Progress with these indicators reflects the Borrower’s intensive work on
       epidemiological surveillance of vaccines and tobacco control, both of which have
       been supported by the Project through a Public Health Activities (PHA) output-
       based mechanism.


   -   The PDO indicator related to the accreditation of provincial public health
       functions and programs is likely to achieve its final target based on the


                                            6
         satisfactory evaluation of the sub-national accreditation instrument in the pilot
         Province of Tucuman. This instrument will be applied to all provinces in 2011.

    -    The Borrower requested adjustment in the following three PDO indicators: (i)
         50% increase in voluntary blood donations (VBD) by 2010; (ii) the certification
         of 17 of 19 Provinces in the interruption of Chagas vector transmission; and (iii)
         the decrease in prevalence of smoking by 6% among the population of 18 to 64
         years old. (Section C)

    -    Regarding the four intermediate outcome indicators, 15 Provinces have reached
         the expected targets1 in 2010, as certified by the External Concurrent Audit. In
         addition, major steps have been made in the implementation of the ‘Healthy
         Communities and Municipalities' Program, with all members considered its
         implementation satisfactory.

    -    The Project has made significant progress in Public Health Activities
         implementation. In 2010, implementation of PHAs increased by almost 100% as
         compared with the cumulative amount PHAs executed in the last three years of
         the Project. Progress made demonstrates that management by results is now
         accepted by the provinces as an effective instrument for the implementation of
         public policies.


C. PROPOSED CHANGES

Adjustment of Project Development Indicators

    (i) Revision of Voluntary Blood Donations Indicator target from 50% to 30%.

Based on implementation experience, and taking into account the baseline of VBDs in
Argentina and the annual rate of increase of this indicator2, the Borrower considers that it
will be impossible to reach the voluntary blood donations target of 50% by the end of the
Project. Based on the observed trend, the Project could reach 35% voluntary blood
donations, with a significant and sustained effort. For this reason, the Borrower proposes
a new target of 30%. This indicator has been included in the FESP II Project with the
original target, which encourages both Projects to continue working towards the original
target of 50%.


1
  Intermediate Outcome Indicators: (i) by the end o f the project, all Provinces have 95% immunization
coverage for BCG, DPT3+HiB7 MMR+HepB vaccines, and each participant Province has at least 90%
coverage; (ii) 90% of cases selected key diseases (measles, rubella and HUS) reported by surveillance
system are managed according to norms; (iii) 85% of new reported sputum-positive TB cases are receiving
DOTS in regular form according to norms; and (iv) by the end of the project, at least 750 Municipalities are
members o f the healthy municipalities’ network, and 400 are accredited as full members (with 100 from
NOA and NEA).
2
  Although the VBD Indicator has not reached the 50% target, it has made significant progress in the
increase of VBDs, achieving an annual increase of approximately 40% per year since its start date in 2007,
accounting for the highest increase rate in the region during that period.
                                                     7
   (ii) Revision of Chagas Vector-Control Indicator

In 2009, after two years of Project implementation, Argentina suffered severe outbreaks
of dengue and influenza A/H1N1 epidemics. The dengue epidemic hit provinces in the
north, infecting almost 30,000 people. To control this epidemic, the Borrower
implemented a number of strategic social and medical measures with Project support and
succeeded in reducing the number of dengue cases to less than 3,000 by 2010.

Given the urgency of addressing the dengue epidemic, the Borrower had to slow down
the pace of addressing the Chagas disease. However, important efforts in the surveillance
and control of vector-borne diseases in general; were made and the Borrower has
launched a strategic plan to increase coverage of the Vector-Borne Disease Programs,
including Chagas, dengue, leishmaniasis and yellow fever, among others. This will
contribute to, and improve the stewardship and regulatory capacity of the National Public
Health System.

Based on this new strategy, the Borrower has requested the modification of the Chagas
indicator to reflect the efforts and progress that have been made in the surveillance and
control of vector-borne diseases, as follows: 20 out of 24 health situation rooms certified
for the epidemiologic surveillance of vector- borne diseases. The Borrower has also
requested that the Chagas indicator is kept as a process indicator.

   (iii) Revision of Tobacco Control Indicator target.

The target for the indicator was mistakenly stated at appraisal as a decrease from 33%
(baseline) to 27% (endline). Instead, it should have been stated as a decrease from 33%
(baseline) to 31% (endline). The target was wrongly expressed in the PAD as a reduction
in 6 percentage points in the prevalence of smoking, instead of a variation (decrease) of
6% or 2 percentage points (33% x 0.06 = 2%). Although Argentina has experienced a
more significant reduction in tobacco smoking prevalence than other LAC countries in
the period 2003-2010 (Table 1), the team agrees that a reduction in the prevalence rate of
smoking from 33% to 27% would have implied an over-ambitious goal. As the next
National Risk Factors Survey will only be available in 2014 (after the Project closing
date), the team agreed with the target change proposed by the Borrower.

Reallocation of Loan Proceeds

1. The Borrower propose a reallocation of loan proceeds to:

        (i) Allow for the completion of the national laboratories and blood banks works
        currently underway under Category 1 of the Loan. Due to delays in the
        procurement of these works, the actual prices are higher than estimated during the
        design phase. The reallocation represents less than 10% of the original amount of
        Category 1.

        (ii) Support the MOH strategy aimed at increasing coverage of the National Blood
        Program, the HIV/AIDS Program and the Reproductive Health Program under
        Category 2 of the Loan. Taking into account that the procurement of vaccines
        represented 54% of expenses in Category 2 until 2009, the MOH has decided to
        continue financing vaccines through local funds and use Bank financing for the
        prioritized programs mentioned above. The reallocation represents less than 10%
        of the original amount of Category 2.

        (iii) Increase the amount of Operating Costs under Category 3 of the Loan to
        finance the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) and UFI-S staff responsible for
        Project implementation, as the original amount allocated under Category 3 was
        insufficient to finance the Operating Costs needed to carry out Project activities.

        (iv) Reduce the amount under Category 4 that will not be executed by the Project.
        The FESP II Project was approved on December 20, 2010, and its design includes

                                                   9
       the implementation and financing of PHAs, which makes the respective allocation
       unnecessary. Project’s PHAs will be implemented until the end of 2011, at which
       point FESP II will begin implementation of the revised PHAs.

       (v) Reallocate the balance of the Project Preparation Fund.

2. Therefore the Proceeds of the loan 7412 will be reallocated as follows:
