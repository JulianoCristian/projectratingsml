The\n            project's main objective was to help Nigeria to improve\n            the production of palm oil in order to satisfy the\n            increasing local demand. The project was also to support oil\n            palm research and to promote the private sector by\n            supporting smallholders development and private palm oil and\n            rubber processing units. Bank's performance was\n            satisfactory. Borrower's performance was deficient. The\n            key lessons learned were as follows: (a) access to land with\n            assured user rights for Nucleus Estate (NES) expansion\n            should be a loan conditionally; (b) projects which suffer\n            from extended start-up delays should be either redesigned or\n            canceled; (c) in cases where political circumstances\n            (bifurcation of states, profound changes in government\n            system) prevent implementation, loans should be suspended or\n            canceled; (d) in agricultural production projects, where\n            processing is an integral part for achieving the expected\n            benefits, all efforts should be made to ensure the\n            construction of processing facilities, taking due\n            consideration of financial and economic viability; and (e)\n            Bank procedures for procurements and disbursements should be\n            made clear and Borrower should adhere to them.."}, "docdt": "1996-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
