     Ref. Loan No. 3126-UNI-Tree Crops Project
          Amendment of Loan Agreement
Dear Sir,
     Please refer to Loan Agreement (Tree Crops Project) dated
October 12, 1990 between the Federal Republic of Nigeria (the
Borrower) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (the Bank).  The decision by the Borrower and the Bank
to cancel US$20.0 million out of the proceeds of the above-named
Loan requires the amendment of Schedule 1 to the Loan Agreement.
The Bank accordingly proposes that the Loan Agreement be amended by
the deletion of Schedule 1 and the replacement of said Schedule by
the new Schedule set out in the Annex to this letter.
     Please indicate your agreement with the proposed amendment by
signing the form of confirmation on the enclosed copy of this letter
and returning the copy to us.  The amendment shall be deemed to have
come into force as of January 1, 1993.
                              Very truly yours,
                              INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR
