     5.4.1       By and large there is only a limited                    practice of direct

                  cost      sharing for public utility services                    at      present.

                  More so for water facility,               because of the          traditional

                  belief that "The water is perceived as nature·'s gift to

                  the     mankind".             Also many feel that the          provision         of

                  wat.er is tbe         ret~ponsibility     of the Government..              Hence,

                DEMAND FOR PRIVATE LATRINES
Lft             Based    on responses from sample households, demand             for

                private latrines emerges as 48%.        Howev·er this is based

                on a intensive dialogue with detailed          eh~lanations.      It

                would    be    realistic to assume a   dema~nd   of    around    25%
                wherein the project is taken up on a large scale.

                CONCLUSION
l.   5          It is hoped that the findings and recommendations would
                prove    to    be useful for    implementing     the    integrated

                project.       The key elements for success would        be     user

                education and community participation.
