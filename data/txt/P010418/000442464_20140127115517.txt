PREFACE

The Government has made considerable efforts in the past decade to provide safe drinking water
and sanitation facilities with the support of several multilateral, bilateral and non-Government
organisations. With the onset qf the International Drinking Water and Sanitation Decade, new
initiatives have been taken in several states for the implementation of Integrated Rural Water
Supply and Environmental Sanitation Projects (IRWS&ESP). Several donors came j01ward for
providing assistance to the rural water supply and sanitation sector. A unique opportunity existed
in Kamataka State to make a Comparative Study of Externally assisted IRWS&ESP and
Govemment involvement in the sector. The interest in the study arose because of certain
innovative policies, strategies and approaches for project implementation and management.


The study reviewed the experience ofjour ntral water supply and sanitation programmes, mainly
project organisation, project designs, components, delivery 'mechanism, financial arrangements,
management process, operation and maintenance, junctions of Village Water and Sanitation
Committees (VWSCs) and programme development strategies. The study is jointly sponsored by
the Rajiv Gandhi National Drinking Water Mission, Govemment of India, UNDP!World Bank
Regional Water and Sanitation Group- South Asia (RWSG-SA).


The South East Asia Regional Bureau of the International Union for Health Promotion and
Education (SEARB-IUHPE) wish to thank Rajiv Gandhi National Drinking Water Mission,
Government of India, UNDP!World Bank, RWSG-SAjor identifying SEARB-IUHPEjor carrying

1.      INTRODUCTION

The Government has made considerable efforts in the past decade to provide safe drinking
water and sanitation facilities with the support of several multilateral, bilateral and non-
Government organisations. With the onset ofth~ International Drinking Water and Sanitation
Decade, new initiatives hayy been taken in several states for the implementation of Integrated
Rural Water Supply and Environmental Sanitation Projects (IRWS&ESP). Several donors
came forward for providing assistance to the rural water supply and sanitation sector. A
unique opportunity existed in Karnataka State to make a Comparative Study of Externally
assisted IRWS&ESP and Government involvement in the sector. The interest in the study
arose because of certain innovative policies, strategies and approaches in project
implementation and management.

The study is jointly sponsored by the Rajiv Gandhi National Drinking Water Mission,
Government of India, UNDP/World Bank Regional Water and Sanitation Group- South Asia
(RWSG-SA). The Study team reviewed project documents and reports and had discussions
with programme man~gers and officials, donors and the NGOs before formulating the
methodology.

The study was conducted in two parts. The first part wasÂ· related to village level studies which
were carried out in selected villages of the three externally assisted projects and the project
under the Government. In consultation with the PPMU and the concerned officials five
villages were selected from each project area. The criteria for selection was that most of the
project works should have been completed in the village. A sample of 100 households were
selected from each of these villages for the study of community participation, cost-sharing,
working of the village water and sanitation committees and changes in knowledge, attitude,
personal hygiene behaviours and use of the facilities created under the projects. Questions
related to sustain ability ofthe system were also examined.

The second part of the study was addressed to technical and management aspects including
financial aspects and project implementation. Information on this aspect was collected through
a study of project documents and interviews with project officials at different levels, the donor
agencies and the non-governmental agencies. The study reviewed the experiences of four
rural water supply and sanitation programmes (Danida, Netherlands, World Bank and
Government Supported) mainly with regard to Project Organisation, project designs,
components, criteria for selection, delivery mechanisms, financial arrangements, management
process, operation and maintenance, functions of village water and sanitation committees
(VWSCs) and programme development strategies including behavioural changes.

The South East Asia Regional Bureau of the International Union for Health Promotion and
Education (SEARB-IUHPE) wish to thank Rajiv Gandhi National Drinking Water Mission,
Government of India, UNDP/World Bank, RWSG-SA for identifying SEARB-IUHPE for
carrying out the study which was initiated vide Government of India Letter D.O.No.JS(TM)

Water and Sanitation Group - South Asia.

We very much hope that the findings and recommendations of this study will pave way for
some directions towards working out new policy framework and strategies. for integrated
water supply and environmental sanitation programme.

3.1       Introduction

With the launchiqg of. thr.ee externally supported integrated rural water supply and
sanitation projects each with a different strategy, methodology of implementation and
several innovative approaches provided a unique opportunity for a comparative study of
these projects with the Government programme in this sector. Such an analysis and
comparison was expected to yield rich dividends in identifying replicable methodologies
and sustainable institutional development strategies and policies for the national
programme.

The study was jointly sponsored by the Rajiv Gandhi National Drinking Water Mission,
Government of India and the UNDP/World Bank -Water and Sanitation Group - South
Asia. The South East Asia Regional Bureau of the International Union for Health
Promotion and Education (SEARB-IUHPE) was requested to conduct the study.

3.2       Objectives

The study was undertaken with the following objectives:

â¢     to examine rules and procedures followed in the mentioned projects, adjustments made
      to the original proposals, methodologies and the reasons for such changes and
      modifications and implementation arrangements;
â¢     to compare the institutional linkages, cost sharing mechanisms and eligibility criteria
      followed in the four projects to understand the rationale behind such practices,
      feasibility and effectiveness;
â¢     to compare the financial arrangements adopted at the State, District, Taluk and Gram

3.3       Conceptualization of the Study

A unique opportunity existed in Karnataka to study three different externally assisted and
Government sponsored projects ofRural Water Supply and Sanitation which hav~ certain
unique features and are administered through special organisational arrangements.
Although the objectives of the three projects are essentially the same, there are variations
in the project design, administrative and management structure, programme
implementation strategies and policies. In contrast to this, the project under the
Government Rural Water Supply schemes does not possess these and does not have a
sanitation component nor any community participation and hygiene education inputs.
Administratively, also there are no special features as it is implemented through the Public
Health Engineering Department. It is therefore, very interesting and highly useful to make
a comparative study of these different projects to understand as to what extent such
variations in the project design and implementation have contributed to achievement of the
objectives and to the sustainablity of the programme. To bring about sustainability and
behavioural change in matters related to protected water, water handling, waste disposal,
use of toilets and personal hygiene is not easy in the socio-cultural context of the rural
population.

The study is focused on the innovative features of these projects like community
participation, cost sharing, institutional development, use of non-governmental
Organisation and consultants to perform certain functions, and project supported
administrative structure, it provides an opportunity to examine how these special features
contributed to the development of programme, what were the problems in implementation
and management of these innovative features. Some assumptions are implicit. For
instance, participation of NGO is expected to increase community mobilization and
participation, cost sharing is expected to generate greater commitment to programme
activities, increased funds for O&M, involvement of women is expected to contribute
greater utilization of services provided and so on. This study provides an opportunity to
examine whether these assumptions are valid. It will also help to know what factors
limited the realization of the full potential of such innovative measures in the project
organizations and administration and also in the community, so that correctives measures
can be undertaken. In fact, these underlying assumptions of the innovative strategies and
policies can be formally stated as hypothesis, a few which are indicated below:

â¢     given the same objectives, certain administrative structures and processes are better
      suited to the realization ofthe objectives of the project
â¢     other things being equal, use of non-governmental Organisation and consultants has a
      great influenceÂ· on community participation and development of community
      responsibilities for the facilities created
â¢     community cost sharing prompted greater commitment to programme activities and
      facilities created
â¢     community mobilization, participation, combined with health education would g1ve
      better results than health education input alone




                                             6
Though the study does not propose to test such hypotheses, such formal statement of
them help in directing the study and the nature of data to be collected.

The core objectives of these projects have been to promote health behaviour and
sustainable institutional.dev:elopment. They also emphasize replicable methodologies. The
programme variables and the community factors that contribute towards the achievement
of these goals were examined in the study.

3.4       Methodology

As reflected in the statement of objectives, it is a two dimensional study covering
technical, financial and management aspects on the one side, behaviour and community
related aspects on the other side. Therefore, the study was carried out in two phases and
the methodology adopted for each phase is described below:

a.        Study of Technical, Financial and Management Aspects

â¢     Data was collected from published documents, pmject reports and mission reports of
      pilot studies relating to three externally      supported projects, namely Danida,
      Netherlands and the World Bank
â¢     Consultations and discussions were held with the Donors and the professional staff of
      the Project Planning and Monitoring Unit to fully understand the details of the project,
      similarities and differences
â¢     Two types of instruments were developed, one covering the technical engineering and
      financial aspects and the other management and implementation aspects. They were
      revised in consultation with donors and the officials of the Project Planning and
      Monitoring Unit
â¢     Data was collected through the schedule and by personal interview wherever possible
      from officials and professional staff at the State, District and peripheral levels in
      respect of all the 4 projects under study. Interviews were also held with donor
      Organisation and non-governmental organizations involved in the projects

b.        Study ofBehavioural and Community Aspects

â¢     Two types of instruments were developed, field tested and finalised for this study - one
      on household survey and the other on village level data. The household survey covered
      information on health and hygiene behaviour (KAP), the village level data related to
      community participation, working of the village water and sanitation committees, cost
      sharing and willingness to take care of operation and maintenance of water supply and
      sanitation facilities. Village observation data was used as a Sl!pplement to these data
      sources.
â¢     Data was collected from 5 villages from each of the 3 externally projects and from the
      Government project. The criteria for selection of villages was that most of the project
      works should have been completed in these villages so that the impact can be assessed.
      In respect of selection of households for survey a systematic sampling procedure was


                                               7
      used after classifying the households on income basis. 20 households were selected
      from each of the project villages chosen. Therefore, the total number of respondents
      were 100 per project or 400 from all the project studied.

3.5      Data Analysis

The data collected from the households was in the form of pre-coded schedules and could
be subjected to cross-classification and analysis. Project-wise comparisons were made on
important dimensions. Data collected through focus interviews with members of the local
Panchayat and village water and sanitation committee was mostly qualitative and could
only be narrated to give full picture of the dynamics involved.

3.6      Preparation of the Study Report

The study was conducted by a team of three specialists, an environmental engineer, a
management specialist and a behvioural scientist. Each specialist has contributed in their
respective areas and also jointly as a team for the preparation of the report. A comparative
analysis and discussions on major issues is presented, keeping in view the study objectives
and comments and suggestions offered by several experts during presentation of the draft
report on 22.4.98, additional information has been gathered and referred in the report as
appropriate.

4.      COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE PROJECTS

The three externally assisted Integrated Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Projects and the
Government sponsored projects are compared with regard to project objectives, components,
project organisation and implementation, levels of service, selection criteria and such other
relevant dimensions. The enclosed statements present the details. Even though the overall
objectives are similar there are notable differences in respect of the dimensions mentioned
above. All the projects also seem to emphasise development of replicable methodologies,
development of local institutions in taking care of water supply and sanitation programmes,
sustainability of the institutions, community participation and cost-sharing. These aspects areÂ·
not much emphasised in the Government programmes.

An examination of the general objectives of the project as given in Table 1 indicate that they
are identifical across all the projects though in terms of number, the Danida Project had 5
general objectives, the Netherlands project 4, the World Bank had 3 and the Government
project had 2, a close examination of the statement of objectives stated in the Danida project
are also implicit in the other projects.

A critical examination of the project components given in Table II, show certain similarities
and differences among the 4 projects. In relation to water component, the World Bank project
has given importance to rehabilitation of existing water supply systems and water quality
monitoring which is very essential. The Netherlands project also provided for the same.
Danida project carried out water quality testing in the three taluks and given greater
importance to this aspect in its revised project for the districts. Institutional development,
community participation, involvement of women etc. are the components missing in the
Government programme.

As far as project design is concerned, it has been observed that no major deviation has been
made in any of the projects. However, there were few incidences of villages in the World Bank
schemes which subsequently changed the design of water projects. This situation could have
been avoided had the conceptual designs were prepared in consultation with the conunittees. It
may be noted that the conceptual designs are prepared by consulting engineers in the World
Bank and Netherlands projects.

There have been no major deviations as far as Danida project is concerned.

Cost sharing by the conununity for environmental sanitation is an important support
component in World Bank project which is about 30% ofthe cost. Danida project envisages
30% cost sharing for household latrines. There is no cost sharing for either water or
environmental sanitation components in the Netherlands and Govel1111Jent projects. However,
"shramdan" (contribution of labour) and materials have been solicited in the Netherlands
project. Thus there is no uniform rate of cost-sharing by community.

The criteria for selection of villages emphasises scarcity of water (less than 40 lpcd) as the
main criteria. However, it is noteworthy that in all programmes, emphasis is also placed on
quality of drinking water. (Table III gives details on this aspect).

As far as conununity participation is concerned, the World Bank has engaged NGOs, while in

                                              9
Netherlands project the funding agency has employed its own personnel. The Danida took the
help of teachers for mobilising community. There is no such component in Government
programme.
                                                                                .
In view of the extreme importance given to community participation and involvement of
women, uniform approach may be worked out for all projects.

A comparison of the project cost reveals that the Government spends a maximum of 78% for
water supply, Netherlands 68.6%, World Bank 57% and Danida 34% of the outlay. For the
sanitation projects, the Government spends 22%, Netherlands 15. 7%, World Bank 24% and
Danida with a higher outlay of35%. However, health education activities do not get adequate
allocation and there is an imperative need to increase the inputs in this area to sustain
behavioural change. While all the Externally supported aided projects have allocation for
project support (including institutional development), there is no such input in Government
programme (Table 4.4).

5. INSTITUTIONAL SET UP AND FINANCE MECHANISMS

5.1 Institutional Framework

The institutional and organization framework in the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector
is rather complex as the political, administrative and technical responsibilities in this sector
have undergone major changes with the enactment of the Karnataka Panchayat Raj Act 1993.
Primarily this has resulted in the transfer of the responsibility for Rural Development in general
and water supply and sanitation in particular to the respective districts in the state. The district
administration consists of various departments covering all areas of rural development such as
health, education, women and child development etc. While most development activities are
handled directly by respective departments, the Panchayat Raj Act 1993 defined and delegated
specific functions and responsibilities to the Taluka and Grama Panchayats, the most important
being the delegation of operation and maintenance responsibilities for the Rural Water Supply
and Sanitation to the Gram Panchayat.

The Secretary Rural Development and Panchayat Raj (RD&PR) is responsible for all the
development programmes in the state including rural wateF supply and sanitation programme
implemented by the Government and the ESAs. The Zila Panchayats come under the
administrative control ofthe secretary, RD&PR and he has an important role as inter-sectoral
coordinator for rural development programmes.

To facilitate speedy implementation of the programmes, there is a Public Health Engineering
Department (PHED) headed by an Engineer-in-Chief The PHED, being the technical wing of
RD&PR, consolidates, reviews and recommends on all rural water supply and sanitation plans
submitted by the respective Zila Panchayats and is responsible for overall monitoring and
technical support to the ZP engineering divisions. It may be noted that all the engineering staff
ofPHED down to the GP level are on deputation from the Public Works and Irrigation
Departments as there is no separate cadre at present. This reflects greatly in their sense of
belonging and commitment to the water supply and sanitation programmes, barring a few
exceptions. This is an important aspect to be considered when we discuss institution building.
Creation of a separate cadre exclusively for PHED will be most beneficial.

The Danida project is having a P AG at the state level supported by separate sub-division in 3
taluks working as Field Implementation Cells. Similarly the Netherlands has a Project Support
Unit (PSU) at the state level manned by an expatriate technical expert and a community
development expert in Bangalore. At the district level, DPUs headed by District Project
Advisor is in position in the two districts ofDharwad and Bijapur.

For all the ESA water supply projects the Nodal agency is Project PJanning and Monitoring
Unit under the Ministry of Rural Development and Panchayat Raj of GOK. This is headed
by an lAS officer of Additional Secretary level supported by a Deputy Secretary, a
Superintending Engineer, Social Scientist, Health and Hygiene Expert, Finance/Accounting
and other supporting staff of Assistant Engineers, and office secretarial staff This unit is the
link between the RDPR/GOK and EiC PHED for Hard Ware aspects, link between Health
department and Department of Women and Child Development for Soft Ware aspects of
 the programme. This is also the link between the GOK and the community through
CEOs of ZPs. The unit is responsible for planning, implementation, monitoring of the

                                                15
programmes of all externally aided Bi-lateral programmes. There are Steering committees and
Empowered committees for decision making on policy matters. There are also separate
coordinating committees at district level for all programmes for considering policy issues.
The Institutional set up for implementation of ESA water supply proje~ts and the
government project are .indicated in the four accompanying charts (Charts 5-1 to 5-4)

5.2     Implementation Procedure

Before the actual implementation process/start of works on site the schemes pre-require

1.     Administrative approval
2.     Technical sanction
3.     Acceptance of tenders

In case of bilateral programmes no separate administrative approvals are considered
necessary other than the agreements between the donor and the recipient governments. But
in case of centrally sponsored and state sponsored schemes budget allocations should have
been made before administrative approvals can be issued separately by the competent
authorities based on the powers delegated to the various officers for the purpose. Technical
sanctions are necessary to the estimates prepared on the basis of designs, drawings before
calling for tenders. This is a certificate of the competent engineerauthority to the correctness
of the designs technically and completion of the works within the estimated costs. Tenders
received from qualified contractors are evaluated, accepted and work order issued
followed by execution of an agreement between the contractor and the executive
engineer before the actual work can start on the ground. A knowledge of various processing
 stages and powers of engineers for technical sanctions and acceptance of tenders is
necessary for this type of comparative study and are indicated in charts and tables (Charts 5-5
and 5-6 and Table 2).

All the ESA programmes aim at demand driven sustainable alternative delivery systems of
 water supply and environmental sanitation works. The community participation right from
 the inception of the project right through source selection, 'technology options,
detailed designs, involvement during execution and supervision, commissioning, owning
the assets with a view of fund raising for operation and maintenance of the scheme for life
are stressed. The general information about the terms and conditions of the bilateral
funding agencies like amount of loan, dates of agreements/ commencement, terms of
giving loan, preconditions, targets, progress achieved so far, design aspects etc., are
tabulated and attached. On the overall the progress achieved in all the three externally
aided water supply projects is not as expected and very dismally falls short of expectations.
 In addition to the three ESA water supply programmes, for the sake of comparison, a
few centrally sponsored works which are executed as per the existing procedure of works of
 GOK were also studied.

5.3    Scope of the Works: Hard Ware

In all the three externally aided programmes in the hardware, water supply and sanitation
works are integrated. In addition to supply of water, under environmental sanitation,
works of construction of community and individual house hold latrines, washing plat-

                                              16
forms, cattle troughs, storm water drains and lane paving etc., are included. In the
Netherlands assisted programme construction of Anganwadi buildings and in Danida
programme afforestation, ground water recharge works etc., are added to the programmes
to provide a special feature to the programmes in bringing out an overall improvement in
the quality of life of the- villagers. In the central and state sponsored schemes the
environmental sanitation works are not integrated with water supply works and
community participation concepts are not being considered as part of the programmes. Table
1 shows the major features ofhardware of the three ESAs and Central/Government sponsored
schemes.

5.4    Powers of Engineers for Implementation Technical Sanctions

 The implementing powers of engineers are exercised mainly at three levels, depending upon
 the cost of the works. The Executive Engineer holds the key role of implementing the
works with the support of the Assistant Executive Engineers ,Assistant Engineers and Junior
 engineers and administrative and accounts staff of his division. He has limited powers of
 technical sanction and accepting tenders. He can technically sanction works costing
below Rs. 5 lakhs. These powers are adequate for only environmental sanitation works and
some hand pump schemes and not generally for MWS and PWS schemes. He is responsible
for preparation of all the schemes whether they come under his powers or powers of SE or
EiC and process them for sanctions to SE or EiC as the case may be. If the works are under
the powers of sanction of EiC they will be scrutinized by SE and further submitted to the
EiC for sanction/acceptance. Thus for all the schemes falling under the powers of EiC the
schemes have to be processed by EE and SE, as shown in the charts before they can be
sanctioned by the EiC. The SE can technically sanction works costing between Rs.5 lakhs
and Rs.20 lakhs. The Eic can issue technical sanctions up Rs.250 lakhs without getting the
clearance of State Technical Advisory Committee. The statements of above powers of
the engineer's are attached (Table 2). For the schemes coming under the technical sanction
powers of the EiC they are prepared by the EE, scrutinized by the SE and forwarded to the
EiC for further necessary processing by him. If there are any observations by the EiC on
the scheme which are quite common, the schemes will be referred back to SE, EE for
attending to the observations and resubmission. The file retraces back to EiC for
technical sanction after the observations are attended to by the SE/EE. There will be
considerable lapse of time in the process of submission/making observations/compliance
before the scheme gets the sanction from E.-i.-C. based on powers delegated to engineers.
These currently prevalent procedures and powers of engineers remain the same for all the
works of Govt. as well as the externally aided bi-lateral programmes. A review of the
powers of engineers in the context of implementation of bi-lateral schemes reveals
startling revelations on the impact of limited powers of engineers in timely completion of
programmes.

5.5    Cost of Schemes: Centrally Sponsored and Danida Schemes

The cost of the works sanctioned and put to tenders in case of centrally sponsored and
DANIDA schemes are all small. The DANIDA schemes were mostly rehabilitation I revival
 schemes of providing hand pumps with the exception of a few MWS and PWS schemes.
The cost of the schemes were all within the powers of SE/EE for technical sanctions and
acceptance of tenders and rarely came under the preview of the EiC. Hence the processing

                                           17
time was short. A summary table indicating some main differences in implementing
methodology of the schemes under various programmes is attached. (Table 3).

5.5.1   Danida and State/Central Schemes

Both the above programmes are implemented in the traditional way of implementation by
GOK according to the powers delegated to the engineers. The implementation is done in
 many cases departmentally eliminating the contractor and by employing labour on nominal
roll and supplying materials by the department itself The services of small contractors is
also utilised for executing the works on piece work basis. This substantially reduces the
over heads of the contractor and the completion costs will thus be lesser than those got
through regular tendering procedure.

5.5.2   World Bank Schemes

In the case of World Bank schemes the implementation is based on a slice as a unit for
the purposes of sanctions and accepting tenders. A slice consists a group of 10 to 15
villages. The estimated cost of the slice is beyond the powers of SE and as such the EiC is
required to sanction and accept the tenders. Due to the high cost of tendered works the
EMD to be deposited and the security amount which lies with the Govt. for a long time till
the completion ofthe works, are high beyond the capacity of local contractors who are used
to the traditional methods of contracting and they are not coming forward to offer their
tenders. Only the big contractors of neighbouring states and having their base at distances
from the site of works are quoting for the works. Hence the tender % ages are very high.
Some times they are as high as 25 to 40 % over estimated costs and these tenders are to be
accepted only by the Empowered Committee.

5.5.3   Netherlands Assisted Schemes

Under this programme the implementation of works has just started even though they were
supposed to have been completed by mid June 1993. There is no scheme which is likely to be
commissioned before end 1998.            There is not much difference in implementation
methodologies from the World Bank schemes and Netherlands assisted schemes. In
Netherlands assisted programme the unit considered for purposes of sanctions and tendering
 is a package consisting of 10 to 25 villages.

5.6     Role of Consultants in the Bi-lateral Programmes

The DANIDA and Central/State sponsored schemes do not have consultants. All the
act1v1t1es required for implementation of the scheme right from the investigations,
topographical surveys, detailed designs, estimating and drawings, preparation of tender
documents, supervision of works are carried out byÂ· the departmental staff in the
traditional way. In the World Bank and Netherlands assisted programmes the role of the
consultants is very significant. The concept of consultants for various activities that are
 normally carried out by the departmental staff is new to government works.




                                            18
5. 7    Methodology of Estimating in PHED

The methodology followed in estimating in the department has a contributory role in the
delays in implementation of the bi-lateral programmes and overall completion cost of the
schemes and hence it is _.discussed here. The departmental method of estimation is based
on Schedule of RateÂ·s (SR) that is supposed to be updated year after year. The rates for
various items of work included in the SR are based on certain assumptions. The rates are
applicable for small works where the assumptions hold good. For example in the SR it is
assumed that the materials like cement, steel, and pipes which are major material inputs into
the works are supplied to the contractors free of cost for fixing or supplied to him at
departmental issue rates which are generally lower than the market rates. The contractor is
not required to invest on purchase of materials. His tenders will virtually be for labour
portions only. His tender% age will naturally be lower than the other tenders whereas the
contractor in World Bank and Netherlands programme is required to buy materials from the
market and he is required to quote for composite rate for both materials and labour.
Another aspect of defects correction is not contemplated while preparing the SR. Estimates
based on SR are therefore not realistic estimates for comparison of either tenders or
completed cost ofthe works.

5. 8   Selection Process of Contractors

In view of the small tender costs in DANIDA and Centrally sponsored schemes mostly the
local contractors are participating in the tendering process. Class two or three contractors
are eligible for tendering. Mostly the schemes are single village schemes and they are also
split into a numbe; of tenders covering various components of the whole work. In the case of
World Bank and Netherlands programmes because of the higher tender costs only class one
and above contractors are eligible to submit tenders. Splitting u'p of the work for the sake of
making several tenders is not at all permitted. The work is to be carried out as if it is aÂ·
turn-key project (less designs).        This ensures that the          contractor feels     the
responsibility of completing all the components of the work and is duty bound to
commission the scheme and hand over and also attends to the post commission defects
corrections. This calls for a contractor who has resources to handle not only the high cost
of the tenders but also experienced in dealing all types of water supply related works of
drilling tube wells, civil works, over head storage reservoirs, treatment units, electrical
and mechanical works and pipe laying etc., Only the big contractors mostly from outside the
state are participating in the tendering process. Their overheads are very high and they load
 all such expenditure on the tender. . The tender % ages are substantially higher than those
quoted by the local contractors. The methodology used for selection of various consultants is
also by tendering. The concept of utilizing consultants for activities is new to the
government. There appears to be limited number of experienced consultants in the field.
Even if available some of them are based outside the state. This leads to the delays in
selecting and appointment of consultants and increase in completion costs of the schemes.

5. 9   Review of Powers of Engineers for Issue of Technical Sanctions and Acceptance
       of Tenders

The existing cost related powers of the engineers in the context of rural scenano and
simple standardized types of works and the rigid time-bound bi-lateral programmes, need

                                              19
critical review. An SE can sanction a full fledged water supply scheme of a village at a cost of
 Rs.20 lakhs. If another identical scheme is there in his own jurisdiction in a different
village, by clubbing the two schemes together for purposes of sanctions and acceptance of
tenders he looses the powers just only on the grounds of financial considerations. He has
powers as long as a single village is concerned but has no powers to club and group a few
identical villages. This logic needs to be reviewed as a special case to implement the time
bound bi-lateral schemes ifthe time factor is of importance.

With the existing powers an SE can implement and complete a single village scheme in all
respects within his own powers. When large number of villages are involved in a programme
and if it is proposed to have all single village schemes he has to conclude as many contracts as
the number of villages which really is an unmanageable task and cumbersome to deal with so
many contracts in hand.

5.10    Effect of Time Over-runs on the Programme

Not adhering to the time schedules will have very undesirable effects on the programme. First
of all the villagers are disappointed and their long cherished goal will be postponed. They
become very aggressive and hostile to the staff and village community development workers.
 This is particularly so when they have contributed some thing to the project how ever
small it may be. If the implementation is delayed the cost of the scheme will go up due to
the escalation in cost of material and labour inputs. This automatically results in cost over-
runs and imbalance of budgets of both donor and recipient governments. The
proposed physical targets cannot be met with. The amounts of loans/grants will become
insufficient to meet the 100 % physical targets. The overheads on both the governments
also go up.

Finally all the above factors contribute to the increase in the cost of water per cu.m to be
borne by the community. This may affect the enthusiasm of the community to own and
maintain the assets on a long term and thus sustainability of the programme may be
adversely effected.

5.11   Powers of Engineers and Escalation in Prices

The delegation of powers to engineers for various activities connected with implementation of
 works like technical sanctions, acceptance oftenders etc., by government are required to
be revised more frequently than being done presently. The escalation in prices of
various inputs of materials and labour is a constant and continuous phenomenon. The SRs
are revised once in a year mostly upward. With every revision of SR, the powers delegated to
the engineers goes on decreasing or eroded. As the cost of works increases, unless there is a
 matching increase in the delegated powers, the engineer's powers of sanctioning and
acceptance of tenders gets reduced, as the same work will cost more after a lapse of time
and it requires to be dealt with by next higher engineering authority. To maintain the
effectiveness of the delegated powers in a real sense there should be a system of automatically
increasing the powers of delegation with revision of SR.




                                              20
5.12    Replicability and Sustainability of the Systems

There are no systems as at present which have been completely handed over for
management, operation and maintenance to the community and where the community has
accepted the responsibility_ .and running the schemes out of their own resources for sufficiently
                      a
long time at least for period of not less than one financial year satisfactorily when it can be
inferred that the system is sustainable. There is no scheme under the Netherlands
assisted programme which can be commissioned before the middle of 1999. In the World
Bank pilot schemes which are supposed to have been completed and handed over there is no
feed back about the community having run the system for a fairly long period satisfactorily,
except in the case of some pilot villages where community provided contribution for repairing
burnt motor and other O&M expenses.

As far as the Danida project is concerned, the completion report of February 1997 revealed
that though the project did develop and try out a number of methods/approaches to be
replicated (e.g. use of PRA techniques, demand driven approach, introduction of household
defluoridation etc.) it did not regretfully, contribute to a situation in which such
methods/approaches can effectively be replicated, let alone be sustained within the existing
government structures.

With regard to sustainability of the systems, it may be noted that the operation and
maintenance costs will be more in case of piped water supply schemes due the power
charges to be met than in case of hand pumps where the maintenance charges are minimal. It
is appropriate to consider a piped water supply scheme for studying the sustainability of the
 system where the community has not fallen into arrears of paymet1t of electricity charges
and paying the staff salaries regularly and the community is satisfied with the service of
the village committee with respect to the quality and quantity of water supplied.

The village water supply and sanitation committees (VWSCs) were not so far legalized to
collect the water charges and run the systems. The recent amendment to the Panchayat Raj
Act empowers the village committee for constitution of sub committees for maintaining the
amenities ofwater supply and sanitation. It has not been tried out yet in the field. However
even if the sub committees are formed data on their continued performance is not available
at present.

Under the above circumstances it is too early to evaluate the sustainability of the systems
without having them put on a field trial for atleast some time. It is considered that the
evaluation can be taken up after at least 50 % of the villages have been in operation by the
village communities for about one year after taking over the for maintenance and operation
aspects.

The GOK should issue guidelines about the implementation of the Amendment to the
Panchayat Raj Act immediately and monitor the operation and maintenance of the systems
by the village committees.

However it is opined that cost sharing of the 0 & M by villagers will bring in good
response towards sustainability of the systems.

6.      COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION, INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
        AND COST SHARING

6.1     Introduction

There is a lot of evidence to show that participation of the beneficiaries and other
organizations and social groups in the project activities related to water supply and
sanitation is very essential to achieve the goals of sustained behavioural change,
institutional inputs and activities. The evidence summarized from the pilot studies under
the World Bank supported project and the experience gained on the I Phase of the Danida
supported project reinforce the same conclusions.

Participation of the community in all the phases of project activities right from the
planning and designing stage, though project monitoring and evaluation help to establish a
close fit between the technical and scientific requirements of the project activities and the
socio-cultural demands of the community so that adaptation becomes easy. The felt needs
of the community and other socio-cultural and economic dimensions can be taken into
consideration and suitable modifications can be introduced through such interactions.
Unless this is done, there is little chance that the facilities created will be adequately used.
The Danida supported project has emphasized this point in the project completion report.

Realising the importance of active community participation for the success of the project,
cost-sharing has been introduced under the World Bank supported project. Such
contribution is expected to promote active participation of the members of the community
in project activities and develop a sense of ownership and responsibility in project
activities and services. However, experience during the pilot phase has shown that people
will be willing to contribute if they are involved right from the planning stage in the project
activities and perceive that their ideas and suggestions are incorporated to the extent
possible.

Participation becomes more meaningful and effective when there is a shared responsibility
between the community and the project staff. This was the aim in both the Netherlands
supported project and the World Bank supported project when an agreement was signed
between the village water and sanitation committee and the project authorities specifying
the roles and responsibilities of parties concerned.

These committees provided the much needed link between the project staff and the
community. It was expected that these committees will take major responsibility for
community mobilization, health and hygiene education, demand creation and promote
responsibilities for cost sharing and operation and maintenance of facilities created under
the project. This institution was expected to be nurtured and developed by the project staff
through training, technical and supervisory support by the project staff through their own
local staff (TPMOs as in the Netherlands project or through non-government
organizations (NGOs) under the World Bank Supported project).




                                              22
Community participation efforts should not be restricted to the involvement of the
beneficiaries only. Informal and interested leaders and other social welfare and cultural
organizations can make significant contributions to programme development and its
sustainability. For instance, in the World 'Bank supported project the existing Mahila
Mandals in A. Nagathiha!U, Yelasangi and Daginakatte were activised and utilised to
provide for villages greater participation of women in the project (see status study report
June 1997 - page 26). In the same way, youth organizations can be mobilized to bring
social pressures on the community in keeping the village clean. Informal and influential
leaders can be mobilized and used in educational programme to change attitudes and
practices. Satisfied adopters of household toilets can help in demand creation and upkeep
of the toilets.

Community participation levels and quality can be promoted by inter-sectoral approach.
The peripheral level staff of several departments like education, health and social welfare
were actively involved in community participation and education in the Danida supported
programme. It was possible to attend some the felt needs of the community through the
programmes of these departments. This will strengthen the motivational base for
participation. The rapport and skills of the personnel of these departments would help to
promote the credibility ofthe project.

6.2     Community Participation: A Project-wise Comparison

Regarding community participation, data clearly shows that there is substantial difference
between the World Bank and the Netherlands project. Even though clear cut guidelines
have been given by the Government of Karnataka about community participation exercises
to be carried out in the World Bank project area especially the members of the village and
water sanitation committees have reported that they are not consulted in construction of
water supply and other facilities. Perhaps greater concentration on collection of cash
contributions has diluted efforts in obtaining active participation of people in the World
Bank project.

In both the projects, participation of women has been low. Even the few women enrolledÂ·
as members of the village, water and sanitation committee and were present during the
discussion were very passive leaving all talking to the male members.

Under utilization of facilities created such as washing places and cattle troughs or dustbins Â·
reflects lack of consultation with the users especially women. For instance washing slabs
are set at a distance from the water point with the idea of preventing excessive use of
water and waste water stagnation. The women who do the washing preferred these were
located very close to the water points. Consequently, they are .not using the facility,
instead they are putting some stones near the source of water and using it for washing.
Result has been wastewater accumulation in many water collection points.

1994. The committee meets once in 3 months and takes decision after discussions of
issues. The committee is able to obtain adequate involvement of the communifJ! in project
activities. Sanitation facilities are created according to their priority. They suggest
adequate inter-departmental coordination and avoiding tramfer ofproject staff


It was very clear that there was a greater participation and decision making by the people
in the type of drainage system they needed in the Netherlands project than in the World
Bank project. Consequently they demanded and got underground drainage while the
people in the other project complained about not having such a system. There was a
greater demand for completion of drainage work in the World Bank project. Not only they
were concerned about water stagnation in many places because of poor drainage but also
demanded completion of remaining works for which they have paid. Contribution seems to
have generated greater concern for the qualitative and timely services.

In Kuduru, the village water and sanitation committee was formed during 1994-95 and it
consists of 20 members which includes 5 ji-om SC and 5 women. The committee was
selected in one ~~the meetings of the Gram Sabha. The members were given training on
project activities and the responsibility of the committee. It meets very often special(v
when construction works are to be reviewed. The committee maintains a record of the
resolution adopted and decisions taken. The committee has opened an account and
maintains it.

There were complaints that the engineers concerned with the implementation did not
consult them on implementation process and procedures.

People in the above two villages and also in other village of the two projects complained
about lack of coordination between the engineering staff and staff of the social wing.

One of the factors affecting community participation is the delay in implementation of
water supply. The delays cause loss of interest and confidence of people in programme
activities.

It may be of interest to note how the findings of this study compare with findings of the
study conducted by Srinivas Rao (1996) on Community participation. He found that users
awareness as to who has to take care of the functions of operation and maintenance and
users perception of ownership were high in the Netherlands and the World Bank
supported projects as compared to the Government and the Danida supported schemes.
The weighted average of the ranking on the above two measures showed the Netherlands
project in the first place and the World Bank scheme in the second, the Danida scheme got
the third place and the Government scheme the fourth place.




                                           24
Given the fact that both the projects (Netherlands and World Bank) had given adequate
importance to community participation, why is this difference? It may be noted that in the
Netherlands project, there was greater involvement of the Donor Organisation in the
community participation, whereas this was m.anaged by the Non-government Organisation
(NGO), under the World Bank Project. Further, well trained staff (TPMOs) were
responsible for theÂ·community participation activity under the Netherlands project. They
were guided and supervised by the District Project Units. The Non-governmental
Organizations under the World Bank project may not be having the same competence as
reported by the officers of the Project Planning and Monitoring Unit during the interview.

6.3     Village Water ami Sanitation Committee

As can be seen from the narrative account of the discussions held with the members of the
committee in five villages of each of the two projects, constitution and functioning of the
committees appeared to be much better in the Netherlands project villages than in the
World Bank Project villages. There is greater representation of women and weaker
sections and more active involvement of the committee in planning and reviewing
technical and engineering works of the project, greater enthusiasm to have more
orientation session to the members. They identified several weak points in the
implementation of the programme such as lack of coordination between technical and
community related activity, inadequate funds for community activities, lack of
coordination with other departmental functionaries at the village level etc.

 Chandakavadi village under the World Bank assisted project was selected for
augmentation of existing ZP water supply. The village water and sanitation committee
was formed in 1995 with 18 members and it has 12 women members. There is a strong
feeling among the members that the engineers and contractors are by-passing them. They
are not consulted at the stage of design, location offacilities, type of pipes to be laid etc.
 The PVC pipes which are laid at the depth of about I feet have broken frequently,
leakages are common site everywhere. The committee has requested for corrective action
in a meeting withEE and Contractors but this has not taken place so jar.

There is evidence of generating active involvement of the committee in the Netherlands
project in selection of sites, setting up of priorities, supply of raw materials and generating
commitment to the programme from the community. That underground drainage was
insisted by the people is an evidence of their active participation. Similarly, they prevailed
and got the Anganwadi buildings modified. In one village, they were against cluster based
water supply systems, preferred village based system.

The committees are constituted through a meeting of the Gram Sabha. They meet at
regular intervals and leave a record books for minutes. However, the participation of
women is not adequate and needs to be improved.




                                              25
Arekuratti village under the Netherland<; project has a village committee consisting of 28
members of which 15 are women. Members are given orientation training and are well
aware of their functions. The committee meets once in 6 months to discuss .issues and
decisions are taken by consensus. There is good participation by the people in project
activities, their ideas are considered and incmporated. It is because of their pressure
underground drainage was constructed in the village. The committee feels more health
education activities are needed.

In the World Bank Project area also the committee is constituted to give representation to
all sections of the community, maintains a minutes book. However, the working
relationship with project personnel is strained. They (the committee members) could not
give enough proof about active involvement of the community and how their ideas
influenced the implementation process. Further, the subsidy amount due to beneficiaries
for construction of toilets is often diverted and shown as people's contribution to
environmental sanitation works. This was reported by members of the committee in
Kabballi and Chandakavadi. This problem did not arise in the Netherlands project areas,
because no money was sought as contributions but only voluntary labour (Shramdan) and
materials.

6.4     Institutional Development

Regarding the question of developing capacity of the committee to take care of operation
and maintenance of water supply and sanitation works the questions were hypothetical and
answers guess work. In most villages the water supply and sanitation is still the
responsibility of the local Panchayat. The committee is currently attending to
environmental sanitation works and construction of household toilets. The water supply
projects are often launched to supplement available inadequate water. When water is
pooled from new and old sources and supplied, the question of sharing water tariff
required further examination.

In some villages, there is congenial and harmonious relationship between committee and
the Panchayat, in others the relationship is under stress. Majority of committees
interviewed feel that ultimately the Panchayat should take over responsibilities under the
project. In this context it is important to note that by recent amendment to the Panchayat
Act the Government of Karnataka has provided for establishment of a committee to take
care of certain functions and invest the committee with suitable powers as may be
necessary and expedient for the fulfillment of the purposes (see 6.A "Other
Committees/Karnataka Panchayat Raj (Third Amendment) Bill 1997 which is passed by
both legislatures).

The members who argued for the merger of the committees with the Panchayat, cited two
important reasons (1) Availability ofwider resources with the Panchayat and (2) its legal
status to increase taxes if funds are not sufficient; Those who are for independent
existence of the committee felt that the Panchayat is concerned with the group of villages


                                           26
and therefore may not give specific attention to each village and also political pressures
may influence the decisions of the Panchayat.

 The Chairman of the Committee in Kudau village under the World Bank supported
project desires that the- _committee should be independent~~ the
                                                              .
                                                                 Panchayat. In his view,
 the Panchayat which inclz(des other villages may not give adequate attention to this
village and political pressures may operate on the Panchayat with regard to its
functioning

Kyathanahalli under the World Bank Assisted Project has a village committee consisting
of 18 members elected through Gram Sabha. None of the members are from weaker
sections and there are five women members. The NGO (MYRADA) is helping the
committee in educating the public. The village was selected to augment the existing water
supply and people are able to get 60 lpcd of water. As the old system and the new water
supply are pooled together and supplied, it faces problem in collecting water tar(ff
separatelyfor the project.

A much stronger case can be made for concentrating on the development of local
Panchayat to take care of this sector. Improvement of health status of the population
demands inter-sectoral coordination especially among departments of Agriculture,
Horticulture, Education, Women and Child Development with Health Department as a
nodal agency to coordinate. Panchayat has a responsibility for total development of the
village under its purview. Village level planning should take into consideration the sector
development also.

7.      CHANGES IN HEALTH AND HYGIENE BEHAVIOUR

7.1     Introduction

A comparison of the behavioural changes as a result of the implementation of these
projects is to be made as per Terms of Reference. An attempt has been made to bring out
several observations in this regard, for all the projects and they are explained below:

A large majority of the respondents in the project villages have shifted from traditional
unprotected water source like wells, tanks and rivers, to protected source of water
provided. However, among the major reasons for the shift are proximity of the source,
availability of adequate quantity of water and suitability for drinking by which they mean
sweetness of water and it suitability for cooking. Health reasons are cited only by about 11
to 12% of respondents in Danida and World Bank projects respectively and by less than
2.5% in the Government projects. This question was not asked in the Netherlands project
area as water supply was not yet given.

There is a consistent decline in the time taken to fetch water as between pre- and post-
project situations across all the four projects which had a water supply component but
reports on time saved are not uniform, roughly 30-45 minutes are saved in time investment
in this job.

Estimates of quantity of water in terms of !peds were found to be rather unreliable
showing no consistent pattern across the projects. As adequate quantity of water is
available in the post-project period, both consumption and wastage are found to be high.
Even under conditions of abundance of water as in the World Bank and Government
Project areas. Consumption around 44-48 !peds indicates the norm set by the Government
is realistic.

Purpose

Not much change has occurred in handling of drinking water across all the projects. Most
of the respondents considered the water now provided as protected and therefore no need
to take care in water handling practices. No significant changes have occurred in bathing
practices and also ablution practices.



                                            28
Household data and observations indicate that safe disposal of household water is not
practiced across all the project villages. Efforts to promote safe disposal appear to be
weak. Consequently, lanes behind the houses are in very bad condition with stagnated
water.

Generally, across the projects, the facilities provided for safe disposal of household waste
are not in use as also cattle troughs and washing platforms.

If knowledge of diseases caused by contaminated water and bad surroundings is taken as
an indicator of sanitation and hygiene education, Netherlands, World Bank and Danida
villages appear in that order while the Government project villages take the fourth place.

With regard to source of information that played a major part in imparting knowledge,
interpersonal communication seems to have done better than mass media. Among the
inter-personal media, staff of the Health Department, Anganwadi Worker and the project
staff appear in that order of importance. Teachers seem to have done fairly well in Danida
project. In case of mass media, radio and television appear to play a major role. Folk
programmes have played a major role in Danida project .area.

With regard to number of household toilets promoted, Netherlands, World Bank and
Danida projects appear in that order. With regard to usage (all members of the family
making use of the toilet) the villages under the World Bank and Netherlands Project are
better compared to villages ofDanida project in the usage pattern.

7.2     Household Toilets Constructed and in Use

It is seen that the number of toilets available have increased across all the projects in the
post-project period.

More than the increase in the number of toilets, the usage rate is important. The level of
motivation for use is expected to be higher in households where latrines were constructed
at their own cost. In project constructions, the usage is related partly to the educational
inputs and partly to other factors. Non-availability of space for open air defecation or long
distances one has to walk for this may be one determining factor. Educational and
economic levels for the households and their extensive urban contact may be another
source of influence.

The use of the toilet (which is a desirable goal) has increased during the post-project
period in a notable way in the World Bank and the Netherlands Project areas. The increase
in respect ofDanida and Government project villages is minimum.

In the Netherlands group of villages, out of 75 households, who had toilets in 16 (22%)
households they were not in use. The major reasons for non-use of toilets are incomplete
construction (without super structure) and defective construction.

While discussing the usage of toilet, it is important to note that by and large men and
children do not use toilet as much as women. Men go out for agricultural and other
activities where they attend to nature calls, while children are considered rather differently
than men. There is greater tolerance for defecation by children and they are allowed to sit
in and around the house or in a garbage pit. Therefore, a family centered education and
motivation is needed to promote the use of toilets by all members and also to focus the
hazards of children faeces.



                                              30
Health education strategies and methods should be adapted to the field situation and the
nature of the problem involved. Under conditions when the behaviour of all the members
of the household has to be changed as in the. case of use of toilets and changes in personal
hygiene a Family Centered Education Strategy appears to be appropriate.

In a field experiment on promotion of use of toilets, Health Education staff in the project
adopted certain facilities for intensive education and motivation involving all the
members of the family and a variety of educational aids and group discussions method
on why toilets should be used by evetybody at home. These educational sessions were
conducted usually in the afternoons when most of the members were at home. An
experienced Health Educator supervises these sessions.

Even though the families were being motivated to use pay and use system of toilets, the
results were remarkable. A comparison between the baseline conducted in March 1983
and final evaluation in May 1986 showed that while 84% of males, 54% offemales and
68% of children in these families were practicing open air defecation at the beginning;
only 35% of males, 30% females, 42% children continued Â·this habit, the rest having
shifted to use of toilets provided after payinf{ a token fee of I 0 paise.

8.         INSTITUTIONAL SUSTAINABILITY

8.1        Recent Developments

Under the institution building for the sustainability of the programme, one of the recent
developments is the creation of KAS officer in the rank of Deputy Secretary in all the
World Bank Districts to coordinate the various technical and social aspects of the
programme. It has been reported that the inter-sectoral coordination has greatly improved
after the KAS officer has taken charge. Meetings are held regularly with the personnel
from various development departments such as Health, Women and Child Development,
Education, etc. in addition to the Engineering staff. This is indeed the positive trend and
when carried further to the village level, it has resulted in horizontal coordination and
inculcation of team spirit among the functionaries at the lower levels. The grassroot level
functionaries have therefore a better understanding about their roles and responsibilities.
Similar approach is recommended for the Government and other programmes also for
better results.

8.2        Elements to be included in Government Programmes

The following elements should be included in the Govt. programmes and may be
considered by RG&WNM/GOI/State Government for implementation.

1. Community participation in health education should be introduced. It has been noted
   that the villagers do not take any active role in planning etc. if they are denied
   participation.
2. Similar to World Bank Project, every village should have a Village Water and
   Sanitation Committee (VWSC)
3. Inter-sectoral coordination should be insisted upon which is lacking at present in Govt.
   programmes
4. Contribution from the community may be solicited as in the case ofESA projects so as
   to give them the sense of ownership and to prepare them for taking over the O&M
   aspects. The study reveals that the people are willing to pay for water supply in
   preference to environmental sanitation and this is true with all the project (Govt. and
   ESA)

8.3        Training and Orientation

The importance of training to all the implementing staff and proper orientation to the
community need not be over-emphasised. The curriculum should be so devised that the
motivational aspects should be given prominence in addition to skill upgradation.

Training should be a continuous activity to sustain the programme. The method of training
using Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) techniques has been found to be very
rewarding. While the ESA projects are attempting to follow this method with some degree
of success, it is completely absent in Govt. programme.



                                           32
8.4        Mobility Support and Staff

One more aspect to be noted while we consider the institutional sustainability is the
mobility support and additional staffing for proper monitoring of the project. While the
ESA projects have addressed this programme to a great extent, govt. programmes are
found comparatively deficient in this regard.

8. 5       Role of Gram Panchayat

The role of Gram Panchayat is very crucial in the implementation of water supply and
sanitation schemes. The responsibility for operating and maintaining in the water supply
and sanitation systems has been given to Gram Panchayats.

8.6     Village Water and Sanitation Committee

In order to ensure smooth implementation and effective community participation in greater
measure, the World Bank and the Netherlands project envisaged establishment of village
water supply and sanitation committees (VWSCs) at village level. This committee
consisted of elected members and other influential persons from the village. NGOs are
actively involved in training and formulation of VWSCs to enlist community participation.
This committee did not have statutory recognition until recently and could not therefore
function effectively.

The Karnataka Panchayat Raj (Third amendment) Act 1997 empowered the Gram
Panchayats to appoint other committees for better functioning of various developmental
activities.

Section 61 A reads as follows:

1.     A Gram Panchayat may appoint one or more committees consisting of such
       members as it may decide for any purpose other than those specified in Section 61
       and may invest the committee so appointed with such powers and functions as may
       be necessary or expedient for the fulfillment of the purpose for which it is
       appointed

2.     The committee appointed under sub-section (1) shall be competent to co-opt in
       such manner as may be prescribed such of the residents of the Panchayat area
       The procedure of the committee shall be such as may be prescribed.

From the above, it is amply clear that village water and sanitation committee has become
statutory body of the Gram Panachayat.

Considering the pros and cons ofthe GP undertaking the O&M responsibilities for water
and sanitation programme, it is felt that this function can better be performed by the



                                           33
village water and sanitation committee as the members of these committees will be closer
to the people because of its village based nature. Field observations revealed that there is
greater awareness among the people about the importance of safe drinking water and
environmental sanitation whenever VWSCs have been formed and functioning. For
example in the government programmes, the GP are taking care ofthis aspect while in
World Bank and Netherlands project the VWSCs have been given the role. Field studies
have clearly demonstrated that the V\VSCs take better interest because of its exclusive
nature while the GP may not be able to give the kind of attention and priority owing to
other pressing demands. Hence, it is suggested that the formation ofVWSCs or village
Development Committee should be insisted in the Government Progammes also.

The sustainability of the programmes really depend on the capacity of the VWSCs to
undertake operation, maintenance, and management of the systems. This is made more
difficult because of various factors viz.

A      There were delays in starting in the implementation even where the major part of
       the people's contribution was mobilized. This had negative impact on
       transparencies.
B.     Though the agreement with the village committee states that they have a role in
       programme, the tenns of the agreement tend to focus on people's role in the
       sanitation components and on the amount of people's contribution and the time
       frame within which it should be mobilized. There was no specific reference to the
       role of the community in the drinking water component.

There is an urgent need for clear and agreed perceptions of this crucial issues as it
undermines the sense of ownership of the drinking water system and it will probably
hinder the process towards sustainable management. As the O&M costs are quite high,
Gram Panchayat will find it extremely difficult to undertake this responsibility unless
adequate resources are generated. With the recent amendment to the Panchayat Raj Act
the VWSCs have become a statutory body and they are empowered to_ collect revenue for
O&M. It is hoped that the situation will improve gradually.

As institutional development at the village level appears to be relatively easy compared to
institutional development at higher level of administration, this needs to be given greater
attention. In this regard the following suggestions are offered to strengthen the systems.

a.     As mentioned earlier, under the amended Panchayat Act there is a provision made
       to set up one or more committees by the Gram Panchayat to take care of special
       tasks. The VWSCs be now designated as Village Development Committees with
       responsibility not only for water and sanitation, but for other developmental
       services also. To provide specific data base and technical infonnation, financial
       sources available and other details, the committee should include some programme
       officers of the department like Health, Education, Women and Child Development,
       Social Welfare, Agricultural, Horticulture, besides the PHED. This committee
       should help in village level planning and implementation activities



                                             34
b.    All programme actiVIties in village should be planned, discussed and
      implementation strategy decided within the development committee. The
      concerned programme officials should get the plans approved in this committee.
      Such formation will make it mandatory for getting community involvement in
     Â·activities at different stages. Until this suggestion is implemented by the
      Government, VWSCs should continue to play its role.

c.   A separate cell within the Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Department may
     be created for water Supply and Sanitation Programmes with officials from the
     Health, Women & Child Development and Public Health Engineering Department
     to ensure better co-ordination and monitoring of the programme activities at ail
     levels. They can ensure that their functionaries at District, Taluk and village levels
     play a positive role through horizontal co-ordination and interaction.

d.   There appears to be a need to maintain the Project Planning and Monitoring Unit
     at least for the period of the bilateral project as their implementation is time bound.
     With work load reduced by the modifications suggested above, this unit can give
     greater attention to speed up implementation of hardware, supervision,
     coordination and regular monitoring and evaluation. The present district level
     arrangements for implementation of hardware in the of DPU or special cells under
     ZP appears to be necessary.

e.   While the State Government is having periodic review meetings separately for the
     Government and ESA projects, combined meetings with ail donor agencies may be
     held to have a better understanding of the programmes in their proper
     perspectives. This will have a salutary effect in realising the programme objectives
     because of experience sharing, brain storming etc. Similarly during the visits of the
     missions of ESAs from Delhi or donor countries, inter-agency meetings may be
     held for sharing experiences and resolving issues and challenges in a common
     platform.

f    Finally, in as much as the Government oflndia is a major partner in the
     programme, it is very important that the Ministry ofRural Areas and Employment
     and Rajiv Gandhi National Drinking Water Mission conduct review meetings at the
     State Level at least once in six months to critically analyse and assess the progress
     of implementation.

9.     LESSONS LEARNT AND MODIFICATIONS SUGGESTED

The three externally supported projects on rural water supply and sanitation are_ still in the
early stages of development many of their components not fully implemented or
integrated. Only with regard to Danida I Phase the work has been completed. In case of
the World bank project some experience is gained during the pilot phase and first phase.
These are summarized below.

1.     The project completion document of the Danida I phase has recommended
       abolition of a separate sub-division established for the first phase as it had a
       negative impact on sustainability. Consequently in the second phase this
       arrangement will not be there

2.     The experience of the first phase also shows that unless people pay towards water
       and sanitation facilities a sense of ownership and responsibility cannot be
        inculcated. Hence, during the 2nd phase there is a proposal to introduce cost
       sharing.

3.     During the first phase major responsibilities for software activities was taken up by
       the donor organizations i.e. the project advisory group. Even though other
       departments like women and child welfare education, health and family welfare
       were involved, their participation planning and design implementation and
       monitoring, of activities were very minimal. Instead the project had fruitful
       experience in promoting software activity through existing institutions especially
       the school teachers and the non-governmental organizations with supportive
       training and supervision. Perhaps these approaches are replicable.

4.     Experience suggest that unless govt. take adequate steps to protect drinking water
       sources against over abstraction from aquifers by irrigation well many such
       sources are not likely to be sustainable

5.     Govt. needs to find also appropriate solutions for technical problems such as poor
       power supply and quality ofwater on long-term basis.

6.     The following structural changes are proposed in 2nd phase
       â¢ appointment of a project director to assist the chief executive officer of the ZP
          in day to day executive matters related to the project
       â¢ establishment of district coordination unit consisting ofDanida Project
          Coordinator (India engineering advisors) a sociologist, executive engineer,
          AEE, and health education specialist.
       â¢ Cluster coordinators for a group of project villages with the responsibility for
          involvement of beneficiaries in different phases of project activities.

7.   The status report (1997) of the world Bank project highlights the following
     experience gained during the pilot phase and also phase 1 .
     â¢ to induce to contribute towards capital cost it is essential that people are
        involved in all project activities right from the planning stage that the project
        meets some of their felt needs and entire process is transparent
     â¢ feedback to the community on technical feasibility of their suggestions and
        incorporating accepted changes will increase the rapport and credibility of the
        project
     e  the areas where participation was low working through the local Mahila
        Mandals results in their more active participation.
     e  Experience also showed that people are willing to contribute to the capital cost
         and willing to take responsibility for operation and maintenance of facilities.

INTRODUCTION
The draft reports of the comparative study of ESA water supply schemes in
Karnataka, were sent to the UNDP, Director PPMU, EiC PHED, the Netherlands and
Danida donor agencies' local representatives for perusal and comments. Comments
were however not received from any of them. The UNDP decided to have a
workshop under the chairmanship of the Secretary RDPR GOK, on 22 April 98 in
Bangalore. The list of participants in the workshop is appended as Appendix 'A'.

PRESENTATION OF THE SUMMARY REPORT IN THE WORKSHOP

A draft Summary Report of the comparative study was presented in the workshop on
22 April 98 under the chairmanship of the Secretary RDPR GOK when the
representative of the Rajiv Gandhi National Drinking Water Mission, the UNDP
representatives, Donors' representatives, CE PHED, Director PPMU and other
officers of GOK were present.

The representative from the Rajiv Gandhi National Water Mission, suggested that
lessons learnt and good points of ESA programmes could be adopted in the
Government sponsored programmes.

During the presentation useful discussions took place on several points of the report.
There was a consensus that some more aspects could be studied and included in the
report thus making the report more useful and a reference document. The main topics
that were suggested to be studied are detailed below. The UNDP thought it fit to be
studied as a Phase II of the study. Accordingly the UNDP directed the consultants to
take up the Phase II study vide their letter dated 11 May 1998 along with the Terms
ofReference.                                       Â·

ADDITIONAL TOPICS OF STUDY

During the presentation the following major topics were suggested to be studied.

        1. The advantages and disadvantages of having consultants for various
functions of the implementation process like Hydrogeological Investigations, Designs,
Tender Document Preparation and Supervision which are new concepts introduced in
the bi-lateral programmes. Success rates of bore wells sites selected by PHED
hydrogeologists and consultant's hydro-geologists be studied.

       2.The delays due to paucity or otherwise of good and competent local
contractors.

       3. Time reduction for processing the tender evaluation and award oftenders.


                                           38
       4. Separate cadre for the water and sanitary engineers for implementation of
the programmes.

Accordingly another questionnaire       was framed and sent to the concerned
organi~ations requesting them to send the i~formation by 15 May 98 so as to finalise
the report. A copy of the questionnaire sent is appended Â·at 'Appendix C'. The
questionnaire was sent to Director PPMU, and EiC PHED who hold all the relevant
documents and who are the main resource persons of the information on the additional
points to be studied. Some of the information to be given is normally not readily
available as it is not compiled and documented in the form in which it can be readily
referred to.

The information to be given requires study of voluminous documents and careful
analysis and drawing intelligent inferences from the analysis. The study encompasses
first determining the indicators for the comparison, and a wide range of aspects and
not easy to report in a short time. Many documents some of them may be confidential
and legal in nature, particularly to the aspects concerning evaluation and acceptance of
tenders, negotiations, bad quality of work, penalising and black listing a contractor,
rejection and rebuilding of works etc., at contractors'cost, censuring and punishing
officers if at all compiled and documented systematically, have to be made accessible
and studied in detail. Many case studies have to be made to draw conclusions. This
requires sufficient time and also authority for the study members to see confidential
and legal documents. All contractual documents are confidential in nature.

Further to compare the timely completion of works and performance of the various
implementing agencies the indicators like the amount paid to the contractor as
incentive bonus for early completion of works, liquidated damages collected from the
contractor for the delayed completion of work etc., have to be studied, systematically
and documents should be made available. Similarly for the comparison of the quality of
works executed by the various agencies the information regarding the amounts
recovered for bad work, number of works rejected and reconstructed and their cost
etc., are required to be studied. It is not likely that type of documentation is
maintained in the departments. Additionally the direct implementing units (Executive
Engineers) are too many to be studied.

 Probably due to the paucity of time and busy schedules of the officers and confidential
nature of the documents, the replies to the questionnaire and information were not
adequately covered and also not received in time. The EiC gave the replies to the
questionnaire though incomplete to some extent. The information from PPMU was
obtained by verbal discussions only with the officers of directorate. It necessitated a
few visits to the various offices and also several discussion meetings with the officers
to collect even the above information. However from verbal discussions and written
replies to the questionnaire received only some preliminary information has been
collected and this has been summarised below.




                                            39
         1. The programmes have not reached any completion and commissioning stage,
let alone handing over by the implementing agency and maintaining by the community,
even in less than 1 % of the villages. It is learnt that the 0 & M responsibilities have
been transferred to Village water Supply and Sanitation Committees in only the 10
pilot villages out of 1200 villages contemplated in World Bank project. No 'Other
village either in phase I or phase II schemes has reached a stage of handing over for 0
& M responsibilities. Under the above circumstances it too premature to study the
various aspects.

        2. The appointment of consultants is a new concept and to the departmental
implementing agencies as well as consultants and they are having teething troubles and
trying to adjust to the new environment and new system. Hence it is too early to arrive
at a view about the advantages and the disadvantages of appointing consultants.
Further the consultancy services involve a wide spectrum of different disciplines of
engineering. It is difficult to find consultancy companies well versed in all types and
disciplines of engineering to take on the Consultancy work on a turn key basis.
Subletting of works and joint ventures can only deliver the goods. At present in the
works sponsored by the Government and executed by the PHED the tenders are split
into various small tenders based on the nature and type of work like Electrical and
Mechanical works, Construction of water retaining structures, pipe laying, treatment
plant construction etc.,

        3. The CE PHED has indicated that the success rate of drilling bore wells in
case of sites selected by the government hydro geologists is 60 % where as the same is
45 % in case of sites recommended by the hydrogeologists of the consultants. It has
not been indicated whether the geological formations and other affecting factors were
IDENTICAL in both the cases for comparison base. To arrive at the success rates of
bore wells comparison is to be made under exactly identical conditions of geological I
soil data, depths of water table characteristics, time of conducting the studies and
various other parameters affecting the yield of the wells. A systematic and scientific
study considering all the above parameters is required to be carried out for
comparison. This type of study has not been made.

         4.It has already been brought out in the phase I study report that due to big
tender amounts local contractors could not participate in the tendering process. The
contractors were from distant places of neighboring states whose overheads are more.
The system of appointment of consultants for various activities of the implementation
is in contrast to the age-old, deeply rooted system of utilising departmental staff
These factors have contributed significantly to the delay. However of late small
tenders are being invited and tendering procedures are being simplified to attract local
contractors, the delay in awarding tenders, delays in implementation are on reducing
tendency. The tender percentages over the sanctioned estimates are also getting
reduced. The mandatory requirement of past experience of the contractor and
consultants in the sector for prequalification is being relaxed and the prequalification
criteria is changed to the post qualification which are attracting more local contractors



                                             40
and more competition .. This trend is to be watched for some more future time to
arrive at a view whether the new simplified procedures are really yielding the desired
results. The departmental staff are also getting geared to the new system. The tender
percentage is reported to have come down to 3 5 to 40 % in case of Phase II World
Bank works as againstÂ§) %in case ofPhase I works. This has to be time tested.
                   .        -
         5. Before the formation of the Zilla Panchayats, the water supply works not
only in rural but also urban schemes were being looked after by PHED circles which
maintained on its rolls staff, experienced in the sector of water supply and sanitation
for longer periods and the turn over was generally with in the PHED circles. Though
there was not a separate cadre of public health engineers there used to be normally no
transfers of all the lower level and middle level officers outside the PHED circles. This
procedure ensured continuity and up gradation of knowledge of new technologies. The
public health engineering subject requires specialised technical qualifications and
experience in different fields of engineering. It is the practice in the irrigation
department even now in the interest of the works to post staff within the irrigation
circles. After the formation of the ZP' s all the works of water supply and other works
have been transferred to them for implementation, operation and maintenance.
Officials experienced in water supply works are posted to do works other than water
supply works or personnel not experienced in water supply and sanitation works are
posted to look after these works due to the reasons that water supply works forms a
small percentage of the total works and there is no justification for having a separate
qualified and experienced person to exclusively look after the public health engineering
works. Some ofthe other states are having a separate public health engineering cadre
and works are being looked after by qualified and experienced public health
engineering personnel only. The practice as far as possible of retaining and posting
experienced and qualified public health engineers to water supply and sanitation
works will improve the quality of the works.

         6. Regarding the cost of consultant services it has been reported that the
percentage of consultancy services is 9 % of the total cost of the tendered works. The
government department also charges 16.25 % as the service charges if it executes the
works of other organisations as deposit works as establishment, tools and plant
charges. The 9 % indicated above does not include the tools and plant charges. Hence
the costs of consultancy services are comparable but to arrive at a conclusion more
data is required from the PWD and Irrigation departments to ascertain the percentage
of total expenditure on establishment debited towards various activities of staff like
designs, supervision, accounting, etc.,

        7. General standards of quality of works is stated to be "SATISFACTORY" in
both the cases of works supervised by the consultants and by the departmental staff.
However the inferior quality of work carried out with the departmental supervision is
likely to be hushed up and not publicised as that of the works supervised by the
consultants. They are rectified with the co-operation of the contractors and does not
come to the notice of the public nor accounted in the books .. Now the new concept of



                                            41
the community involvement in the implementation supervision has been introduced in
the ESA works. It can be expected that the chances of execution of inferior quality of
work will be reduced as the contractors will be on their watch since the community
will also be keeping a watch on the quality of the works executed by the contractors as
works will become their property and they will have to maintain the completed works.

        8. A solitary case has been reported in the world bank assisted scheme that two
overhead tanks and other minor works are recommended to be pulled out. This is a
result of a more watchful donor agency and probably the community involvement.
The trend is a healthier one and more and effective community involvement in
supervision of works execution is to be brought into effect for getting quality work,
even though there may be some resistance and disagreements between the stake
holders in the beginning. There are cases of similar failures of overhead tanks in
works of other departments but they have not been given the same amount of
publicity. Community involvement in supervision of execution is absent in the case of
government sponsored works and hence such lapses of are likely to be hushed up.

         9. Opinion of some of the serving staff of the department is that the old system
of utilising the departmental staff instead of consultants would give better results. This
may be due to the fact that they belong to the old school of thought and not taking
into consideration the realities of the situation of not having sufficient government staff
to man all the additional developmental works of huge magnitudes and costs. This is
one of the reasons for the trend of privatisation in the other sectors. They also argue
that the staff of the department is more worried about his career and promotion and
will be more sincere where as the consultant is interested in his business. Since the
system of engaging consultants for various activities of the department is newly
introduced in the ESA water supply projects, the views expressed are not based on
sufficient experience and cannot be taken as conclusive.

         10. Other issues studied in the phase II, like Community Participation,
Institution Building, lessons learnt etc., are covered and incorporated under the
respective headings in the Phase I report itself.

CONCLUDING REMARKS

        11. Finally it is recommended that a separate study be taken up at a later stage
allowing     sufficient time for the study, when most of the ESA projects are
completed, commissioned and handed over to the community and after they have been
successfully operated by them for at least two or more years on "no profit and no loss
basis" and the community becomes self reliant for the Operation and Maintenance,
which is one of the basic objectives of the programmes. For the study at that time the
experience of similar programmes in other states if reckoned will be very useful in
policy formulation for the government.
