{"cdata!": "This project is implemented in about\n            twelve districts in the state of Karnataka and includes 1200\n            villages. It raises the standard of living in rural areas by\n            improving health and productivity . This is accomplished by\n            expanding access to potable rural water supply systems and\n            environmental sanitation facilities. Beneficiary communities\n            are assuming full responsibility for operation and\n            maintenance including cost recovery. These communities are\n            also responsible for capital cost sharing for environment\n            sanitation works. This project comprises the following\n            components: (a) construction of new and rehabilitation of\n            existing water supply schemes in 1,200 villages including\n            leakage repair works, assistance for Public Health\n            Engineering Department's borewell program, a water\n            quality monitoring program and measures for groundwater\n            recharge; (b) construction of environmental sanitation\n            facilities including sullage drainage and, on a demand\n            basis, pit latrines, washing platforms, cattle troughs,\n            bathing cubicles, street bins and biogas plants; (c) health\n            communication for creation of greater community awareness\n            and demand for improved hygiene and environmental\n            sanitation; and (d) institutional strengthening through\n            community development programs (creation of village water\n            supply and sanitation committees) and comprehensive training\n            programs. NGOs comprise a large role in sanitation and\n            health communication components."}, "docdt": "1993-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
