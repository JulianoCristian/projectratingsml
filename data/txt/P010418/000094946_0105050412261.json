Both\n            World Bank and Borrower performances are rated satisfactory\n            overall: Despite weaknesses in project management, the\n            project largely achieved both its physical targets and\n            development objectives. Key lessons learned include the\n            following: Ownership of the project design at the political,\n            bureaucratic, and operational levels is a pre-requisite for\n            project success. A conducive policy environment and\n            willingmess to learn by doing are equally vital for success.\n            Project design should respond to village aspirations for\n            high service standards. The state level institutions should\n            have the appropriate mandate and functional autonomy to play\n            an effective facilitating role. The excessive turnover of\n            key project staff has been a serious problem. Changing\n            mandates and mindsets of state agencies, capacity building\n            of all stakeholders by providing resources, and quality time\n            need to be at the core of project design. Capacity building\n            should address motivation, team building, and managerial\n            issues for project staff. Implementation arrangements and\n            procurement procedures should be aligned with community\n            empowerment principles in participatory projects.\n            Women's active participation improve local ownership\n            and quality of implementation. Imaginative approaches have\n            to be vigorously implemented to draw women into project activities."}, "docdt": "2001-03-26T00:00:00Z"}
