APPRAISAL OF SINE SALOUM AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Background
i.        The Government of Senegal has requested the Bank Group and the
French Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE) to help finance an
agricultural development project in one of Senegal's most heavily populated
regions. The objectives would be to increase and diversify agricultural
production and thus raise the incomes of about 34,000 farm families. The
project is based on improved farming practices tested successfully by a
pilot project financed by CCCE and Government. It was identified by an RMWA
mission in April 1973, and prepared by the Agricultural Development Authority
for the central regions of Senegal (Societe de Developpement et de Vulgarisa-
tion Agricole - SODEVA), with funds provided under the second agricultural
credit project financed by IDA.  The project would further Government's
national agiçicultural credit and extension program (Programme Agricole) that
has formed the basis of its agricultural development strategy since the
early 1960's. This program has been financed in part by two IDA credits
approved in 1968 and 1973.
The Project
ii.       The project area would be the region of Sine Saloum, in the south
of Senegal's Groundnut Basin. It has a rural population of some 700,000,
equivalent to about 20% of the country's total, and accounts for about 50%
of Senegalts groundnut and 30% of its cereal production. Per capita farm
incomes including subsistence range from US$60 to US$150.
iii.      The proposed project would carry agricultural development in Sine
Saloum beyond the plateau reached by Programme Agricole. Increases in output
of groundnuts, cereals, and livestock would be achieved by training some
34,000 farmers in the improved farming practices tested by the pilot project.
The proposed project would be carried out by SODEVA over the five-year period
1975/76 to 1979/80 and would involve:
(a)  strengthening SODEVA by providing it with buildings,
equipment and staff;
(b)  constructing and renovating training facilities, and
providing courses for extension workers;
(c)  demonstrating and disseminating improved husbandry
techniques for cereals, groundnuts and cotton;



- ii -
(d)  introducing improved animal husbandry practices for
draft oxen, beef cattle, and breeding cows; constructing
and operating an animal feed plant;
(e) supplying implements and seasonal inputs and providing
medium-term and seasonal credit;
(f) establishing a tree nursery and distributing trees
for windbreaks and future fuel supplies and demonstrating
soil conservation techniques;
(g) monitoring and evaluating the results of project activities;
and
(h) hiring consultants to review grain marketing policies,
procedures and facilities.
iv.       Project Execution.  Government has designated SODEVA as the regional
development agency for the Groundnut Basin, where it has been responsible for
extension services under Programme Agricole and for carrying out the Sine
Saloum Pilot Project. SODEVA is well managed and effective and would be
responsible for implementing the proposed project. It would provide extension
services and coordinate with other agencies in supplying inputs and credit
to the farmers. Since extension service support for Programme Agricole
would be phased out in Sine Saloum, the proposed project would occupy all of
SODEVA's extension effort and thus would finance all of SODEVA's staff,
operating, building, and equipment costs in Sine Saloum for the five-year
project period.
v.        Seasonal Inputs, Farm Implements and Credit - Seasonal inputs
and implements would be supplied by ONCAD, against orders from cooperatives.
Since there have been delays in ordering and delivering farm inputs, SODEVA's
field staff would prepare lists of goods required by farmers, to help the
cooperatives and ONCAD in placing orders and planning deliveries. The
National Development Bank (Banque Nationale de Developpement du Senegal
- BNDS) would channel credit to project farmers using in part the roll-over
fund created by the two IDA credits and funds borrowed on favorable terms
from the Central Bank. Farmers would purchase seed, fertilizers and pesti-
cide with short-term credit, and implements on medium-term credit. To cover
the increased credit requirements of the project, the present limits imposed
by BNDS on borrowing by cooperatives may need to be liftèd or arrangements
made to increase the guarantee funds of cooperatives. This issue would be
monitored carefully during project implementation.
Cost Estimates and Financial Arrangements
vi.       The estimated cost of the project is US$30.9 million, including
taxes and duties (US$2.9 million). The foreign exchange component would be
about US$3.9 million or 13 percent of total cost. Physical contingencies
and expected price increases would amount to 30 percent of base cost estimates,
which are at mid-1975 prices.



- iii -
vii.      The Bank would make a loan of US$7.0 million for a term of 20 years,
including a five-year grace period, and IDA a credit of US$7 million on standard
terms.  Additional financing of US$8.9 million would be provided by the CCCE.
The proposed Bank loan and IDA credit would cover the foreign exchange costs
(US$3.9 million) and US$10.1 million (42%) of the local costs for a total of
50% of project costs, net of taxes and duties (US$28 million). The CCE loan
would be for a term of 20 years, including a five-year grace period, with
interest at an annual rate of 3.5%.
viii.     Since SODEVA would not have its own revenues and would carry
out the project on Government's behalf, the IDA credit and the Bank and CCCE
loans (US$22.9 million) plus Government's contribution to SODEVA's costs of
US$4.2 million would be passed on to SODEVA as grants. In addition, Govern-
ment would provide SODEVA with CFAF 200 million (US$889,000), equivalent to
about three months of its expenditures, as working capital for the project.
ix.       Incremental farm inputs would be financed jointly by Government
and BNDS. Government's contribution would be US$2.1 million and would be in
the form of subsidies for fertilizers and insecticides. BNDS would finance
short- and medium-term credit totalling US$1.8 million.
Procurement
x.        Vehicles, equipment and civil works expenditures would total about
US$2.15 million. Contracts for buildings, equipment and vehicles for more
than US$50,000, aggregating about US$400,000, would be awarded on the basis
of international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank Group's
guidelines for procurement. Locally manufactured goods would be allowed a
preferance of 15% or the level of applicable import duty, whichever is lover,
when comparing domestic with foreign bids.  Contracts for less than US$50,000,
totalling US$1.6 million, including the bulk of civil works contracts which
are small and widely scattered, would be awarded on the basis of competitive
bidding advertised locally and in accordance with local procedures, which are
satisfactory to the Bank Group. The remaining equipment purchases, in amounts
less than US$10,000 and totalling US$150,000, would include office and house
furnishings and equipment for agricultural demonstrations and would be pur-
chased chiefly from local sources. Consultant services, totaling about
US$200,000, would be obtained according to the Bank Group's normal procedures.
The balance of projects costs would be for personnel and management, US$24.9
million, and for farm inputs, US$3.69 million, and would be unsuitable for
competitive bidding.
Disbursements
xi.       The proceeds of the IDA credit and the Bank loan would be disbursed
to cover 60% of:
(a) the costs for project buildings, vehicles, equipment and furnishings--
US$1.0 million;



- iv -
(b) the salaries of staff employed under contract by SODEVA and
allowances for all project staff--US$7.5 million; and
(c) SODEVA's other project operating costs--US$2.0 million.
The IDA credit and the Bank loan would be disbursed pari passu with the CCCE
loan in the ratio 60:40 so that the credit and the two loans would together
cover 100% of the costs of the above items. The balance of the IDA credit
and the Bank loan would cover 100% of the foreign exchange costs of the con-
sultants (US$160,000), and a contingency reserve of US$3.3 million.
Benefits and Justification
xii.      The project's direct benefits would be the increased output of
groundnuts, cereals, cotton, and livestock products that it would generate.
At full development in PY5, the net value in 1974 terimis of this incremental
production would be about US$8.5 million, representing also a contribution of
about US$7.5 million to Senegal's net foreign exchange earnings.
xiii.     The economic rate of return of the project would be 25% over 10
years. Benefit decreases or cost increases of 25% would lower the rate of
return to 12% and 13% respectively. The project is expected, therefore, to
have a satisfactory rate of return.
xiv.      About 80% of beneficiaries would have pre-project per capita incomes
between US$60 and US$90; under the project incomes would be increased by
about 35%, bringing the average up to about US$115 per capita.
xv.       In addition to the directly quantifiable benefits derived from in-
creased production, the project would help reduce the threat of soil erosion,
and the resulting lonR term losses in productive capacity, which accompanies
increasing population pressure. It would demonstrate efficient farming tech-
niques that could be adopted by many of Senegal's farmers to increase their
incomes and would create a nucleus of some 34 ,000 farmers who could be expected
to expand the application of these techiiques on their own farms and serve as
an example for other farmers. It would also help develop in SODEVA an ex-
perienced extension service capable of expanding the scope of the proposed
project to include even more farmers, or of carrying out future development
projects in Sine Saloum or other regions.
Recommendation
xvi.      With the assurances and conditions set out in Chapter VII, the
project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$7.0 million, and an IDA credit of
US$7.0 million.



INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Goverument of Senegal has asked the Bank Group and Caisse
Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE) of France to help finance an agri-
cultural project in Sine Saloum, one of Senegal's most heavily populated
regions. The objectives would be to increase and diversify agricultural pro-
duction and, thereby, raise the incomes of some 34,000 farm families.
1.02      The proposed project is based on a pilot scheme financed jointly
by Government and CCCE since 1971. It was identified for possible Bank Group
financing by a RMWA mission in April 1973, and prepared by a Governnent
agency, the Agricultural Development Authority for the central regions of
the country (Societe de Developpement et de Vulgarisation Agricole - SODEVA),
under the Second Agricultural Credit Project financed by IDA.
1.03      This report is based on the findings of a Bank Group appraisal
mission, comprising Messrs. A. Cole, J. Brown, J. Pelissier, and J. Tillier,
that visited Senegal in July 1974. Mr. J. Cantournet appraised the project
at the same time for CCCE.
1.04      The Bank Group has made one loan and six credits for agricultural
development in Senegal: an agricultural credit program financed by Loan
584-SE (US$3.5 million) and Credit 140-SE (US$6.0 million) in 1969, and by
Credit 404-SE (US$8.2 million) in 1973; rice development in Casamance by
252-SE (US$3.7 million) in 1971; resettlement in Eastern Senegal by 254-SE
(US$1.3 million in 1971); rice development in the Senegal River delta by
350-SE (US$4.5 million) in 1973, and drought relief by 446-SE (US$3.0 million)
in 1973. With the exception of the first agricultural credit project, and
notvithstanding frequent delays in Government's project funding, the projects
have been completed or are progressing satisfactorily (Annex 1). In the case
of the first agricultural credit project, demand for farm implements developed
more slowly than foreseen because of droughts and a sharp reduction in the
producer price for groundnuts; since disbursements would have been delayed
beyond a reasonable period, Loan 584-SE was cancelled in 1971. After demand
for implements resumed, IDA provided a second tranche for Government's farm
credit program in 1973 (Credit 404-SE); and disbursements of the latest IDA
credit are now expected to be made faster than estimated at appraisal. The
two agricultural credits also provided for technical assistance for the re-
organization of ONCAD; this activity has been unsuccessful and Government
and IDA are examining steps to remedy the situation.
II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      Senegal is located mostly within the Sudano-lahelian zone on the
coast of West Africa and has a land area of 196,700 km . Population is about
4.2 million and is growing annually at about 2.2%. Urban areas account for



- 2 -
about 25% of total population, the largest being around the capital, Dakar
(pop. 0.6 million). Per capita GNP in 1974 was estimated at US$310 (Bank
Atlas method) while rural per capita incomes average about half that amount.
2.02      In 1972, the economy came under severe strain as a result of the
worst series of droughts in this century. In 1973 there was another though
less severe drought, and by the end of the year total reserves had reached an
all time low of minus US$31 million; the real standard of living in rural
areas had declined to early 1960 levels; and Government's financial situation
had become very precarious. Faced with this situation, Government resorted
to heavier external borrowing and assistance to avoid a slowdown in its
investment program. During 1974, the economic situation improved markedly
as a result of sharp price increases for groundnuts and rock phosphate. In
addition, satisfactory rainfall in 1974 improved crop production, and Government
took steps to improve its financial situation by reducing substantially the
level of subsidies on food for consumers (para 2.12).
B. Rural Sector
2.03      Despite relatively poor soils and erratic rainfall, the agri-
cultural sector is central to Senegal's economy. It accounts for about 35%
of GDP, up to 70% of Senegal's exports, and 70% of all employment. Moreover,
as Senegal has few known economic alternatives, agriculture will continue to
be the largest source of employment for the foreseeable future.
2.04      There are several important sectoral characteristics:  small-scale
farms account for 95% of all production; groundnuts account for almost 70%
of agricultural exports; 60% of rural population is concentrated within about
100 miles of Dakar in the Groundnut Basin; and large areas in the north and
east of the country are suitable only for livestock production under extensive
grazing. There are thus significant variations in the distribution of popu-
lation, but with smaller differences in cropping patterns.
2.05      Government's efforts to develop agriculture have been directed to
(a) increasing groundnut and millet production, especially in the Groundnut
Basin, and (b) diversifying production by promoting rice and cotton in Casamance
and Eastern Senegal, and developing the irrigation potential of the Senegal
river.
Programme Agricole
2.06      A central feature of Government's rural development strategy has
been "Programme Agricole" (PA), which has been supported by Credits 140 SE
and 404 S}-.  Starting in the early 1960s, it aimed at increasing the pro-
duction of millet and groundnuts by making animal- drawn implements, fertilizers
and improved seeds available to farmers on credit, providing extension services
to promote the correct use of these inputs, and by developing cooperatives to



facilitate the distribution of inputs and crop marketing. The main organi-
zations involved in PA are the National Office of Cooperatives and Development
Assistance (ONCAD, Annex 2) and the cooperatives, which ONCAD supervises and
assists.
2.07      In addition to supporting the cooperatives, ONCAD procures and dis-
tributes farm inputs, administers the associated subsidies, and maintains and
distributes the stock of groundnut seeds. It is also responsible for market-
ing groundnuts, domestic cereals and imported rice. Because of its role in
groundnut marketing, ONCAD is the agency primarily responsible for the recovery
of credit under PA. Finance for this credit is provided by National Development
Bank of Senegal (BNDS), which also provides short-term financing of the
groundnut purchases and input inventories of ONCAD, short- and medium-term
credits to cooperatives and loans to individual farmers. The amounts lent
to cooperatives are governed by the past volume of groundnuts marketed.
2.08      Cooperatives (Annex 8) form the basic structure in Government's plan
for organizing the rural sector. Senegal has about 2,200 cooperatives, some
500 of which are in Sine Saloum; the average cooperative has about 120 members.
In exchange for a membership fee of CFAF 1,000, the member is entitled to
credit for fertilizer, insecticides and agricultural implements distributed
under PA. In addition to serving as a channel for collectively guaranteed
credit, the cooperatives serve as the focal point for the distribution of
seeds and for the marketing of the output of members and non-members alike.
In order to enable the cooperatives to be more self-sufficient, ONCAD plans
to reorganize the cooperatives into basic units or unions that will market
at least 1,500 tons of groundnuts per year, the minimum it considers necessary
to pay for the full-time cooperative manager.
2.09      PA's goals were ambitious and its targets included rapid increases
in cultivated areas as well as yield increases. During the early 1960's
groundnut and millet production reached record levels, at least in part due
to the promotion of fertilizers and animal traction under PA. In the last
half of the 1960's, however, yields and production of these crops declined
sharply with the onset of the droughts. In the 1970's production has fluctuated
with rainfall (Charts 9238 and 9239), but even in good rainfall years output
has not exceeded the record levels of the mid-1960's. This leveling off,
together with the fact that some 80% of the farmers in the Groundnut Basin
now participate in PA, suggests that the Program may have reached the limits
of its development potential.
Regional Development Agencies
2.10      Semi-autonomous development agencies, organized on either regional
or product lines and reporting to the Ministry of Rural Development, have
begun to supplant the Ministry in the provision of extension services to
farmers (although the latter still maintains direct responsibility for extension
in part of Casamance and for small scale vegetable projects, generally near
Dakar). SODEVA (para 2.17) has been given overall responsibility for extension
in the Groundnut Basin and has been primarily concerned with the introduction



- 4 -
of improved farming techniques under Programme Agricole in which it has been
quite successful. SAED is responsible for rice development in the Senegal
River Delta, and may become the Regional Development Agency for the whole
valley, while SODEFITEX is responsible for cotton production, mainly in Eastern
Senegal. In addition to providing technical extension services, these two
agencies are responsible for distributing inputs procured by ONCAD to the
farmers and for the commercialization and processing of farm output. A fourth
agency, the Societe des Terres Neuves (STN), is responsible for settlement
projects, primarily in Eastern Senegal. The activities of these agencies
have shown that new techniques can be effectively introduced when PA is
supported by projects comprising close extension supervision.
Financing Agricultural Development
2.11      A key problem in development activities lies in assuring adequate
financing. The regional development agencies have no revenues to finance their
extension activities and must rely on Government support, either directly from
the budget or from external donors.  ONCAD is theoretically self-financing,
with its marketing activities paid for out of the differential between the
price paid to producers for groundnuts and that received from the oil mills
and the cost of input distribution included in the price paid by farmers for
the inputs. However, the lack of appropriate procedures to provide funds to
cover the costs of subsidies on farm inputs and consumer purchases of cereals
has contributed to ONCAD's current severe financial difficulties.
Subsidies
2.12      Until recently, subsidies for imported foodstuffs have discouraged
local production and caused serious financial problems. Recognizing the
harmful effects of these policies, Government in November 1974 eliminated
the subsidy for imported rice, which had reached a value of about CFAF 7.5
billion per year, and reduced the subsidies on sugar and vegetable oil. At
the same time, producer prices for groundnuts were raised by 40% and for
cotton by 37% to reflect more closely their world market value. Fertilizers
are still subsidized, however, while ONCAD has been selling farm implements
below cost. In addition to contributing to the financial problems of ONCAD,
this policy encourages the uneconomic use of inputs.
2.13      In spite of rising costs for farm implements, the prices paid by
the farmer have been frozen at 1973 levels, resulting in ONCAD losses of about
CFAF 150 million in 1974. Given the recent increases in producer prices, the
farmer should be able to pay full cost for the implements. Government has
raised the prices charged to farmers by 15% for the 1975 campaign and during
negotiations an assurance was obtained that Government would continue to follow
a policy of progressive adoption of prices reflecting the full cost of imple-
ments.
2.14      Credit 404-SE provides for annual consultations between IDA and
Government on the level of fertilizer subsidies. The goal of these consulta-
tions was to be the progressive reduction in the level of the subsidy. However,



- 5 -
the maintenance of a constant price to farmers in light of higher world market
prices has led to an increase in the subsidy which covered about 80% of costs
and amounted, in total, to about CFAF 2 billion in 1974. The first of the
consultations was held during the negotiations for the proposed project and
Government informed the Bank Group that the price paid by farmers was raised
from CFAF 12/kg to CFAF 16/kg for the 1975 campaign (increases in cost, how-
ever, kept the subsidy at about the same percentage). An assurance was ob-
tained that Government would follow a policy of progressive adoption of prices
reflecting the full cost of fertilizers and that consultations would be held
between the Government and the Bank Group in October/November of each year to
discuss prices to be set for the following campaign.
C. Agricultural Development Strategy
2.15      Because of the heavy concentration of population in the Groundnut
Basin, the improvement of productivity for groundnuts and cereals in that
region is the only practical short-term means for improving the livelihood
of most of the rural population. However, the agricultural potential of the
Groundnut Basin is severely limited by its unreliable rainfall, and Govern-
ment's plans to develop irrigation in the Senegal River Region, and agri-
culture in the higher rainfall areas of Eastern Senegal and Casamance are
sound and would give the country some measure of protection against the most
severe effects of droughts.
2.16      In recognition of the success of projects to diversify and intensify
production in specific geographical areas, Government has designated SODEVA
as the regional development agency with primary responsibility for planning
and implementing agricultural development projects in the Groundnut Basin,
and intends to establish similar development agencies for each of the country's
regions. This strategy is sound because PA is not designed to provide the
intensive supervision required to move farmers to new levels of productivity,
and because these semi-autonomous development agencies have managerial and
administrative advantages over Government departments. These agencies are
not revenue earning, however, and Government has so far relied heavily on
external assistance to cover their costs. Exclusive reliance on external
finance would be imprudent. Government should therefore plan the budgetary
measures (including the review of subsidies) necessary to assure adequate
financial support for these agencies.
D. SODEVA and the Pilot Project
2.17      SODEVA (Annex 4) was established in 1968 by Government and Societe
d'Aide Technique et de Cooperation (SATEC) of France as an agricultural devel-
opment agency to take over and expand the activities of SATEC in the regions
of Sine Saloum, Thies and Diourbel that comprise most of Senegal's Groundnut
Basin (Map). SODEVA operates as an arm of Government, has no revenue earning



- 6 -
activities, and is financed in part from the budget of the Ministry of Rural
Development, but mostly through external aid agreements (Annex 4, Table 1).
Its staff includes civil servants seconded from and paid by the Ministry of
Rural Development, personnel employed under direct contract, and expatriate
staff provided by SATEC. SODEVA is well-managed and effective. In addition
to providing basic extension services under Programme Agricole to all farmers
in the Groundnut Basin, an important activity since 1971 has been a pilot
project in Southern Sine Saloum (para 2.18). This project, financed in part
by CCCE, is the basis for the project proposed in this report and for a similar
project to the north of Sine Saloum (Thies and Diourbel) for which Government
has received assistance from USAID.
2.18      The pilot project (Annex 5) was designed to test the applicability
of research results that have shown that further improvements above the levels
reachecl under Programme Agricole could be achieved with more intensive farming
practices. The new technology involves (a) stump and root removal to complete
land clearing; (b) the use of oxen for plowing; (c) comprehensive use of
fertilizers for cereals and other crops; (d) the introduction of sorghum,
maize, cotton, and livestock on a larger scale in the farming system; and
(e) the correct timing for farming operations. The introduction of this tech-
nology required the concentration of extension services on a relatively small
number of farmers for a limited period of time.
2.19      Progress was slower than expected because many farmers were reluctant
to or did not understand the need to clear fields of stumps and roots, a pre-
requisite for effective plowing. However, the rate of clearing increased when
uprooting was made a precondition for receiving free phosphate and the full
support of SODEVA's extension staff. Late delivery of farm inputs by ONCAD
also proved a problem and SODEVA's field staff had to intervene to assure
supplies. The first meaningful results (based on a partial sample of some
1,700 farms) available are for the 1973/74 crop year and show the following
yields:
Groundnut   Millet   Sorghum   Maize
Under Pilot Project
Recommendations                            1,260       1,010     780      1,960
Under Normal
Recommendations of P.A.                      940         760     560
Although limited, these results indicate that the improved farming techniques
recommended and SODEVA's extension methods are sound for application in a
larger project.

III. THE PROJECT
A. Project Area
3.01      The project area covers the administrative region of Sine Saloum
that comprises the southern part of the Groundnut Basin (Map). The region
has six districts, with a commercial center at Kaolack, the largest town
(pop. 100,000).
3.02      The climate is characterized by a dry season of eight to nine months
and a rainy season of some three to four months, with generally 40 to 60 days
of rain. To the north, the rainfall averages 600-800 mm and to the south
800-1,000 mm. Average monthly temperatures range between 25° and 30°C.
3.03      Three soil types prevail.  In the north, the soils are sandy,
permeable, and easy to work when wet; they are well suited to groundnut and
millet and are heavily cropped. In the northwest they have a high clay
content and are difficult to work and are best suited to sorghum, and where
rainfall is sufficient, to maize and cotton. In the south and east, the
soils have a variable clay content and are reasonably easy to work when moist;
they are suitable for groundnuts, millet, sorghum, maize and cotton. The
traditional rotation consists of one or two years of groundnuts, followed by
millet; after three or more years of cropping, the land reverts to a bush
fallow for one to several years.  But fallow is being drastically reduced,
thus increasing the danger of soil erosion, in the heavily populated north-
western section of the project area.
3.04      The area's agriculture accounts for 40-60% of Senegal's groundnuts
and 33% of its millet production. Livestock consist of about 470,000 cattle,
460,000 sheep and goats, and 8,000 pigs. The cattle are mostly N'dama, a
trypano-tolerant breed, in the south, and zebus in the north.
3.05      The rural infrastructure consists of a road network comprising some
450 km of main roads and about 1,500 km of secondary roads that are passable
throughout the year. The area is also served by a port on the Saloum River
at Kaolack and by the Dakar-Bamako railroad. Village water supplies generally
depend on wells, and Governnent has initiated a program for well improvement
supported by the European Development Fund (FED).
3.06      Total population of the Sine Saloum Region is about 8002000, of whom
about 90% live in rural areas. Population density averages 34/km and ranges
from about 9/km2 in the east to 85/km2 in the northwest, and the area's 70,000
farms range in size between 6 ha and 20 ha, and average about 11 ha.  Families
vary from individual households with about 6 members to compounds with several
households totaling 20 to 30 members. Traditionally, agricultural land
belonged to the family and cultivation rights were allocated to individual
farmers by family chiefs. This system is changing and, under a law passed in
1972, all agricultural land is in the national domain, with individual rights



-8-
allocated by rural community leaders and reinforced by law (Annex 6). Although
no serious land tenure problems are foreseen for the project, SODEVA's study
group would be asked to monitor the transition from one system of allocation
to the other during project implementation.
B. Project Description
3.07      The proposed project would carry agricultural development in Sine
Saloum beyond the plateau reached by Programme Agricole (para 2.09). Increases
in output of groundnuts, cereals, and livestock would be achieved by training
some 34,000 farmers in the improved farming practices tested by the pilot
project i(para 2.18). The proposed project would be carried out by SODEVA
over the five-year period 1975/76 to 1979/80 and would involve:
(a) strengthening SODEVA by providing it with buildings,
equipment and staff;
(b) constructing and renovating training facilities, and
providing courses for extension workers;
(c) demonstrating and disseminating improved husbandry
techniques for cereals, groundnuts and cotton;
(d) introducing improved animal husbandry practices for
draft oxen, beef cattle, and breeding cows; constructing
and operating an animal feed plant;
(e) supplying implements and seasonal inputs and providing
medium-term and seasonal credit;
(f) establishing a tree nursery and distributing trees
for windbreaks and future fuel supplies and demonstrating
soil conservation techniques;
(g) monitoring and evaluating the results of project
activities; and
(h) hiring consultants to review grain marketing policies,
procedures and facilities.
C. Detailed Features
3.08      Strengthening SODEVA - The project would finance the construction
of an office block, garage, and central store for the project's headquarters
in Kaolack. The project would also finance construction and equipment for



- 9 -
five district offices, 28 subdistrict offices and stores, four senior and 34
junior staff housing units, and one central and three field staff training
and meeting facilities. Four existing training centers would be renovated
and SODEVA would be equipped with 25 pickup and heavier trucks.
3.09      Since PA is now firmly established in Sine Saloum (para 2.09),
SODEVA's extension efforts in its support would be phased out. The proposed
project would therefore occupy all of SODEVA's farm level staff for Sine
Saloum which, including the pilot project, currently comprises some 370 field
extension workers.  By project year (PY)3, this level would be increased to
500, giving an overall ratio of one field worker to about 150 farms for the
project area. During the same period, middle level technical staff, including
animal husbandry assistants, would be increased from 115 to about 170, and
senior staff would remain at about 20.
3.10      Training - The 55 new middle level staff would be recruited from the
Ministry of Rural Development's training schools, and about 130 literate
farmers would be selected as new field extension workers. All new middle
level and field staff would undergo six months of further training for the
project at the Training Center for Agricultural Development Techniques (OETAD)
at Thies. CETAD, which is operated by SODEVA with a budget from the Ministry
of Rural Development, is well run and its graduates are proving to be effective
field workers. Classes would be followed by practical sessions, including a
training assignment with an experienced field officer.
3.11      Improved Farm Practices - Under the project, SODEVA's extension
workers would encourage farmers to clear their fields, plow their land every
three to four years, and begin the basic crop rotation with a cereal crop,
preferably maize or sorghum. Seed varieties and fertilizer rates would be
those recommended by Senegal's research organizations (Annex 3). Fertilizer
economics are being studied by a SODEVA team financed under Credit 404-SE,
and assurances were obtained that SODEVA would consult the Bank Group on the
study findings with a view to agreement on recommended changes for the project.
Project staff and cooperating research institutes would also: (a) test new
varieties of groundnuts, sorghum and maize; (b) investigate the possibility
of plowing during the dry season and assess prospects for minimum tillage;
and (c) develop soil conservation practices.
3.12      Farmers satisfactorily using the crop management practices and
basic inputs provided under PA (Annex 3), owning and training a pair of
draft oxen, and clearing at least 1 ha of all roots and stumps would receive
the concentrated support of SODEVA's field staff who would make farm visits
about twice a month and would hold regular group meetings. By PY 5 the
project's staff would supervise closely about half of farmers in the project
area and production practices would be intensified on about 1/5 of the
cultivated land.
3.13      Improved Animal Husbandry Practices (Annex 7) - To develop ox-
traction, SODEVA has promoted stall feeding of crop residues, and many farmers
have expanded into beef fattening as an extra source of income. By PY 5,



- 10 -
farmers would be helped to fatten 16,000 cattle annually.  Mature oxen, three
years and over, would be kept in stalls for 150 to 180 days and would gain
about 75 kg. Also, SODEVA would cooperate with the Ministry of Rural Devel-
opment's Veterinary Department to reduce calf mortality and raise the calving
rate by improved feeding and health care. Since the development of stall
feeding would expand the demand for water, the project would finance 22 sets
of ox-drawn water lifting equipment for demonstrations in the project area.
To meet the requirements for feed supplements, the project would also finance
the construction of a small animal feed mixing plant at Kaolack to be owned
and operated by SODEVA. The mill would produce about 6 tons/day of feed
concentrates and minerals, which SODEVA would distribute and sell at cost to
project farmers.
3.14      Seasonal Inputs and Implements - Seasonal inputs for cereals and
groundnuts and all implements would be supplied by ONCAD, on the basis of
orders from cooperatives. Tle Cotton Development Agency (Societe pour le
Developpenent des Fibres Textiles - SODEFITEX, para 2.10) would supply farmers
with seasonal inputs for cotton. Since deliveries from ONCAD have often been
late, SODEVA's field staff would prepare lists of goods required by farmers.
These lists would provide a basis for cooperatives and ONCAD to make orders
and plan deliveries, and would be part of a joint effort by the two agencies
(para 3.23). Since maintenance and repairs of farm equipment have proved
difficult, SODEVA would purchase 16 welding sets to start a training program
for blacksmiths.
3.15      Soil Conservation and Tree Planting Program - As a result of stump
removal and plowing, the soil would lose its natural cover of trees and bushes,
and the danger of erosion would be increased. To minimize this danger, and
to protect against erosion which would arise from the reduction of fallow due
to population pressures in the northwestern part of the project area, SODEVA
would introduce a program of soil conservation, involving contour plowing and
strip cropping, and promote the planting of trees for windbreaks and fuel
through the free distribution of planting materials.
3.16      Project Monitoring and Evaluation - Initially, much of the record
keeping would be done by extension staff, but farmers would be taught to keep
their own records, and SODEVA's main objective would be to evaluate results
from a 1% sample of project farmers. An important task of the evaluation
unit would be to accurately sample crop yields in the project area and to
establish a base line for the situation without the project. An assurance
was obtained that SODEVA would provide the Bank Group with a detailed evalua-
tion report on the project's progress within six months of the end of each
cropping season. Requirements for this report and for semi-annual progress
reports are detailed in Annex 9. SODEVA would employ consultants for a total
of about 9 man-months spread over the five years of the project, to help
design the evaluation system and to analyse the data. An assurance vas ob-
t :ne  that the consultants' experience, qualifications and terms of reference
would be acceptable to the Bank Group.



- il -
3.17      Cereal Marketing Study - The project would finance a study by con-
sultants to examine marketing arrangements for domestic cereals and to recom-
mend any needed changes. Since subsidies for imported rice were abolished in
November 1974, the prospects for increased sales of locally grown cereals
have improved and it will be necessary to examine marketing, storage, and
processing facilities and determine their capacity to handle an increased
domestic crop. Government's present position is that ONCAD should have a
monopoly on marketing domestic cereals. However, in order to ensure adequate
marketing facilities, Goverument agreed during negotiations to take all
necessary steps to utilize as and when needed all available marketing channels.
Governaent al8o agreed to discuss vith the Bank Group the implications of
the stud; for the marketing system as the findings become available. The
consultant team would be employed by the Ministry of Planning and vould com-
prise a marketing specialist, a grain storage/processing specialist, and an
economist. The study would require a total of 9 man-months, and an assurance
vas obtained that the qualifications, experience, and terms of reference for
the consultants would be acceptable to the Bank Group. Draft terms of refer-
ence are in Annex 10.
D. Organization and Management
3.18      Project Management (Annex 4, chart) - SODEVA's regional director for
Sine Saloum would be the Project Manager. A technical director in charge of
all field operations would be deputy project manager and would have an or-
ganizational specialist as his principal assistant.  There vould be three
technical divisions reporting directly to the technical director: crop
husbandry, animal husbandry and training; credit would be the responsibility
of the administrative officer. The technical divisions would be assisted by
specialists in farm machinery, seed production and forestry.  A civil engineer
vould supervise the project's building program, and an internal auditor would
inspect project accounts.
3.19      Field Organization - The project area would be divided into six
districts. Each district vould have an operational chief, reporting to the
technical director, supported by representatives of the technical divisions.
The districts would be broken down into a total of 17 sub-districts and 78
rural community offices.  The farm level extension officers would be in groups
of six and would report to an extension agent in the rural community office.
3.20      Staffing - The project manager and 190 of the senior and middle
level technical staff (para 3.09), including counterparts for expatriates,
would be seconded to SODEVA by Government and would be mostly from the Minis-
try of Rural Development; of these about 140 are already in post or under
recruitment. SODEVA would employ about 30 senior and middle level staff on
contract for accounts, stores, and the credit division.



- 12 -
3.21      Senegalization - Since 1968, SODEVA has made considerable progress
in recruiting and training Senegalese staff, and has recently appointed
Senegalese staff to all senior district positions in the project area. How-
ever, six senior positions at the regional level remain to be filled. At
present, five of these positions are occupied by expatriates provided under
an agreement with SATEC, which would be expected to continue to supply the
expatriates required for the project. All expatriate staff would train
counterparts as part of their assignment. Project costs make provisions for
the appointment of the expatriate technical director for three years, with
one additional year as an advisor to a Senegalese technical director. The
organizational specialist, to assist in planning and evaluation, would be
appointed for three years, and the administrative officer for two years. The
expatriate chiefs of the crop husbandry, animal husbandry and training divi-
sions would be appointed for the first two years, with full executive res-
ponsibi:Lities for their divisions, and would remain as advisors to their
Senegalese replacements for one additional year. While it is expected that
Senegalization of all project positions would be completed by PY 4, there is
already competition for good managers in the public and private sectors and a
shortage of qualified managers with agricultural experience and it may take
longer than 4 years to complete the Senegalization of all project positions.
SODEVA's managerial performance would be monitored closely during project
execution to ensure that its record of good administration would continue. Terms
cf reference for the expatriate staff are in Annex 11.
3.22      During negotiations, assurances were obtained that Government
vould: (a) provide SODEVA with suitable qualified senior and mi-ddle level
staff and (b) allow SODEVA the opportunity to refuse and return Government
staff it considers unsuitable for the project. Assurances were also obtained
that SODEVA's appointments to the positions of project manager, technical
director, administrative officer and his deputy for credit, organizational
specialist and the chiefs of the crop, animal husbandry and training divisions
during PY 1 and PY 5 would be of persons with qualifications, experience,
terms of reference, and conditions of service acceptable to the Bank Group.
3.23      Coordination with Other Agencies - SODEVA would work closely with
cooperatives in the project area, with the Ministry of Rural Development's
Agricultural and Veterinary Departments and their associated agricultural and
veterinary research organizations on crop and animal husbandry investigations,
and with SODEFITEX for cotton production. SODEVA has already established
effective working relations with these departments and agencies and no formal
agreements would be required. With regard to input supplies, Government
has agreed to cause ONCAD to appoint a senior manager to be responsible for
deliveries to the project area.

IV. COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS
A. Cost Estimates
4.01      Project cost estimates are based on mid-1975 prices.  A physical
contingency of 10% is allowed on all costs except personnel and consultants.
A total price contingency of 26% is included to cover expected price increases
on local and foreign cost items, including physical contingencies. Costs
include direct taxes and import duties amounting to US$2.9 million or 9% of
total costs. The total expected cost of the project is US$30.9 million with
a foreign exchange component of US$3.9 million or 13%. The following table

Percentage                          20      45      29     6    100
4.03      The Bank would make a loan of US$7.0 million for a term of 20 years,
including a five-year grace period, and IDA a credit of US$7 million on
standard terms. Additional financing of US$8.,9 million would be provided by
the CCCE. The proposed Bank loan and IDA credit would cover the foreign
exchange costs (US$3.9 million) and US$10.1 million (42%) of the local costs
for a total of 50% of project costs, net of taxes and duties (US$28 million).
The CCCE loan would be for a term of 20 years, including a five-year grace
period, with interest at an annual rate of 3.5%. A condition of effectiveness
of the Bank loan and IDA credit would be that the CCCE loan had been declared
effective.



- 16 -
4.04      Since SODEVA would not have its own revenues and vould carry out
the project on Government's behalf, the Bank and CCCE loans and the IDA
credit (US$22.9 million) plus Government's contribution to SODEVA's costs of
US$4.2 million would be passed on as grants. In addition, Government would
provide SODEVA with an interest-free loan of CFAF 200 million (US$889,000);
equivalent to about three months of its expenditures, as working capital for
the project. Conditions of effectiveness would be that Government and SODEVA
had entered into an agreement satisfactory to the Bank Group under which
SODEVA is charged with the responsibility of carrying out the project and
that SODEVA had received the loan of CFAF 200 million.
4.05      Over recent years SODEVA has been successful in obtaining foreign
assistance and, as a consequence, Government financing for its budget declined
from 43% to 30% between 1973 and 1974 (Annex 4). However, most of the external
assistance has been for relatively short periods, two to four years, and its
continuation is uncertain. If SODEVA is to extend its activities beyond the
five-year period of the proposed project -- in order to increase output from
project farms beyond the levels achieved by this project and to assist addi-
tional farmers -- it would need an assured source of financing. Assuming its
activities to continue at the level reached by the end of the project, the
amounts required would be on the order of CFAF 850 million (US$3.8 million)
in 1975 terms or CFAF 1.2 billion (US$5.3 million) in 1980 prices. An assur-
ance was obtained from Government that by PY3 it would review with the Bank
Group, in the light of plans for SODEVA's future operations, the finance that
would be required for this purpose and the means of providing it, including
regular Government budgetary support as may be necessary (para 2.17).
4.06      Incremental farm inputs would be financed as follows:  Governnent
would contribute US$2.1 million in the form of subsidies for fertilizers and
insecticides; and BNDS would finance short- and medium-term credit totalling
US$1.8 million.
C. Credit Arrangements
4.07      Credit to farmers would be channelled through cooperatives.  The
amount of credit available to each cooperative is limited by its average
level of marketed groundnuts. As the number of project participants increases,
their incremental credit requirements may, in the short run, exceed the
ceilings set for individual cooperatives. An assurance was obtained that,
should BNDS's limits on cooperative indebtedness prevent BNDS from providing
financial assistance to any cooperative under the Project, the Government
would review these conditions with the Bank Group and make arrangements to
ensure adequate financing of the cooperative concerned.
4.08      BNDS would finance the credit to farmers, using in part the roll-
over fund created by Credits 140-SE and 404-SE and funds borrowed on favor-
able terms from the Central Bank of the West African Monetary Union (currently



- 17 -
5.5%). Medium-term loans (five years), and short-term loans vould finance
all costs, respectively, of implements for animal traction and of seasonal
inputs. Under the terms of Credit 404-SE, the loans would bear
interest at 2.0% above the Central Bank rate. The effective interest rate
for seasonal loans would be on the order of 12% to 16% since the nominal
rate is charged on an annual basis while the loans must actually be repaid
within six to nine months. An assurance was obtained from Government that
it would cause BNDS to provide sufficient funds and to lend them to project
farmers on these terms and conditions.
D. Procurement
4.09      Vehicles, equipment and civil works expenditures vould total about
US$2.15 million. Contracts for buildings, equipment and vehicles for more
than US$50,000, aggregating about US$400,000, would be awarded on the basis
of international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank Group's
guidelines for procurement. Locally manufactured goods vould be allowed a
preference of 15% or the level of applicable import duty, whichever is lover,
when comparing domestic with foreign bids. Contracts for less than US$50,000,
totalling US$1.6 million, including the bulk of civil works contracts which
are small and widely scattered, would be awarded on the basis of competitive
bidding advertised locally and in accordance with local procedures, which are
satisfactory to the Bank Group. The remaining equipment purchases, in amounts
less than US$10,000 and totalling US$150,000, would include office and house
furnishings and equipment for agricultural demonstrations and vould be pur-
chased chiefly from local sources. Consultant services, totalling about
US$200,000, would be obtained according to the Bank Group's normal procedures.
The balance of projects costs would be for personnel and management, US$24.9
million, and for farm inputs, US$3.69 million, and would be unsuîtable for
competitive bidding.
E. Disbursements
4.10      The proceeds of the IDA credit and the Bank loan would be disbursed
to cover 60% of:
(a) the costs for project buildings, vehicles, equipment and
furnishings--US$1.0 million;
(b) the salaries of project staff employed under contract by
SODEVA and allowances for all project staff--US$7.5 million;
and
(c) SODEVA's other project operating costs--US$2.0 million.



- 18 -
The IDA credit and the Bank loan would be disbursed pari passu with the CCCE
loan in the ratio 60:40 so that the credit and the two loans would together
cover 100% of the costs of the above items. The balance of the !DA credit
and the Bank loan would cover 100% of the foreign eychange costs of the
consultants (US$160,000), and a contingency reserve of US$3.3 million. Dis-
bursements would be against contracts and certified statements of expenditures
prepared by SODEVA and would include a charge for SODEVA's Dakar headquarters
calculated as 10% of all project personnel and other operating costs. It would
be a condition of disbursement against this item that SODEVA's annual headquarters
expenditures and financing arrangements would be acceptable to the Bank Group,
and an assurance was obtained that SODEVA would submit its headquarters budget
to the B`ank Group, at least three months prior to the beginning of the finan-
cial year. Any funds remaining undisbursed upon completion of the project
would be cancelled. Government's contribution to project costs would be in
the form of civil servants' salaries paid directly from the central budget,
and subsidies for farm inputs. Details of disbursements are in Annex 13.
F.  Accounts and Audit
4.11      SODEVA would keep records consistent with sound accounting prac-
tices and adequate to reflect is operations and financial conditions and
would employ independent auditors. Assurances were obtained that:
(a) SODEVA would appoint auditors with qualifications and
experience acceptable to the Bank Group;
(b)  SODEVA would maintain separate accounts for the project;
and
(c) copies of SODEVA's accounts and the auditors' reports thereon
would be submitted to the Bank Group within six months of the
end of the financial year; the auditor's report would be of
such scope and in such detail as the Bank Group may reasonably
have requested.
V.  YIELDS AND OUTPUT, MARKETS, FARMERS' BENEFITS
AND GOVERNMENT REVENUES
A. Yields and Output
5.01      Cos.  Farmers in the two project zones (para 3.02) are expected
to develop their crop yields and production as follows:



- 19 -
Crop                           Yield (kg/ha)                Production ('000 tons)
South          North             Annual Incremental
PYO  PY5      PYO        PY5                PY5
Groundnuts                900  1,100    700       1,000                27
Cotton                    800  1,200       -          -                 1
Maize                       -  2,400       -          -                15
S*rghum                   850  1,700    700       1,300                 9
Millet                    900  1,000    700         900                 7
It is expected that, without the project, yields would not exceed those for
PYO (para 2.09). Estimates of incremental production are based, therefore,
on yield improvements between PYO and PY5, and on the phasing outlined in
Annex 14. Yield and output estimates also allow for a drought every fourth
year.
5.02      Livestock - Under the project, growth rates for stall fattened
cattle would be about 500 grams/day, compared to an average of about 150
grams/day under traditional grazing methods. Calves weaned and reared on
the project would have a mortality rate of about 20% compared to about 35%
outside the project, and breeding coews would produce about 350 liters of milk
per annum, some 200 liters more than the present average for the project area,
and their calving rate would increase from 60% to 80%. The project's annual
incremental output by PY 5 would be 1,500 tons of beef, 6,000 calves, and
1,600 tons of milk (Annex 7).
B. Markets and Prices
5.03      Cereals - Most of the 400,000 to 500,000 tons of domestically
produced cereals are for subsistence consumption. Urban requirements are
met largely from rice and wheat imports of between 300,000 and 400,000 tons
annually.  Local production has been encouraged by the withdrawal of the
consumer subsidy for imported cereals (para 2.12), which has greatly improved
the prospects for marketing surpluses. The official farmgate price for millet
and sorghum is CFAF 30/kg and for maize CFAF 35/kg. These prices are about
CFAF 5/kg below their current economîc value based on import substitution.
However, project financial calculations have been based conservatively on
1980 farmgate prices of CFAF 28/kg for millet and sorghum and CFAF 30/kg for
maize. Further details on the cereal market are in Annex 15.
5.04      Groundnuts - ONCAD has a marketing monopoly for groundnuts, which
it buys through cooperatives and sells to domestic processors. After proces-
sing, all the groundnut cake and 80% of the groundnut oil is exported. Over
the last 10 years, the crop has fluctuated between about 500,000 and 1 million
tons. Marketing arrangements are satisfactory, and world market prospects
are fair, despite expected declines in prices over the next three years, from
about US$580/ton to about US$300/ton (in 1974 terms). The current farmgate



- 20 -
price is CFAF 41.5/kg. At this level, and after taking account of production
costs and subsidies, the amount retained by the stabilization Fund represents
about 1/3 of the farmers net income from groundnuts.  However, in line with the
sharp decline expected in world market prices, it is expected that farmgate
prices will have to decline in real terms to about CFAF 27/kg by 1980; this
price would continue to provide adequate incentives to project farmers and
has been used for the project's financial projections (Annex 15, Table 3).
5.05      Cotton - SODEFITEX has a marketing monopoly for cotton and all
project output would have a ready local or export market. During the boom
in commodity prîces, world market prices for cotton fiber reached USi83.6/lb
and seed about US$160/ton. In response to the improved prices, Government
raised the official farmgate price for seed cotton from CFAF 30/kg in 1973
to CFAF 46.5/kg in 1974. Even so, the effective tax rate on farmers is about
45%. However, by 1977, world prices for fiber and seed are expected to fall
in 1974 terms to US,52/lb and US$140/ton respectively.  As a result, it is
expected that Government revenues will be allowed to fall in an effort to
maintain the producer price in real terms at its current level, and to keep
the taxation rates on cotton and groundnuts at similar levels. Project finan-
cial projections have been based, therefore, on a farmgate price continuing
at CFAF 46.5/kg.
5.06      Livestock Products - Meat consumption in Senegal is about 76,000
tons, of which some 20% is made up of imported cattle, sheep, and goats from
Mauritania. Prospects for increasing output of livestock over at least the
next five years are poor, because of the losses in breeding herds during the
recent droughts. These have already been reflected in Dakar cattle prices
that have increased since 1970 from about CFAF 100/kg liveweight to about
CFAF 145/kg liveweight. The farmgate prices used for beef cattle and milk
for the project's economic and financial analysis are the current market prices
and are equivalent, in 1974 terms, to CFAF 100/kg liveweight for beef cattle,
CFAF 12,000 for a two-year old calf and CFAF 25/liter for milk.
5.07      Current official prices for cotton, groundnuts and cereals provide
sufficient incentives to farmers. Adequate incentives would continue to be
required for the project and, therefore, official farmgate prices would need
to be monitored carefully. During negotiations, assurances were obtained
that Government would follow a policy of fixing the prices of groundnuts and
of cotton at levels advantageous to the growers, that it would promptly inform
the Bank Group of any decision to establish subsidies on imported cereals, and
that it would consult annually with the Bank and the Association on the prices
to be paid to producers for groundnuts, cotton, and cereals.
C. Farmers' Benefits
5.08      Project farmers would obtain substantially increased incomes.  Because
of the larger farm size and a more rellable rainfall, incomes are expected to



- 23 -
VII. AGREENEENTS REACHED AND RECOOENDATION
7.01      During negotiations, assurances were obtained that SODEVA would:
(a)  consult with the Bank Group on the fertilizer study findings and
theit implications on the project (para. 3.11);
(b) provide the Bank Group with a detailed evaluation report on the
project's progress within six months of the end of each cropping
season; and it would employ consultants with experience, quali-
fications and terms of reference acceptable to the Bank to design
the evaulation system and analyze the data (para. 3.16);
(c) appoint to the positions of project manager, technical director,
administrative officer and his deputy for credit organizational
specialist, and the chiefs of the crop husbandry, animal husbandry
and training divisions during PY 1 to PY 5, persons with quali-
fications, experience, terms of reference, and conditions of service
acceptable to the Bank Group (para. 3.22);
(d)  submit its headquarters budget to the Bank Group at least three
months prior to the beginning of the financial year (para 4.10);
and
(e) appoint auditors acceptable to the Bank Group; it would maintain
separate accounts for the project and copies of the accounts and
auditors' reports thereon would be submitted to the Bank Group
within six months of the end of the financial year; the auditor's
report would be of such scope and in such detail as the Bank Group
may reasonably have requested (para. 4.11).
7.02      During negotiations, assurances were obtained that Government
would:
(a) follow a policy of progressive adoption of prices reflecting
the full costs of implements and fertilizers and consult
annually with the Bank Group on prices to be set for the next
campaign (para. 2.13-2.14);
(b)  exploy consultants for the cereal marketing study with qualifications,
experience and terms of reference acceptable to Government and the
Bank Group (para. 3.17);
(c) review the results of the cereal marketing and storage study with
Bank Croup (para. 3.17);



- 24 -
(d)  provide suitable qualified senior and middle level staff to SODEVA;
SODEVA would have an opportunity to refuse and return Government
staff it considers unsuitable (para. 3.22);
(e)  cause ONCAD to appoint a senior manager to be responsible for
deliveries of inputs to the project area (para. 3.23);
(f)  review, with the Bank Croup, arrangements for providing regular
Government financial support for SODEVA to maintain and/or expand
i,ts activities (para. 4.05);
(g)  review BNDS' limits on cooperative indebtedness and make arrange-
ments for adequate financing of project cooperatives should these
limits prove to be an obstacle to project implementation (para. 4.07);
(h)  c:ause BNDS to lend to project farmers on terms and conditions
agreed under Credit 404-SE (para. 4.08); and
(i)  promptly inform the Bank Group of any decision to establish
subsidies on the retail price of imported cereals and consult
annually with the Bank Group on the prices paid to producers for
groundnuts, cotton, and cereals (para. 5.07).
7.03      Conditions of effectiveness would be that:
(a)  t;he loan agreement between Government and CCCE had become effective
(para. 4.03); and
(b)  Government and SODEVA had entered into an agreement to carry out
t'ie project and Government had provided SODEVA with CFAF 200
million (US$889,000) as working capital for the project.
7.04      A condition of disbursement against expenditures for SODEVA's Dakar
headquarters would be that SODEVA's annual headquarters expenditures and
financing arrangements would be acceptable to the Bank Group (para. 4.10).
7.05      I.'ith the above assurances and conditions, the proposed project is
suitable for a Bank loan of US$7.0 million and an IDA credit of US$7.0
ndillion.



ANNEX 1

SENEGAL
SINE SALOUI AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
PROGRESS OF AGRICULTURAL PROJECTS
FINANCED BY THE BANK
A.   Loan 584 SE - Agricultural Credit, US$3.5 million eauivalent
(Feb. 10, 1969); Credit 140 SE - Agricultural Credit, US$6.0 million
equivalent (Feb. 10, 1969).
The project consists of improving groundnut and millet production
in the Groundnut Basin area, by financing farm implements and by strengthen-
ing the National Development Bank of Senegal (BNDS), the Agricultural Develop-
ment Authority for the Groundnut Basin (SODEVA), and the Office of Coopera-
tives and Development Assistance (ONCAD). The loan and credit became effec-
tive on June 25, 1969. The loan portion of the project was cancelled in 1971,
when demand for farm implements declined sharply because of drought and re-
duced producer prices for groundnuts. Disbursements of the IDA Credit for
farm implements should be completed in 1975, 2 years behind appraisal esti-
mates. The performance of BNDS and SODEVA has improved during the project;
the management of ONCAD has been weak, but assistance is continuing under
the second agricultural credit project.
B.   Credit 404 SE - Second Agricultural Credit,
US$8.2 million equivalent (June 25, 1973).
The project comprises a countrywide extension of Government's farm
credit program that was supported by Credit 140 SE. The Second Credit makes
provision for medium-term credit through BNDS for the purchase by farmers of
draft animals and animal-drawn implements, continuing technical assistance to
ONCAD and SODEVA, and research and training programs. The credit became
effective on October 30, 1973. Groundnut production is rising again after
the disastrous drought of 1972/73, as is the output of food crops. The use
of animal traction is spreading and the demand for medium-term credit is
likely to be above appraisal estimates. ONCAD is being reorganized following
serious cost control and financial difficulties. ONCAD's difficulties have
arisen from over-staffing and weak management, Government's inadequate pro-
cedures to finance subsidies for farm inputs, and the failure on the part of
ONCAD to stress the seriousness of its financial problems. Government has
recently reviewed ONCAD's accounts. It is aware of the gravity of the sit-
uation and is working out measures with IDA to place ONCAD on a sound finan-
cial footing; principal among these, will be improvements in management and
t'e establishment of appropriate financing procedures to cover the cost of
subsidies. The abolition of the subsidy on imported rice in November 1974
should also reduce the burden on ONCAD's finances.

C.   Credit 252 SE - Casamance Rice. US$3.7 million equivalent (June 18, 1974).
Good management and adequate rainfalls ensured good crops for
groundnut and rice, which are well above appraisal estimates. The number of
farziers participating is expanding at a faster pace than anticipated and their
response is good.  Housing and offices were conmîssioned early in 1975, three
months behind schedule. Road improvement program is in progress, but most
of the improvement of bottomland for rice cultivation probably will not be
implemented, because of lack of funds and of technîcal expertise. The proiect
has incurred some cost overruns, mainly because extension staff were increased
to cope with good farmers' response, and because of salary increases. In
addition, changes in the US$ exchange rate would cause a loss equivalent to
US$900,000. As a result, the project would be short of funds at the end of
1975, instead of 1976. Governnent intends to ask the BANK/IDA to finance a
new project in the same area starting early CY 1976.  Terms of reference for
the preparation of this second project have been proposed to Governnment.
RNWA would coordinate that preparation, and appraisal is tentatively scheduled
for July, 1975.
D.   Credit 254 SE - Terres Neuves Resettlement,
US$1.3 million ecquivalent (June 18, 1974).
The project's settlement program was completed in 1974 as antici-
pated at appraisal. Adequate and evenly distributed rainfall ensured good
crops last season. The project has been successful in providing higher
incomes than expected for settlers and has attracted more active people than
anticipated in 1974. STN has taken over project management from the manage-
ment agency agreed upon at appraisal. This change, together with personnel
shifts, have caused managerial and administrative problems that are not yet
solved.  The project's accounts have been audited recently.  Government's
contribution has been paid in full, and the previous financial difficulties
encountered by the project are now overcome.
E.   Credit 350 SE - River Polders
US$4.5 million (January 9, 1973)
The project, as appraised, comprised expanding irrigated rice cul-
tivation in the Senegal River Delta by constructing a fully controlled irri-
gation system at Dagana to increase the irrigated area by 2,730 ha, and by
improving polder flood irrigation in Debi and Lampsar. The credit became
effective on June 8, 1973. Progress on the Dagana polder is satisfactory,
and the total area to be irrigated and double-cropped has been increased
from 2,730 ha to 3,200 ha. At Government's request, the Debi and Lampsar
polder components are being reformulated within the broader framework of
integrated development of the Senegal River Basin and have been deleted
from the ongoing project. An engineering credit for the Debi and Lampsar
polder development was approved in April, 1975. The total cost of the
expanded Dagana component, however, has increased overall project costs from



ANNEX 1
Page 3
US$7.4 to US$9.3 million because of the increased area irrigated and general
inflation since appraisal. The rate of return for this component, nevertheless,
remains satisfactory and IDA agreed on October 18, 1974 to reallocate savings
from the Debi and Lampsar components to help cover cost increases for the
Dagana polder.
F.   Credit 446 SE - Drought Relief Fund,
US$3.0 million equivalent (December 7, 1973)
This two-year project is part of an IDA credit to six West African
countries severely affected by drought. In the Senegal project, individual
subprojects are funded through a Drought Relief Fund account at BNDS; they
include support for well repair brigades, veterinary services, fire-brigades,
firebreaks, pump rehabilitation, and funding for a coordinating committee
secretariat. The credit became effective on February 5, 1974. The project
is being implemented satisfactorily.

SINE SALOUM AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
THE NATIONAL OFFICE FOR COOPERATIVES A1iD
DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE (ONCAD)
Background
1.        The Office National de Cooperation et d'Assistance pour la
Developpement (ONCAD) was established in 1966 to take over assistance to
cooperatives from regional farmers' organizations, the Centres Regionaux
d'Assistance au Developpement (CRAD), which had been inefficient. In addi-
tion, in 1967/68 ONCAD was given responsibility for the procurement of farm
inputs to cooperatives and the monopoly for purchasing groundnuts collected
by cooperatives and selling them to the Office de Commercialisation Agricole
du Senegal (OCAS), which was responsible for groundnut exports or delivery
to local oil mills and for rice imports and commercialization in Senegal.
In 1971 the Government decided to have all commercial groundnuts processed
in local oil mills and, in November 1971, it dissolved OCAS and transferred
its assets and its responsibilities for rice import and marketing to ONCAD.
Objectives and Organization
2.        ONCAD is a public corporation supervised by the Ministries of
Rural Development and Finance. It is governed by a Board of Directors with
19 members including representatives of the President of the Republic, of
the Ministries of Commerce, Rural Development and Finance; of the Governors
of the seven regions; and four representatives of cooperatives. Its Director
General is appointed by decree of the President of the Republic and the
Minister of Rural Development.
ONCAD's objectives are presently: (a) to assist and supervise
cooperatives and pre-cooperatives, (b) to commercialize groundnuts and basic
agricultural products, (c) to supervise rice imports, storage and distribu-
tion, (d) to transport and commercialize agricultural products collected by
cooperatives and agricultural development agencies, (e) to procure and deliver
to cooperatives fertilizers, farm implements and oxen, and (f) to handle,
store and distribute groundnut seeds to farmers.
ONCADReognization under the First and Second Agricultural Credit Projects
3.        When the First Agricultural Credit Project was appraised, it appeared
that ONCAD. which was overstaffed and inefficiently run, should be reorganized.
Consequently, funds were provided under Credits 140-SE to help pay for the
services of consultants to study and make recommendations on management and
staff structure, training, accounting, transportation of groundnuts and inputs,
and management of the groundnut seed stockpile.



ANNEX 2
Page 2
4.        ONCAD's ability to carry out its functions has generally improved.
It is now able to handle groundnut marketing, pay farmers on time, and re-
cover credit adequately, although it still has difficulties in organizing
the delivery of inputs to farmers. However, the more specific objectives
of the reorganization have not been achieved: ONCAD continues to be over-
staffed (more than 2,000 permanent staff); operating costs are high; accounting
procedures recommended by the consultants have not been implemented; and
accounts are incorrect and issued only after unacceptable delays. Moreover
ONCAD?s resources have been run down to the point that it is presently very
much dependent on the Central Bank's continued support. Recovery of outstand-
ing claims against Government of CFAF 5.8 billion would reduce the current
financial gap to an amount between CFAF 1.7 billion and CFAF 2.5 billion,
depending on the status of certain receivables and inventory losses.
5.        In effect the financial situation at ONCAD is the direct result of
Government's price policy for cereals and fertilizers, which up to recently
were sold below their market value. The Stabilization Fund and Government
are supposed to reimburse ONCAD for the differences in prices and subsidies,
but they are slow to do so, while ONCAD has to pay immediately a levy on
groundnuts to the Fund. As a result, ONCAD had to bear high overdraft charges
(CFAF 1.2 billion, i.e. US$5.0 million), which in strict sense should have
been borne, that is paid, by the Stabilization Fund.
6.        Credit 140-SE did not provide for an audit of ONCAD's accounts, and
delays in implementing this requirement under Credit 404-SE meant that the
magnitude of the problem was not revealed until mid-1974 when the Controller's
Committee of the Supreme Court began to audit the 1971-72 accounts. Although
the consultants could have been expected to provide some warning of the
deteriorating financial situation, they never had executive power to enforce
their recommendations on accounting procedures which went largely ignored
by ONCAD's management.
7.        Following the preliminary conclusions of the audit of ONCAD's
account and the recommendations of the most recent IDA Supervision mission,
the Government has taken a series of encouraging steps towards improving
ONCAD's managerial and financial position:
(a)  As of November 1, 1974, the Government announced new
consumer and farmgate prices for the principal
agricultural commodities, substantially in line with
the level of world market prices. In particular, it
has fixed the consumer price of rice at CFAF 10Q/kg
(compared with CFAF 52/kg previously), thereby
eliminating the consumer subsidy on rice. This
measure, which is in line with IDA's view, is a major
and most encouraging step towards eliminating one of
the important causes of ONCAD's financial difficulties
since it should now require much less overdrafts and
depend much less on timely payments of subsidies by
Government;



.A.NNLX 2
Page 3
(b) ONCAD has appointed a new chief accountant and has
hired an expatriate chartered accountant to review
accounting procedures which have been considerablv
streamlined; and
(c) more flexibility has been introduced in ONCAD's
remiuneration system to put it in line with that
of private enterprises, which should help in the
recruitment and retention of competent local staff.
8.        IDA has confirmed its support of Government's action, especially
the new agricultural commodity pricing which IDA has urged be extended to
fertilizers and farm implements.  IDA has also urged Governnent to promptly
clarify ONCAD's financial situation, particularly as regards the settling
of accounts due.

SENEGAL
SINE SALOUM AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF CROP PRODUCTION
A.   Background
1.        The agricultural economy of Sine Saloum is dominated by millet
and sorghum for subsistence, and groundnuts as a cash crop; because of their
relative drought tolerance, these crops are well adapted to the local ecol-
ogy. The south of the project area (Zone 1) has good scope for diversifica-
tion into cotton, rice, maize and tobacco.
2.        Traditionally, groundnuts ahd millet were grown with hand tools
and without fertilizer. Yields averaged 800 kg/ha for unshelled groundnut,
and 400 kg/ha for millet. The most important early development was the
improvement of groundnut seed (variety 28-206). In the early 1960's, this
was followed by a Government supported program to increase agricultural
productivity. This program, known as Programme Agricole (PA), has evolved
into a comprehensive system of farm support services.
3.         heminimumacka!  promoted under FA was derived from the results
of agricultural research. The main components of the package are:
(a) Improved seeds: Seed of the improved groundnut
varieties is multiplied by the Ministry of Rural
Development and distributed by ONCAD. Farmers
apply fungicide to it after shelling and sow at
the rate of 100 kg/ha.
(b)         DrawnImlements:  Farmers obtain credit
for seeders and hoes drawn by donkeys, horses or
oxen. This equipment enables farmers to improve
yields because of timely seeding and hoeing;
extend the area under cropping; and reduce labor
peaks during the critical period of seeding and
first weeding.
(c) Fertilization: The soils of Senegal are deficient
in phosphorus; they become deficient in potassium
after several years of cropping; and they lack
nitrogen for non-legume crops. The extension
services have been promoting the use of fertilizer
as recommended by the Institute of Tropical Agri-
cultural Research (Institut de Recherche Agronomique
Tropicales - IRAT), to correct basic soil deficien-
cies and improve yields.  These recommendations call



ANNEX 3
Page 2
for the application of 150 kg/hia of mixed fertilizers
(6-20-10 for groundnuts, 14-7-7 for millet and sor-
ghum).
4.        PA has been successful in terrs of its adoption by farmers.
SODEVA estimates that some 80% of farmers in the Groundnut Basin have
benefited from the program; ONCAD now distributes about 100,000 tons of
groundnut seed a year; and Senegal has also made more progress in draft
animal cultivation than any other West African country. While fertilizer
use has expanded, consumption fluctuates in response to both droughts and
price changes (Graph 9237). Under PA, however, fertilizer recommendations
have not taken sufficient account of the low response of groundnuts, parti-
cularly in drier areas, and with recent price increases, existing recommen-
dations are not sufficiently flexible to take account of adjustments re-
quired by price fluctuations and droughts.
5.        The impact of PA on cron yields and production is more difficult
to assess. Craphs 9238 and 9239 show the production and yields of groundnut
and cereals (millet and sorghum) in the Groundnut Basin from the inception
of PA to date. Groundnut yields and production increased from 1960 to 1965,
when average yields reached 900 - 1,000 kg/ha. This increase can be credited
in part to PA, and in part to the gradual southward shift of cultivation in
the Groundnut Basin to higher rainfall areas. Ilowever, yields and produc-
tion dropped, concurrently with fertilizer use, with the onset of droughts
and a reduction in groundnut prices. Subsequently, groundnut yields have
fluctuated with rainfall (Graph 9239), and the droughts and price reductions
have blunted the earlier impact of PA. Recent studies suggest that ground-
nut yields may be declining irrespective of fluctuations of weather and in-
put use. If this is true, the explanation is not clear. Two possible causes
are: (a) soil depletion under increasing population pressure; and/or (b) the
failure of farmers to fully apply all the recorurendations of PA.  Contrary
to groundnut yields, however, millet and sorghum yields (Graph 9239) show
a slight gradual increase, possibly reflecting an increase in fertilizer
use and improved technology.
6.        This evidence suggests that productivity under PA may have reached a
ceiling for groundnuts, and may soon reach a ceiling for cereals. Increases
in productivity require further advances in farm management and technology.
The need for such advances is particularly pressing in the northwest of the
Sine Saloum, where population pressure has led to a decrease in fallow, and
to a deterioration of farm revenues that are already among the lowest of the
country. The elements of new farm recommendations have been successfully
tested by SODEVA, especially in the pilot project (Annex 5).
B.   The New Package
7.        Ihe proposed package has two main components:  plowing, and a more
comprenensive fertilization program. It requires a major investment in draft



ANNEX 3
Page 3
animals, implements, and stump removal. Farmers adopting this new package
also have to follow the basic recommendations of the minimum package of PA.
Plowing
8.        The sandy and sandy loam soils of the Sudanian zone are character-
ized by poor tilth, as they harden during the dry season (the small clay
fraction acts as cement). As a result, crops develop a shallow root system
when grown with superficial land preparation, and they are poorly equipped
to withstand drought. Moreover, the poor tilth of the soil limits its
capacity for storing available water, and IRAT has shown that plowing does
increase yields by encouraging a deeper root system and promoting better
utilization of rainfall. The following average yields were achieved with plow-
ing (for farmers that follow the minimum package) in research plots set up
on farmers' fields:

/1   Based on 1975 economic-farmgate prices (Annex 15, Table 1-3).
9.        The major obstacle to the adoption of plowing is the presence of
stumps.  The number of stumps, bushes and small trees ranges from practically
nil, in certain areas of northwest of Sine Saloum, to an average of 3,000/
ha in the south. Besides preventing correct plowing, the stumps slow down
the work of animal-drawn implements for seeding and weeding, cause more
frequent breakdowns, and encourage pest infestations by providing shelters
for parasites. Stump removal is thus a prerequisite to the adoption of the
new package. It requires 50 to 100 mandays/ha and the cost is CFAF 3,000 -
6,000 if supplemental labor has to be hired. The land tenure implications
of stump removal are discussed in Annex 6.
10.       Because the soil hardens during the dry season, plowing is pos-
sible only at the end of the cropping season immediately after harvest, or



ANNEX 3
Page 4
after the first rains before seeding at the beginning of the cropping sea-
son. Plowing is recommended once every three or four years, as the resi-
dual effects are felt for several years. It is best to plow ahead of a
grain crop, because grain gives a better response to plowing than ground-
nuts.  It is possible that several plowing cycles might change the soil
structure sufficiently to make it possible to plow during the dry season.
Prospects for dry season plowing would be investigated in cooperation with
IRAT as part of the project. Recent developments in Nigeria under comparable
ecological conditions suggest that minimum tillage could give similar yields
as plowing but at lower cost. Under the project, SODEVA would investigate
minimum tillage, as an economical alternative to plowing, in liaison with
IRAT.
Fertilization
11.       Fertilizer recommendations under PA require adjustments to optimize
returns. IRAT has found that the main soil deficiency, which is phosphorus,
can be minimized by a basic application of 400 kg/ha of rock phosphate before
the first plowing of fields after stump clearing. This application of low
cost, unprocessed phosphate which is produced in the country, supplemnented
by regular applications of soluble phosphate in the regular fertilizer, assures
correction of the deficiency. It rernains to be determined whether regular
applications of phosphate in fertilizer will always be necessary, at least
at current levels. The maintenance fertilization program recommended by IRAT
is as follows (with the compound fertilizer applied at seeding, and urea side
dressed at the early stages of growth).

ANNEX 3
Page 5
12.       Fertilizer recommendations for groundnuts have undergone a suc-
cession of adjustments. In 1973 they called for the application of 150
kg/ha of 6-20-10 under the minimum package, and 150 kg/ha of 8-18-17 under
the new package.  In early 1974, the Ministry of Rural Development decided
to switch to a uniform recommendation of 150 kg/ha 8-18--27 for both packages.
In the light of recent results obtained by IRAT, SODEVA is reducing the fer-
tilizer application on groundnuts from 150 kg/ha to 100 kg/ha of 8-18-27.
The main difference between the former minimum package (150 kg/ha of 6-20-10)
and the present intensification program (100 kg/ha of 8-18-27) in terms of
nutrients (in kg/ha of N-P2 O5-K20)  for groundnuts is:
-    former minimum package ....... 9-30-15 1/
-    present intensification ...... 8-18-27
The change is insignificant for nitrogen; the phosphorus rate is decreased,
but phosphorus requirements of groundnuts are low and the soil receives a
corrective dose of rock phosphate; the rate for potassium, to which ground-
nut is most responsive, is increased substantially. The new package thus
better reflects the fertilizer requirements of groundnuts. In the case of
grain crops, the new package emphasizes nitrogen, which also better re-
flects the fertilizer requirements of these crops. The programn also gives
more flexibility: it makes allowance for the drier environment of the north
(Zone 2) and enables farmers to cut down on urea applications if the early
season rains fail.
13.       Data from experiments on farmers' fields indicate the following
average yields brought about by different rates of fertilization (for plowed
crops with improved practices):

Groundnuts are not included, as the new fertilizer recommendation would
represent a reduction in cost. These benefits suggest that the new fer-

14.       Present fertilizer recommendations satisfy fertility requirements
but may not maximize economic returns, and this aspect of the recommendation
needs substantial review. In Zone 2 of the project area, which has low and
irregular rainfall, fertilization may not always be economical. In Zone 1,
the recommended rates of 8-18-27 and urea on maize may not optimize returns
and there is a need for a fertilizer program for this purpose, taking account
of fertilizer and crop prices, and crop responses as affected by rainfall
probabilities. This will be the subject of a study to be carried out by
SODEVA and financed by IDA under credit 404-SE. While the fertilizer pro-
gram formulated for the Sine Saloum project is reasonable, SODEVA would
adjust its recommendations in the light of the findings of this study.
Rotations
15.       Farmers in the project area usually grow about 1.5 ha of ground-
nuts for every hectare of millet (or sorghum). This means that in many in-
stances groundnuts follow groundnuts in the rotation. Under the program,
this ratio would be reduced gradually to about 1:1, as experience has shown
that the most desirable rotation is grain-groundnuts-grain-groundnuts, with
plowing and rock phosphate application before the first grain crop. Cotton
would substitute for groundnuts on part of the fields in Zone 1, and the
rotation would be flexible, for farmers to take advantage of crop price
fluctuations with the exception that groundnuts would not be grown for more
than two years in succession because of the risks of soil erosion and pest
attacks. The main rotations would be:
(a)  South (Zone 1) - maize-groundnut or cotton-sorghum-groundnut; and
(b) North (Zone 2) - sorghum-groundnut-millet-groundnut



ANNEX 3

Soil Conservation
16.       Stump removal and plowing would increase the danger of soil erosion
after groundnuts are harvested, as the soil would lose its natural cover of
trees and bushes. To protect the soil against water erosion, which would become
a problem on sloping land because of the high-intensity rains that fall before
the new crops develop sufficiently to cover the soil, SODEVA would promote
strip cropping and contour plowing. Farmers on sloping land would be required
to alternate their crops on strips that would not exceed 30 meters in width
and to plow following master contour lines constructed with the assistance
of SODEVA at 60 meter intervals, using the standard plow.
17.       To compensate for the increased possibilities of wind erosion, the
project would finance a tree planting program. SODEVA would encourage farmers
to plant neem, eucalyptus, and acacia trees as windbreaks and for fuel and
forage. As an initial step, SODEVA would have its own tree nursery, but it
would at the same time encourage farmers to establish their own small nurseries.
The target would be to provide about 90 trees for each hectare of cleared land.
Since the program would depend on the full cooperation of farmers in the pro-
ject area, planting material would be provided free of charge.
C.   Farm Development
18.       For farmers implementing fully the recommendations of Programme
Agricole, the switch from the minimum package to higher levels to technology
would be made in two stages:
a.   farmers would introduce ox-traction for seeding and weeding
and use an intermediate level of fertilization for millet
(150 kg/ha of 14-7-7); land thus cultivated would be classified
as "Semi-intensified" fields
b.   after about three years at the "semi-intensified" stage,
farmers would move to the higher levels of technology in
'"intensified" field by removing stumps, plowing, applying
rock phosphate, increasing fertilization, and by introducing
maize, sorghum, and cotton in crop rotations.
Annex 14 gives targets for the number of farmers supervis~ed and the areas
at the various stages of development.
D.   Crop Recommendations for Intensified Fields
Groundnuts
19.       The recommended variety would be 28 - 206, which is late maturing
(120 days), and best adapted to Zone 1. For Zone 2, 28-206 would be used
only until IRAT completes development of a shorter cycle variety (105 days).
During the recent droughts, farmers preferred the variety 55-237 (90 days),



ANNEX 3
Page 8
which gives greater assurance of a crop under marginal rainfall, However,
as this variety sprouts if the raîn continues after maturity, SODEVA would
not recommend its use for the project.
20.       Soil Preparation and Fertilization.  The fields would receive 100
kg/ha of 8-18-27 before land preparation. Land preparation would consist of
cross hoeing before the start of the rainy season.
21.       Seed Preparation and Seeding.  Seeds would be shelled and sorted
by hand, and treated with an insecticide-fungicide mixture (Thiram and DDT)
at the rate of 200 grams/100 kg of seed. The seed would be planted within
three days following the first rain (20 mm minimum), 3 to 5 cm deep, in rows
60 cm apart, with a seeder equipped vith dises with 24 or 30 notches.
22.       Weeding and Harvesting.  The first hoeing would be made some 10
days after seeding, the second about 15 days later. Further weedings would
be according to need. The crop would be lifted 115-125 days after seeding,
by a hoe or an animal-drawn lifter, and allowed to dry by turning the plant
upside down. The dry crop (after 3-4 days) would be stacked in the field,
to be threshed by hand in December-January.
Millet
23.       Pearl millet would be grown in rotation before groundnuts, or con-
tinuously in fields fertilized with cattle droppings. This short cycle crop
(90-100 days) is well adapted to the short rainy season in Zone 2. Farmers
in Zone 1 would grow grain crops with longer cycles and higher production
potentials. An improved variety, Souna 2, was recently released by IRAT,
and would be used for the project.
24.       Soil Preparation and Fertilization.  Soil preparation would consist
of cross cultivation with a hoe, or, preferably plowing in Zone 2. Ferti-
lizer recommendations would call for:
-    150 kg/ha of 14-7-7 in semi-intensification; and
-    100 kg/ha of 10-21-21 and 50 kg/ha of urea in
intensification in Zone 2.
The mixed fertilizer would be broadcast before soil preparation; urea would be
side-dressed at the time of thinning.
25.       Seeding.  The seed would be treated with the same fungicide-insecti-
cide mixture used for groundnuts at the rate of one matchbox full for 3--4
kg of seed. Seeding would take place in June, before the start of the rains,
at the rate of 3 - 5 kg/ha, in rows 0.9 m apart, and spacing of 0.9 m on the
row. This would be done by seeder equipped with a 4 hole disc, and placing
the seed 4 - 5 cm deep.



26.       Thinning aad Weeding.  Some 6 to 20 days after emergerce, thie
seedings would be thinned down to three per clump (farmers rarely fol[ow this
recommendation, lor fear that drought or pest damage will reduce the stands).
The first weeding would be needed at about the samne time, and the second
would follow after 15 days.  Further weedings would &eoend on need.
27.       Harvesting.  The panicles would be harvested by hand at full matur-
ity, at least 90 days after seeding. Intensified plots could be plowed
immediately after harvesting, when the soil is moist.
28.       White-grain sorghum has a 90-100 day cycle.  IRAT has developed the
improved varieties labeled CE - 90 for Zone 2 and 51 - 60 for Zone 1. This
crop is well adapted to the more humid Southern part of Sine Saloum (minimum
rainfall of 800 mm) and would be promoted by the project. In cooperation
with IRAT, SODEVA would pursue adaptation trials of slhort stem varieties.
Sorghum would follow groundnuts and would be followed by groundnuts in the
rotation.
29.       Soil Preparation and Fertilization.  Soil preparation would be
similar to that required for millet, but it could be done after the first
rains, and in this case the field could be plowed.
Recommended fertilization would be:
-    Zone 2:   150 kg/ha 10-21-21 and 100 kg/ha of urea
-    Zone 1:   100 kg/ha 10-21-21 and 50 kg/ha of urea
30.       Seeding.  Sorghum seed would be treated with the same fungicide (at
the same rate) as millet seed. Seeding would be done between June 15 and
July 15, 2 or 3 cm deep, with spacing of 0.9 and 0.45 cm (8 hole plate), cor-
responding to 5 to 7 kg/ha of seed.
31.       Thinning, Weeding, Harvesting.  Same as for millet, but later in the
season. Because of later harvesting, post harvest plowing may not be possible.
Maize
32.       The high yielding hybrid BDS 1, a double hybrid with white grain
developed by IRAT, has a 90 cycle and a yield potential of 5 tons/ha. This
hybrid would play an important role in the intensified rotation of Zone 1
(minimum rainfall of 800-850 mm), where the crop would be grown. SODEVA
would pursue variety trials, in cooperation with IRAT. One of the objectives
of the maize research program would be to develop hybrids that would be
more widely accepted for local consumption. Maize would be grown at the
beginning of the rotation, before groundnuts, preferably on plowed land.



ANNEX 3
Page 10
33.       Land Preparation.  Maize responds well to plowing, which can be
done at the end of the previous cropping season, or just before seeding.
The plowed land would be smoothed by hoeing.
34.       Seeding.  The seed would be treated with the same fungicide-insect-
icide mixture as millet and sorghum; it would be planted between June 20 and
July 5, with 0.90 x 0.25 cm in spacing (16 hole plate), giving a rate of 20
kg/ha wïth three seeds per hole; depth is 3 to 4 cm.
35.       Thinning, Weeding, Fertilization, Harvesting.  Some 10 days after
seeding the stand would be thinned down to one plant per clump; the field
would be hoed immediately afterwards, and furrowed 20 to 30 days after seed-
ing. Hatrvesting would begin 75 days after seeding for urgent food needs,
and the main harvest begins 90 days after seeding. The ears would be stored
with the husk after treatment with 300 grams of DDT per 100 kg of crop.
Cotton
36.       SODEFITEX has been promoting BSA 592, a medium staple variety,
which requires at least 120 days to mature and a minimum of 900 mm of rain-
fall. Cotton gives a high response to plowing. For this reason it is best
grown after a short cycle cereal, allowing plowing after harvesting, before
the soil hardens. The preferred place in the rotation is after maize.
37.       Soil Preparation and Fertilization.  The fields would be prepared
by hoeing, to complete plowing or in lieu of plowing. Cotton would receive
150 kg/ha of 8-18-27 broadcast before soil preparation, and 50 kg/ha of urea
side-dressed one month after seeding.
38.       Seeding.  SODEFITEX supplies seed already treated with 500 grams/
grammoram per 100 kg. Cotton would be seeded after the first heavy rain, at
the end of June or the beginning of July. Seeding would be 2 - 3 cm deep,
in rows 0.90 m apart, with spacing of 0.20 m on the row and 6-8 seeds per
hole (40 kg/ha of seed). Farmers still practice hand seeding, but an animal
drawn seeder is being developed.
39.       Thinning, Cultivation and Pest Control.  The first hoeing is needed
10 to 15 days after seeding, then the crop would be thinned down to one plant
per clump, three weeks after seeding. The second hoeing would be done two
weeks aft:er the first. The field would be furrowed 35 days after seeding.
Insecticide (preprothion) would be sprayed about six times, the first about
six weeks after seeding, and the others at two week intervals.
40.       Harvesting.  Picking would start 120 days after seeding; several
pickings are needed, in order to select only the fully open capsules. After
the last picking the stems would be pulled and burned to control pests.



ANNEX 3

E.   Expected Yields
41.       Considering the data developed by research tests on farmers' fields,
and by the pilot project, the expected yields under normal rainfall brought
about by the improved technology are summarized in Table 1 (the incidence of
drought on production is taken into account in the calculation of the farm
budgets; it is estimated that a drought would occur every four years and
would reduce yields by 60%).
F.   Demonstrations
42.       A key factor in the adoption of the new package is the training of
draft oxen and training in the use of a plow. For this purpose each extension
field worker would operate a demonstration center to show farmers how to train
a pair of oxen, to plow, and to handle and care for ox-drawn implements. The
center would also be a gathering place where other farmers would be shown the
technique of training oxen and of plowing. The demonstration centers would be
rotated so as to reach a maximum number of farmers. Once a farmer has adopted
the new package, his fields would become demonstration fields for other farmers
of the village.

SINE SALOUI AGRICULTURAL DEVLLOPM'ENT PROJECT
AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT AGENCY FOR THE GROUNDNUT BASIN
Societe de Developpement et de Vulgarisation Agricole (SODEVA)
Background
1.        SODEVA was created in 1968 to take over the extension services of
SATEC, a French consulting firm, in Senegal's Groundnut Basin.  Government has
made SODEVA the regional agricultural development authority for the Groundnut
Basin, covering the regions of Sine Saloum, Thies and Diourbel. SODEVA has
concentrated on:
i.   improving agricultural production at the farm level;
ii.   increasing the yields of groundnuts, Senegal's main cash crop;
iii.   promoting maize, millet, and sorghum cultivation to overcome
the country's cereal deficit, and
iv.   integrating livestock development with smallholder crop production.
Or~ani zation
2.        SODEVA is a "societe d'economie mixte,"' a joint venture in which Gov-
ernment owns 90% and SATEC 10% of the capital. The Director General, SODEVA's
senior executive, is appointed by a Board of 11 directors representing Govern-
ment i4inistries, ONCAD, BNDS and SATEC. The chairman of the Board is the
Director of the Cabinet in the Ministry of Planning and Cooperation. SODEVA
is responsiLle to the Ministry of Rural Development through the office of the
Director of Agricultural Production.
3.        SODEVA's headquarters, in Dakar, is divided into two divisions:
management, which oversees general administration and reports to Government,
and technical which is responsible for supervising ongoing field operations
and for planning new activities. The planning and developtnent unit, in the
technical division, is preparing to study fertilizer recommendations for
Senegal, and is responsible for evaluating the impact of PA and SODEVA's
other field operations. SODEVA also has a training section that provides
15 to 120-day staff courses on field activities. Financial accounts are kept
in Dakar for all SODEVA operations. These accounts are audited by a Govern-
ment commission.
4.        Most of SODEVA's 1,100 personnel, of whom 13 are expatriate, are
attached to three regional field offices at Kaolack (Sine Saloum), Thies and



ANNEX 4
Page 2
Diourbel, which have direct responsibility for implementing projects. Each
field office is headed by a delegate with an administrative and technical staff
for the region. Day-to-day activities are directed by operations chiefs, who
coordinate all field activities, at the district level.
5.        SODEVA recruits its personnel from three sources.  Staff above the
level of field extension workers are usually seconded to SODEVA from Government's
civil service. Field workers are recruited on the basis of regional examin-
ations, and the majority have at least primary school education. Most ex-
patriates are provided by SATEC under a technical assistance agreement with
SODEVA.
Operations
6.        In addition to providing agricultural extension throughout the
Groundnu2t Basin and to implementing a pilot intensification project in Sine
Saloum financed by CCCE (Annex 5), SODEVA is also responsible for coordinating:
(i) a project directed by the Research Institute for Oil Crops (Institut de
Recherche des Huile et Oleagineaux - IRHO) to increase the output of edible
groundnuts to 28,200 tons by 1975; (ii) a cotton program implemented by
SODEFITEX to increase the cotton acreage in Sine Saloum to 6,500 ha; and a
program to disseminate high yielding seed varieties. USAID has been asked
to provide US$4 million for an agricultural intensification program to be
implemented by SODEVA in the districts of Thies, Bambey and Diourbel; this
project will comprise strengthening of extension services, a limited construc-
tion program, equipment for training and demonstrations, an applied research
unit, and credit for on-farm storage facilities. SODEVA is also responsible
nationally for implementing a project supported by finance from Iran to
develop audio-visual facilities in rural areas.
7.        SODEVA coordinates its activities with other organizations active
in agriculture, including: ONCAD; BNDS; the cooperatives, Government Minis-
tries dealing with crop production, livestock, and rural infrastructure; and
private and semipublic organizations that supply agricultural equipment and
fertilizers.
SODEVA's Role as a Model Regional Development Agency
8.        Government's agricultural development policy includes both functional
organizations providing services on a national level and geographical agencies
which concentrate on regional development. National organizations include
BNDS fo-r credit; ONCAD for cooperatives, marketing and farm inputs; and
SODIFITEX for cotton development. SODEVA is the largest regional development
agency and Government is using it as a model for similar organizations for
other regions of the country. While extension services are often performed
directly by Government Ministries in other countries, the establishment and
strengthening of regional development agencies in Senegal has its own merits.
However, the permanent effectiveness of semi-autonomous regional agencies
will depend on reliable financial support from Government.



ANNEX 4
Page 3
9.        Management - The expansion of SODEVA's activities, particularly
as a result of the projects proposed for assistance by the Bank/CCCE, USAID
and Iran, will place a burden on the management capability of SODEVA, es-
pecially SODEVA's headquarters. While Government is confident that it can
provide sufficient field personnel and headquarters staff for the proposed
project, it must be recognized there is already in Senegal competition for
good managers in Government and in private industry; and there is also a lack
of qualified managers with agricultural experience. SODEVA's managerial per-
formance should be closely monitored during project execution to ensure that
the past record of good administration continues.
Coordntionof_npu
10.       SODEVA's intensification and diversification schemes depend on the
timely provision of seed, fertilizer, 'implements and credit. In the past,
one or more of these critical inputs has sometimes been unavailable. For
example, due to lack of ONCAD transportation, seeds and fertilizer sometimes
arrive too late for planting. SODEVA, therefore, has an important coor-
dinating role:  aggregating the needs of individual farmers and working
with ONCAD to deal with bulk suppliers such as Societe Industrielle
Senegalaise de Constructions Mechaniques et de Mlateriels Agricoles (SISCOMA)
for implements, and Societe Industrielle d'Engrais du Senegal (SIES) for
fertilizers, and with cooperatives to ensure that farmers receive their
requirements.
Financing
11.       Working Capital - SODEVA has suffered in the past from shortages
of working capital, particularly to prefinance expenditures that are reimbursed
either by external development institutions like the Bank, or by Government.
To finance its operations, SODEVA has increased the length of its accounts
payable to an average of six months while some accounts are a year and a half
overdue. In addition, SODEVA has borrowed short-term money from banks at
high interest rates. The substantial increase in SODEVA's operations over
the next few years will only exacerbate its financial problems.  Government
is increasing SODEVA's capital from US$40,000 to US$400,000, the estimated
minimum amount required to provide working capital for an annual budget of
US$4.0 million (Table 1). This capital increase will provide only temporary
relief for SODEVA's problem since the approved 1974/75 budget is US$4.1
million and will rise to at least US$8.0 million within the next two years.
To ensure the effective itnplementation of the project proposed in this re-
port, SODEVA will need additional long-term financing for working capital
of about CFAF 200 million (US$889,000).
12.       Long-Tern - The percentage of SODEVA's activities financed by the
national budget declined fron 43% in 1973/74 to 30% in 1974/75 (Table 2).
SODEVA's ability to attract external assistance is a compliment to its past

record of effective project implenentation. liowever, much of the external
assistance has been for relatively short-periods--two to four years--and its
continuation is never certain. In the long run, SODEVA needs a permanently
sound financial base. This could be provided by finance for five-year
planning periods from regular budgetary allocations or by a levy on groundnut
production in the area where SODLVA does extension work. In view of the
fluctuations in the groundnut crop, a levy on production would need to be
supported by Governrment or the crop stabilization fund in low crop years.

SINE SALOUM AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPIENT PROJECT
PILOT PROJECT
Background
1.        Under Programme Agricole (PA), moderate amounts of fertilizer,
improved seeds, and animal-drawn hoes and seeders have been supplied to
farmers on credit, together with limited agricultural extension support pro-
vided by SATEC until 1968 and thereafter by SODEVA. Research has shown
that further improvements in agricultural technology are possible by plow-
ing and by a more comprehensive use of fertilizer, particularly in Sine
Saloum, where the risks of drought are less than in the northern parts of
the Groundnut Basin. A widespread and successful application of these
measures depends, however, on strengthening farm support services. With
these considerations in mind, SODEVA launched a pilot project in 1971 that
involves intensive farmer supervision, coordination of agricultural support
services, the expansion of ox-plowing, heavier fertilization rates for
cereals, increased cropping of maize, sorghum and cotton, and the integration
of livestock with crop farming. Detailed technical recommendations for
this project are described in Annex 3.
2.        The project is being carried out in the three southern districts
of Sine Saloum: Nioro, Foundiougne and Kaffrine. Initially, it was planned
that the project should cover a five-year period and benefit 25,000 farmers
in these districts. Eowever, following successful implementation during the
past two years, Government decided to expand the project after 1975, to
cover the whole of the Sine Saloum Region.
Organization
3.        The pilot project is being implemented by SODEVA's regional admin-
istration for Sine Saloum. While the project comes under the regional
director, his deputy is in charge of day-to--day operations. The project is
administered through three district and 18 sub-district offices, and SODEVA's
extension staff are supervising closely some 9,500 farms (1974 figures).
SODEVA lias established ox-training centers for project farmers, and the
Ministry of Rural Development provides animal health services. Project
progress is evaluated each year by a team of 13 evaluation officers.
Results
4.        Crop Yields:  The following yields were achieved in 1973/74:

recommendations of PA        940        760         -         560

recommendations tested
by the Pilot Project       1,260      1,010       1,960       780
The yields for groundnuts and millet were computed from records kept by ex-
tension agents for some 1,700 project farms, each of which had one plot grown
under pilot project recommendations and a second following the recommendations
of Programme Agricole. Results for maize and sorghum, which were grown on a
much smaller scale, were computed from detailed measurements made on the entire
operations of a sample of 60 farms. Sorghum yields were low because of a pre-
mature end of the rains, but other crop yields were satisfactory. The
results show that plowing and higher levels of fertilization under good
management can result in substantial yield increases, even in a somewhat
unfavorable cropping season.
5.        Crop Production : The project's production goals for groundnuts
and millet were surpassed, but the early end of the rains prevented a good
sorghum harvest. Fewer farmers grew maize than had been projected because
of an initial reluctance to clear fields of stumps and roots. Additional crop
production attributable to the pilot project is calculated from the yield
increases obtained by project farmers over yields they would have achieved
without the project and is estimated as follows:
Crop              Target        Actual Production (1973)  Actual as % of Target
(tons)               (tons)
Groundnuts         8,800               15,000                      170
Millet             2,820                 5,000                     177
Maize              1,382                   700                      51
6.        Animal Production:  Farmers were prepared to buy young animals
for ox-traction without requiring credit. Thirty-five percent of farmers
trained oxen themselves, and by the end of 1973, 6,000 pairs of oxen had
been trained, some 124% of the project's target. It was also found that
draft animals gain an additional 60 to 80 kg a year when they are kept in
enclosures and fed groundnut hay and other crop residues. These animals
are in high demand for traction and command good prices for beef. As a
consequence, farmers are keeping oxen for beef fattening as well as for
traction. In order to meet the growing demand for young animals, SODEVA
has started a feeding program for calves and breeding cows among farmers
to reduce calf mortality and raise calving rates.

Problems Encountered
7.        The main obstacle to the prompt adoption of improved cropping
was stump removal. A substantial number of farmers who had enlisted in the
program failed to destump their fields, and thus plowing was difficult and
only partially effective. To correct the situation, SODEVA now insists on
destumping as a prerequisite to receiving free rock phosphate and to receiv-
ing the support of its staff to intensify production techniques.
8.        As a second problem, in some cases the higher credit requirements
of project farmers were not at first approved by cooperatives because some
loan committees were reluctant to assume liability for the debts of individual
farmers requesting higher than average loans. Following the intervention of
SODEVA's staff, loan requirements were approved by cooperatives and SODEVA
expects this to be a short-term problem that will be resolved as familiarity
with the project increases (Annex 8).
9.        As the third problem, project farriers encountered difficulties in
obtaining prompt delivery of implements and fertilizers required in excess of
supplies normally provided under the PA program. SODEVA's staff now prepares
lists for the materials required and coordinates their delivery with ONCAD
and cooperatives.
Implications for the Proposed Project
10.       The pilot project has demonstrated that stump removal is the main
bottleneck to intensification. It confirmed the need for a high ratio of ex-
tension workers to farmers at this stage of development, and highlighted the
need to improve arrangements for input supplies. It has demonstrated that
farmers could achieve reasonably high yields by following the recommendations
given by the extension staff, and that the improvements in livestock husbandry
have been well received by farmers.

LAND TENURE AND SOCIAL STRUCTURE
Land lenure
1.        Much of the population of the Groundnut Basin is of recent and mixed
origin, the result of large migrations from other regions in Senegal and from
Mali and Upper Volta between 1890 and 1930. The division of land is based on
inalienable and irrevocable user rights which families descended from the first
occupants are acknowledged to possess. The "lamanes" are the descendents of
heads of familles who first burned off the forest and are accordingly the
guardians and administrators of the land. However, the farmers whose peroga-
tives are the closest to property rights are the inheritors of the "axe right"
granted to those who first cleared the land of trees and bush. Farmers with
axe rights cannot sell their land but often lend surplus land at nominal rent
to families with spare labor or to young men.
2.        Government is attempting to play a larger role in land use.  The law
on national property of June 17, 1964, makes the State the successor to all
ancient rights and the sole owner of the land. Under this law, land is, in
principle, allocated to the members of rural communities with the power to
allocate being transferred from the families to an elected rural council ,
Law 7202 of February 1, 1972, provides for the division of each district into
rural communities; this reform of administrative units has started in Sine
Saloum and is to be completed throughout the country by 1979.
3.        A certain amount of uncertainty now exists as to land use rights
arising from Government's intervention, and many farmers have ceased lending
land outside their immediate family. However, while this uncertainty over
land tenure is having some adverse effects on the redistribution of land that
has previously been lent, it is not expected to be a major constraint for the
project. Under the project, farmers with surplus land would be assisted to
exploit it more fully through increasing animal traction, and those with land
constraints would be helped to farm more intensively.  The uncertainty may,
however, explain part of the reluctance to destump fully (Annex 5), as farmers
who have borrowed land have no long term user rights. Nevertheless, since
only about 10% of land is borrowed, this problem should not seriously impede
the stump removal program.
Social and Economic Relations
4.        The basic social unit in the project area is the compound where the
compournd chief, the oldest active male, lives with his wives and children.
Relatives and seasonal workers are attached to the compound. Married younger



ANNEX 6
Page 2
brothers of the compound chief form separate households within the compound,
eating separately and farming as a semi-independent unit; younger brothers
may also form separate compounds. By administrative definition, a family head
becomes a compound chief when his name is entered on the tax list and he ceases
to pay taxes through an elder brother. The basic economic unit is, however,
in most cases the household rather than the compound, although there is a
tendency to consider household heads as compound heads. Seasonal workers are
mostly young male relations (sourgas) and sometimes outsiders (navetanes)
whose main interests are accumulating money to establish their own households
and earning a living.
5.        The compound chief is responsible for providing food and shelter for
all members, owns livestock and implements, and allocates land within the
compound, some 40-60% of which he farmis himself. The chief is usually the
only member of the compound registered in the cooperative and the ONCAD col-
lection point (secco); it is he who has access to credit for seeds, fertilizer
and implements. In return for guaranteeing the subsistence of the compound --
the chief is usually the sole cereal producer -- all members of the compound
perform services for the chief. For the women, this work is mainly of a
domestic nature, plus agricultural chores such as sowing, winnowing and
shelling groundnuts after the harvest. Male relatives, as well as seasonal
workers, after helping to plant the chief's field, work about four mornings
per week for the chief during the rest of the season. On some farms just
beginning intensive agriculture, a new pattern of work is emerging under which
the men work continuously together under the chief as a coordinated work team
that makes full use of animal traction. The work relationship is flexible,
depending very much on personal relationships that vary from compound to
compound.
6.        All members of the compound over the age of about 15 have individual
fields which they cultivate with the assistance of others. Since the compound
chief grows sufficient food to support the compound, the individual members
can concentrate on and are motivated to cultivate cash crops: women to purchase
spices, clothes and household goods, and men to earn money for marriage and
to carry their families over until the next year. Since most benefits for
intensification are from cereals, not traditionally a cash crop, improved
markets for cereals is critical to promote cereal production among farm
members other than the chief.
7.        The compound chief receives the majority of direct benefits from
development schemes; surveys have shown that the level of mechanization on
the chiefs' fields is usually twice that of other members of the compound.
In addition, the chief, through his membership in the cooperative obtains
and distributes agricultural implements and fertilizers. Equipment is used
communally by the compound after the chief's fields have been finished, and
increasingly, because of animal traction, men are plowing and planting not
only their own fields but those of women. The amount of fertilizer and pesti-
cide used on individual's fields depends very much on the chief's willingness
to extend credit to his own compound members.  Moreover, as the provider of



ANNEX 6
Page 3
food and lodging, his requirements for these materials are paramount.  How-
ever, there is considerable evidence that the direct and indirect benefits oE
intensification are, in fact, shared by the compound.  Implements are used by
many members; food supplies are more certain, a-id since more food is grown
with Less labor-intensive farming on the chief's plot, individual members of
the compound can spend less time working for the chief and more time on their
own fields increasing their personal revenue. The economic relationships of
compound members strikes a reasonable balance between individual self-interest
and communal insurance, in the form of obligations to and from the compound
chief, and against harvest failures.
Conclusion
8.        Although no serious land tenure problems are foreseen for the pro-
ject, SODEVA's study group would Be asked to monitor the transltion from one
system of allocation to the other during project implementation. Also, while
working through family heads, the benefits of the project would be distributed
to famnily members and their associated workers (sourgas and navetanes).

SINE SALOUM AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF ANIMAL PRODUCTION
Traditional Grazing
1.        Most of the farmers in the project area own beef cattle, sheep
and goats. Cattle herds comprise between 10 and 60 head; they are kept
as reserve capital, and as a source of milk for family consumption. They
graze crop residues during the dry season, and fallow fields or uncul-
tivated areas during the cropping season. In addition, migratory cattle
herds from the dry north of Senegal graze residues from cultivated fields
of the Groundnut Basin during the dry season. In the northwest, where
almost all the available land is cropped, local cattle graze on crop
residues, mainly groundnut hay and millet stalks during the dry season,
and with the exception of milking females and calves, are moved to the
Sine Saloum delta area during the wet season. Under this system the cattle
make small weight gains -- 30 to 60 kg liveweight/year; the calving rate is
about 60%, calf mortality 25%, and milk production about 150 liters/year.
Practically all animals are regularly immunized against rinderpest, pleuro-
pneumonia, anthrax and blackleg by Government's veterinary services. However,
internal parasites (helminthiasis and coccidiosis) are widespread and contri-
bute to low calf weaning rates.
Development of Mixed Farmin
2.        The traditional open grazing system is undergoing a radical change
with the introduction of animal traction and improved animal care under
which animals are kept in shelters and fed crop residues, especially
groundnut hay.   This change results in an improved utilization efficiency
for the crop residues when compared to the traditional nomadic grazing
system. The net result is an increase in the carrying capacity of the
land and crops.
3.        A stall fed animal requires a mixed ration of about 3 tons/year
of groundnut hay and 1.5 tons/year of sorghum/millet stalks, or about 3.5 tons/
year of groundnut hay alone. The current practice of farmers is to feed
groundnut hay mostly by itself. The production of groundnuts under the
project (assuming the same yield for dry hay as for unshelled seed for the
typical 13-hectares farm described in Annex 16) would enable the average
farmer to feed the following animal units on groundnut hay alone:
Y O Y 1 Y 2 Y 3 Y 4 Y 5
South     1.5      2.8     2.8      3.0     2.9      2.8
North     0.9      2.2     2.3      2.4     2.4      2.4



ANNEX 7
Page 2
With the inclusion of sorghum/miilet stalks in the ration, the carryinr
capacity would be increased by 25 percent.
4.        Draft Oxen.  Draft oxen are now fed mainly with groundnut hay (10-
12 kg/ day) and under the project SODEVA would encourage farmers to make more
use of sorghum/millet stalks, and thus save groundnut hay to stall fatten
steers. A daily ration of 8 kg of groundnut hay, 4 kg of cereal straw and
50 grams of mineral supplement would allow mature oxen to work and gain
60 - 100 kg liveweight/year.
5.        Cattle Fattening.  Cattle would be fattened under a system that
would include: (a) simple stables; (b) basic supplements of groundnut hay
and millet/sorghum stalks at the saire rates as for draft oxen; (c) feeding
troughs; (d) drugs for internal parasites; and (e) mineral supplements (50
grams/day). A three-year old animal weighing 175 kg would be expected to
gain 500 grams/day, or 75 kg for a 150-day period of feeding, some 50 kg
nx)re than under open grazing (Table 3).
6.        Calf Rearing.  Under the project's calf weaning program, calves
would receive a treatment for internal parasites, and a daily ration for
100 days of 100 grams of feed concentrate rich in protein and minerals.
Under this regime, about 85% of the calves would survive one year. During
the second year and half of the third year (up to the marketable stage)
the calves would receive 20 grams/day of mineral supplement. They would
also receive a deworming treatment during each of the 2nd and 3rd years
and under the project about 80% of the calves would survive to three
years of age, compared to about 60% without the project. This calf rear-
ing operation would help to satisfy the rapidly increasing demand for draft
animals and feeder steers. Details are in Table 3.
7.        Improved Feeding of Dairy Cows.  Dairy cows normally produce about
150 liters of milk over about 100 days, and give birth to two calves in about
three years (birth rate of 60%). The causes of the low calving rate would
be investigated by the SODEVA's animal husbandry specialist, together with
veterinarians from the Ministry of Rural Development with a view to recommend-
ing measures to improve the rate. Nevertheless, with drugs to control internal
parasites, supplementary feeding of 200 grams/day of concentrate for 200 days,
and feeding of groundnut hay and millet bran, cows would produce an additional
200 liters of milk per year, and the calving rate is expected to improve by
about 30% to one calf about every 15 months (birth rate of 80%).
8.        Traction Cows.  Small farms that can only feed a few animals would
use cows for traction.  There cows would receive the same drug treatments and
feed supplements as draft oxen, plus an additional mineral supplement of 50
gramis/day to improve the calving rate.
9,        Sheep, Goats and Pigs.  In addition to improved care for cattle,
SODEVA would demonstrate improved production methods for sheep and goats
including control of internal parasites, and supplementary feeding with



ANNEX 7
Page 3
groundnut hay. In cooperation with animal husbandry research services, SODEVA
would introduce rams of the improved "Djalonke" breed to upgrade the sheep
population in selected villages, and the results of the crosses would be kept
under close observation. Traditionally Serere farmers in the northwest of
the project area raise pigs on millet bran, and kitchen residues. Under the
project, SODEVA would supervise pig husbandry demonstrations including deworming
and feeding of concentrates and minerals. Since SODEVA's major activity in
livestock would be with cattle, and would be linked to demonstrations for
other animals, no benefits are assumned in project calculations for increases
in sheep, goat and pig production that could arise from the demonstrations.
Animal feed mill mixinÉ_plant
10.       To meet the requirements for feed supplements (minerals and con-
centrate), SODEVA would build and operate a mixing plant at Kaolack. Details
on ingredients, and requirements of the project are shown in Table 1, and
Table 2 gives a breakdown of tule costs of the mixing plant. The plant would
produce about 2,000 tons per year by 1979.
Development of livestock production costs and benefits
11.       Table 3 gives the numbers of animals that would be reached by the
project, and the expected increases in production that would result. The
corresponding farm costs and benefits are shown in Table 4.

SENEGAL
SINE SALOUM AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPIENT PROJECT
CREDIT AND COOPERATIVES IN SENEGAL
1.        The basic structure in Government's plan for organizing the rural
sector is the cooperative systen. Senegal has about 2,200 cooperatives, of
which about 77% are connected directly with groundnuts. Groundnut coopera-
tives have about 200,000 members, but the number of farmers who use collec-
tion points and, directly or through relatives, the other services of the
cooperatives, has been estimated at about 1.2 million.
2.        The philosophy of the cooperative movement, expressed by Government
shortly after independence, is "to set up a mode of organization which makes
it possible to preserve the old community values and promote modern develop-
ment". 1/ First priority was to replace the trader-based system and thus halt
the "usurious" indebtedness of farmers. Since 1967/68, groundnuts have been
marketed through the cooperatives at official Government prices; and in the
last 13 years. Programme Agricole (PA) has provided CFAF 11.7 billion (US$49
million) in credit to cooperative members.
3.        The average cooperative has about 120 members and markets about 400
tons oi groundnuts annually. Each cooperative member, usually the chief of
a compound, pays CFAF 1,000 as a membership fee and is entitled to obtain
credit for fertilizer, insecticide and agricultural implements.
4.        The membership votes for a board of directors, and one third of the
directors are replaced each year; the chairman of the cooperative is appointed
by the directors. ONCAD supervises and provides technical assistance to co-
operatives through its Directorate of Cooperation, and BNDS finances their
credit requirements. A cooperative's borrowing limit set by BNDS is either
10 times its membership fees or, since this amount rapidly becomes insuf-
ficient, about 75% of the average value of marketed groundnut production over
the past three years, less outstanding medium and short-term debt. Credit is
formally backed by the joint and several guarantee of all members, and in
monetary terms bv the membership fees and groundnut production bonuses paid
to cooperatives: these funds, now amounting to about CFAF 1.8 billion (US$7.5
million), are held in blocked accounts in BNDS.
5.        This collective form of credit has been oriented toward the minimum
credit needs of large numbers of farmers, and thus neglects farmers who re-
quire above-average credit for fertilizer and implements. In fact, even under
1/   Government Instruction Circular No. 032/PC of May 21, 1962.



ANNEX 8
Page 2
the pilot intensification project (Annex 5), project farmers beginning inten-
sification occasionally had difficulty in securing credit because of the un-
familiarity of cooperative credit committees with the project and their re-
luctance to increase the cooperatives' debt load. Credit for progressive
farmers under the herein appraised project could be assured in the future
by using funds now held for the cooperatives in the BNDS as a guarantee for
the CFAF 54.3 million additional credit which the proposed project would
involve.
6.        In the pilot project, SODEVA's field staff aggregate the require-
ments for fertilizer and implements for farmers and provide lists to ONCAD,
which distributes inputs on faith that retroactive approval for the credit
from individual cooperatives will be forthcoming. In the future, SODEVA
intends to deal directly with cooperatives to ascertain credit requirements.
Procurement and credit specialists would be employed by SODEVA to (i) work
wit}l cooperatives and ONCAD, (ii) prepare lists of seasonal inputs and im-
plements for which credit is needed, (iii) arrange for increases in co-
operative guarantee funds, and (iv) coordinate the distribution of inputs.
7.        ONCAD is planning to reorganize cooperatives into units that will
market at least 1,500 tons of groundnuts per year, the minimum it considers
necessary to pay for a permanent cooperative manager. This reorganization
represents a major change for the cooperative movement and may not be sup-
ported by farmers. It should tnerefore be closely followed during project
implementation.

REPORTING REQUIRENENTS
1.        SODEVA would be required to supply detailed quarterly reports.  Under
the pilot project SODEVA prepared periodic reports for CCCE. The reports were
of two types: (a) a progress report on the implementation of the program in
September, and a final report on the cropping season in March; and (b) a
tentative program of the coming season in December, and a final program in
June. The same schedule and similar forms as suggested by CCCE would be
kept for the project. In addition all reports would include an administrative
section. The suggested formats of reports are shown in Tables 1 to ,'. These
formats would be discussed with SODEIVA in the course of the first supervision
mission.

MARKETS AND PRICES
Livestock
1.        Current Market Situation - Meat consumption in 1973 totaled about
76,000 tons comprising 41,000 tons of beef from doimestic cattle, 11,000 tons
of beef f rom cattle imported from Mauritania, 14,000 tons of meat from sheep
and goats, and 10,000 tons of pork. Per capita consumption of meat was about
20 kg of which beef accounted for 13 kg. Following the recent droughts beef
prices have risen sharply, and the national herd has been reduced by deaths
and an increased offtake. Liveweight cattle prices in Dakar that were CFAF
100-130/kg in 1970 are now CFAF 130-170/kg, and the total number of cattle
slaughtered rose from about 142,000 in 1970 to 180,000 in 1973. Between
1972 and 1973, the average carcass weight of animals slaughtered in Dakar
declined from about 160 kg to 120 kg and thus, despite increased slaughter,
meat supplies have remained relatively stable. These developments illus-
trate the short-term impact of the drought on the meat supply situation and
the longer term need to rebuild the national herd for future supplies of
beef.  In addition, recent beef price increases have led to substitution
of fish for meat; it is estimated that coastal people now eat 80-90 kg of
fish annually, and the fish consumption in Dakar alone has risen from
48,000 tons in 1970 to 62,000 tons in 1973.
2.        Future Trend for Beef - The main factors that will determine future
demand for beef will be population growth and the relative price of beef
among other sources of protein. Assuming that the present relatively high
prices for beef are maintained while the national herd is restocked, demand
for beef will probably grow in line with annual population growth of 2.2%.
Consequently, an additional 6,000 tons of beef will be required by 1980
to maintain consumption at present levels.
3.        The immediate constraints on the market will be restrictions on
domestic supplies and imports. Mauritania, which has consistently supplied
about 20% of Senegal's beef requirements, has been severely hit by the recent
droughts; and given the general shortage of livestock in West Africa, it is
unlikely that beef supplies will rise above the present level for the fore-
seeable future, and if anything may decline. Medium-term prospects for
increasing domestic production rest largely on Government's plans for the
higher potential grazing areas of Eastern Senegal and Casamance and on in-
creasing output from the predominantly arable areas of the country through
mixed farming as proposed for the project described in this report. The
combined incremental production from these two activities is expected to
reach about 4,000 tons between 1980 and 1985, and this production could be
absorbed easily on the domes tic market even if prices remain at their pre-
sent levels.



ANNEX 15
Page 2
4.        Erices - In view of the supply restrictions, it is assumed for
project appraisal purposes that liveweight prices on the Dakar and Kaolack
markets will average about CFAF 145/kg. After taking account of marketing
costs, the farmgate price for beef cattle in Sine Saloum will average CFAF
100/kg liveweight.  Two-year-old cattle suitable either for training as
oxen or for fattening are expected to maintain their current market value
of CFAF 12,000, and milk prices are expected to be maintained at about CFAF
25/liter, the present market price.
5.        Marketing - The livestock trade is controlled by private whole-
sale dealers who purchase through middlemen. Transactions are frequent and
costly. In an effort to increase the bargaining power of producers and re-
duce intermiediaries, the project would establish selling points in each of
the six project districts, with weighing scales controlled by project staff.
Farmers would be encouraged to bring their animals to these points, where
they would be able to sell direct to wholesale dealers and thus bypass the
small bush traders.
Cereals
6.        Cereal marketing in Senegal is more concerned with distributing im-
ports than with trade in local production. In normal years, over one third
of Senegal's cereal requirements are imported, averaging some 315,000 tons
per year.  In 1972, the height of the drought, 400,000 tons were imported.
On average, imports include about 190,000 tons of rice, 100,000 tons of
wheat, and 25,000 tons of maize.
7.        Millet and sorghum comprise the most important domestic cereals,
with combined production of just under 500,000 tons per year. Most is pro-
duced for subsistence consumption; only 30,000 tons were purchased by ONCAD
in 1973/74. Maize production is about 30,000 tons per year, of which some
12,000 tons were purchased by ONCAD in 1973/74. ONCAD's producer price for
millet and sorghum, which had been considered too low to encourage produc-
tion of a marketable surplus, was recently raised from CFAF 25/kg to CFAF
30/kg, while that of maize was set at CFAF 35/kg. With world market prices
for these commodities doubling between 1972 and 1974, the new producer
prices are about CFAF 5/kg below their economic value based on import sub-
stitution, and about equal in 1974 terms to the corresponding prices projected
for 1980 (Tables 1 and 2). There is a possibility for some substitution of
millet for wheat in bread (up to 25% of the flour). The main prospect, how-
ever, lies in its substitution for urban consumption of rice, two thirds of
which must be imported. There is a strong preference for rice in Senegal
because of taste and because it is easy to prepare, in contrast to millet.
In addition consumption of imports by the urban population has been en-
couraged by recent consumer price subsidies. Prior to 1972, the wholesale
cost of imported rice was about CFAF 29/kg while that of domestic rice was
CFAF 39.51kg. To encourage local production, domestic rice was subsidized
from taxes on imported rice and both were sold at a wholesale price of
CFAF 37/kg, which was about half the price of processed millet couscous.



ANNEX 15
Page 3
However, the world market price of rice tripled between 1972 and 1974 and,
although some decline is expected, it should remain considerably higher
than the 1972 level for the rest of the decade. With this increase, the whole-
sale price of rice was raised to CFAF 58/kg, which meant the previous tax on
imported rice was replaced by a subsidy equivalent to about half the wholesale
cost. At these prices, rice was cheaper than processed millet couscous, and
there was no incentive to substitute the domestic produce for the imported
grain. Recognizing the severe strain imposed on its finances and the adverse
conditions it imposed for the domestic market, Government withdrew the subsidy
in November, 1974, and announced that prices would follow the world market in
future. This decision should bring the multiple benefits of (i) reducing
imports and the burden on the Government budget, (îi) enabling domestic rice
production to become more attractive, and (iii) allowing millet to become more
competitive for a share of the urban cereal market.
Export Crops
8.        Groundnut marketing is a Government monopoly.  The marketing agency,
ONCAD, buys groundnuts from the cooperatives at a fixed price, provides hand-
ling and transport services, and sells the groundnuts to oil millers at a
price based on the world market price. The total marketed production, rang-
ing from 500,000 to 1 million tons per year, is processed locally; and vir-
tually all of the groundnut cake and about 80% of the oil is exported. Oil
is sold on the domestic market at a subsidized price of CFAF 200, compared
to a total wholesale cost of about CFAF 300.
9.        The price of shelled groundnuts, which fluctuated around US$190/ton
through the 1960's, reached US$610/ton in April-May of 1974. As a result of
the world price trend, ONCAD's selling price to oil millers increased from
CFAF 34/kg in 1971/72 to CFAF 80/kg in 1973/74. Only a fraction of the recent
increases was at first passed to farmers, as the producer prices for unshelled
groundnuts were increased from CFAF 23.1/kg in 1971/72 to only CFAF 29.5/kg
in 1973/74. But Government has now raised the price for the 1974 crop to CFAF
41.5/kg. The world market price for groundnuts in constant terms is expected
to decline through 1980 to the extent that, if the producer price is maintained
at CFAF 41.5/kg in 1974 terms, no transfers would be made to the price stabil-
ization fund, but to the contrary, this fund may be required to support the
farmgate price. To maintain positive and adequate balances--for price
stabilization and revenues for Government sufficient to cover the costs on
behalf of groundnut farmers--the producer price may have to be lowered to
about CFAF 27/kg in 1974 terms (Table 3). This price has been used in all
financial analysis in this report.                            1
10.       Cotton marketing and ginning is the exclusive monopoly of SODEFITEX.
About 55% of the cotton fiber is exported, with the rest sold to local
textile factories; this proportion is likely to change as production in-
creases faster than local demand. All seed not required for planting is
sold to oil mills, and most of the oil is exported.



ANNEX 15

11.       World market prices for medium staple cotton have almost doubled
in the last two years, rising from about US$0.38/lb in 1972 to US$0.70/lb
in 1974. The proportion of the proceeds of sales transfered to the stabili-
zation fund increased from about 25% of the selling price in 1972/73 to 60%
for the 1973/74 campaign. Coupled with a 40% increase in production,
stabilization fund revenues increased from CFAF 300 million to about CFAF 2
billion over the same period.  Governnent has increased the net producer
price for seed cotton by 55%, from CFAF 30/kg in 1973/74 to CFAF 46.5/kg
for the 1974 crop, and with the expected decline in world market prices the
stabilization fund revenues will fall substantially. But even so, it should
be possible to retain a farmgate price of CFAF 46.5/kg in 1974 terms, and
leave adequate revenues for Government (Table 4). Therefore, this,price
has been used for the projects financial calculations.

SINE SALOUM AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
ECONOMIC RATE OF RETURN CALCULATION -/
1.        The project is designed to take farmers through a four-year crop
rotation cycle and an intensification process which would gradually expand
until all of the land cultivated by a given farmer would be included. However,
the nature of the techniques involved is such that any farmer participating
in the project would be able to maintain the level of production reached
during the project period.  Thus farmers participating for the full five
years (or as long as eight years if covered by the pilot project) would have
removed stumps from, and spread intensive cultivation techniques to, a much
larger portion of their total areas than would farmers entering the project
at a later stage, but all farmers would retain the benefits of the areas
actually uprooted, and of the introduction of ox-drawn plowing and comprehen-
sive fertilization beyond the project period. The economic rate of return
calculation makes the conservative assumption that extension activities do
not continue beyond the five-year project period and that farmers trained
during this period would be able to maintain the levels of production reached
by PY5 for an additional five years.
2.        Costs - Cost figures include all project investment and operating
costs for SODEVA. No incremental extension costs are included after full
development in PY 5, as project benefits would be obtained with expenditures
at pre-project levels.
3.        All labor would be provided by the families of project farmers
and the incremental needs of the project are valued at zero, as the addi-
tional time spent on project activities would not otherwise be used for
productive activities.
4.        Costa exclude all direct taxes, duties, and provisions for expected
price increases.
5.        Costs include incremental seasonal farm inputs; the purchase cost
and maintenance for farm implements; farm costs for draft oxen, steer fatten-
ing, calves and breeding cows; and physical contingencies.
1/   All economic and financial calculations were based on 1974 prices,
exchange rates, and commodity projections. Checks were made using
revised 1975 figures and the net effects were negligble.



ANNEX 18
Page 2
6.        Benefits - Benefits are calculated on the incremental production
attributable to the project, and output is stabilized by PY 5, the assumed
full development of the project. Estimates include a provision for drought
in PY 2, 6 and 10, that would reduce increments expected in average years by
60%. The calculation assumes that, without the project, farmers' productivity
and productivity per hectare would not change. Details of incremental pro-
ject crop production are in Annex 14 and livestock production in Annex 7.
7.        Groundnut and cotton output is treated as exports and cereals and
livestock output as import substitution. The economic farmgate prices for
crops used in the rate of return calculation are based on the Bank's projec-
tions and details are in Annex 15. Prices for livestock and livestock pro-
ducts are based on current market prices and are also detailed in Annex 15.
8.        Sensitivity Analysis - The sensitivity of the rate of return has
been tested against changes in costs and benefits due to price and drought
effects and the results indicate that the project would be justified econom-
ically under most conceivable circumstances. Details of the sensitivity
analysis are in Table 2.
9.        A rate of return has also been calculated to allow for the estimated
substitution of maize and sorghum by groundnuts that might occur if the
market for cereals did not develop as expected. In these circumstances it
is estimated that the rate of return would be 16%.
