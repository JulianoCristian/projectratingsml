MANAGEMENT\n            OF PROTECTED AREAS", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Participatory Management\n            of Protected Areas Project for Peru were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, risk to development outcome was\n            low or negligible, Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: innovations should be piloted in more than\n            one area. Although this adds a layer of complexity, it will\n            test the innovation in a variety of circumstances.\n            Attempting to fine-tune the criteria and select a pilot that\n            appears to have the best conditions risks failure of the\n            test, as unforeseen circumstances may arise that cannot be\n            resolved. The importance of communications in establishing\n            the transparency and trust needed for effective\n            participation of a range of diverse stakeholders has already\n            been mentioned. Communications must be tailored to address\n            local interests and concerns. A communications strategy\n            should be conceived of broadly, going beyond dissemination\n            of information to promoting forums, processes, mechanisms,\n            and instruments for inclusion. The willingness of local\n            populations and communities to become involved in\n            conservation tasks is enormous. Participatory management\n            will progress and succeed to the extent that there is shared\n            information and analysis and the parties perceive the\n            distribution of costs and benefits as equitable. Economic\n            interests may be more powerful than environmental awareness\n            as a motivation for participation. Thus environmental\n            awareness raising programs will not be enough to achieve\n            effective participation. A long-term results-oriented\n            management approach, such as the Administration Contract\n            instrument, may more effectively promote efficiency than the\n            more traditional project-specific implementation contract.\n            The requirement for the contractor to make a financial\n            commitment also promotes efficiency. It is important,\n            however, to allow the financial commitment to be fulfilled\n            progressively in order not to discriminate against smaller\n            partners that may have less short-term financial capacity.\n            It should not be assumed that the Borrower agencies that\n            participated in project preparation and are to be involved\n            in its implementation will have a clear, much less common,\n            view of the objectives, strategy, and activities of the\n            project, particularly as the preparation phase may be\n            lengthy and there may be rotation of key staff during it.\n            Project launch to promote a common understanding and buy-in\n            is, therefore, critical."}, "docdt": "2011-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
