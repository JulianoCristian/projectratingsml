Some of those impacts are discussed in this\n            summary: Camping sites will be located strategically to\n            avoid harming vegetation, forest animals and\n            plants-especially endangered species-and water and soil.\n            Adhering to camping ethics will be reinforced with visitors.\n            Drainage systems will be built to protect the infrastructure\n            of protected areas from flooding. Visitors will be educated\n            on the prohibition of collecting plants and animals, proper\n            waste disposal, restricted access areas, and regulations for\n            using footpaths, etc. Solar, wind or water will be used as\n            energy sources. Latrines and other installations will\n            collect and store liquid and solid waste. Fire emergency\n            plans will be issued. Existing infrastructure will be\n            adapted to blend in visually with its surroundings or\n            replaced and cables will be buried. Electric generators will\n            be operated within closed structures to prevent spills and\n            reduce noise. Road repair will be done with light equipment\n            to avoid damage to vegetation and to soil. Where roads would\n            possibly interfere with forest animals, adequate signage\n            will be posted. The number of vehicles will be limited in\n            sensitive environs."}, "docdt": "2002-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
