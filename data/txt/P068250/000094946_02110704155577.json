social assessment of the\n            Participatory Management and Protected Areas (PAs) Project\n            for Peru discusses potentially adverse social impacts\n            identified through the social assessment and public\n            consultation process during preparation. First, certain\n            zoning categories defined in the Management Plans may result\n            in limiting or eliminating public access to relevant areas\n            (strict conservation areas). Second, five of the six\n            protected areas are populated by ethnic or indigenous\n            groups, most of which live in extreme poverty and depend on\n            subsistence agriculture and natural resources exploitation.\n            Demographic growth and consumption patterns have combined\n            and increased pressure on PA lands and natural resources.\n            Land tenure disputes exist in three of the five areas and\n            will not be resolved by this project. The project promoted\n            private involvement in PA management through concessions,\n            which has been perceived by some communities as adversely\n            affecting their welfare. Lastly there is a risk that the\n            privatization approach may further complicate the\n            relationship existing between the National Institute for\n            Natural Resources (INRENA) and the communities and result in\n            impeding PA management. To address these issues, the\n            project's social strategy calls for adopting a Process\n            Framework and an Indigenous Peoples Development Framework,\n            and promoting public participation in project-supported PAs."}, "docdt": "2002-10-21T00:00:00Z"}
