planning and sustainable management of\n            at least five protected areas (PA) of the Peruvian System of\n            Natural Protected Areas (SINANPE), and one PA to be created\n            during project implementation; and ii) obtain sustainability\n            for the financing of recurrent cost in SINANPE. The project\n            will build upon the experience gained during the first GEF\n            Grant to PROFONANPE, supporting the Trus Fund's\n            establishment and development of its capacity to attract\n            financial resources for conservation. The project has three\n            major components: 1) participatory protected area management\n            by involving civil society, private sector and local\n            community organizations in the decision making process and\n            management of the PAs; 2) institutional development to\n            consolidate PA management through the strengthening of\n            INRENA, PROFONANPE, PAMCs, civil society organizations and\n            private sector to manage the PAs collaboratively; 3) PA\n            financing, administration, monitoring and evaluation, and\n            information dissemination in order to increase the\n            PROFONANPE endowment fund, design and implement a SINANPE\n            financing strategy."}, "docdt": "2003-02-20T00:00:00Z"}
