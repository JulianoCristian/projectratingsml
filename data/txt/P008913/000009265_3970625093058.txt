PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
TURKEY - BALIKESIR NEWSPRINT PROJECT
(LOAN 1258-TU)
PREFACE
Loan 1258-TU for the Balikesir Pulp and Paper Project for
US$70.0 million was signed May 21, 1976 and was closed on September 13,
1983, the full amount of the loan having been disbursed.
Thet main objective of the Loan was to finance the construction of
a pulp mill, a newsprint paper mill, a sawmill, pollution abatement
facilities and ancillary installations. In addition to help meet the
growing dea-nd for newsprint in the country, the project would generate
substantial foreign exchange savings.
The Project Completion Report has been prepared by the Industry
Department based on a draft prepared by the Borrower and the findings of an
Industry Department mission in October 1983. Comments received from the
Borrower are reproduced in the Attachment.
This project has not been audited by the Operations Evaluation
Department.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
TURK - BALIKEsnSR NEWSPRINT PROJECT
(LOAN 1258-TLU)
HIGHLIGHTS
i.        Implementation of the entire project was completed about 24
months behind schedule, with slight cost underrun (1.1Z in US$ terms). The
main reason for the implementation delay was slow construction progress
during a period of general economic difficulties which resulted in a
shortage of local materials and local currency financing. In addition to
these local delays, SEKA was unable to open letters of credit on time thus
resulting in delays of shipments from foreign suppliers (para 3.10).
During the implementation period, Balikesir was under the direction of five
different mill managers (one of which held the post on two separate
occasions). While impossible to quantify, this instability in top
management undoubtedly had a detrimeutal effect on project implementation
and in the coordination between SEKA management and the consultant
(para 3.11). On the other hand, technical assistance arrangements,
including training, during implementation and start-up were judged
satisfactory by both SEKA and the Bank (para 3.06).
ii.       The sawmill component of the project was commissioned in mid-1980
without incident about one year behind schedule and operated briefly at
design capacity shortly thereafter. The production of sawnwood, however,
has been well below appraisal estimates not as a result of any physical
deficiency in the plant or lack of operating capability by SEKA, but rather
due to the severe depression in the construction industry of the country
%para 4.01). Although the sawmill represents a small part of the total
investment (6%), sawmilling residues are important in the operating cost
structure of newsprint production. After initial technical difficulties
due t3 equipment failure, production performance of the newsprint mill has
been good, reaching 80% of design capacity in its 31st month of operation
which is close to the appraisal estimates (paras 4.02-4.03). Operating
costs have been higher than foreseen, mostly as a result of increases in
the cost of pulplogs, fuel oil, labor, imported chemicals and the
previously mentioned low volume of sawmilling residues (para 5.01).
iii.      As a result of delayed start-up of the project, and slow and
partial adjustment of product prices to offset increasing input costs,
Balikesir's financial performance has progressed more slowly than estimated
at appraisal. Provided that more timely price increases are granted should
production costs increase, the company is expected to make a profit in its
fifth year of operation or about two years later than foreseen at
appraisal. The project is now expected to achieve a financial rate of
return of 5% compared to 7.7% estimated at appraisal. However, if the



sawnwood market should recover earlier than anticipated and the company
could improve the present profit margin, by say 5%, the return would be
higher than the appraisal estimate (para 5.03). The economic rate of
return is presently estimated at 15.3% (para 6.02).
iv.       The Bank was involved since the early stages of project
preparation and played an important role in assisting SEKA and the Turkish
authorities in adequate preparation and implementation of the project.
Given the introduction of new technology in the country, the Bank was also
instrumental in defining technical assistance arrangements for the
project (para 7.03). By Increasing the size of the loan to allow
procurement of the whole technology package under Bank guidelines, the Bank
also ensured strong Bank influence in project implementation. The lessons
that can be learned from this project are:
(a) With suitable training and adequate technical assistance,
introduction of new technology which has clear technical and
financial advantages can be appropriate (para 7.03);
*b) The Bank should not underestimate the potential difficulties in
coordinating action between public sector enterprises and related
government agencies particularly if this action requires the
abolishment of traditional operating practices (para 7.01); and
Cc) Stability and competence of top management are of paramount
importance, particularly for their effect on the implementation
schedule (para 3.04).



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
TURKEY - BALIKESIR NEWSPRINT PROJECT
(LOAN 1258-TU)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Since the early 1960s with financial assistance from United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and with the help of the Food and
Agricultural Organization (FAO), Turkey had been systematically surveying
its forest resources (the fourth largest forests in Europe) and studying
ways of introducing more intensive utilization. The Akdeniz Forest
Utilization Project, which utilized wood resources along the Southern
Mediterranean coast was the first result of these surveys, as well as the
first attempt in Turkey to integrate closely industrial and forest
development. In 1974, the Bank approved a US$40.0 million loan to the
Gover mnt of Turkey for the construrtion of the Akdeniz integrated sawmill
and pulp and paper mill for linerboard and sackkraft. This project started
commercial operations on January 1984, and preparation of the PCR has been
initiated.
1.02      The Balikesir Pulp and Paper Project, which uses forest resources
along the northern and western areas of the country, was thus the second
Bank loan in support of Turkey's forest industry. The project represented
not only an important industrial investment in the country aimed at meeting
the growing demand for paper products but an equally important measure to
utilize more effectively and more fully Turkey's valuable renewable natural
resources.
II. PROJECT BACKGROU-ND
A. Project Preparation, Appraisal and Loan Approval
2.01      Using preliminary results of a detailed Turkish study of the
North Aegean, Marmara and Black Sea Regions (North Turkey Forest Study), a
prefeasibility study and, subsequently, a full feasibility study were
commissioned by UNDP, with FAO as executing agency, and the Bank involved
as an observer, for the Balikesir Pulp and Paper Project. The feasibility
study was prepared by consulting engineers of Vancouver, Canada and a first
draft was completed in January 1975. In March 1975, the Government and the
State Pulp and Paper Enterprise (SEKA) requested Bank financing for the
Project.
2.02      The Project was appraised in September 1975 on the basis of this
study. At the time of appraisal, the mission focussed mainly on financial
and pricing issues. The appraisal mission also discussed in detail the



size of the Bank loan and recommended that the proposed loan be
substantially increased to allow procurement of the whole paper machine and
pulp-making equipment under Bank guidelines, an action that could lead to
significant savings and stronger Bank influence in project implementation.
2.03      In April 1976, negotiations between the Turkish authorities and
the Bank took place and on May 18, 1976, the Bank's Executive Directors
approved a loan of US$70.0 million jointly to SEKA and the Balikesir
Establishment for 15 years, including 4 years of grace, at an interest rate
of 8.5Z per annum plus a fee of one and one half percentage points that
would be due to the Government. The loan became effective on October 15,
1976.
B. Project Description and Objectives
2.04      The Project's primary objectives were to provide for Turkey's
growing need for newsprint to support an expanding newspaper industry and
to make more intensive use of the available forest resources. An
integrated mill was chosen to permit processing of both sawlogs and pulp
logs and use the sawmilling residues in the pulping operation. A newsprint
capacity was chosen consistent with market demand, the available raw
material, and SEKA's operating capability with adequate training and
operating assistance.
2.05      The Balikesir Pulp ana Paper Project comprises:
(a) a sawmill to produce about 105,000 m3 per year of air-dried
sawnwood;
(b)  a wood preparation plant to produce about 86,000 m' of wood
chips;
(c) a thermomechanical wood pulp mill to produce about 79,100
bone-dry tons per year of thermomechanical wood pulp;
(d) a newsprint mill to produce about 100,000 tons per year of
newsprint at the standard basis weight of 52 g per m2;
(e) pollution abatement facilities, including a system tor effluent
treatment and disposal; and
(f) ancillary facilities, including a 9 MW non-condensing
turbogenerator to minimize voltage variations and provide
sufficient electric power to the newsprint machine for up to two
hours in the event of an outage.
2.06      The Project is located 12 kma southeast of the city of Balikesir,
on the main highway to Izmir at an average hauling distance of 150 km of
the major forest areas serving the project. Although the site is near the
railway network, transport for the project is being entirely done by road
since the trucking industry is able to provide fast and reliable services.

2.07      Although the species of pine available to the Project had never
been used in newsprint manufacture, laboratory and pilot plant testing
carried out in reputable Canadian and American installations showed that
the Turkish species were suitable for newsprint manufacturing using newly
developed but adequately tested process improvement, i.e., thermomechanical
pulping and twin-wire sheet forming on the newsprint machine. The choice
of this technology was aimed at obtaining important advantages to the
Project both in reducing manufacturing costs and improving product quality.
III.  PROJECT IHPLEMENTAIION AND MANAGEMEIT
A. Achievement of Project Objectives
3.01      The principal objective of the Project, to reduce imports of
newsprint through increased domestic product-on, has been achieved, with
the mill producing approximately 80Z of its design capacity in 1983, its
third year of operations. Production in the first three years of
operation, amounting to 168,000 tons, represents a foreign exchange savings
of between U$90-100 million. The broader objectives of more efficient use
of the main raw material, wood, through integration of a sawmill and pulp
mill, plus the significant energy saving resulting from delivering wood
with bark intact so that it can be removed in the mill and used as fuel,
however, have not been achieved. Failure to achieve this is due to the
continuation of forestry practices which provide for hand-barking in the
woods,1/ and an apparent disregard for allocating logs for their best
use.  Thus the mill continues to receive large diameter logs for paper
production, so much so that the installed chippers have become a production
L-ttle.neck bzause they were designei to handle small dirameter pulplogs
-tch it was igreed tbh  Project w'o' d receive.  In addition, poor quality
sawlogs have restric:ed sawmill production thus compounding the existing
problem of a depressed sawnwood market. It should be noted that, prior to
the implementation of this project, MOF was the only sawmill operator in
the public sector and were reluctant to see their role being diminished
somewhat by the construction of a large modern sawmill by SEKA. The result
has been a deterioration in the relationship between SEKA and KOF, and SEKA
has had a continuing problem in obtaining appropriate volume and quality of
wood. Finally, the objective of completing the Project in 3 years was not
achieved (almost 5 years actual).
B. Project Scope Changes
3.02      There have been no significant changes in project scope compared
with that agreed at time of appraisal, except for an increase in the
training program which was requested by the Bank and agreed to by SEKA.
1/   The MOF has indicated that this procedure is required to prevent tree
infections. However. with proper scheduling for prompt delivery from
forest to mill, this alleged problem can be circumvented.

C. Project Management
3.03      The Project was implemented by the Balikesir Muessesesi, i.e.,
the Balikesir Establishment, a legally established subsidiary of Turkiye
Seluloz ve Kagit Fabrikalari Mudurlugu (SEKA), which is the Turkish State
Economic Enterprise for Pulp and Paper. SEKA retained a Canadian
consulting firm to undertake basic engineering and detailed process design,
including preparation of tender documents and evaluation of bids, and
on-site supervision of erection. Civil design and construction was
undertaken by Turkish consultants and contractors.
D. Employment and Training
3.04      Balikesir currently employs 1,040 nationals (374 administrative
staff and 666 operating and maintenance personnel). This compares with a
total of 850 (125 administrative and 725 operating) estimated at
appraisal. Most of the increased number of administrative staff over the
appraisal estimate is actually assigned to township duties (i.e.,
maintenance, gardeners, drivers, etc.).  The staff have been drawn from
other SEKA mills and also recruited locally. Generally, recruitment and
training have been satisfactory but somewhat unstable at the higher
management levels as demonstrated by the change of four mill managers
during the period 1978-1981. Since July 1981, however, the situation has
stabilized and there have been no further changes. The situation in
Balikesir was similar to SEKA as a whole which for political reasons was
also affected by frequent changes in senior management, and high turnover
of technical staff as a result of inadequate salaries.
3.05      The consultants conducted training at the mill s-te through
classroom teaching and hands-on training during implementation and after
start-up. Some key SEKA personnel were also trained in the consultant's
headquarters and in operating mills in North America.  The achievement of
production levels close to appraisal estimates indicates this training has
been successful.
E. Use and Performance of Consultants
3.06      The main consultant for this project was involved in project
identification, preparation, implementation, training and start-up. Their
performance was judged satisfactory by both SEKA and the Bank. However,
coordination between SEKA management and the consultant was not as
effective as desired and contributed to the lengthy implementation period.
F. Procurement
3.07      All major machinery and equipment was procured under
international competitive bidding (ICB) using Bank guidelines. SEKA report
that they experienced no difficulties following these guidelines. The loan
was fully disbursed in the original categories with no changes.



-5-
3.08      Foreign procurement through ICB was spread among 11 countries,
with 3 of these providing major packages: paper machine and ancillary
equipment from Italy, turbo-generator and other electrical equipment from
the Federal Republic of Germany and the thermo-mechanical pulping plant and
sawmill, as well as consulting services, from Canada. Among foreign
suppliers, the most important ones were Canada (26.5Z), Italy (22X), UK
(19%) and the FRG (16.3%). Turkish suppliers selected through ICB supplied
1.9% of the Bank-financed goods and services.  Full procurement details are
shown in Annex 3-1.
G. Implementation Schedule
3.09      A comparison of the appraisal and actual implementation schedules
is presented in Annex 3-2. At the time of appraisal it was estimated that
the sawmill would start up in October 1978 and the newsprint mill in
January 1979. These targets were not achieved. The sawmill commissioning
was completed about one year late in September 1979, and the newsprint mill
two years late in January 1981.
3.10      The major cause of delay was slow construction progress during a
period of general economic difficulties in the country which resulted in a
shortage of local materials and local currency financing.- Local
contractors were not paid on time and work essentially stopped on several
occasions. In addition to these local delays there was reluctance on the
part of some foreign suppliers to ship materials during this period for
fear of not being paid, because SEKA was unable to open letters of credit
in a timely fashion.
3.11      During the implementation period, Balikesir was under the
direction of five different mill managers, one of which held the post on
two separate occasions. While it is impossible to quantify, this
inztability in top management undoubtedly had a detrimental effect on
project implementation. Coordination between SEKA management and the
consultant also suffered.
H. Ecology
3.12      Although pulp and paper mills in general can be potentially
damaging to the environment, this is not a particularly serious problem in
the case of newsprint mills which use mechanical rather than chemical
pulping processes.  Before Bank involvement, the Balikesir mill was
originally planned to be a chemical pulp mill, but primarily because of the
low flow in the river which would receive effluent, this was judged to be
unacceptable by several consultants and international organizations who
advised SEKA and the Government. The Project was therefore switched to
produce newsprint.
3.13      The mill is capable of a high level of water recirculation to
reduce effluent discharge to a minimum. Effluent is treated in a primary
clarifier to reduce suspended fine pulp fibers, followed by secondary
treatment in an aerated lagoon where oxygen-demanding dissolved organic



- 6 -
material, primarily wood sugars, are oxidized. Treated effluent is then
discharged to the Simav River. The system has operated according to design
expectations and no detrimental effects on the environment have been
experienced.
1. Capital Costs, Financing and Loan Disbursement
3.14      The total financing required for the Project was
US$197.8 million, about 1% lower than the 1976 estimate. The total foreign
exchange cost of the Project was US$95.0 million (about 16% higher than the
estimate) and the total local currency cost was US$102.8 million equivalent
(about 13% below the estimate). Capital cost estimates at the time of
appraisal and actual figures are shown in Annex 3-3, and summarized below:

disbursements. The figures are subject to some error since the exact
timing of disbursements versus the many devaluations is not
precisely known.
b/  Price and physical contingencies included in the appraisal estimate are
distributed among individual cost items to facilitate comparison with
the actual expenditures.
3.15      Despite the lengthy implementation period of the project, the
more than two years' delay in commissioning and the massive currency
realignments which occurred during the period, actual project costs are
very close to the appraisal estimate. The provision of adequate price and
physical contingencies (37% of the base cost estimate) and the advanced
stage of procurement of the main technology packages at the time of
appraisal contributed to the accuracy of the estimates. Expressed in local
currency, local costs were about 113% higher than appraisal mainly due to
the high domestic inflation and the implementation delays. On account of
the maxi-devaluations of the Turkish lira which took place during 1979-81
(the years of heaviest disbursements), when expressed in US dollar
equivalent, local costs actually declined by 14%. Total project



- 7 -
costs were 6Z below appraisal estimates although given the project delay,
actual iuterest during construction expenses increased 1.5 times.
3.16      The original closing date of the Bank loan was December 31,
1981. However, as a result of delays in project implementation, the Bank
agreed to a one-year extension of the closing date through December 31,
1982. The loan was fully disbursed and the account closed on September 13,
1983. Compared to the appraisal estimates (Annex 3-4), disbursements were
as follows:

IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
A. Production Build-up
4.01      The sawmill component of the Project was commissioned without
incident in mid-1980 and operated briefly at design capacity shortly
thereafter. However, the production of sawnwood has been dismal - in
1981, the first full year after completion, the sawmill produced only
900 m3 of sawnwood, less than 1% of its design annual capacity of
105,000 m3.  In i982 the production was 3,100 m3 and up to September 1983
it had produced at an annual rate of only 16,500 m3 or about 15X of
design. This poor performance is not the result of any physical deficiency
in the plant or lack of operating capability of SEKA but simply the
collapse of the domestic sawnwood market due to the general recession and
resulting severe depression in the construction industry in the country.
Some signs of recovery in the construction sector have emerged which are
expected to improve the demand for sawnwood products. For the purpose
of financial projections and rate of return calculations, however, it has
been assumed that full production (90% of capacity utilization) will only
be reached in 1989.
4.02      The newsprint mill began commercial production in February 1981
but shortly after start-up, suffered several mechanical problems, including
failure of numerous electrical motors and burned out coils on the
turbo-generator set. On the paper machine itself, a journal on a main roll
in the forming section failed, resulting in a major breakdown of the paper
machine. In all of these cases of equipment failure, the warranty period
had expired (due to the 2-year delay in project implementation). Newsprint
production has also been restricted by the shortage of purchased electric
power, exacerbated by the reduced in-plant generating capacity due to the
failure of the turbo-generator.
4.03      In spite of these initial difficulties, following repairs by the
suppliers, production performance has been good. In the third year of
operation the annual operating rate was 80% of design and in the 31st month
the mill operated at full capacity during the entire month. Appraisal
estimates and actual production figures for both sawnwood and newsprint are
shown in Annex 4-1.
B. Marker Developments
4.04      Domestic demand for sawnwood products have developed well below
appraisal estimates and the future is uncertain (para 4.01). Except for a
recent sale of 21,000 m3 to Iran, attempts to export have been largely
unsuccessful. Some of the reasons are: (i) SEKA's lack of experience in
export marketing for sawnwood; (ii) poor product quality; and (iii) low
economic activity due to internal unrest of many neighboring countries
which would be natural markets for the Project. However, the sawmills
represent a small investment, profits from exports would be small, and
sawnwood exports would not likely be a high priority for the company.



- 9 -
4.05      Domestic demand for newsprint during the period 1976-1983 grew at
a rate of 6.3Z per annum compared with 8% estimated in the appraisal
report. At present, the Project accounts for more than half of the
existing newsprint capacity in Turkey. Actual figures for the country's
production, consumption and imports of newsprint are shown in full detail
in Annex 4-2 and summarized below:

Even at full production in the Project from 1985 onwards, a deficit
situation will exist.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
A.  Value of Sales and  ;   -:tion Costs
5.01      Prese:t Turkish prices for the project products and manufacturing
costs per ton of newsprint are shown in Annex 5-1. Sawnwood costs are not
being analyzed due to the small production level of the mill. The average
price of newsprint in 1983 terms was 10.3% lower than at time of appraisal
in 1975. The cost per ton of one of the two main raw materials, pulplogs,
increased by 139% while the other, semi-bleached kraft pulp decreased by
23h. The costs of fuel in the same period increased by about four times
while the total cost of purchased power decreased by 50%. The decrease in
power cost is due to a much lower actual specific consumption than
estimated at appraisal. The high appraisal estimate was based on
laboratory tests performed on samples of Balikesir wood. Overall
production costs, excluding depreciation and financial charges, increased
by 4%, while newsprint price decreased by 10%. Historical newsprint prices
are shown in Annex 5-3.



- 10 -
B. Financial Analysis
5.02      Financial results and projections are shown in Annex 5-2.  They
are based on actual volume and value of sales through the end of 1983;
projections are based on present prices applied to the forecast volume of
production and sales and assumes that the sawmill reaches full production
(90% of capacity utilization) in 1989.
5.03      The internal financial rate of return in 1983 dollars after sales
tax but before corporate income tax is 5.0% compared with 7.72 estimated at
the time of appraisal and 7.5Z before sales tax and corporate income tax
compared with 11.8% at appraisal.  The lower return is due to (i) almost
two years' delay in project completion (para 3.10); (ii) slower production
build-up (para 4.01); (iii) higher operating costs (para 3.01, 5.01); and
(iv) lower price increases.  The sensitivity analyses indicate that any
combination of increased sawnwood production and sales earlier than
projected or 5% decrease in operating costs, e.g. use of tree bark as fuel
(para 3.01), and 5% increase in prices, increases the return after sales
tax and before corporate income tax to a range between 9.9-10.4%.
VI. ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE
6.01      According to the latest FAO estimates, world newsprint capacity
is projected to increase through the late 1980s at a rate appreciably lower
(2.3%) than the growth during the period 1978-82 (3.7%) (Annex 6-1).
During the early 1980s, world-wide recession and excess capacity provided
the setting for some of the lowest newsprint prices recorded in the
international market. In spite of periodic drops and rises, annual average
prices recorded by a major trading house in the UK show a steady long-term
increase in the price of newsprint (expressed in US dollars). In order to
determine the economic price of newsprint for rate of return calculations,
the long-term experience of a major importer has been used. For this
purpose the United Kingdom has been used as reference because the country
imports more than 1 million tons per year of newsprint from Canada and
Scandinavia, largely through long-term contracts. Appropriately adjusted
by the differential freight cost between London and Mediterranean ports
(about US$30/ton), the estimated long-term order price of newsprint at
Turkish ports has been estimated in 1983 at US$622/ton, compared to US$
611/ton in 1983 prices assumed at appraisal.
6.02      The economic rate of return calculated on the basis of the above
plus other applicable adjustments to reflect the economic values of capital
and operating costs, is 15.3% (Annex 6-2) compared to 16.1% estimated
during appraisal. The lower rate of return is due principally to the
completion delay and higher operating costs than forecast at appraisal.
6.03      The domestic production of newsprint, on the basis of the CIF
price of US$622/ton generates an annual net foreign exchange savings of
US$42.0 million measured at full production which will pay back the foreign
exchange cost of the project in about 2 years.

VII. BANK ROLE AND LESSONS LEARNED
7.01      The objective of more efficient utilization of the main raw
material (wood) through the integration of a sawmill and pulpmill, and the
utilization of bark as fuel, has not been achieved (para 3.01). The
fundamental mistake was failure to recognize that traditional practices are
difficult to change and that MOF itself was not integrated into the project
design and its intended benefits. In the proposed SEKA III project for
rehabilitation of existing facilities, the technical assistance project
would examine SEKA's overall operations, including a review of their export
potential and export marketing arrangements (possibly through joint
ventures with the private sector. Through this continuous Bank involvement
in the sector and dialogue with the Government, some changes have also been
promised which will result in higher deliveries of wood of better quality
and with the bark not removed.
7.02      A common failing seen in other Bank projects was repeated here:
we were too optimistic on implementation time and disbursement schedule.
However, much of this delay was due to the very difficult financial
situation Turkey faced during the implementation period. While much of
this difficulty was not foreseeable it does illustrate the importance of
sound financing plan and the ready availability of qualified project staff,
both foreign and local.
7.03      This project introduced new technology to Turkey
(thermomechanical pulping and twin-wire papermaking) which has clear
technical and financial advantages, but at the time of project preparation
had only relatively recently been introduced even in developed countries
where the techniques were considered major technological advances in the
production of newsprint. The successful start-up and continuing gDod
operational results at Balikesir demonstrate that in certain circumstances,
and with suitable training, introduction of new technology to developing
countries can be appropriate.
