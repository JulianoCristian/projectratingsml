MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO r%GANDA
FOR A SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS REHABILITAT10N PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed development credit to the
telecommunications parastatal, the Uganda Posts and Telecommunications
Corporation (UPTC) in Uganda for SDR 38.3 million (US$52.3 million
equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be at
&         standard IDA terms with 40 years repayment period and would mainly help
finance the rehabilitation of telecommunications facilities in and around
Kampala damaged during internal disturbances and provide essential
technical assistance to UPTC to improve its efficiency and productivity.
2.        TPTC will be the beneficiary of the entire IDA credit and the
Government will onlend to UPTC the proceeds of the credit to be used for
financing telecommunications equipment, plant and associated services
(US$45.7 million) and to be repaid over a period of 15 years, including
four years of grace, bearing the standard annual charge applicable to such
onlending agreements, with UPTC bearing the foreign exchange risk. The
remainder of credit funds (US$6.6 million) would be transferred by the
Government to UPTC as equity contribution.
3.        BackRround.  In the aftermath of many years of internal
disturbances and turmoil, Uganda's economy faces formidable difficulties.
In the short run, Uganda must effectively deal with rampant inflation and
achieve economic stability while mounting a mzjor recovery effort to
reverse the downward trend in its economy devastated by war, insecurity and
mismanagement. Rehabilitation of the basic infrastructure and increased
capacity utilization of major sectors of the economy is the key short-term
objective while institutional strengthening lay the ground for a sustained
development in the longer run.
4.        The telecommunications network impacts every aspect of the
economy. It can facilitate or greatly impede efficiency of operations in
all sectors, public or private.  Uganda has limited telecommunications
facilities, concentrated in large towns, particularly Kampala. Although
telephone density is comparable to that of other similar economies in the
region (Sudan, Tanzania), service is hampered by severe damage to the local
cable networks and subscriber facilities. As a result utilization of
existing system capacity is reduced to about 48?, and at any given time
about a quarter of the connected telephones lines are out of order.
5.        In 1983 IDA financed its first Telecommunications Project
(Credit 1367 for US$20.4 million equivalent) to rehabilitate the
telecommunications network in major population and business centers, badly
damaged during the 1978/79 war. The project also introduced a program of
institutional development. Project implementation initially was generally
satisfactory; operations of some strategic telecommunications facilities
were improved, an act established UPTC as an autonomous body, and some
badly needed improvements in accounting and subscribers' billing and
collection functions were made. However, resurgence of internal
disturbances culminating in a civil war destroyed part of what had been



2
rehabilitated and seriously impaired UPTC's ability to furtlher rehabilitate
and maintain the telecommunications services. The project consequently
fell far short of original performance targets. Rampant inflation and
inadequate tariffs to offset its impact combined with the prolonged absence
of stable management led to serious erosion in the gains in institution
building which had been achieved under the first credit.
6.        The Government has demonstrated its support to the
telecommunications sector with the inclusion of a telecommunications
rehabilitation project as one of the priorities in the public sector
investment program, and shown its commitment to UPTC's financial viability.
The Government agreed to two substantial tariff increases in the past two
years and more recently re-adjusted UPTC's tariffs to offset the impact of
devaluation of the Uganda shilling. Although tariffs adjustments have made
UPTC into a reasonably profitable institution, its management, planning and
operational capabilities need to be upgraded and key issues affecting
UPTC's efficiency, such as poor salaries and incentives, and a lack of
skilled manpower, need to be addressed more forcefully.
7.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  IDA's country strategy is to
assist the Government in its overall economic recovery effort through
improved macroeconomic management, improved policy environment for the
productive sectors, and rehabilitation of critical infrastructure, of which
telecommunications is one. The proposed project would be a continuation of
the infrastructure rehabilitation and institution building undertaken under
the first rehabilitation credit.  IDA's continued association with the
sector would enable financing for urgent sector rehabilitation at the least
cost and, with IDA's coordinating role, facilitate donor support for the
next stage of sector development.
8.        Project Objective.  The proposed project is a self-contained,
balanced and integrated package of high priority components within the
UPTC's agreed investment program. Its main focus would be on (i)
rehabilitation of the economically critical facilities and increasing the
utilization of existing exchange capacity to partly satisfy currently unmet
demand and (ii) improvement of UPTC's operational and financial performance
through institutional development.
9.        Proiect Description.  The project would be implemented over a
four year period and comprise:
(a) (i) rehabilitation of the local cable networks in Kampala,
Entebbe and Jinja through replacement of and some expansion in
primary and secondary telephone cables and associated equipment;
(ii) provision of telephone instruments, PBX, teleprinters,
facsimile and data equipment; (iii) provision of 100 subscriber
units of rural radio call equipment and a transmitter to
rehabilitate the existing radio call network; (iv) cables and
associated equipment for networks in provincial towns; (v) a
computerized subscribers' record system and microcomputers; and
(vi) vehicles and tools;
(b) institution building through (i) technical assistance to UPTC
for strengthening corporate planning, financial management,



3
training and maxipower develop:nent; (.i) consultancy services to
assist UPTC in implementing its institutional development
strategy; (Wii) fellowships and twinning arrangements with a
suitable telecommunications agency; (iv) provision of laboratory
equipment and training aids; and
(c)  provision of spare parts and materials for telecommunications
maintenance and operation.
10.       The total cost of the project, excluding duties and taxes is
estimated at US$58.8 million equivalent with a foreign exchange component
of US$52.3 million (892). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are
shown in Schedule A. Procurement and disbursement information are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in Uganda are given in Schedules C and D
respectively. A general map of Uganda is also attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report No. 7437 dated February 21, 1989 is being distributed
separately. To facilitate timely start up of project implementation UPTC
has engaged consultants for procurement assistance, under a PPF advance of
US$1 million. A second advance of US$500,000 was approved in October 1988
to finance urgent institutional needs.
11.       Agreed Actions.  It has been agreed with the Government and UPTC
that: (i) UPTC will consult with IDA on any proposals for investments
estimated to cost more than 10? of the investment planned for any one year;
(ii) Prior to December 31, 1989 UPTC will conduct a review of its
organizational structure and develop and implement proposals aimed at
reducing the workload of the Managing Director; UPTC will also assess
overall staffing gaps and redundancies and prepare a detailed staff
training program; (iii) UPTC will review its remuneration package to ensure
its competitiveness and, if necessary, make appropriate adjustments and
design and establish an appropriate incentive system by June 30, 1989; (iv)
prior to September 30, 1989 UPTC will have finalized twinning arrangements
for in-service training; (v) by June 30, 1989 UPTC will issue telephone and
telex bills witnin 15 days of the end of billing period; (vi) performance
indicators will be established to monitor amongst others, generation of
sufficient income by UPTC to finance its local currency investment
requirements through retained earnings and generate not less than 12? rate
of return on its net revalued assets; (vii) UPTC's tariffs will be reviewed
every six months and adjusted, if necessary, and pending such adjustment,
tariffs would be automatically modified in accordance with an agreed
formula to offset a part of the cost increases.
12.       Actions acceptable to IDA have been taken on the following: (a)
adoption by UPTC Board of directors of a Policy Statement which will not be
changed without consultation with IDA; (b) submission of an action plan to
reduce by June 30, 1990 UPTC accounts receivable to no more than 90 days of
sales; (c) submission of audited accounts; and (d) UPTC has submitted a
proposal for meeting the urgent needs of technical assistance for the
Pinance Department.
13.       As a condition of credit effectiveness, the Government and UPTC
have agreed to sign the Subsidiary Loan Agreement and UPTC has agreed to:
(a) award the turnkey contract for the network rehabilitation; (b) submit a



4
comprehensive institutional development program; and (c) appoint financial
consultants and recruit a Financial and Expenditure Accountant and a
Management Accountant.
14.        f-;nefits.  Adequate uninterrupted telecommunications service to
key sectors of the economy as well as the Government is crucial to Uganda's
economic recovery program. The Droposed project would nearly double the
existing telephone exchange capacity utilization through rehabilitation of
damaged cable network and associated equipment. Its main impact would be
in the capital city of Kampala and surrounding areas where most of the
country's businesses as well as Government departments and parastatals are
located. The overall economic rate of return of UPTC's 5 year investment
program, of which the proposed project is an integral part. is estimated at
about 14Z. The project would arrest further deterioration of the existing
telecommunications network and maximize its utilization for the benefit of
productive sectors of Uganda's economy. It would also establish UPTC as a
commercially oriented, financially sound and operationally effective entity
which could pave the way for eventual investment in UPTC's equity by
private investors.
15.       Risks.  The risks mainly revolve around the overall uncertain
country situation. Considerable institutional risks in terms of UPTC's
poor financial performance and/or inadequate management and operational
controls also exist. Given the Government's commitment to the speedy
rehabilitation of key sectors of the economy and the ongoing dialogue
between the Bank, the Government and UPTC, these are viewed as acceptable
risks. Institutional risks to a large extent are mitigated by UPTC's and
the Government's acceptance of technical assistance and other institution
building measures and their commitment to work for UPTC's financial
viability.
16.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Artictes of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
