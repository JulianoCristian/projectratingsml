The specific\n            objectives are: (i) to strengthen the quality and efficiency\n            of basic education, with a view to raising student\n            achievement; (ii) to improve the effectiveness, efficiency\n            and responsiveness of technical and vocational education and\n            training (TVET); and (iii) to reinforce employment services\n            and labor market information. To these ends, the project\n            includes the following components: (a) the general education\n            support component aims to reinforce the basic education\n            foundation by improving the quality of services and raising\n            internal efficiency. The project supports the expansion of\n            innovative and cost effective instructional strategies such\n            as multi-grade teaching and school-based training; (b) the\n            TVET development component aims to increase the\n            effectiveness of TVET programs through the provision of key\n            inputs to the learning process and to raise efficiency\n            through increased sharing of facilities, expanded use of\n            program view/evaluation procedures, and introduction of user\n            fees in post-secondary education. Responsiveness would be\n            improved through the introduction of flexible curricula,\n            enhanced capabilities to evaluate performance and to\n            design/implement new programs, provision of incentives to\n            post-secondary institutions to enter into training contracts\n            with industry, and increased accountability of institutions."}, "docdt": "1993-06-04T00:00:00Z"}
