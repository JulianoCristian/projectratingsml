The seven-year\n            project achieved most of its targets and effectively\n            contributed to strengthening the country's human\n            capital base by expanding the availability of trained\n            manpower, thus enhancing productivity and facilitating\n            economic restructuring. However, there was a change in\n            national leadership in 1994, immediately after project\n            effectiveness. The new government decided not to commit to\n            the policy development sub-component of the general\n            education component of the project, scaling down the initial\n            objectives of the project, and thus contributed to the\n            implementation delay. The main lessons learned from this\n            project include: 1) A strong institutional set-up is needed\n            in complex projects. 2) Project design should be as thorough\n            as possible and requires extensive consultation with the\n            stakeholders. 3) Project design should be simplified. 4)\n            Implementation management capacity needs to be strong over\n            the entire project life. 5) Clarity of and expertise in\n            project implementation procedures is required. 6) Clarity\n            and relevance of performance indicators and implementation\n            of an education information system are essential for\n            monitoring and evaluation."}, "docdt": "2001-06-22T00:00:00Z"}
