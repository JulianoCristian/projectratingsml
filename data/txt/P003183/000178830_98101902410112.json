"The Project would support the\n            Government's efforts to diversify Zambia's energy\n            consumption away from high cost petroleum fuels by\n            determining the technical and economic viability of\n            rehabilitating the Maamba coal mining operation in Southern\n            Zambia. The Project would consist of the following\n            components: (i) technical and economic feasibility study for\n            reorganizing and rehabilitating the Maamba mining complex,\n            including an examination of coal pricing and marketing and a\n            review of Maamba Collieries' technical and managerial\n            constraints and personnel training needs; (ii) procurement\n            of critical spare parts and components needed to keep the\n            mining complex operating during the study period and quality\n            control equipment for the coal preparation plant; and (iii)\n            training of key technical personnel for the implementation\n            of the repair and maintenance program."}, "docdt": "1983-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
