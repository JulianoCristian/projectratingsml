Both the\n            Borrower and the Bank performed most of their duties\n            successfully. Most of the primary technical objectives were\n            achieved by the target date. Even so, the project did not\n            fulfill its operational purpose - to produce a bankable\n            Babai irrigation project - due in part to international\n            water rights complications. The primary lesson learned from\n            this experience is that international water rights issues\n            must receive high priority attention by all concerned, the\n            Bank, Borrower, and consultants. A strategy should be agreed\n            upon for dealing with these issues from the beginning of\n            project preparation. If not, the project could be delayed or\n            lost entirely and breakdown of understanding could occur\n            between the Borrower and the Bank."}, "docdt": "1989-03-22T00:00:00Z"}
