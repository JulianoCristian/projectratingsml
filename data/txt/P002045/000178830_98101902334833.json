           the first time in Nigeria, the feasibility of providing\n            affordable shelter, infrastructure and related urban\n            services to low income households. Urban infrastructure\n            would be furnished to provide sites and services and to\n            upgrade low income residential areas in two towns of Bauchi\n            State. Sites would also be provided for small scale\n            enterprises so as to furnish employment. Low income families\n            would be given access to construction loans and supporting\n            social services would be provided in the project area. The\n            project would benefit 74,000 people with incomes below the\n            urban median for Bauchi State. The project also seeks to\n            strengthen the planning and project implementation\n            capabilities of key institutions so that the experience\n            gained from this pilot project may be applied to other parts\n            of the country. In this context, technical assistance would\n            be provided to the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria (FMBN)\n            and to state and local authorities participating in the\n            project. In addition, the FMBN would finance from the loan,\n            studies for the preparation of urban development projects in\n            seven other states."}, "docdt": "1979-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
