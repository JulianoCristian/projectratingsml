The loan\n            will support the government's program of structural\n            adjustment and the key reforms that contribute to the\n            restoration of growth. The reforms focus on four areas: (a)\n            fiscal retrenchment; (b) strengthening and diversifying the\n            financial sector; (c) continued privatization, private\n            sector development and enterprise restructuring; and (d) a\n            more efficient social safety net."}, "docdt": "1993-11-05T00:00:00Z"}
