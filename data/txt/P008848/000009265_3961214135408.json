Economic Recovery\n            Loan (ERL) of the Slovak Republic can be rated as partially\n            satisfactory. The ERL supported the transformation of the\n            Slovak economy and provided funds for imports when they were\n            most needed. Being a small open economy, Slovakia can expect\n            to grow at a moderate pace even if foreign markets absorb\n            its exports at considerably lower rates than has recently\n            been the case. Some of the lessons are as follows: First,\n            the ERL was designed as a single tranche operation to give\n            continuity to the ongoing reform program and to be a visible\n            measure of international support to the new country. Second,\n            the lack of appropriate institutions could be an important\n            impediment to modernization and restructuring. Third, like\n            in other Central and Eastern European countries, the ERL was\n            broadly designed to support the transformation process."}, "docdt": "1996-05-16T00:00:00Z"}
