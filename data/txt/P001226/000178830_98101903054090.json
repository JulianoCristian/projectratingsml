The processing part of the project, involving\n            building and extending factories, is expected to be financed\n            by CDC and commercial sources. The part of the project to be\n            financed by IDA consists of the planting of some 35,000\n            acres of smallholder tea during the five-year period\n            commencing with the fiscal year 1968/69 and bringing to\n            maturity the most recent plantings financed under Credit\n            64-KE. It involves the supply and distribution by KTDA of\n            planting material, the supervision of smallholder\n            cultivation, training, and the collection, inspection and\n            transportation of green leaf to processing factories. For\n            these services, KTDA would collect cesses from smallholders."}, "docdt": "1968-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
