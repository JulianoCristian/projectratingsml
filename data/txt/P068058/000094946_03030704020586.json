"The Yixing Pumped Storage Project for\n            China's development objective is to increase the\n            overall efficiency of the power sector in Jiangsu Province\n            in two ways: a) design and implementation of a restructuring\n            of the power sector to further competition at the generation\n            level and to provide large consumers access to generators,\n            and b) construction of a pumped storage plant (4 x 250 MW)\n            in Yixing to ease acute peaking problems and improve the\n            generation mix that will create the conditions for more\n            flexible dispatch and improved supply reliability an\n            essential requirement for well-functioning competitive\n            markets. The project components are: 1) construction of the\n            Yinxing pumped storage power plant, a new upper reservoir,\n            new main dam and subsidiary dam, and the underground\n            powerhouse; 2) assistance to the restructuring of the power\n            sector; and 3) construction of a double circuit transmission\n            line to connect the Yixing pumped storage plant to the East\n            China 500 KV network. The project will contribute to the\n            Bank's energy sector strategy for China by assisting in\n            making a smooth transition from a fully state-owned\n            monopolistic sector to a diversely owned, market-oriented\n            sector in which are promoted clean fuels, renewable energy,\n            energy efficiency and assistance to poor western areas to\n            develop their energy resources for local growth and export\n            to other regions."}, "docdt": "2003-02-21T00:00:00Z"}
