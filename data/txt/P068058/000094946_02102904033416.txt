Executive Summary
1. Outline of Project
Yixing Pumped Storage Power Station Project is located in the Tongguanshan
mountainous area of the southwest suburb of Yixing, Jiangsu Province, with installed
capacity of 1000MW. The low reservoir is 8.5km away from Yingxing urban area. The
project, after completion, will play an important role in the peak regulation, valley filling,
spinning standby, frequency regulation and condenser operation, etc. for the Jiangsu
provincial power supply system.
The project is composed of three parts: water control works, water replenishing works and
transmission lines. Of which, the water control works includes the upper and lower
reservoirs, water conveyance system, powerhouse, switchyard and access roads inside and
outside the project site.
The total construction period of the project will be 6 years and the investment is RMB
4.77684 billion Yuan.
2. Major Assessment Conclusions
(1) In "Site Selection Report of the Large-Scaled Pumped Storage Power Station Projects
in Southern Jiangsu Province", the Yixing Pumped Storage Power Station Project is
recommended to be built as soon as possible. The project is located at the load center
of southern Jiangsu Province, and its maximum hydraulic head is over 400m. The
project is convenient in traffic and well in both construction condition and technical
economic indexes.
(2) The project will decrease peak to valley load difference of 2000MW in Jiangsu power
supply system, by taking the peak load and filling the valley load, greatly alleviate
peak regulation operation of thermal power plants, improve unstable frequency
condition in the system and upgrade power supply quality and reliability in the power
system. It is obvious of its remarkable social and economic benefit.
(3) It will be a new tourist spot of Yixing with the construction of the project, and it is
beneficial to the touristry and the employment condition for the local people, which
will expand the local labor market and the local social economic development.
(4) The project is located at Tongguanshan mountainous area, where the environmental
condition is well. The water quality surrounding the upper and lower reservoirs
generally meets Grade I as specified in the "Environmental Quality Standard for
Surface Water" (GHZB 1-1999). The ambient air quality meets Grade II as specified
in the "Ambient Air Quality Standard" (GB3095-1996). The acoustic environmental
quality conforms to Grade I as specified in the "Standard of Environmental Noise of
Urban Area"(GB3096-93).
(5) The basins of the upper and lower reservoirs are small areas. The natural inflow is
insufficient to meet the initial reservoir impounding of the power station, daily water
compensation during operation and water consumption during construction. Therefore,
Tuanjiu Lake water will be diverted through Huangtong River and the water quality of



Tuanjiu Lake generally conforms to Grade III specified in the "Environmental Quality
Standard for Surface Water" (GHZB 1-1999), meeting the functional planning
requirements.
During operation period, 61.8% of the months in a year need water from Tuanjiu Lake
as a supplement due to the reservoir surface evaporation and the greater seepage loss
than the inflow in the basin area. Although the diverted water quality is relatively
worse, there will be no accumulation of non-persistent and persistent pollutants in the
reservoirs after completion of the project. Therefore, the water will not be
deteriorated.
(6) There is a fish cultivating area of 61mu (1 mu  667m2)in the existing Huiwu reservoir,
mainly with grass fish, breem, crucian, silver carp and green fish etc. The average
fishing product yields of the reservoir accounts for only 0.00075% - 0.00125% of the
fishing output in Yixing, thus no negative impact will be brought about for the local
fishing resources and production. Only one person is on duty of all fish culture works
of the reservoir, and all income from fish culture belongs to him. None was benefit by
it. He enjoyed a certain annual retirement allowance and his personnel life was
dependable.
(7) Artificial vegetation widely covers both the upper and lower reservoirs and
surroundings. There are no rare and precious wild animals and plants in the range of
national and local protection. The forestry acquisition of the project is 3173.73 mu,
accounting for only 0.53% of the Yixing Forestry Farm. Construction activities such
as excavation, road pavement, stacking and setting up buildings will cause damages to
the construction areas and surrounding vegetation to some extent, but no systematic
impact on animal and plant resources and ecological system.
(8) The existing Huiwu reservoir is requisitioned and compensated as a special facility of
the project. The original irrigated farmland (700 mu) in Meidong area is to be irrigated
by building a water replenishing works with an irrigation capacity of 0.3 m3/s, which
is larger than the original design irrigation capacity (0.24 m3/s) of the Huiwu reservoir.
Therefore, the water replenishing works can meet the irrigation requirement with the
irrigation dependability higher than the existing reservoir.
The loss and land re-cultivated cost of the tea farm and ploughed fields for the project
acquisition was compensated according to the pertinent national standards.
(9) A total of 757 people will be affected because of the project. Among them, only 19
households 44 people (mainly staffs of the forest farm) will loss their houses, and
need to move from their original place and be resettled. The other 713 people will loss
whole or part of their cultivated land or forestry land. A smaller quantity of land is
required at host site for only 44 people to be resettled, where is simply with bushes.
Therefore, under the condition that the 'Resettlement Action Plan' is strictly executed,
it will cause little impact on the resettlers' living condition and the environment of the
host site because of the project.
(10) The max. diversion discharge for the project is 0.48m3/s (including 0.3m3/s for the
alternative irrigation scheme), being 2.59% of the annual average discharge of the
Tuanjiu Lake in draught year, and resulting in no obvious impact on the Tuanjiu Lake
water level. The project diversion will not cause adverse impact on the surrounding
2



environment of Tuanjiu Lake.
(11) The productive wastewater during construction, the damaged water and soil
conservation installations due to construction blasting and excavation, and the
increasing water and soil loss increase the turbidity of the surface runoff, which
contains some residua TNT of explosives. Thus it leads to potential impact on the
quality of the wells water used by the downstream units and the residents.
(12) The water quality of the existing Huangtong River is generally in compliance to
Grade III standard as specified in "Environmental Quality Standard for Surface
Water"(GHZB 1-1999). The wastewater and sewage at the lower reservoir in the
construction area will be treated to reach the standard and then discharged to
Huangtong River. The water in some river sections will surpass Grade III standard,
but it can still meet the water quality requirement for the construction of the power
station, the industrial enterprises operation and the farmland irrigation.
(13) Asphalt concrete anti-seepage facing is used for the upper reservoir basin and dam of
Yixing project, which is similarly used for the upper reservoir basin and dam of the
Tianhuangping Pumped Storage Power Plant. The water quality monitoring at the
initial impoundment stage of the Tianhuangping Project did not find PAHs and
benzine series that reflect the impact of soluble asphalt on the water quality. Therefore,
it is predicted that the asphalt concrete anti-seepage facing of the upper reservoir have
small impact on the water quality, only if the asphalt concrete quality and construction
procedures are well controlled.
(14) The noise from construction will have some effects on Yixing TV Transmitting
Station, Yixing 173 Micro-wave Station, the upper reservoir area, some residents at
Meiyuan village around the lower reservoir area, camp areas for the builders and the
residents along the access road.
(15) The construction blasting and excavation will have some effect on structures, TV
transmitting tower and the safety of the tower foundations, normal operation of the
communication equipments and on-duty personnel's safety of Yixing TV Transmitting
Station and Yixing 173 Microwave station.
(16) The flying dust and waste gas during construction will have some effect on air quality
in the area. However, Yixing TV Transmitting Station in the upper reservoir area,
Meiyuan village and the camp areas for builders in the lower reservoir area, are
generally in the up prevailing wind direction. The flying dust and waste gas will be
only harmful for the in-site builders.
(17) The electromagnetic wave caused by switchyard, 500kV outgoing line equipments,
and switchgear is impeded by the mountains and will have little impact of
electromagnetic wave interference, signal receiving and transmitting.
(18) The depth between the normal water level and the dead water level is 42.90m and
21.90m respectively for the upper and lower reservoirs. However, the upper reservoir
basin will be overall protected with asphalt concrete against seepage and the water
depth of the lower reservoir will not be much increased after expanding the existing
Huiwu Reservoir, and the fault and fractured zone there are not in large scale.
Furthermore, the ground surface load will not be much changed after formation of the
3



reservoirs. Therefore, the project construction will have no obvious impact on the
local geological structure and hydro-geological conditions within the upper and lower
reservoirs. Meanwhile, the project area is about 50 - 60km from the northwest
Maoshan rift and the earthquake activity is relatively weak around Yixing. Therefore,
the possibility of induced earthquake is rather small.
(19) The waste gas resulted from the asphalt concrete mixing system in the upper reservoir
area might have some effect on Nanyuesi at the mountain foot. The layout of
construction yard in the area may affect the overall local landscaping. Therefore, the
asphalt concrete mixing system should be re-arranged so as to alleviate the adverse
visual effect on the Nanyuesi.
(20) Water and soil loss possibly caused by the construction activities will be totally 4272
mu, which includes the upper reservoir area, 1# and 2# spoil disposal areas, the asphalt
concrete mixing system and concrete system at the upper reservoir area, lower
reservoir area, 3# and 4# spoil disposal areas and concrete mixing system at lower
reservoir area, temporary construction living area and land, borrow area and
construction road to the construction camp, and resettlement host site, etc. The
mitigation measures of soil and water loss should be taken for the above-mentioned
areas, including engineering and planting measures.
(21) At present, angling and swimming and other recreational activities are not allowed at
the Huiwu reservoir. According to the Forestry Law of the People's Republic of China,
the activity in forestry lands (such as cooking) possibly causing fire accident is
forbidden. After completion of the project, the above-mentioned activities will be also
strictly forbidden in the reservoir area. Therefore, it will not affect the living quality of
the inhabitants in the area.
(22) There will be 91 tower foundations at the construction of 35kV transmission line,
which will occupy about 5770m2, that is all in the forestry area, with less and scattered
land occupied, and have less impact on ecological environment. The electromagnetic
radiation of 35kV transmission facility is in exemption range and it has less
electromagnetic environment impact.
There will be 45 tower foundations at the construction of 500kV transmission line,
which will occupy about 2700m2, that is all in forestry area, with less and scattered
land occupied, and have less impact on ecological environment. The Yixing TV
Transmitting Station and Yixing 173 Microwave Station, located at the peak of
Mt.Tongguanshan, are about lkm and 1.3km away from the nearest transmission line,
which are longer than the protection distance of 500m and 700m specified by the state
respectively. Thus the transmission line will not have electromagnetic interference
impact on Yixing TV Transmitting Station and Yixing 173 Microwave Station. There is
no any radio facility within 2km range of line route and no interference on radio.
According to the design requirement, all trees along the transmission line were not be
allowed to disafforest if the distance between the line and the earth were equal or more
than 7.5m, or the natural height of which were less than 2m,or the vertical distances
between the line and trees were not less than 7m, and all tall wild trees were in the
valley.
All prescription and limitation restrict disafforestion along the transmission line, and
4



it's farthest protection to the artificial trees and vertex. It's estimated that totally 4660
trees were fell at the 35kV construction transmission line and 500kV transmission line
(according to the experience of the institute, and accounted as 200 trees every
kilometer).
Since the 35kV construction transmission line and 500kV transmission line were in the
forest, it did not change the status of the land usage and their attribution except the
tower bases and a little amount of fell trees.
3. Mitigation Measures for Environmental Impact
(1) During Construction Period
The productive wastewater and domestic sewage produced during construction period
will be collected. For the different characteristics of the wastewater and domestic
sewage, the different technical processes are adopted. They are allowed discharge after
reaching "Integrated Wastewater Discharge Standard" (GB8978-96) Grade I. Five
sewage treatment stations are considered according to the construction layout, with
total capacity of 11900t/d.
The oil-contained sewage produced from the oil storage/tanks during construction
period will be discharged after treated and reaching Grade I standard in "Integrated
Wastewater Discharge Standard". Treatment of oil-contained sewage may be by
three-section oil-separating tank or moveable sewage treating machine.
Yixing TV transmitting tower will be relocated. Trial blasting should be done to
control the dosage of explosives precisely. The TV Transmitting Station and
Microwave Station should be informed about the blasting time before each blasting
ahead of time. Alarm should be given before blasting to avoid outdoor activities of
builders during the blasting period to ensure personal safety. In order to prevent the
flying stone, more mitigation measures should be taken, such as steel mesh for
windows of structures, straw bags over the roof, protection mesh over the exposed
cables, antenna, feeders etc., straw bags on the ground feeder, steel piping for finer
cables and wires. A 3m high sound insulating wall outside the equipment house of the
TV Transmitting Station, and all windows are changed to double-layered, both for
sound insulation and safety purpose.
The wholly enclosed cement storage will be adopted. The sprinkling truck will be
equipped for routine spraying along the roads to reduce the flying dusts. The
excavation yard at the base of dam, quarry and the other dusty areas will also be
sprayed periodically with manual control. Wet-drilled method will be used for
excavation of underground powerhouse, conveyance system and construction drifts. In
order to reduce dust discharge, it is necessary to improve the tunnel ventilation and
airflow rate. The air clarification device will be installed at the smoke and dust
discharge equipment of the auxiliary factories to meet the discharge standard. The
materials that may cause flying dust (such as soil/rock material and cement) will be
covered with waterproof cloth during transportation. The asphalt concrete construction
of the upper reservoir should be approved by the local environmental protection
authority (i.e., obtaining the environment protection permit). Mixing of the asphalt
5



oncrete should be strictly following the requirements.
lentilation device is considered for water conveyance system and underground
)owerhouse caverns. All the builders in the tunnel are ensured with safety and labor
'rotection.
'or strong noise sources, mitigation measures are taken for sound insulation, damping
nd sound absorbing. At the same time, more attention is paid for construction
nanagement and reasonable time allocation. The construction with strong noise source
s forbidden at night (22:00 - 07:00). The trucks should be at lower speed and homing
hould be prohibited, while passing by the villages, residents' center and temporary
iving areas during construction to reduce the noise and vibration. Heavy trucks are not
llowed to pass by the villages at night.
i thorough health examination will be taken for the builders entering the construction
ite. Those who have infectious diseases are forbidden to enter. It is necessary for
hose working in the dining hall to have their periodical health examination. They are
vorking with health certificates. In case that some of them are found to have illness,
imely treatment should be taken to prevent the propagation of infectious disease.
4ouse prevention measures at the temporary living areas should be adopted, and it's
ecessary to strengthen sanitary supervision and checking the sanitary status around.
'or the domestic sewage, refuse and the other dirty wastes at the construction area,
trict treatment and management should be available, such as discharging the domestic
ewage into the sewage treatment station, clearing the domestic refuse and solid
vastes out of the construction areas periodically.
)uring construction period, effort should be made to publicize and observe the 'Law
,f the People's Republic of China on the Protection of Wildlife', and issue relevant
otices. The people involved in the project construction are strictly forbidden to hunt
ie wildlife illegally by any means such as hunting and traps, or to jeopardize the
yivng and multiplying of the wildlife. The forestry authority is entitled to forfeit the
aptured animals, hunting tools and illegal gains of the people who violate the law and
Egulations. In addition, they will be fined. For those seriously violating the law and
-gulations and committing crimes, their responsibility for crime should be
ivestigated and affixed according to the 'Criminal Law of the People's Republic of
'hina'.
'he asphalt concrete mixing system at the upper reservoir area should be re-adjusted
:r its layout so as to alleviate the adverse visual effect and landscape of Nanyuesi.
4eanwhile, the construction of the project, particularly setting up the asphalt concrete
roduction yard, should be approved by the local environmental protection authority
i.e., obtaining the environmental protection permit), and production should strictly
:llow the requirements. The spoil disposal site is selected near the hill and valley to
icilitate dumping and less occupation of forestry land. Outside the spoil area is an
'CC retaining dam. Mortar masonry drainage ditches will be built around it on the
lope, based on the catchment area of the spoil site. After finishing of dumping,
wveling should be done for each site, and it will plant bamboo and acacia at the upper
ide and grass on the slope with the excavated soil.
'he temporary land occupation for soil site and living area at the lower reservoir will
e back filled and leveled after completion of the construction, restoring production of
6



tea farm or planting trees.
After completion of the water replenishing works, earth backfill, land filling, removal
of temporary construction facilities, it will be carried out for restoring cultivation.
The domestic refuse produced during construction period will be collected, then
hauled to and treated at Yixing Landfill Site.
It will be strengthened monitoring to the water quality of wells in the downstream of
the upper reservoir, to know the water quality change in time. If the drinking water
quality turns to be affected by the construction sewage, compensation will be paid to
the downstream villagers and the factories, such as providing water treating equipment
to the factory for pre-treating, and digging new wells or economic compensation to
villagers, etc.
(2) Operation Period
Before reservoir impounding, it should clean up the reservoir basin according to that
specified on the 'Planning and Designing Criterion of Hydraulic Engineering'
(DU/T5064-1996). All cleaning-up works should be accomplished before 3 months of
impounding to reduce the influence of the water quality from the leftover at the
beginning of impounding. The anti-vortex beam, concrete apron and sand sill etc. will
be set up at entrance and exit to decrease the possible reservoir turbidity during
operation of the power station.
The domestic sewage from the permanent living and production areas should be
treated by embedded sewage treatment device, and then drained to Huangtong River
via creeks downstream.
Nets and fish barrier facilities are provided outside the intake so that the fishes are
protected against access to the intake.
According to the characteristics of the project operation, swimming in the reservoir,
recreation activity on the water, fishing and picnicking in the forest area are prohibited,
and warning board and safety instructions should be set up around the reservoir.
Table 1 shows the mitigation measures of environmental impact, investment and
proposed execution schedule in detail.
4. Environmental Management Plan and Environmental Monitoring Plan
The project owner establishes the environment supervision office staffed by
professional and pluralist personnel, who are responsible for the environmental
protection and supervision work during project construction and operation of the
power station.
After entering the construction site, the contractor should assign a person responsible
for the environmental protection specified in the Bidding Document or Design
Document, solving the environmental problems encountered during construction and
assisting the supervision and management of environmental protection from the
7



authorities concerned.
The in-site environment supervision includes protection and monitoring for water
source of domestic drinking water, execution of sewage treatment, labor protection of
builders, control of noise of construction transportation and flying dust, environmental
sanitary supervision and epidemic prevention, protection measures for spoil site during
construction and protection of standing plants, as well as soil and water conservation
after completion of construction.
In preparation of the Bidding Document, certain clauses regarding the environmental
protection should be listed therein, specifying obligations and duties among project
owner, contractors, and supervisors, so as to facilitate the environmental protection of
the project. The construction supervision should include environmental supervision,
including execution schedule, quality and cost according to the relevant supervision
procedures and requirements, ensuring that the contractor abide by the requirements of
environmental protection and solving the problems in time.
The main responsible personnel from the project owner, power supply bureaus,
contractors, design consultants and local power supply company should be trained to
have environmental protection knowledge, including national environmental
protection policy and regulation, relevant procedures of China and the World Bank
regarding environmental protection, environmental impact content, environmental
protection measures, and management requirements, etc.
The environmental monitoring plan includes the monitoring of environmental quality,
execution results of mitigation measures and supervision of the execution process of
environmental protection. Considering the fact that Yixing pumped storage power
project is quite near from the urban, the local monitoring department, apparatus and
equipment can be fully utilized in the environmental monitoring. It is proposed that
Yixing Environmental Monitoring Station, Epidemic Prevention Station, Soil and
Water Conservation Station may be entrusted to carry out the environmental
monitoring. The project owner should sign entrustment contract with environmental
monitoring department, specifying obligation, authority and benefit between two
parties so as to make the environmental protection work go on with the relevant laws
and procedures. Table 2 shows the detail-monitoring program of environmental quality
and environmental protection measures.
5. Public Consultation
During selection of the project site and design, much attention was paid to the
comments and requirements of the project construction and environmental protection
raised by the governments at different levels and relevant authorities, which were fed
back to the project design without delay. During July 12 - 15, 1997, a meeting was
held in Yixing for examining the report of selecting large-sized pumped storage power
project site in South Jiangsu Province. More than 60 specialists and professors
attended the meeting. After extensive demonstration, the Yixing Pumped Storage
Power Project was finally selected as the best site to be-developed. During June 6 - 9,
1998, about 100 specialists and professors attended a meeting in Yixing, at which the
pre-feasibility study report of Yixing Pumped Storage Power Project was reviewed.
Analysis and demonstration were made at the meeting on structure of the reservoirs,
dam type, construction method, resettlement scheme, environmental impact of the
8



project and other aspects. On February 8, 1999, a consulting meeting was held in
Yixing for appraisal of the dam type of main upstream reservoir. On July 17 1999,
Yixing government convened a meeting to inform the progress of Yinxing project. At
the meeting the leaders of the city requested the city power supply bureau and
communications bureau to support and concern themselves with the scientific research
units. It was also requested that all city government departments should cooperate and
coordinate to the project in time, whenever specific problem was encountered. During
November 18 - 21, 1999, a meeting was held in the city to appraise the project
proposal. In January 7, 2000, more than 130 specialists and professors participated in a
meeting held in Yixing, at which the feasibility study report of the project was
reviewed. Suggestions and comments were put forward at the meeting on technical
issues concerning project design and construction. The above-mentioned meetings
were all publicized with meeting details on the front page of "Yixing Daily" or at
Yixing TV news. (Refer to the attachment.).
During January 25 - 26 2000, the competent department organized domestic
specialists to review the "Environmental Impact Assessment Report of the Yixing
Pumped Storage Power Project" (Chinese version). 33 representatives and specially
invited specialists attended the meeting. The specialists listened to the representatives
about preparation of the report and carried out extensive discussion and review. The
review comment was then formed. The construction of the project is deemed feasible
from the environmental viewpoint, so far as the environmental protection measures
described in the report are implemented. The report has been approved by the State
Environmental Protection Agency.
Much work was done for public consultation in January 1999, May 2000 and February
2001, such as visiting the local residents and communities, colloquia and issuing
questionnaires. All the public and communities receiving interview are aware of that
the project will be built in Yixing mainly through local media such as TV programs
and newspaper. All of them support the construction of the power station and they
know the project is beneficial to the local economy and tourism. Most of the residents
to be resettled are willing to change their present job or move to the other near places
for living. Quite a number of the people regard the project construction a great impact
on the vegetation and think that forest resource is the key item to be protected. Those
who thought the project construction would affect the forest production are mainly the
persons working in the forest farm. The other environmental concerns include the
impact on the local production, life, transportation, and the impact of the flying dust,
noise resulted from construction.
In order to solicit opinions and comments of the public on the "Environmental Impact
Assessment Report of the Yixing Pumped Storage Power Project" (English version),
am announcement was issued on the front page of Yixing Daily on March 6, 2001,
(refer to Attachment 5), inviting the public to review the report at Management Sector
of Yixing Environmental Protection Bureau (where the report is kept) and providing
their suggestions and comments. From March 20 to April 4 2001, a total of 14 people
went to the bureau, read the report and put forward their recommendations and
comments. Most of them deemed that the assessment in the report was on solid bases
and in full detail, suitable standards were adopted in environmental protection, the
environmental impact of the project construction and environmental protection
measures were fully demonstrated and the measures were feasible, and the prediction
and assessment on the environmental impact after completion of the project were to
9



the point. They also considered that construction of the project would gear up the
economic devly6prment of the city and hoped that the project would be commenced as
soon as possiblel for its early benefit. At the same time, they pointed out that the
attention should be made to the project impact during the construction period on the
people in the vicinity of the project site and on the ecological environment as a whole,
and that the supervision of the environmental protection department should be
strengthened to guarantee the implementation of the environmental protection
measures.

1. Introduction
1.1 Background of Project
Jiangsu province is one of the most economically developed provinces in China, with its
power system composing the most important part of the East China System. The range of
power supply can be classified geographically into southern Jiangsu province and northern
Jinangsu Suzhou, including 13 sections such as Nanjing, Zhengjiang, Changzhou, Wuxi,
Suzhou, Suqian, Lianyungang, Huaiying, Yancheng, Yangzhou, Xuzhou,Taizhou and
Nantong.
In view of the existing power source structure, the Jiangsu provincial power system is
generally a power system purely supported by thermal plants, with scarce conventional
hydropower resources. The thermal power plants undertake spinning stand-by operation of
the system and the peak regulation. However, the peak regulation is in very poor condition
for the whole system owing to several factors such as peak regulation capacity, technical
condition, operation reliability of units, life span of units, quality of fuel and low response
speed of thermal power load. In 1998, the max. power consumption load reaches
118645MW, max. peak to valley difference of the system 5039MW and on the average
3782.8MW, max. peak to valley difference rate 52.58%. In 2005 and 2010, it is forecasted
that the max. power load in the province is 20500MW and 25500MW respectively, with
max. peak to valley difference reaching about 9369 MW and 12495MW respectively. The
ever-increasing peak to valley difference has brought about much concern for the
dispatching and operation of Jiangsu province system, thus leading to potential impact on
safe and stable operation of the system.
The pumped storage power station is a relatively adaptable peak regulation power source
alleviating insufficient regulation capacity, especially feasible for the pure thermal power
system in Jiangsu power system. The pumped storage power station, on the one hand,
provides good load tracing and good load rising and rejection speed in comparison with
the thermal power units, with good adaptability to the variation of load, ensuring safe and
flexible operation. On the other hand, the pumped storage power station has the advantage
of valley filling, which can not be replaced by the other peak regulation power source so
as to avoid or lessen excessive electricity in the system, maintaining stable operation of
cycle.
Yixing Pumped Storage Power Project is a relatively favorable power source site among
the possible sites of large-scale pumped storage power stations in the south part of Jiangsu.
Therefore it is necessary and compulsory to build Yixing Pumped Storage Power Station
in solving peak regulation in the system of both Jiangsu province and East China Power
System. The daily operation style of the Jiangsu System in 2010 is shown in Fig.1.
Part of the funds for the project will be from World Bank loan. According to the
1-1



regulations in "Environmental Protection Law of the People's Republic of China",
"Environmental Protection Management Regulation of Construction Projects" and the
environmental protection requirements of the foreign-financed projects specified of
international monetary organizations, "Environmental Impact Report, Yixing Pumped
Storage Power Project, Jiangsu Province (English edition)" should be prepared. Entrusted
by the Project Owner, East China Investigation and Design Institute under the State Power
Corporation undertakes the preparation work of the report.
1.2 Preparation Purpose
In order to fully develop the project benefit, promote coordinate progress of economy and
environment surrounding the reservoir, the project impact on the environment should be
thoroughly investigated, with comprehensive analysis, evaluation and forecasting the
potential impacts on natural environment, ecological environment, social environment and
life quality. Based on the evaluation results, countermeasures and mitigation measures are
proposed against the negative factors so as to provide a scientific basis for the project
owner in his decision making.

persons will move out from their original hosts and be resettled. Other 713 persons need
financial compensation or work position resettlement because of the reservoir inundation
and project land occupation. The resettlement environmental protection object is that PAPs
should be provided with production and living facilities not lower than their original level,
and assisted to set up better economic foundation and self-service system for earning their
own living so as to make their lives reach or surpass their previous status.

1.8 Major Expertise and Method to be Adopted in Evaluation
(1) Collecting the existing data, field investigation, together with monitoring
The environmental impact assessment for the project was started in April 1998. During
site investigation in the project area and its periphery, the environmental survey was
carried out. The units surveyed included Yixing City Environmental Protection Bureau,
Statistics Bureau, Forestry, Agricultural and Side-line Production Bureau, Epidemic
Protection Station, Yixing Environmental Protection Science and Technology Park,
MeiYuan Village, Nanyuesi Branch of Yixing Forest Farm, Jingle Drinking Water Co.
Ltd., Tonguanshan Spring Co. Ltd. Jingle Villas, Jiangli Village, Danhanquan Drinking
Water Co. Ltd., and the persons managing the existing reservoir, etc. The data
collected covered various aspects including natural environment in and around the
project area (whether, topography, morphology, geology, hydrology, sedimentation and
soils, etc.), ecological environment (terrestrial plants and animals, fishes), social
environment (socio-economy, traffic, land use and important infrastructures, etc.),
living quality of the local people (public health, employment status, historic relics and
landscape, etc,). The Yinxing environmental monitoring station was entrusted to
monitor the water quality of the underground water and wells in the project site and
possibly affected areas. Special survey was made into the terrestrial animals and plants
and fishes, and the local experts on this field were consulted.
(2) Qualitative (mechanism analysis) analysis and quantitative (mathematical model)
analysis together with analogous analysis
In the report, the different environmental impact factors were assessed by different
methods according the nature of the environmental impact. The qualitative mechanism
analysis was adopted for assessment of water environmental impact downstream the
dam after completion of the project, impact on the environment of diversion area,
ecological environmental impact in the project site and its vicinity and the
environmental impact during construction. The impact on reservoir water quality was
predicted by quantitative analysis with mathematical model. The analogous analysis
was adopted for assessment of impact of the asphalt concrete facing to the water
quality of the upper reservoir.

2.4.4.2 Project Land Occupation
The reservoir will inundate 1671.81mu (1.12km2) land, in which 608.39mu (0.41km2)
for upper reservoir and 1063.42mu (0.71kin2) for lower reservoir. The land occupation
of the main control works area, auxiliary structures, highway, resettlement area and
replenishment works etc. will be 457.58 mu (0.37km2). The land occupation of the
transmission line will be 12.7 mu (0.0085km2). The temporary land occupation will be
1435.64mu (0.96km2). The total project land occupation is 3577.73mu (2.39 km2).
2.4.5 Operation Mode of Power Station
Four sets of generating units are installed with unit capacity of 250MW, total capacity
of 1000MW, daily full generation for 4.1h, daily pumping for 5.5h, average annual
output of 1.491 billion kWh, average annual energy consumption for pumping of
2-7



1.959 billion kWh, and comprehensive efficiency of 0.76. The power station will
provide peak load capacity of 1OOOMW at peak hours of the system and absorb
surplus energy of OOOMW for pumping at valley load hours of the system. In case of
urgent demand, 1OOOMW standby capacity or a certain amount of energy can be
provided to the system within 3 - 4 min. In generation mode, the water level of upper
reservoir will drop from 471.5m to 435.Om and that of the lower reservoir from 58.Om
(in case the reserved reservoir storage is not lost) up to 78.9m correspondingly. In
pumping mode, the water level of the upper reservoir rises from 435.Om back to
471.5m and that of the lower reservoir drops from 78.9m to 58.0m, which will be
going on periodically.
2.5 Water Replenishing Works
2.5.1 General description
The water replenishing works is built for the purpose of initial impounding, daily
replenishing during operation and water consumption during construction, including
stage I and stage II replenish pumping stations, conveyance steel pipe and water pond
for construction. Stage I replenish pumping station is located at the east bank of
Huangtong River, south side of Donghe Road while stage II replenishing pumping
station and water pond are located at the downstream area of lower reservoir of the
power station, with pipeline length of 3220m, inner diameter of 500mm. The water
source is from Tuanjiu Lake via Huangtong River. The layout plan is shown in Fig.9.
2.5.2 Water Replenishing Mode and Amount
There will be loss of water in the reservoir at normal operation of the reservoir owing
to water surface evaporation of upper and lower reservoir and reservoir seepage.
Water replenishing will be necessary when the total amount of water for upper and
lower reservoirs is less than 5,962,000m3. According to analysis of data concerning
annual precipitation, water surface evaporation and seepage of upper and lower
reservoirs, the reservoirs can be replenished by precipitation within about 38.2% of
the months in a year at normal operation, no need of replenishing, while about 61.8%
of the months needs 20 - 150 thousand m3 water replenished, with max. monthly
replenish of 150 thousand mi3. The redundant water in flooding case should be
discharged outside the reservoir through the bottom outlet of lower reservoir. The
water volumn banance is shown in Fig. 10.

3.1.2 Topography, Land Form and Geology
(1) Land Form
The topography of Yixing city is high in the south and low in the north, including hilly
region in the south, plain region in the north and northwest, and ridge region in the west
and east along the Taihu lake. The south is bordered with Zhejiang and Anhui provinces,
with undulating and continuous hills. The major mountain peaks include from the east to
west Dawangshan, Huanglongtou, Huangtading, Taihuashan, Longchishan, Maoshanjie,
Tongguanshan, which belong to the Tianmu and Huangshan mountains. The highest
peak is over 600m a.s.l. and Tongguanshan where the project is located is 529.9m a.s.l..
The upper reservoir is located at the north side of Tongguanshan main peak, an irregular
shouldow col, with round hilltop surrounding the reservoir, top elevation of 500m -
527m, steep for the outer topography, which is typical of disintegration topography.
The lower reservoir is located inside the gully within land of the Nanyuesi branch in the
northeast of Tongguanshan, which is now Huiwu reservoir. Behind the reservoir is
continuous mountains. The main gully extends in the direction of NE, with bottom
elevation of 50 -65m, but 44.7m E.L near the dam. The left bank mountain of the
reservoir extends generally in the east - north direction, with several small gullies
converging into the reservoir area.
(2) Geology
The project area is located at the south edge of lower Yangtzi formation, nearing
Jiangnan formation. The exposed formation within the area is mainly of delta - estuary -
seashore facies sedimentary formation of Devonian system, granite-porphyry in the form
of apophyse and rock dyke at late Yanshan cycle.
Geotectonically, the area belongs to east fracture zone of Gaochun - Yixing - Jiading
westeastward upheaval belt at new Huaxia system. The project area is located at
anticlinorium of Zhoucheng - Tongguanshan, near secondary syncline of Tongguanshan.
The upper reservoir is of inclined structure of NE low-angle dipping, while the lower
reservoir is of flat slope structure rising westward, with developed NWW fault and
granite-porphyry, not obvious in NE structure.
The underground water can be divided into fissure water and pore water. The former is
embedded deeply in the bedrock fissure and the latter shouldowly in slope wash of
Quaternary system of Upper Holocene. The major source of underground water is from
atmospheric precipitation.
The basic earthquake intensity within the area is VI according to "Classification Map of
Earthquake Intensity in China (1:4000000 scale)".

3.1.3 Hydrological Sediment
Yixing city nears Taihu lake in the east, Gehu lake in the north, Nanxihe river across the
middle part, Wuyi canal and Mengjinghe river through south to north, full of rivers and
lakes. In Yixing, there are 3 jius for Xijiu, Tuanjiu Lake and Dongjiu, which are located
att the west of Taihu, south of Gehu, connecting each other, belong to a small shouldow
lake. The total area at wet period is 21.4km2. 3 jius water from Suyang, Jintan, zhaohu
and Gehu enters Taihu via Xijiu, Tuanjiu Lake and Dongjiu, with average annual runoff
of 1.293 billion m3 and annual average flow of 40.87m3/s. The Taihu water will return to
3 jius when higher than it. Tuanjiu Lake Yixing(west) station (85 national elevation
datum)has average annual level of 1.30m, and average annual variation of 1.39m.
Huangtong River is a small river in the direction of south to north, with the source in the
northeast of Tongguanshan, converging into Tuanjiu Lake via Meiyuan, Huangtong creek,
5km long in total. Of which, the main river course is from Huangtong creek to estuary,
about 3.5km long. Huangtong River is a river course used to discharge floods for both
banks and upstream (including Huiwu reservoir) at flood season, and a diversion river
course at non-flood period. At upstream of Huangtong creek is a small creek, normally
dry at dry period, and can be used for flood relief of Huiwu reservoir in wet period, in
addition an irrigation canal for the downstream irrigation area of Huiwu reservoir.
Huiwu reservoir has very clean water all the year round, without sedimentation for many
years' operation of the reservoir. The plain area is thick with river systems, with rivers
and lakes joining each other and less sediment content. According to the observation of
sediment concentration for Tuanjiu Lake, intake of Dongheqiao of Huangtong River and
Huiwu reservoir in Jan.,1997 - Oct., 1998, the max. concentration is 54.6g/m3 and the
min. 0. lg/m3, refer to Table 3-2.

3.4 Life Quality
3.4.1 People's Health
There are 61 health and medical organizations in Yixing city by the end of 1999, 2738
beds, 3248 technical personnel, with stable health organization in village level, for which,
there are 694 medical sites, 938 village doctors and health workers.
According to statistic information provided by sanitation and anti-epidemic station, there
were totaling 10 sorts (8 sorts of beta and 2 sorts of gamma) of infectious disease with
1293 patients found in Yixing city in 2000, and the disease rate is 166.5/100000 and is
17.7% reduced as compared with that in 1999. Among them there are 719 hepatitis and
dysentery patients, with the disease rate of 22.8% reduced as compared with that in 1999.
It shows that the infectious disease rate is lower in Yixing city where the project is
located, and regional people are in good health. The domestic drinking water for the
residents near the project area is taken from well, with good water quality. (Refer to
section 3.5.1 of the Report.)
In general, the construction laborers are mainly from Yixing region, but shall be decided
after final bidding.
3.4.2 Employment
There are altogether 1791 persons at the project affected Meiyuan village in 1999, and
1202 persons having job, including 480 persons for agriculture, 18 persons for forest, 4
persons for animal husbandry, 160 persons for industry, 60 persons for construction
industry, 50 persons for transportation, post and telecommunications, 80 persons for
commerce and catering trade, 4 persons for education, cultural art, broadcasting and TV,
15 persons for village economic organization management and 331 persons for the

3.5.1 Water Quality
(1) Water Quality of Ground Surface and Underground Shouldow Layer Surrounding
Upper and Lower Reservoir
In June 9t 2000, Yixing Environmental Monitoring Station carried out water quality
monitoring for Huiwu reservoir (at iiiiddle of the reservoir), downstream residents
area (wells) in Huiwu reservoir area, downstream of upper reservoir dam site (lOOm
upstream of Jingle Drinking Water Co. Ltd) and Jingle Active Drinking Water Co.
Ltd (wells), with the results shown in Table 3-4.
Compared with "Ground Water Environmental Quality Standard" (GHZB 1 - 1999),
the Table 3-4 shows that, except feces coliform group, all the other monitoring items
are in conformity with grade I water quality standard, feces coliform group of well
downstream of lower reservoir in conformity with grade III, and feces coliform
group of wells of Jingle water factory in conformity with grade II.
(2) Water Quality in Diversion Area
Tuanjiu Lake water quality monitoring data statistics during 1995 - 1997 is shown
in Table 3-5.
From Table 3-5, it can be seen that Tuanjiu Lake water quality is generally in
conformity with "Ground Water Environmental Quality Standard" (GHZB 1 - 1999),
grade III, meeting the requirements. The total phosphorous concentration on the
average surpasses grade III, compared with the total standard phosphorous value for
specific items of lakes and reservoirs. (Refer to Table 1-2 in detail).
By investigation, it shows that chemical fertilizer quantity used in peripheral farm
land at Tuanjiu water diversion region is less and gradually decreased year by year.
The existing water quality in Tuanjiu is in grade III. It also shows that chemical
fertilizer lost in the peripheral farm land is not seriously. After the completion of
Yixing Wastewater Treatment Plant, the discharge quantity from industrial and
domestic sewage will be greatly decreased. According to Yixing City General Plan
(1995-2010), the sewage treatment capacity will be 58% after the completion of first
Yixing Wastewater Treatment Plant by the end of 2001 and up to 77% after operation
of three planned wastewater treatment plants by 2010. Thus the water quality in
Tuanjiu will be further improved.

From Table 3-6, the environmental air quality for the surrounding of upper and lower
reservoirs is good and in conformity with "Environmental Air Quality
Standard"(GB3095-1996), Grade II.

4. Forecast of Environmental Impact and Countermeasures
4.1 Ground Water Environmental Impact During Operation and
Countermeasures
4.1.1 Analysis of Water Quality Impact in Reservoir
4.1.1.1  Analysis of the pollutant concentration impact of the reservoir
The around-reservoir highway of the upper reservoir is built with drain ditches and
retaining walls and the surface runoff within the collection area of upper reservoir will
not enter the upper reservoir area. Except for nourishment by rainfall, the water of this
reservoir is mainly from the lower reservoir. Hence, the quality of the reservoir water
will basically not be impacted by the surrounding environment of the upper reservoir,
but mainly dependent on the water quality of the lower reservoir.
Bituminous-concrete watertight protective faces should be provided for the entire
upper reservoir basin. According to water quality monitoring results (Attachment 1 for
details) during initial impounding at projects with bituminous-concrete watertight
protective faces adopted for the upper reservoir as similar to Tianhuangping Project
both at home and abroad, it is predicted that application of bituminous-concrete will
not result in contamination impact on reservoir water quality.
The total initial storage of the power station, including the storage for power
generation, the emergency reserve storage, reserve storage for losses, and the dead
storage of both the upper and lower reservoir, is 5.962 million cubic meters.
According to the construction schedule, the initial impoundment period is about 1
year. After deducting the losses resulted from evaporation and seepage, the inflow of
this watershed merely accounts for 5% (low-water period) to 30% (high-water period)
of the initial storage of the reservoir and most of the inflow is from Tuanjiu Lake.
Thus, the water quality of lower reservoir during the initial storage period is mainly
dependent on the water quality of Tuanjiu Lake. According to Report 3.5.1 the water
quality of Tuanjiu Lake basically conforms to criteria of Grade III specified in
"Surface Water Environmental Quality Standard" (GHZB 1-1999).
During the normal operation period of the power station, in 61.8% months of a year
the water losses resulted from reservoir evaporation and seepage are higher than the
inflow of this watershed, monthly 0.02million to 0.15 million cubic meters of water
should be replenished from Tuanjiu Lake, which corresponds to 0.34% to 2.52% of
the total storage of the upper and lower reservoir. The annual replenishment is
0.223million to 0.9 million cubic meters, which corresponds to 3.74% tolS.1% of the
total storage of upper and lower reservoir. The mean annual replenishment is
0.522million cubic meters, which corresponds to 8.76% of the total storage of the
upper and lower reservoir. Since the water is mainly replenished from Tuanjiu Lake,
its water quality is relatively poorer than the water from this reservoir's watershed,
and during most of periods the reservoir is replenished and not drained outward
4-1



(except for flood period), long-term replenishment will result in accumulation of
pollutants in reservoir. Hence prediction is made through mathematics pattern.
Non-continuous pollutants
The prediction of non-continuous pollutants is shown in Attachment 2 for details. It is
shown that if the quality of the initial water storage and perennial replenishment water
for reservoir of the power station is the quality level of Tuanjiu Lake in 1997
(CODMn :5.10mg/L, BOD5 :2.80mg/L), CODMn and BOD5of the reservoir water
will be gradually reduced with time and finally stabilized. CODMn and BOD5 are
stabilized in 0.49 mgAL and 0.35mgAL respectively in 800days and 600 days from
replenishing water. Obviously, the non-sustainable pollutant will not be accumulated
and will not deteriorate the reservoir water.
In order to reduce the impact on initial reservoir water quality by the residual
buildings, pollutants and trees in lower reservoir basin, the reservoir should be
cleaned (Attachment 4 for details) one year prior to its initial storage strictly in
accordance with relative specifications in "Treatment Program and Design Code of
Reservoir Immersion for Hydropower Project" issued by the Ministry of Electric
Power (DL-T5064-1996) and cleaning of the entire reservoir area should be
completed 3 months before storage of the reservoir.
(2) Continuous pollutants
The prediction on continuous pollutants is shown in Attachment 3 for details. It is
shown that the concentration variation of the continuous pollutants (Total As, total Cr,
total Pb and total Cd) is mainly dependent on the reservoir's outflow rate (sum of the
draw off discharge and the seepage) and on the diversion rate. When reservoir's
outflow rate is excessively higher than the diversion rate, the concentration of the
continuous pollutants in the reservoir will be reduced; while when reservoir's outflow
rate is nearly equal to or less than the diversion rate, the concentration of the
continuous pollutants in the reservoir will be increased. Since the concentration of
6+
continuous pollutants (total As, Cr , total Cr and total Pb) in runoff of this watershed
and in replenished water from Tuanjiu Lake conforrns to the criteria of Grade I
specified in "Surface Water Environmental Quality Standard" (GHZB 1-1999) and the
historical sum of reservoir's draw off discharge and the seepage is higher than the
diversion rate. Thus no accumulation of continuous pollutants in the reservoir water
will occur after completion of the reservoir and it still confonns to the criteria of
Grade I specified in "Surface Water Environmental Quality Standard" (GHZB
1-1999).
4.1.1.2 Variation in content of sediment in the reservoir and the measures
The sediment content in the reservoir water is an essential parameter for selection of
hydraulic turbine for power station. Excessively high content of sediment will
accelerate wear-out of the hydraulic turbine and impair normal operation of power
4-2



station.
Breast walls should be built along banks of upper reservoir of the power station to
prevent the runoff outside the reservoir area from entrance into the reservoir and the
reservoir merely collects the rainfall within its basin. Thus it is impossible that the
slope runoff bears silts to enter upper reservoir.
The collection area of the lower reservoir is 1.8679 km2. During normal operation
period of the power station, both the flow of catchment and the replenishment will
bear a certain amount of silts. According to the sediment test and the hydrological
calculation for tail of Huiwu Reservoir and for Tuanjiu Lake made by Yixing
Hydrological Station, the maximum measured sediment content in Tuanjiu Lake is
19.3g/m3 and the mean annual sediment discharge of the lower reservoir is 10.8t/a.
The estimate without considering settlement of silts in lower reservoir shows that in
the first, second and third year from reservoir's putting into operation the sediment
content in the reservoir water is respectively not more than 20.06g/m3, 20.82g/m3 and
21.58g/m3, i.e. the sediment content is increased at an annual rate of 0.76g/m3, and the
sediment content in the reservoir water in the 30th year will not exceed 42.07g/m3,
which will not impair the normal operation of hydraulic turbine. In fact, part of
sediment will settle down and hence the sediment content in the reservoir water is less
than the estimated value.
Before storage, the reservoir should be desilted. In the works the eddy-control beam,
concrete apron and sand trap should be built in water inlet and outlet to eliminate the
possible increase in turbidity of reservoir water resulted from running of power
station.
In the upstream of Huiwu reservoir it is mainly consisted of forestry land, which will
have no pollutants discharged from farm chemical fertilizer, industry enterprises and
domestic sewage. The monitoring results for Huiwu reservoir (Clause 3.5.1 for details)
shows that the water quality at present is fine and it is predicted that there is no
pollutant in the soil at the reservoir bottom. Thus the silt cleaned from the reservoir
bottom can be used as a cover on disposal area for greening.
4.1.2 Analysis of Water Environmental Impact Downstream the Dam Site and
Counter Measures
(1) Lower reservoir
During operation of the power station, some sewage will be discharged from
underground plant houses. According to project design, this sewage, after reaching the
discharge criteria through treatment by small-scale sewage treatment facilities, will be
discharged to downstream of the reservoir through drain system of the plant houses.
This power station will be staffed 242 personnel. On basis of daily living-water
demand of 250L per person/day and discharge coefficient 0.9, the daily discharge rate
4-3



of domestic sewage of this power station is 54.5 m3/d, including 36 m3/d for living
area and 18.5 m3/d for permanent production area. An embedded sewage treatment
plant is also built (for process flow sheet, referred to Fig. 4.4-2), by which the sewage
is treated before being discharged to Huangtong River through downstream runnels.
In order to ensure the normal operation of the station, the lower reservoir will not take
the irrigation task as that for the original Huiwu reservoir during the operation. Thus
except the flood period, the lower reservoir will not have flow to discharge, and the
reach about 1.5km long from the dam site to Huangtongjian is basically in dry
condition. The max. wastewater discharge after reaching standards for the station is
0.0011m3/s calculated by 1.5 times of non-uniform coefficient, and the real flow into
Huangtong River will be even less as results of evaporation and seepage. It may have
impact on the water quality for the local reaches of Huangtong River.
(2) Upper reservoir
The catchment area of the upper reservoir is merely 0.2106 km2. Except for runoff
generated by rainfall in the reservoir area, the surface runoff within other catchment
areas still collects to downstream area. Hence, the water rate of downstream runnels is
slightly impaired. Moreover, no water is downwards discharged and thus the water
quality of downstream runnels will not be impaired.
4.2 Impact on Ecological Environment and Counter Measures
4.2.1 Impact on Land Animal and Counter Measures
The frequent human-activity regions such as Yixing Forest Farm, Yixing Economic
Development Zone, Yixing 173 Microwave Station and Yixing TV Transmission
Station are within or surrounding the upper and lower reservoir of the power station.
There are fewer activities of wildlife in the forestry land. According to information
provided by Yixing Forestry Side-line Bureau, and survey on the staff of forest farm
and the people of the surrounding villages, the animals that commonly occur in
forestry land at project site are small ones such as rabbit, snakes, frogs and rats.
Accidentally, wild pigs occur there. According to the Jiangsu Province investigation
results on terrigenous wildlife in 1998, no rare and protection animals is found within
Yixing Farm area where is the land-acquisition region for this project.
Since some forestry lands and tea farm necessary will be occupied for this project,
which will impair the living environment for the wildlife that commonly occur in the
requisitioned region and force wildlife to move to periphery forestry land. During
construction, excavation in the reservoir area, building of access roads, and
transportation and construction facilities will generate noise to a certain extent, which
impacts the living space of the wildlife that live or look for foods in surroundings or
along the traffic roads. Due to the periphery vegetation same as that in the project area,
4-4



it was also an active range for wildlife and the land occupied by the project will only
be 0.53% of the whole forest land area. Therefore, land requisition for this project and
construction will not render serious destructive impact on the living environment for
wildlife. After end of the construction, except for the permanently occupied regions,
the other regions after restoration of vegetation and intensive plantation are still
suitable for living for wildlife. Hence the construction of this project will not seriously
impact the wildlife within or surrounding the reservoir area.
During construction, propaganda should be strengthened and notes published in an
effect to strictly implement "Wildlife Protection Laws of People's Republic of China"
and prohibit the constructors and all others to hunt wildlife or harm their living and
propagation by meanings and measures of guns, trap-holes, etc.. The destruction of
environment by project-unnecessary artificial factors should be minimized so as to
protect the sources of wildlife. The person who disobeys the prohibition, he must be
amerced and his prey, hunting meanings, and incoming from hunting shall be
confiscated by Wildlife Authority. And he will be responsibility for his criminal in
case of serious according to criminal laws.
4.2.2 Impact on Fish and Fishery Production and Counter Measures
(1) Impact on fish and fishery production of Huiwu Reservoir
The fish-culture area of existing Huiwu Reservoir is 16mu. According to the
investigation from reservoir managerial personnel, generally fish fries of grass carp,
pien fish, crucial carp, silver carp and black carp are put into the reservoir every 2 to 3
years with investment of each time 2000-3000 yuan RMB (current price) and in
winter after 2 to 3 years they are caught by emptying the reservoir. Generally, 1000 kg
of fish may be caught every time and they are locally sold with total incomes of 6000
yuan RMB, which all belong to the reservoir managerial personnel, and not for any
other one. After completion of Yixing Pumped-Storage Power Station, Huiwu
Reservoir will become the lower reservoir and the management right of this reservoir
will belong to administrative office of the power station. Generally, no fish will be
cultured in the reservoir. The managerial person is the staff of the water conservancy
station of Yixing Environmental Science and Technology Zone, who is 81 years old
and enjoys a certain annual retirement allowance. The water conservancy station has
bought lump-sum endowment insurance for him and thus his life will not be impaired.
The investigation made by Yixing Forestry and Sidelines Bureau shows that during
1997 to 1999 the actual fish-culture area in Yixing City is 0.17 million mu and the
annual fishery output is 40000 to 42000 tons. The mean annual fishery output of
Huiwu Reservoir is 300-500kg, which merely accounts 0.00075% to 0.00125% of the
total output of Yixing City. Obviously, construction of the power station basically
renders no impact on local fish resources and fishery sources.
4-5



(2) Impact on fish in diversion area
The collection area of the upper and lower reservoir of the power station is relatively
small and the rainfall and runoff in the watershed fails to meet the water demands for
consumption during construction period, for the initial storage and for replenishment
during operation of the power station. Hence, a pump station is to be built in
Huangtong River about 2.4 km northeastwards to the lower reservoir, which will
intake water from Tuanjiu Lake with a maximum intake flowrate of 0.18 m3/s. In
order to protect fish and ensure safety of the diversion works, a fish barrier should be
built in the water inlet to prevent fish from entering diversion ducts. According the
project design, the replenishment water inlet will be designed with trashrack, where
the fish barrier can be designed, but must be regularly cleaned for sewage. The fish
barrier shall be changed if necessary so as to prevent aquatic organism from breeding
and have impact on its effect.
According to the requirements of diversion works, part of channels of Huangtong
River should be dredged. According to survey results from the Fishery Management
Sector of Yixing Forestry Side-line Bureau (Attachment 4 for details), grass carp, pien
fish, crucial carp, silver carp and black carp are artificially cultured in Tuanjiu Lake
and Huangtong River and no rare fish listed under state key protection catalogue is
found. Thus, dredging of channel will not involve extinction of fish species and will
not seriously impair fishes.
4.2.3 Impact on Land Plantation and Counter Measures
According to information provided by Yixing Forestry Side-line Bureau and survey
on workers of forest farm, the vegetation within and surrounding upper and lower
reservoir of the power station is mainly artificial vegetation, including pine (mainly
Masson's pine, Loblolly pine), Chinese fir (Dawn redwood, Slash pine, Pond cypress),
oak, and tea tree. Coppice and brush grasses grow in the pine forest and fir forest,
mainly wild fern and cogongrass. It shows that within the project region there is no
rare plant or wild plant under national or local protection.
For this project totally 3173.73 mu forestry land will be requisitioned (including
1470.5mu reservoir-immersed land, 411.03mu permanent-occupied land and
1279.5mu temporary-occupied land). Construction activities such as excavation for
and building of road, wastes yard, pile yard and structures will to a certain extent
destroy the vegetation within and surrounding the construction region. The impacted
vegetation is mainly pine, fir, wild fern, wild bamboo and cogongrass and no national
protection wild plants are impacted. Moreover, these plants are widely distributed in
Yixing mountainous area and thus the plant resources and ecological system will not
be impacted.
During  the  construction, the  spoil area, pile  yard, construction  roads,
4-6



sand-stone-processing system, auxiliary construction enterprises temporary quarter for
constructors and resettlement should be reasonably arranged in an effect to minimize
the construction-occupied lands and the destruction to the surrounding vegetation.
After completion of construction, the land temporally requisitioned by construction
should be cleared off and leveled to restore to its original state. The
permanent-requisitioned lands, e.g. spoil area, should be rolled, leveled, covered with
earth and planted. The green plants should be planted around the permanent structures,
and under the requisite of meeting project's requirement they should coordinate with
the surrounding natural scene to beautify environment.
4.2.4 Impact on Agricultural Production and Counter Measures
The permanent land occupation of the project (including the reservoir inundation) will
cover 71.32 mu tea farm (58.05mu in Meiyuan Village, which is 5.4% of total tea
farm in Meiyuan Village, and 13.27 mu in Huangtong Village, which is 3.1% of total
tea farm in Huangtong Village), and 23.59 mu farmland (4.64mu in Meiyuan Village,
which is 0.43% of total farmland in Meiyuan Village and 7.46 mu in Huangtong
Village, which is 0.53% of total farmland in Huangtong Village, and 11.49mu in
Shanmen Village, which is 1.18% of total farmland in Shanmen Village). Since the
total amount and the proportion of tea farm and farmland of the requisition is not
large quantity, it has less impact to the agriculture production of the three villages.
The temporary land occupation of the project will cover 97.62 mu tea farm of the
Meiyuan Village, accounting to 9.1% of the village's total tea farm. The impact of the
land occupation will be mainly within the construction period. In addition, the tea
farm that will be temporarily requisitioned for the project will be compensated
according to the relevant criteria specified by the government (refer to RAP for
details). After completion of the project, the relevant governmental department should
well organize the work for restoration of the tea farm.
The Huiwu Reservoir, a special facility for this project, will be requisitioned and
compensated and no longer undertake the previous irrigation task. The original Huiwu
Reservoir is designed with an irrigation discharge tunnel with a design flow of
0.24m3/s. During irrigation, the gravity flow through over 2km long channel irrigated
700 mu paddy field in Meidong irrigation area at downstream. As the reservoir
storage capacity was small, with not large catchment area, it was hard to ensure the
irrigation demand during dry season, and the guarantee ratio for a month was only
76.3%. After the completion of the project, the irrigation flow will be increased to
0.3m3/s, which can meet the downstream irrigation demand even in dry season. Thus,
the dependability of the irrigation will be higher than that of the existing Huiwu
Reservoir. According to survey, the irrigation water for farm lands along Sanjiu is
taken from "Sanjiu" and the water quality meets the requirements for agricultural
irrigation. Thereby, the project construction will not impose adverse impact on the
agricultural ecology of Meidong irrigation area.
4-7



4.2.5 Impact on Forestry and Countermeasures
The reservoir inundation and project land occupation will cover 2146.89 mu forestry
land of the Nanyuesi branch of the Yixing Forest Farm. Of which pine forestry 808.84
mu, fir forestry 610.14 mu, copse 104.91mu, chestnut 183mu, bamboo 179 mu and
nursery of young tree 261 mu, which accounts for 18.9% of the branch's land, and
0.36% of the Yixing Forest Farm. To fell trees in the farm is strictly controlled by the
forest administrative authority according to the law, the trees in the farrn are felled
and renewed at a certain annual rate, and felling quantity can be regulated according
to actual conditions. Meanwhile, the project construction unit has already consulted
with the local government that the forest land areas for the branch can be regulated by
Yixing Forest Farm according to actual conditions or staff number of branches can be
regulated. In addition, the construction unit will offer compensation according to land
occupation conditions. Thus, the requisition of part of the forestry land will generally
not affect the staff incoming, felling quantity specified by the state, and the normal
production of the Yixing Forestry Farm and Nanyuesi branche.
The permnanent land occupation of the project will also cover 309 mu forestry land of
the Yixing 173 Microwave Station, 163.05 mu forestry land of Chuanfu Village in
Yixing Economic Development Zone, 213.35 mu, forestry land of Yixing
Environmental Scienc and Technology Zone (194.94 mu in Meiyuan Village and
18.41 mu in Huangtong Village), 20.29 mu forestry land in Guijing Township and 40
mu forestry land in Shanjuan Town. Yixing 173 Microwave Station doesn't engage in
forestry and it gets no business income from its forestry land. Due to high elevation of
forestry lands of Yixing Economic Development Zone, Guijing Township, and
Shanjuan Town, since 1988 no tree cutting and renewal has been made and they have
not generated business yield. The forestry land of Yixing Environmental Science and
Technology Zone generates small business yield. Acquisition of forestry lands will not
impact the economic yield of the above units, however, according to relevant state
regulations the managerial personnel of forestry land should be compensated for his
land requisitioned (Refer to RAP for details).
For this project totally 3173.73 mu forestry lands will be requisitioned. Currently, the
forestry land in Yixing amounts to 0.6 million mu, including 0.18million mu of
bamboo land. Even neglecting the area of bamboo land, the requisitioned forestry land
for this project is merely 0.53% of the total forestry land of Yixing City. Therefore,
construction of this project has a little impact on local forestry ecology.
4.3 Environmental Impact on Diversion Area
The collection area of upper and lower reservoir of the power station is relatively
small and the natural inflow fails to meet the water demands for the initial storage, for
daily replenishment during operation of the power station and for consumption during
construction period. Hence, for this project water should be taken through Huangtong
4-8



River from Tuanjiu Lake Lake, which is about 5km from lower reservoir.
Tuanjiu Lake is one of "Sanjiu" lakes in Yixing (i.e. Dongjiu, Tuanjiu and Xijiu).
Dongjiu, Tuanjiu and Xijiu Lake mutually connect and their hydrological status and
lower reservoir of this power station is shown in Table 4- 1.
During normal operation of the power station, according to the operation mode about
20000 to 150000 cubic meters of water should be replenished with a maximum
monthly replenishment of 150000 cubic meters, i.e. about 0.0579m3/s. Together with
0.3m3/s. pumping inflow in the alternative scheme for irrigating downstream 700mu
farmland after acquisition of Huiwu Reservoir, the maximum diversion inflow is
0.3759 m3/s, which is 0.93% and 2.05% of historical annual mean inflow and the
mean inflow at low flow year of Sanjiu respectively. At the maximum diversion
inflow, the daily mean water level of Sanjiu merely drops by 1.44mm.
According the construction schedule, 5 years are necessary for diversion during the
construction of the power station and for initial storage, and maximum diversion
inflow is about 0.18 m3/s. Together with 0.3m3/s pumping inflow in the alternative
irrigation scheme, the maximum diversion inflow is 0.48 m3/s, which is 1.17% and
2.59% of the mean inflow rate and the mean flow rate of Sanjiu at low flow year
respectively. Under this state, the daily mean water level of Sanjiu merely drops by
1.94mm.
The above water-balance analysis shows that this project has no obvious impact on
water level in Sanjiu and merely during diversion the flow velocity and the flow
direction in Huangtong River vary during a short period. According to calculation,
velocity in Huangtong River section is 0.002m/s to 0.06m/s, and flow direction
changes from irregular upstream-downstream flow to mainly downstream flow. Hence,
this project will not render unfavorable impact on Sanjiu environment.

The wastewater and sewage in the construction region mainly consists of 2 parts. One
is the silt-bearing production wastewater, which is mainly from concrete casting
system of dam and reservoir basin, water conveyance system, tunnel drain during
construction of underground powerhouses, and washing water of concrete mixing
system and the discharge destination of which is rather scattered with a total discharge
amount 363.6m3/h at peak period (about 0.101m3/s). Another part is the domestic
sewage of the constructors and the production wastewater from the auxiliary
enterprises, which mainly contains organic matters and a few of oils and the discharge
destination of which is rather centered with a total discharge amount 132.4m3/h at
peak period (about 0. 037m3/s).
The wastewater discharged to runnels downstream the upper reservoir dam site during
construction is mainly the silt-bearing production wastewater from main dam, minor
dam and basin of upper reservoir and the main contained pollutant is SS of a
concentration of 5-lOg/L.
The wastewater and sewage discharged to runnels downstream the lower reservoir
dam site during construction is mainly the production wastewater and domestic
sewage and the main contained pollutants are CODCr, BOD5, SS, total P and total N.
4-11



4.4.1.2 Forecast of environmental impact downstream upper reservoir dam site
(1) Analysis of hydrological status
The surface runoff of runnels downstream upper reservoir dam site is mainly from
rainfalls and due to restriction in landform the concentration time of these runnels is
rather short. Flood process basically depends on the storm process and the water in
these runnels abruptly raises or abruptly drops. In dry season, usually the runnels will
become dried after 7 to 15 days after a storrn.
During construction the construction wastewater with a peak discharge rate of
163.3m3/h (about 0. 045m3/s) will be discharged to the runnels downstream of the
main dam from construction of the main dam, minor dam and basin of upper reservoir.
Hence at dry season during construction water flow will occur in the runnels
downstream the upper reservoir dam site.
(2) Water consumption downstream
The site investigation shows that the water consumers downstream the upper reservoir
dam site mainly include Yixing Jingle Drinking water Co., Ltd., Tongguan Mount
Spring Co., Ltd., Jingle Villa (Hotel), part of inhabitants of Jiangli Village, and the
stationed armed police troop. The water for them is mainly from wells built by them.
Yixing Jingle Drinking water Co., Ltd., produces barreled and tanked drinking water
with a daily capacity of 50 tons, which is supplied to inhabitants and units of Yixing
City and Wuxi City. The water is taken from the well 30m away from the runnel and
the well has lOm depth and 6m diameter.
Tongguan Mount Spring Co., Ltd. mainly produces barreled drinking water with an
annual capacity of 70000 to 80000 barrels (20kg/barrel). Its intake well is about 20m
away from the runnel and the well has 8m depth and 1.5m diameter.
Jingle Villa (Hotel) is provided with 180 beds. Usually it mainly serves meeting with
fewer guests, while in holidays it mainly provides holiday-services with more guests
and its peak daily water consumption is 120t. The demanded water is taken from well
nearby hillside and about 50m away from the runnel and the well has 15m depth and
4m diameter.
The armed police troops are stationed along Chuan-Zhang Highway (Chuanzhang
Town to Zhangzhu Town) and near the main arm to the dam. The troops are provided
with water supply facilities such as water tower and intake well near the runnel. The
running water supply pipeline from Dingshan to Furong Tea Farm runs through troops
station, hence the water necessary for the troops may be either from the running water
pipeline or from the well.
4-12



Longtoushan natural village of Jiangli administrative village is located on both sides
of main gully, where the Chuanzhang Highway runs through to the dam. In the village
there are 100 households of a population 400, 80 households in 14# Group and 20
households in 16# Group. The water necessary for the inhabitants is from small wells
in front or rear of their houses, which are built with stones and have a depth of about
Sm and diameter of about 80cm.
According to the reports of the above units and the inhabitants of Jiangli Village, their
wells are constantly clear and never dried and the variation in water level ranges
generally 1.4m. During raining days the water of runnels becomes yellowish and the
well water is also slightly turbid. However after 1 to 2 days the turbidity will
disappear.
There are nearly 500 households also distributed along both sides of Chuan-Zhang
Highway and they use well as their water resource. According to the investigation
from village committee, even on raining days, the well water scarcely become turbid.
(3) Impact analysis
The wastewater generated during construction and the destruction of the existing soil
and water conservancy facilities resulted by blasting and excavation will worsen
water and soil loss condition, increase the turbidity of surface runoff and make a few
of TNT (explosive component) residue in runoff, which will impair the water quality
of runnels downstream upper reservoir dam site.
The site investigation shows that there is a mutual replenishment relationship between
the well water and runnels water used by Yixing Jingle Active Drinking water Co.,
Ltd., Tongguan Mount Spring Co., Ltd., Jingle Villa (Hotel), and 100 households'
inhabitants of Jiangli Village. During flood period, the river water replenishes
underground water, while in dry period the underground water replenishes the ground
water. Thus, improper discharging of construction wastewater will impair the quality
of well water to a certain extent. In order to minimize this contamination impact the
generated production wastewater should be collected and treated to meet the
discharge standard before being outwards discharged.
4.4.1.3 Forecast of environmental impact downstream lower reservoir dam site
(1) Water consumption in downstream
Huiwu Reservoir is mainly for irrigation with an irrigation area of 700 mu and the
irrigation area is distributed on the northeast side downstream the reservoir, the west
side of existing 104 National Highway (Nanjing-Hangzhou Highway) and the
northeast side of new 104 National Highway. Since building of Huiwu Reservoir, in
4-13



most years the irrigation water was basically ensured.  However due to small
reservoir capacity and small collecting area, in low flow years it is yet impossible to
meet the irrigation demands. According to irrigation water adjustment calculation on
basis of months from 1967 to 1997, the monthly irrigation rate at the irrigation period
is 76.3%. In order to compensate the insufficient irrigation water of Huiwu Reservoir
the local authorities installed temporary lift pumps, which compensate the insufficient
irrigation water by pumping water from Tuanjiu Lake through canal and Huangtong
River. Lately, the canal was silted and abandoned. Currently, the mere way to solve
the insufficient irrigation water during low flow period is to decrease the quota of
irrigation water.
Huangtong River, a north-southwards running small river, originates from hillside in
southeast area of Tongguan Mountain and enters Tuanjiu Lake near the south side of
Xuancheng Jiubing Park through Meiyuan and Huangtongjian. The upstream of
Huangtongjian is merely a small stream, which in flood period is used as the
flood-relief channel of Huiwu Reservoir and at non-flood period is basically dried.
The river section downstream Huangtongjian to estuary is 3.5km long with a slope
0.6%. At power station's lowest diversion level 0.56m, the river width is about 7m
(Huangtongjian) to 58m (estuary), and at the annual mean level 1.3m, the river width
is about 9m (Huangtongjian) to 73m (estuary).
At non-flood period Huangtong River is used as the diversion channel for both banks.
Agricultural irrigation pump stations built along the river mainly include Huangtong
Electrical Irrigation Pump station near Huangtongjian, 3 pump stations near Malan
River and several temporary pump stations and their total pumping flow rate is
1.4m3/s. The industrial enterprises along the Huangtong River sides are mainly of
pharmaceutical factory, feather factory, lime factory, cement factory, marble factory,
Yixing vehicle factory, etc. (the location of enterprises shown in attached drawing for
details). The domestic and production water for Jiangsu Jinsili Pharmaceutical Co.
Ltd at downstream of diversion intake is lead from the Yixing Running Water Plant.
The domestic water is lead from the Yixing Running Water Plant and the production
water is lead fromn Huangtong River for other factories. The total consumption rate is
O.6m3/s and those factories have no special requirements on water quality for their
production. According to information provided by Yixing Environment Protection
Bureau and site investigation, the production sewage from industrial enterprises along
Huangtong River sides are mainly of washing and cooling sewage, which now have
been discharged into Yixing sewage system and only a little of domestic sewage is
discharge into Huangtong River. As residents along the river sides are rather less and
scattered, the discharged domestic sewage is rather less.
In consideration of the water demands for consumption during construction, for initial
storage and for replenishment during operation in the lift-pumping works, a Step 1
pump station is to be built at Donghe bridge near section H9 and a Step 2 pump station
near Huiwu Reservoir with a pumping rate of 0.18m3/s. Together with 0.3m3/s
4-14



pumping rate necessary for irrigation of 700mu farm land after requisition of Huiwu
Reservoir, upon completion of this project 0.48m3/s diversion inflow should be
increased. Hence, the maximum diversion inflow from Huangtong River is 2.48m3/s.
The living water for inhabitants surrounding the regions from downstream dam site of
Huiwu Reservoir to Huangtongjian is mainly from wells and most inhabitants at both
sides of Huangtong River downstream Huangtongjian consume running water from
Yixing Running Water Plant. During construction the living water should be supplied
from Yixing running water system.
(2) Analysis of hydrological status
At non-flood period the upstream inflow is extremely low and the water flowing into
Huangtong River is mainly construction wastewater and sewage. During construction
the generated domestic sewage (ca. 0.0175 m3/s) is first treated to conform to
classification I specified in "The Comprehensive Sewage Discharge Standard" (main
pollutants: CODcr 100mg/L, BOD 20mg/L) and then discharged together with other
production wastewater (ca. 0.0718 m3/s) from lower reservoir. If no seepage and
evaporation is considered, the total inflow of sewage and wastewater is 0.0893 m3/s,
which mainly contains CODC, 29.9mg/L and BOD5 6.17mg/L.
The pumping points arranged from upstream to downwards along Huangtong River
include farmland irrigation pumping points, power station pumping points and
pumping points of industrial enterprises and the pumping rate of each pumping point
is higher than the discharge rate of construction wastewater and sewage. The surface
of Huangtong River is not wide and generally water velocity is extremely low. When
pumping at the pumping point, part of water is from the construction wastewater and
sewage discharged upstream, and another part of water is replenished from
downstream Tuanjiu Lake, by which both the upstream and downstream water runs to
the pumping points. Thus the sewage and wastewater discharged during construction
merely has a certain impact on the water quality in the river between Huangtongjian
and the pumping point. The water downstream the pumping points is taken from
Tuanjiu Lake and thus its quality is dependent on that of Tanjiu and will not be
impaired by the sewage and wastewater discharged during construction.
The water of Huangtong River is mainly for industrial purpose and irrigation.
Estimated under the most unfavorable conditions (i.e. The construction wastewater
and sewage entirely run into Huangtong River, without consideration of dilution and
degradation there), the quality of pumping water at different pumping rates is shown
in Table 4-3.

It is shown from Table 4-3 that at pumping merely for construction of the power
station, the average concentration of CODc, and BOD5 in Huangtong River conform
to criterion of classification IV specified in "The Surface Water Environmental
Quality Standard"; while at pumping for industrial purpose and irrigation the average
concentration of CODCr and BOD5 conform to criterion of classification III. Hence,
treating the construction wastewater and sewage to meet the standards before
discharging to Huangtong River can satisfy the quality requirements for
construction-required water, industrial water and irrigation water.
4.4.1.4 Impact on water consumers Dahanjie Canal by northern side of Tongguan
Mountain
According to the investigation, the surface runoff in Dahanjie Canal by northern side
of Tongguan Mountain is mainly from rainfalls and due to restriction in landform the
concentration time of the runnels is rather short. Flood process is basically depended
on the storm process.
The main water consumers near Dahanjie Gully include Yixing Dahanshan Drink Co.,
Ltd. and inhabitants at Dahanjie. Yixing Dahanshan Drink Co., Ltd. mainly produces
barreled drinking water with a mean daily capacity 4000 barrels (19L/barrel). It
intakes water from wells (5-6 m depth and 2.5m diameter) about 3m away from the
runnel in Dahanjie Canal. The domestic water necessary for the inhabitants is also
taken from wells.
After impounding, the reservoir water will only be circulated in the upper and lower
reservoir and not be discharged to the downstream stream. The upper reservoir will
not have seepage problem as bituminous concrete impervious face is designed, it will
not have impact on the water quality of the downstream stream and well nearly.
During construction of upper reservoir under the impact of the wastewater discharged
from bituminous concrete and concrete system of the upper reservoir, the turbidity of
water in Dahanjie Canal will be increased and the sewage discharged from the
bituminous concrete system will content PAHs and other hydrocarbon, the water
quality in wells of the water plant will be somewhat impaired. Hence wastewater
discharged from bituminous concrete and concrete system should be collected in a
4-16



collection basin and then treated by wastewater treatment station to reach Grade I
standard specified in "Comprehensive Sewage Discharge Standard" before being
discharged outwards. Monitoring of the water quality of the downstream wells also
should be strengthened.

The Treatment of production wastewater of bituminous concrete system is aimed at
the dislodging silt, PAHs, hydrocarbon and other oil pollutants in the wastewater. The
process flow (One Grade) adopted is shown in Fig. 4.4-3. As the production
wastewater for the concrete system of the upper reservoir is less and is near the
bituminous concrete system, the wastewater of it will be treated together with
production wastewater of the bituminous concrete system.

collection-treatment systems should be built to separately treat silt-bearing production
wastewater, oil-bearing production water and domestic sewage. The characteristics,
treatment capacity and treatment method of wastewater and sewage during
construction are shown in Table 4-4, the parameters of treatment facilities are shown
in Table 4-5 and 4-6, and arrangement of the water treatment stations is shown in

E. Analysis of treatment effect of sewage and wastewater
The silt-bearing construction wastewater is collected in open ditches and then enters
the desilting basin to remove most of the large particle or liable-to-resettle silts.
Thereby, the removal ratio of SS may be about 80%. However, since SS of the
wastewater entering the reaction basin is still rather high (ca. lOOmg/L), PAC
coagulation-settlement process should be used to at least remove 90% SS so as to
basically conform to criterion of classification I (SS <70mg/L) specified in "The
Comprehensive Sewage Discharge Standard" (GB8978-96).
The oil-bearing production wastewater is first subject to oil-separation treatment and
then together with the other production wastewater from ancillary enterprises and the
constructors' domestic sewage (The fecal sewage should be first subject to treatment
by septic-tank.) subject to 2-stage biochemical treatment. The removal ratio of
adjusting basin and primary settlement basin is about 40%, and contact oxidation
basin and secondary settlement basin, about 85%. They are disinfected to reach
classification I discharge standard before being discharged to minimize the
contamination impact on the acceptance water body.
The wastewater of the bituminous concrete and concrete system of the upper reservoir
area is collected in open ditches and then enters the oil separating desilting basin to
remove most of the large particle or liable-to-resettle silts. Thereby, the removal ratio
may be about 80% for SS and 70% for oil pollutants with PAHs and hydrocarbon. If
PAC coagulation-settlement process be used to at least remove 90% SS and gas
floating basin be used for the oil pollutants at least remove 90% so that the
wastewater after treated basically conform to criterion of classification I (SS <
70mg/L and oil sort 65mg/L) specified in "The Comprehensive Sewage Discharge
4-20



Standard" (GB8978-96).
F. Managerial measures to prevent water environment contamination
In order to minimize contamination to water environment, during construction the
following managerial measures should be taken:
a.  Establishing management system  of oil warehouse and transportation-oil
warehouse, providing alarm labels and assigning special persons for transportation
and management. The oil-bearing wastewater from the oil storage can only be
discharged after treatment and conforming to criterion of classification I specified in
"The Comprehensive Sewage Discharge Standard" (GB8978-96). The oil bearing
wastewater can be treated by three-grade type oil separator or movable wastewater
treator.
b. Strengthening maintenance and repair of various construction facilities and
devices, avoiding oil leaking and oil dropping from construction machines, collecting
the oily cotton used for cleaning devices and the oil-bearing wastewater in special
devices for incineration, prohibiting arbitrary throwing.
c. Strengthening site monitoring, prohibiting direct outwards-discharging production
wastewater and machine washing water, treating the domestic sewage and sewage
from dining room to reach discharge standard before discharge.
d. Centrally disposing the spoils in spoil area, taking engineering and vegetation
measures to avoid losses of water and soil; timely transporting the domestic refuses
and solid wastes to Yixing Refuses Landfill Yard.
e. The construction arrangement of the project, especially the arrangement of
bituminous concrete production area for the upper reservoir must be approved by the
local environment authority (have an Environment Certificate) and shall be strictly
carried out according to requirements.
(2) Treatment water quality for downstream inhabitants and units
The wells round the upper reservoir should be strictly monitored (monitoring
requirements, referred to monitoring program) to timely understand their quality. If
the monitoring indicators show that the quality of well water is impaired by the
sewage and wastewater discharged during construction, the proper compensation
measures (such as the water treatment devices supplied to pre-treat the production and
drinking water for the downstream affected factories, new well dug for the
downstream villagers, the economic compensation paid, etc) should be made.
4-21



4.4.2 Acoustic Environment Impact During Construction and Counter Measures
The construction activities-generated noise sources which will impact surrounding
acoustic environment mainly include upper reservoir area (excavation and blasting of
reservoir basin, excavation and casting of dam, excavation of water inlet and outlet),
upper reservoir production area (upper reservoir concrete system), lower reservoir
area (excavation and casting of dam, excavation of water inlet and outlet), lower
reservoir production area (lower reservoir concrete system and auxiliary enterprises)
and the area along the construction transportation roads.
(1) Upper reservoir area
The noise generated by excavation of upper reservoir basin and construction of water
inlet and outlet will mainly impact Yixing TV Transmission Station and 173
Microwave Station.
The noise generated by excavation, blasting and construction of upper reservoir basin
is a kind of transient noise. According to construction schedule, blasting is made
merely at noon and evening with a few times, which will not render an obvious
impact on microwave communication facilities and monitoring.
The noise generated by heavy-duty construction facilities and vehicles may reach 100
dB and it is continuous noise. Their activity range is mainly within upper reservoir
basin. When operating at the reservoir side near TV transmission station and
microwave station, they will give a rather serious impact on new machine room of TV
transmission station, and the living area and offices of microwave station. The
machine room and main working rooms of the microwave station are in
semi-basement and basically not be impacted. In order to reduce construction noise,
meet the noise requirement of indoor working environment and prevent the audio and
video monitoring of the on-operation communication facilities from being impaired, a
3m high acoustic isolation wall (also acting as flying stone retaining wall) should be
built outside the machine room of TV transmission station and all the windows on this
room modified to dual-layer acoustic isolation windows. Vehicle speed limitation and
no-homing signs should be fixed near TV transmission station and microwave station
so as to release the noise impact.
(2) Production area of upper reservoir
The production area of upper reservoir is mainly upper reservoir concrete system,
which is located in flat land of hillside northeastwards to the construction region and
whose noise is mainly generated by feeding, breaking, sieving and mixing during
production of bituminous concrete. According to the similar works, generally the
noise level 10m from concrete mixing system is about 80dB. Estimated according the
4-22



surrounding vegetation, the noise level lOOm from concrete mixing system may be
attenuated to meet standard of daytime-Grade I specified in "The Urban Regional
Environment Noise Standard", and 300m from concrete mixing system, meet
standard of night-Grade I. Because there is no noise-sensitive target within 500m
surrounding the production area of upper reservoir, no impact will generate.
(3) Lower reservoir area
The construction noise in lower reservoir area is generated by the construction
machines, including excavator, bulldozer, loader, concrete mixer, and heavy-duty
transportation truck. and the noise level 10 from the noise source is generally 90dB.
Estimated according the surrounding vegetation, the noise level 400m from lower
reservoir area may be decayed to meet standard of daytime-Grade I specified in
"Urban Regional Environment Noise Standard", and lOOOm, meet standard of
night-Grade I.
Constructors' temporary living area and 10 households of inhabitants are in a range
500m east to lower reservoir area. Construction in lower reservoir area at daytime will
not seriously impact the constructors and inhabitants; while construction at night will
generate a noise level higher than the standard value. Under the requisite to ensure
construction progress, the working time should be reasonably arranged in an effect to
make highly noisy jobs at daytime and restrict noisy jobs at night (22:00-7:00, same
for below).
The transient noise level generated by blasting in lower reservoir is rather high. Since
the blasting duration is very short, the impact is not serious. By control of explosive
dose, transient strong noise contamination generated by blasting may be reduced.
(4) Production area of lower reservoir
The production area of lower reservoir is mainly lower reservoir concrete system and
the auxiliary enterprises.
Lower reservoir concrete system is arranged by west side of the site-access highway
and its noise impact range is basically similar to that of the upper reservoir concrete
system. The daytime construction noise level beyond lOOm may be decayed to reach
standard of daytime-classification I, and 300m, night-classification I. Because the
nearby residential area and constructors' temporary living area are at least 350m away
from concrete system and between them there are workshops or warehouses, they will
not be impacted by noise generated by concrete system.
The auxiliary enterprises include reinforcement fabrication plant, steel pipe plant,
lumber mill, machine repair plant, vehicle maintenance yard, and air compression
plant, which are arranged in the flat slope land by east side of the site-access highway.
4-23



The noise is generated from indoor and the constructors' living area is separated by
warehouses and equipment warehouses. Hence the construction noise basically has no
impact on constructors' temporary living area. Since the east residential area is merely
50m from the processing plant, for construction the high noise source should be as far
as possible arranged at west side of the plant houses and measures of silencing,
acoustic isolation and vibration absorbing should be taken. Moreover, construction
management should be strengthened and no noisy job at night may be allowed to
release the impact of construction noise on the surrounding inhabitants.
(5) Vehicle noise impact during construction and counter measures
The heavy-duty vehicles include 5-20t dump truck, 30t-60t flat truck and concrete
mixing-transportation vehicle, the noise level generated by them along the
transportation routes is generally about 80dB.
The traffic highways in the construction area include 19.5km new-built permanent
highway and 12.38km newly built temporary highway and their estimated mean and
peak traffic volume is respectively 50 vehicles/h and 100 vehicles/h. There is no
residential area by both sides of construction roads. However, the nearest temporary
constructors' living area is merely 20m from the construction road, and the estimated
noise level may be 65dB, which will somewhat impair the constructors. The
construction vehicles should keep at good conditions. Any vehicle passing temporary
constructors' living area should decelerate and horning is not allowed. A retaining
wall is also built by one side of road in temporary constructors' living area to release
noise impact.
By both sides of the road from lower reservoir dam site to 104 national highway there
are tea farms without any residence. Hence no noise impact will occur.
The transportation distance from quarry to lower reservoir dam site is about 20km and
along the route there are several residential areas such as Yushan Village, Furong Tea
Farm, and Chunbu Town. The traffic noise generated by the sand-stone-transportation
vehicles will worsen the environmental noise within this region. According to
estimate, the daytime environmental noise along the route from quarry to construction
area is about 70dB, which basically meets the environmental noise standard by both
sides of main traffic road; however, at night the traffic volume is higher, and the noise
level will exceed the standard value. Therefore, construction management should be
strengthened and the daytime and night transportation volume should be reasonably
planned. In the sensitive sections such as residential area speed limitation and
no-homing signs should be fixed to reduce environmental noise.
(6) Impact of construction noise on animals
According to information provided by Yixing Forest Side-line Bureau (refer to
4-24



Attachment 3), the animals in the project area and area around are all not protection
wildlife, except pangolin and boa, the second protection wildlife (it was found in the
history but not found in survey of 1998) and no wildlife propagation area is found in
the project area. Thus impact of the construction noise on animals is less.
4.4.3 Vibration Environment Impact during Construction and Counter Measures
The vibration possibly generated during construction includes the vibration generated
by blasting, construction vehicles (heavy-duty truck and bulldozer) and construction
facilities (excavator, manual pneumatic drill, in-the-hole drill). According to the status
of sensitive points surrounding the construction area and the features of the noise
sources, the impact by construction vibration is mainly the impact of the vibration
generated during blasting operation in upper reservoir basin on Yixing TV
Transmission Station and Yixing 173 Microwave Station.
Currently, in both domestic and abroad engineering fields the particle vertical
vibration velocity is used as a criterion to assess the safety of blasting vibration. On
basis of "New Technology of Removal and Blasting" (China Railway Press House,
June 1988 edition) and other data, for Yixing TV Transmission Station and Yixing 173
Microwave Station where electronic equipment and precise electronic apparatus are
equipped, the verified safety value of particle vibration velocity is taken <3.5cm/s,
and for old stone-brick structures, <5cm/s.
The attenuation of vibration velocity generated during blasting may be calculated by
the following empirical formula:
v     __f-a
R)
where, v- vibration velocity generated during blasting, cm/s
K, a - parameter decided on basis on geological conditions and blasting mode
W- explosive dose, kg
R- distance, m
Calculation on basis of our measured blasting data shows that when the distance
between the blasting point and machine room of Yixing TV Transmission Station and
Yixing 173 Microwave Station is below 80m and the explosive dose is below 80kg,
the particle vibration velocity at these two places is <3.5m/s, and when the distance
between the blasting point and machine room of Yixing TV Transmission Station and
Yixing 173 Microwave Station is 80m-150m and the explosive dose is below 140kg,
the particle vibration velocity at the old machine room of Yixing TV Transmission
Station and the office and living houses of Yixing 173 Microwave Station is <5m/s.
During construction, technical measures such as oriented blasting, pre-split blasting,
differential initiation, reduction of explosive dose of single section, providing of
cushion layer, reasonable section of blasting apparatus, improvement of powder
4-25



package, reasonable arrangement of blasting sequence and selection of time interval
should be taken to minimize the vibration impact by construction blasting. The impact
of construction vibration on equipment and structures may be basically eliminated by
fixing vibration absorbing pads under important equipment in TV transmission
Station and microwave station, reinforcing structures and constantly conducting
maintenance during operation. In order to ensure blasting effect and control blasting
impact, before construction blasting a site blasting experiment and monitoring should
be made to find out the correct allowable explosive dose and other blasting
parameters. According to different objects impacted by construction blasting, analysis
on following aspects should be made:
(1) Building
The buildings in TV transmission station include the old and new.machine room and
water pump house: The old machine room, which was built early and was not repaired
for many years, is a dangerous house and now is used as a playing room. It should be
removed and rebuilt since it will be collapsed by construction vibration. Water pump
house is of a common brick structure and its safety will be ensured by proper
reinforcement.
It is about 3 decades from establishment of machine room of microwave station in
1970s. This room is a very durable semi-basement structure and will not be impacted
by blasting vibration. However, the ground structures such as the antenna room, the
office and living room of microwave station were lately built and they were not
subject to earthquake-resistant consolidation. Blasting vibration will result in damage
of them. After proper consolidation of these houses, the equipment and the safety of
attendants will not be impacted.
The strengthening design of the building against earthquake has been entrusted to
Wuxi Seismograph Station of Jiangsu Province.
In order to avoid contradiction between Contractor and TV transmission tower and
microwave station, it is clearly defined in the project bidding document that the before
the construction -the construction contractor must thoroughly check the structures of
TV transmission tower and microwave station which may be impacted by blasting and
blasting vibration, and take photos for inside and outside of structures so as to record
cracks in walls and foundation. This can ensure that any blasting has reasonable basis.
(2) TV transmission tower
The vibration generated by heavy blasting will impact the body structure and base of
transmission tower. In order to prevent TV transmission tower from collapse during
construction and ensure its normal operation the tower is primarily planned to rebuild
in another place.
4-26



The new tower is to be sited in the open ground at south side of the existing machine
room, which is not much far from the previous tower site and keeps a relative height
with transmission antenna. Hence its service range and effect will not be impacted. In
order to avoid interruption of relay of TV and frequency-modulated TV programs, the
new tower should be built before removal of the existing one.
(3) Communication equipment
The main communication equipment in Yixing TV Transmission Station and Yixing
173 Microwave Station may be basically divided into receiving-transmitting system,
antenna-feed system and program transmission system. Through preventive measures
such as control of blasting vibration velocity, stabilization and reinforcement of
communication equipment, and vibration absorbing and vibration isolation of
foundation of equipment, normal operation of communication equipment will not be
seriously impacted by blasting vibration, operation of microwave station and TV
transmission tower will not be interrupted. Only in case of improper control of
blasting and excessively high vibration velocity will TV transmission station and
microwave station be seriously impacted. On basis of the explosive dose and blasting
parameters obtained through the trial blasting, generally no excessively blasting
vibration velocity will generate during construction. By preventive measures, constant
tightening and maintenance of the important locations of equipment, timely repair and
replace of wearing out parts, and stocking sufficient spare parts the blasting vibration
impact during construction of upper reservoir will be eliminated.
4.4.4 Excavation Impact during Construction and Counter Measures
(1) Impact on transmission tower of TV transmission station
The transmission tower of TV transmission station is located at the edge of abrupt hill
slope and tower base is near excavation line of bank slope of upper reservoir. When
excavating the load bearing layer under the main dam foundation, the stability of
tower base may be impaired. In order to ensure normal operation of TV transmission
tower it is reasonable to rebuild the transmission tower at another place.
(2) Lightning-preventing earth system
One of the main impacts on TV transmission station and microwave station by
excavation in upper reservoir area is that the existing 2 lightning-preventing earth
poles of microwave station and part of the existing earth power system of TV
transmission station will be damaged. In order to ensure safe operation of TV
transmission station and microwave station following measures are to be taken:
According to hillside landform and geological conditions near the microwave station
4-27



two artificial earth units should be newly erected and connected with the existing
earth power system so as to ensure personal safety and prevent equipment from
damage.
According to "Protective Measures Project Design Report" prepared by the Design
Institute under the Ministry of TV and Broadcasting, Lightning preventing rod is fixed
at mast top of the tower, and the stairs and 4 supports of tower body are used as
lead-lines to connect with both the earthing media of foundation and the existing
earthing network to ensure safety of personnel and equipment in machine room in
case of lightning.
4.4.5 Flying Stone Impact during Construction Blasting and Counter Measures
By taking the technical measures such as oriented blasting, pre-split blasting,
differential initiation, and reduction of explosive dose the quantity of flying stone
during construction in upper reservoir may be obviously reduced and the direction of
flying stone may be controlled to a certain extent, thereby its impact on the outdoor
equipment of TV transmission station and microwave station may be released. Since
TV transmission station and microwave station are near to construction site, they will
likely be impacted by particular flying stones generated by blasting. The safe distance
of particular flying stone may be estimated by the following empirical formula:
Rr = 20 Kf. n2 W   (Formula 4.1-2)
Where:
Rr - safe distance, m
n -  blasting action index, n =r/W
r -  radius of blasting funnel, m
W - Minimum resistance line of largest power package, m
Kf- safety factor, generally 1-1.5, but 1.5-2 at fast down-wind
The correct safe distance should be determined by calculation after trial blasting and
the blasting time should be in advance informed of TV transmission station and
microwave station. Prior to blasting, it should be alarmed to avoid working personnel
to make outdoor activity and thus ensure their safety. The relieving signal shall be sent
to them after blasting.
In order to eliminate damage of window and roof of buildings in TV transmission
station and microwave station by possible particular flying stones, the windows
should be fixed with outside steel screen, roofs covered with straw mat, and a
retaining wall built at north side of main machine room of TV transmission station (in
combination with noise release measures).
The cables, antennas and feed lines exposed outdoors should be provided with
protective mesh and the ground feed lines covered with straw mat. The thin cables
4-28



and lines should be threaded through steel duct.
4.4.6 Environmental Air Quality Impact During Construction and Counter
Measures
4.4.6.1 Dusting impact during construction and counter measures
During construction, dust is mainly generated during excavation, and piling, handle
and transport of spoils. Transport and mixing of cement also results in dusting.
The data of Yixing Meteorological Observatory shows that in Yixing the annual
prevailing wind direction is SE and ESE. Except that the site office and living area is
down the prevailing wind, the residential areas surrounding construction site and the
constructors' temporary living area are up the prevailing wind. Hence the construction
dusting, road dusting and cement dust mainly impact the site constructors. By taking
labor protection measures (such as masks and dusk masks used), this impact will not
be obvious.
In order to minimize the impact by construction dusting on environmental air quality
the following measures should be taken:
(1) Loading and unloading of cement should be in civilized manner and cement silo
should be fully enclosed to eliminate the impact of cement dust on environmental
air quality;
(2) The routes along which truck runs should be regularly water sprinkled to reduce
dusting during vehicle-running;
(3) The spoils should be timely removed and handled to spoil area;
(4) The excavation site (dam base, and quarry) and other dusty working faces
should be regularly manually sprinkled;
(5) In excavation of underground powerhouse, water conveyance system and adit,
the wet drilling technology should be adopted to reduce dusting. Moreover, they
should be well ventilated to keep air flowing.
(6) The water proof cloth shall be used during transportation for those materials
with dust, such as earth, stone, cement.
4.4.6.2 Waste gas generated from fuels of construction facilities
The construction facilities include bulldozer, excavator, diesel-compressor, drifter,
rock drill and heavy-duty truck. The pollutants generated during excavation of dam
4-29



base and basin of upper and lower reservoirs, construction of water conveyance
system and underground powerhouses, and running of truck are mainly nitrogen
oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbon (HC). Auxiliary factories such
as machine plant also will generate waste gasses to some extent. These pollutants
mainly emit to upper and lower reservoir area and construction plants with a low
discharge. Wide surface relief surrounding the upper and lower reservoir area
facilitates fast diffusion of atmospheric pollutants, and surrounding the reservoir area
there is no atmospheric contamination-sensitive target to be protected. Thus, the
impact on environmental air quality in the construction area and its surroundings by
fuel-generated waste gasses is relatively low. In order to keep atmosphere within the
project area clean the fume and dust discharge unit of the auxiliary construction plants
should be provided with air purification device to make the waste gas reach standard
before discharge.
4.4.6.3 Waste gasses and dusting during construction blasting
The total amount of explosive necessary for this project is 4930t, including 3170t for
upper reservoir, 920t for lower reservoir, and 840t for water conveyance system and
underground powerhouses. Blasting will generate toxic gasses such as NO, CO, S02
and NO2. As open blasting process is used for upper reservoir and the dust and toxic
gasses generated by blasting are liable to diffuse. Yixing TV Transmission Station and
Yixing 173 Microwave Station located at south side and southwest side of
construction area of upper reservoir are frequently up the wind, need a few attendants
and their relief is rather high. Thus, they are not seriously impacted by the
blasting-dusting. A few of dusts will collect on surface of insulation parts of antenna
and feed lines. However, washing by rain and regular artificial de-dusting of main
outdoor equipment will ensure the normal operation of antenna and feed lines not to
be impacted.
During blasting for water conveyance system and underground powerhouses the
concentration of toxic gasses in cavern is rather high. However, the toxic gasses are
diluted to a lower concentration by the ventilation devices there and then fast
outwards diffuse, thus, their impact on sensitive targets such as residential area is not
serious. Labor protection should be strengthened for the in-cavern constructors to
ensure their safety.
4.4.7 Impact on People's Health and Counter Measures
According to construction plan, the living area for constructors of upper and lower
reservoir is arranged by the east side of 5# highway downstream lower reservoir dam
site. During construction, the temporary living facilities and offices will cover an area
of 63000m2 with a total floor area of 42000m2. The mean and peak number of
constructors is 3250 and 4470 respectively. The planned per capita construction land
can meet the requirement of arrangement of living facilities.
4-30



Since the constructors come everywhere and centrally dwell under rather poor
conditions, diseases will occur. Hence:
(1) All the constructors should be subject to entire health inspection and the one
having infectious disease is not allowed to enter construction site. The workers
of dinning room should be regularly inspected and take post by health certificate.
Disease, if found, should be timely cured.
(2) The constructors shall have occupational health and sanitary training. The
constructors should have consciousness of self-protection and should not sleep
in open. Indoors mosquito nets should be put to prevent propagation of disease
by mosquito.
(3) Rats which live in open will move to residential area during construction. Hence
in temporary living area rat-prevention and rat killing should be conducted. Also,
hygiene management system in construction area should be established and the
hygiene status there should be regularly inspected.
(4) Drink water sources should be well selected and protected and the drink water
should be disinfected or purified. Dietetic hygiene should be strictly managed to
prevent occurrence of hepatitis and dysentery.
(5) The domestic sewage, refuses and other wastes should be well disposed and
controlled. The domestic sewage should be treated by sewage treatment plant
and the domestic refuses and solid wastes should be regularly cleared and
removed.
(6) The non-constructors in restaurant and snack bars near the construction area
shall be educated on occupation health, sanitary and safety by relative
authorities.
(7) The constructors shall have different protection measure according to different
work and be trained how to use the protection measures. The protection
appliances required for different work are shown in Table 4-7.

4.5 Electromagnetic Wave Impact and Counter Measures
The microwave receiving-transmitting system of microwave station and TV
transmission station is a weak-signal low frequency operation system and is liable to
be interfered by outside electromagnetic wave.
The switchyard of this power station is sited at northern hillside of ridge of
underground powerhouse top and its shortest distance from TV transmission station
and microwave station is about 850m and lOOOm respectively, less than 1800m
protection distance specified by the state standard (GBJ143-90).  The ground
elevation of the switchyard is 310m with a difference of 60m from ridge top elevation
and this ridge is a natural magnetic barrier between the switchyard and the microwave
station and TV transmission station. GIS mode used inside the switchyard has a good
shielding effect and the electromagnetic wave interference on TV transmission station
and microwave station may be basically eliminated.
There is no interrupter and disconnector in the 500kV switchyard and the
electromagnetic wave is merely generated by corona of the conductors and metallic
fixtures, whose impact is similar to that of 500kV transmission line. The linear
distance between the outgoing line of switchyard and the TV transmission station and
microwave station is much higher than 500m protection distance specified by state
standard (GBJ143-90) and the ridge is a natural barrier, hence signal receiving and
transmitting of TV transmission station and microwave station will not be impacted.
4.6 Impact on Environmental Geology and Counter Measures
4.6.1 Reservoir bank stability
For upper reservoir, its bottom elevation is 420-440m, bottom slope, 5°-8°, crest
elevation 500m-520m, bank slope about 260. Under natural conditions, the bank
slope has good stability, without slide or collapse found. After excavation the upper
side slope and lower side slope is respectively 45°-53.1° and 35.50. The upper
reservoir basin-is protected by bituminous concrete lining and the reservoir bank
under normal storage level may be kept stable. Since the transmission tower of Yixing
TV transmission station is sited above the right abutment of main dam of upper
reservoir and the tower base is near the excavation line of side slope of upper
reservoir, the stability of side slope will be somewhat impaired. In consideration of
other impacts by construction, it is to be rebuilt at another place.
The surface relief of both banks of lower reservoir is relative mild. The slope of left
and right banks is respectively 8-20° and 3035° and the banks are stable.
4-32



4.6.2 Reservoir immersion
The elevation of both Yixing TV Transmission Station and Yixing 173 Microwave
Station is above 500m and the normal storage level of upper reservoir is 471.5m. The
difference between elevations is large and thus they are not impacted by reservoir
immersion.
Forestry lands are by both banks of lower reservoir without farmland. After
completion of this project there is no structure by both banks, thus no immersion
impact exists.
4.6.3 Reservoir Seepage
The water divide surrounding lower reservoir is not high, the outside hillside is steep,
and the reservoir is to be excavated to enlarge its capacity, hence the bank mountain
body is rather thin. The analysis of bore water level data shows that groundwater level
surrounding the reservoir is usually very low and after storage a high hydraulic
percolation gradient will form. According to the seepage data along the main dam
plinth line, the embedded depth of relative confining bed (q=lLu) is 20-40m and that
at right bank may reach 30-50m. NWW discontinuities develop through dam toe, thus
problem of central seepage and percolation stability along cracked zone may occur,
especially seepage from lower reservoir basin. Therefore, reservoir basin should be
completely protected by lining with bituminous concrete, i.e. reservoir banks,
reservoir bottom and inside wall of main dam should be protected with bituminous
concrete to form a closed seepage-resistant system to eliminate seepage from upper
reservoir.
Three sides of lower reservoir are surrounded by hill and the mountain body is very
thick, hence permanent seepage will not result. However seepage at banks near dam is
possible. The geological investigation data shows that an east-west oriented spur lies
outside of the right abutment, and beyond there, there is a strip-shaped quarry of large
area with its bottom elevation 76.7-77.9m. The outside of mountain is a steep open
space and the ridge is rather thin. The embedded depth of water table is lower than the
normal storage level. The rock from dam abutment on right bank to cross-over has a
poor integrality and the embedded depth of water table is lower than the normal
storage level. Outward seepage passages possibly exist in the two above-mentioned
locations. In this project the thin ridge at the two dam abutments and the seepage
passages under dam base should be subject to anti-seepage treatment with curtain
grouting. The curtains are arranged along rock-fill dam plinth and penetrate 5m into
relative confining bed (q=3Lu). This program may meet engineering requirements and
eliminate seepage from lower reservoir.
4-33



4.6.4 Reservoir Induced earthquake
According to the geological investigation data, in upper reservoir there are 0.5m-5m
wide rupture bed and O.lm-0.2m wide small rupture bed and cracked zone, and the
scale of rupture bed in lower reservoir is relatively small and the cracked zone is less
than Im in width. The water table at upper and lower reservoir is below the normal
storage level. Though the interval from normal storage level and dead level of upper
and lower reservoir is respectively 42.90m and 21.90m, since the upper reservoir
basin is lined with bituminous concrete and provided with drainage gallery, merely a
little water penetrate to rupture bed and the hydrological and geological conditions of
upper reservoir area will not be obviously impacted. For lower reservoir, increase in
water depth is not large because of expansion of the existing Huiwu Reservoir and the
scale of rupture bed and cracked zone is relatively small, hence the hydrological and
geological conditions of lower reservoir area also will not be seriously impacted. The
difference of surface load before and after construction of upper and lower reservoir is
rather small, so it is not likely to change the existing stratigraphic structure. Thus the
local stratigraphic structure and hydrological and geological conditions of upper and
lower reservoir will not be obviously impacted. The construction area is far from the
northwestern Mashan rupture (ca. 50-60km) and earthquake activity in Yixing region
is relatively weak. Therefore, reservoir will have little possibility to induce
earthquake.
4.7 Resettlement Impact and Counter Measures
4.7.1 Relocation Planning
4.7.1.1  Relocation task
For this project, Yixing Forest Farm Nanyuesi Branch, workers living area of Yixing
173 Microwave Station and 19 households (44 persons) of Nanyuesi Branch should
be removed and relocated. This project will requisition 39.98mu farmland and 512.75
mu tea land from Yixing Environmental Science and Technology Zone (involving 685
persons in 296 households) and 691 mu forestland from Dahanjie Branch Forest farm
(involving 28 persons in 12 households).
4.7.1.2 Planning for relocation and living facilities
(1) Planning of removal and resettlement
According to resettlement plan of this project, the head office and all workers of
Yixing Forest Farm Nanyuesi Branch should be relocated at the existing fir forestry
land of this branch, which covers an area of 10 mu. The host site is near the access
road to the dam crest and 650m northeastwards from the existing head office. The
4-34



workers living area of Yixing 173 Microwave Station should be relocated at the
existing weed tree forestry land, which covers an area of 1.0 mu and is by south side
of this station gate.
(2) Planning of water supply
The water necessary for new head office and workers' households of Nanyuesi
Branch should be pumped from wells. For supplying water for living area of Yixing
173 Microwave Station, a retaining dam, filter tank (140m3), storage tank (60m3) and
pump house should be built in the hillside by south side of the rerouted highway from
microwave station to TV transmission station. The water volume collected in the
hillside area can meet the demands of the microwave station area and its living area.
(3) Planning of electricity supply
The electricity for the relocated head office of Nanyuesi Branch and the living area of
Yixing   173   Microwave    Station  should  be   supplied  by    rebuilt
transmission-transformation facilities to be built along with the power supply plan for
the new site..
(4) Traffic
The new head office of Nanyuesi Branch is merely 250m from the planned access
road to dam crest and it is connected with farm roads. Traffic can be solved without
building other access.. The new living area of Yixing Microwave Station is on the
south side of the existing microwave station gate and the rerouted highway passes
there. Hence traffic is also unnecessary to be solved with other means.
(5) Leveling of ground
The new head office of Nanyuesi Branch covers a small piece of land where the
surface relief is rather flat. Large scale excavation and retaining wall and protection
slope are not required. The land leveling works is relatively small, merely including
leveling of ground and building of intercepting trenches and drain ditches.
The new living area of Yixing Microwave Station is sited on a small piece of flat and
open land, thus the work volume for ground leveling is relatively small. The
necessary works merely is to build drain ditches around the newly built building.
4.7.1.3 Planning of resettlement and production
The project construction will requisition 2159.59 mu forestry land of Yixing Forest
Farm and 44 persons of 19 households in Nanyuesi branch will be affected due to
land requisition. The affected employees will be job re-arranged by the forest farm by
4-35



re-allocating the contracted forestry land and reclaiming young tree nursery. It is
planned to reclaim 300 mu nursery at the gentle sloped hill foot between Nanyuesi
and Dahanjie branches. The newly reclaimed nursery will mainly be planted with
young oaks and firs and pines. Planting young trees is one of the production items for
the forest farm, with matured technology and reliable income. The total investment to
reclamation of new nursery will be 0.75 million Yuan and the predicted yearly output
value is 1.50 million Yuan with a net profit of 0.3 million Yuan, which is more than
the income from the affected forestry land. The resettlement compensation to the
reservoir inundated land and project requisition land is 2.3629 million Yuan, which is
sufficient for reclamation of new nursery.
The permanent requisition for the project construction includes 23.59 mu farmland,
71.32mu tea tree garden and 213.35 mu forestry land in Yixing Environmental
Science and Technology Zone, the temporary land occupation of the project will cover
97.62 mu tea farm of Meiyuan Tea Tree Garden. Because of land requisition, 685
persons of 296 households in the zone will be affected (569 persons of 246
households in Meiyuan Village, 69 persons of 30 households in Huangtong Village
and 19 persons of 8 households in Shanmen Village). As the land to be requisitioned
in Huangtong and Shanmen villages is small in quantity, the resettlement for the
affected persons will be carried out by re-allocating the land within the village group.
The resettlement for the affected persons will be conducted by several means. A) The
farmland of the village group will be re-allocated within the group so that per capital
farmland holding in the group will be generally balanced. B) 270-odd mu tea tree land
of the collective owned tea tree garden will be allocated to affected village groups
based on the land area requisitioned, so as to maintain the tea tree land area of each
affected village group as before land requisition. C) The affected village group will be
allocated with forestry land (from the collective owned forestry land) equal to that
requisitioned.
The project affected forestry lands in the development zone, Guijing Township and
Shanjuan Town are all the collective owned forestry land, no special resettlement
arrangement is needed after land requisition, but compensation.
4.7.2 Impact analysis
Since this project involves a few migrants and a less occupied land and the utilization
of the occupied land is simple, as long as the resettlement plan is strictly executed, the
impact of the project on the life of migrants and on the environment of the relocated
site is very slight.
After resettlement as planned, the affected 44 employees of the forest farm are
predicted to have more income than before land requisition, the production resources
for the affected 713 persons in Environmental Science and Technology Zone will
generally not be reduced. It can be seen that the project construction will impose little
4-36



impact on the production and living of the employees of the forest farm and the
inhabitants in the Environmental Science and Technology Zone.
4.8 Impact on Landscape and Tourism and Counter Measures
Tongguan Mountain where this project will be sited has high forest coverage and a
good natural and ecological condition. The noise, dust and waste gasses generated
during construction will somewhat impair its previous environment. The excavation,
spoils and stacked materials will impair the landscape. However, these impacts are
temporally and will be released by seasonable site plan, construction organization and
advance management measures.
According to construction site plan, upper reservoir bituminous concrete system at
upper reservoir construction area is to be arranged by northwest side of 1# highway
and the construction site is visible from Nanyuesi (Nanyue Temple) at mountain foot
and Nanyuesi is down wind the bituminous concrete system. Therefore, the temple is
somewhat impacted by the waste gasses generated from the system. The arrangement
of construction site in this area will impact the entire landscape effect of Nayuesi, a
major scenic spot of Yixing City. For this reason the bituminous concrete system
should be rearranged to release the visual impact on it.
According to state regulations, upon completion of construction, Tongguan Mountain
should be restored to its original state as far as possible. Under the requisite of
meeting technical requirements of the project, the key structures should be subject to
artistic design to coordinate with natural scene.
After completion of project the reservoir and its unique operation mode will become a
new scenic spot, which will promote development of local tourism and render a
remarkable economical and social effect. According to operation features of the
project, swimming, fishing, water recreation activities in reservoir, hunting and
picnics should be prohibited, and alarm signs and safety notes should be fixed around
the reservoir. It shall be propagated and announced to public by the local news paper,
radio station and TV station.
As the recreation activities of hunting and swimming are prohibited in the existing
Huiwu reservoir area and activities that may cause fire (such as picnics) are prohibited
in the peripheral forest areas according to "Chinese Forest Laws", the prohibiting
fishing and swimming in the reservoir after the completion of project and picnics in
the forest area will not affect the living quality of peripheral residents.
4.9 Soil and Water Conservation
4.9.1 Soil and Water Loss within Project Area and Its Existing Status
4-37



The soil and water loss within project area is mainly caused by water erosion and the
land requisition for this project mainly involves forestry land of Yixing Forest Farrn
and Yixing 173 Microwave station. The timber wood of pines and firs in upper
reservoir area has not been harvested in last decade and the wood in lower reservoir
area-was alternatively harvested and regenerated. These areas are thickly covered by
arbor, shrub, bamboo and herbs, with vegetation coverage of 90%, and soil and water
is well conserved with a slight loss. The soil erosion module is about 11.55t/km2.a,
belonging to slight soil erosion.
4.9.2 Existing Soil Utilization Status within the Project Area
The existing land utilization status within project acquisition area which includes the
project permanent requisition, construction temporary requisition and transmission
line requisition, is shown in Table 4-8.

Note: * including other requisitioned lands such as for simple highway, reservoir
water surface, open land, ditches and tractor roads.
4.9.3 Possibly Damaged Soil and Water Conversation Facility Area
Soil and water loss area possibly resulted from construction is totally 3577.73 mu,
which includes upper reservoir, 1# and #2 spoil area in upper reservoir area, upper
reservoir bituminous concrete system and concrete system, lower reservoir area, 3#
and #4 spoil area at lower reservoir area, lower reservoir concrete system,
constructors' temporary living area, land for auxiliary enterprises, borrow area,
construction roads and resettlement host site.
4.9.4 Spoils Quantity
At the upper reservoir area, excavation will be made for main and subsidiary dam,
reservoir basin, powerhouse system, switchyard, water conveyance system,
4-38



construction adit, and ground leveling, totally 0.9472 million cubic meters for earth
excavation and 7.3242 million cubic meters for rock excavation. Of which, 2.3499
million cubic meters will be re-utilized. According to earth-rock balance, 8.4819
million cubic meters (loose volume) will be disposed to spoil area.
At the lower reservoir area, there will be 1.0322 million cubic meters of earth
excavation and 2.7096 million cubic meters of rock excavation, for dam, reservoir
basin, powerhouse system, and construction adit, among which 0.85 million cubic
meters will be re-utilized. According to earth-rock balance, 3.9787 million cubic
meters (loose volume) will be disposed to spoil area. The total spoils of upper and
lower reservoir are 12.4608 million cubic meters (loose volume).
4.9.5 Counter Measures for Soil and Water Conservation
The work for water and soil conservation in this project can be divided into six parts,
i.e., spoil area, borrow area, construction factories and construction camp,
construction accesses inside and outside the site, water conveyance pipeline of
replenishment works, and the production, living and management area of the power
station. The main measures to be adopted include engineering measures and
vegetation measures.
4.9.5.1 Control measures for spoil area
(1) According to the landform pattern within project site the spoil area should be sited
the nearby gully, which should facilitate unloading of spoils and occupy less forestry
land.
(2) The outside of the spoil area will be placed with roller compacted rock blocks with
the side slope of 1:20 and protected by dry masonry. Every 20m one 6m wide bench
will be built and in inner side of the bench rectangular-shaped drain ditches should be
provided. According to the collecting area of the hillside around the spoil area, mortar
masonry drain ditches should be properly built.
(3) After completion of disposal of spoils, the spoil areas should be leveled and
covered with the excavated earth. The covered depth on top and on side slope should
be at least 50cm and 30cm respectively.
(4) The top of spoil area should be planted with bamboo (or locust), and side slope,
with grass. Bamboo (or locust) should be planted with bunch planting method with a
density of 40 bamboo/mu (total 35350 bamboo). Its side slopes should be directly
transplanted with root-developed grasses.
4.9.5.2 Control measures for borrow area
4-39



After completion of excavation the spoil area should be scaled at a straight-line mode
according to soil character, and the slope should be less than 1:1.25. Then the area
should be back-filled with the spoil surface soil and then leveled (leveling area 0.1297
million square meters). The leveled ground is then planted with tea trees.
4.9.5.3 Measures for construction factories and construction camp
After completion of construction, the temporary construction plant in construction
factories and construction camp should be removed and the ground cleared and
leveled. The soil compacted in construction should be loosened and cleared again
(leveling area 0.27 million square meters). The lower reservoir production and living
area is the temporarily occupied land and should be leveled before planting with tea
trees. The upper reservoir production area is the permanently occupied land and
should be leveled before planting with bamboo (40 bamboo/mu, total 1860 bamboo).
4.5.9.4 Control measures for construction access inside and outside site
(1) According to engineering design, the access road bed side slope will be in four
slopes, i.e., 1:1, 1:0.75, 1:0.4, and 1:0.35, and maximum slope height of each slopes is
15m or 20m. In case of slope height above 15m, pre-split blasting should be adopted.
In case of slope height above 20m, 2m wide benches should be built every 20m to
ensure stability of side slope. For the section of poor geological conditions, support
measures should taken, such as chasm bridge, mortar anchorage, concrete welt and
shotcrete.
The side slope of road beds should be filled with earth and stone. Otherwise, it should
be of M7.5 shelf-type mortar masonry retaining wall structure and part of its section
subject to C15 schist concrete foundation reinforcement.
(2) Drain ditches should be built on both sides of the road (by one side in the filled
section) and the side ditch in bedrock section (1# highway) should be of a rectangular
shape (bottom width 40cm, depth 40cm). The side ditch in earth base section (2# and
7# road, and temporary road) should be of a trapezoid shape (bottom width 40cm,
depth 40cm) and its two side slopes should be 1:1 and 1:1.5 to meet the drain
requirement of the road.
(3) For construction of the access roads, cut-and-fill mode should be adopted and the
total spoils will be 0.217 million cubic meters, which should be hauled to the nearby
spoil area, and random dumping or piling on runnels should be prohibited.
(4) Totally 3771 camphor trees will be planted on both sides of permanent highway
(but only on outer side of highways in mountainous area) at an interval 2-4m. The
steep cut slope and the dike slope with rocks should be planted with Boston ivy at an
interval 2m (total 9750 trees). The side slope above the highway around the upper
4^40



reservoir should be protected with sod.
4.9.5.5 Soil and water conservancy measures water replenishing works
The pipe route of water replenishing works is 3220m long and 3m wide and is
embedded underground. Since the occupied land, for laying this pipeline is mostly
farmland, after completion of construction, conditions for farming should be recreated
by back-filling earth, ground leveling and removal of temporary construction
facilities.
4.9.5.6 Control measures for living and management area of the power station
The production, living and management area of the power station mainly includes its
management and living area, switchyard, step 1 and 2 pump station of the water
replenishing works and planting is the main measures for soil and water conservation.
(1) The office, living and management area of power station should be planted with
trees and sod and provided with flowerbed. In the flowerbed Chinese rose, poinsettia
and chrysanthemum will be cultured. Along both sides of in-site roads, camphor trees
and snow pine, and magnolias will be planted with a total plantation area 13284
square meters.
(2) The switchyard will be mainly covered with sod (total greening-area 500 square
meters). 800 square meters of green belt around the switchyard will be mainly planted
with black bamboo and oleander.
(3) Within the enclosure of step 1 and 2 pump stations, sod with brush and flower will
be planted around buildings. Camphor trees will be planted along both sides of
in-site-roads and the greening-area of step 1 and 2 pump stations should respectively
be 333 square meters and 500 square meters.
4.10 Environment impact assessment for transmission line
4.10.1 Environment impact of 35kV construction transmission line
According to the project design, primary circuit of 35kV construction transmission
line is new Dou-Neng Line, with a length of lOkm and leading of LGJ-185 adopted,
and secondary circuit of that is 35kV Xu-Neng branch line, with a length of 7km and
leading of LGJ-185 adopted. The line routes are shown in Fig. 6 for details. The two
circuits are all across over Xin-Chang railway and Ning-Hang expressway, and
through forestry.
There are 91 tower foundations of the 35kV construction transmission line, which will
occupy about 8.65 mu land area (accounting to 5770m2), that is all in the forestry area.
4-41



It is scheduled that 3400 trees will be felled along the line, about 200 trees every
kilometer, which is according to the experience of the institute. That will not have
forest system ecological impact along the line.
According to Document No. 18 (Environment Protection Administrative Laws for
Electromagnetic Radiation) issued by State Environment Protection Bureau, the
electromagnetic radiation of 35kV transmission facility is in exemption range. The
transmission facility designed according to the station specifications for 35kV
transmission facility will have a less electromagnetic environment impact and not
have unfavorable impact on people health and inference radio.
The transmission line will cross over the railway and expressway according to the
relative state specifications, and enough space will be in vertical and to ground in
crossing. It will not have impact on railway and expressway transportation.
No house removal and resettlement will be for the construction of 35kV transmission
facility. The compensation for the forestry land occupied by tower foundation will be
paid according to the relative state specifications.
The tower type and foundation shall be designed property in crossing forestry land so
as to reduce excavation and destroy on vegetation. The temporary occupied land shall
be restored as original one after the completion of construction in order to protect
ecological environment.
4.10.2 Environment impact assessment for 500kV transmission line
(1) Impact on ecological environment
The line will be designed with 45 tower foundations, which will occupy about 4.05
mu land area (accounting to 2700m 2) that is in forestry area.
According to design requirements, the line and intersection points are selected in
taking full account of peripheral topographic, geologic, hydrographic and wood
conditions so as to minimum the excavation and wood cutting quantity. During
selection of pole and towers, the high-low legs are used as much as possible. The rock
foundation and high-low foundation is taken use as much as possible according to
topographic and geologic conditions so as to reduce the excavation quantity and
destroy on forestry.
According to the design requirement, those trees along the transmission line were not
be allowed to fell: if the distance between the line and the earth were equal or more
than 7.5m, or if the natural height of which were less than 2m, or if the vertical
distances between the line and trees were not less than 7m, and if all tall natural trees
were in the valley. All prescription and limitation restrict felling along the
transmission line, and it is farthest protection to the artificial trees and vertex. It's
4-42



estimated that 1260 trees will be felled, which is counted according to the experience
of the institute, 200 trees every kilometer. It's less amount compared to the total
amount along the line, and that will not have system ecological impact to the forestry
along the line. Since the 500kV-
transmission line is in the forest, it did not change the status of the land use and their
attribution except the tower bases and less amount of felled trees.
The mountain paths and spare land shall be taken use as the temporary sites for the
construction of tower foundations so as to reduce excavation quantity. After
completion of the construction, the temporary construction facilities and dust shall be
moved and the vegetation shall be restored so as to reduce impact on environment.
The construction shall be carried out in way of civilization and specification. If
excavated earth-rock is piled near the tower foundation, it shall be retained by wall or
surrounded by straw bags so as to prevent "Slope Rolling" or random disposal and
reduce the water and soil loss. The drainage ditches or pipes shall be designed, the
exposed excavating faces shall be designed with protection slope and retaining wall,
and greensward shall be planted on the back-fill earth after the completion of the
construction in order to prevent landslide and failure.
(2) Impact on radio station and communication line
Yixing TV Transmission Station is a secondary station, located at Tongguan mountain
peak, about lkm away from the nearest transmission line. The antenna of Yixing
transmission station was 66m high and is mainly used to rebroadcast and transmit TV
and frequency modulation (FM) program. The antenna has been moved 38m to the
southwest and raised to lOOm high for the project construction now.
According to "Design Specifications of High-voltage Transmission Line Impact on
Radio Station (DL/T5040-95)", the protection distance from 500kV overhead line to
TV secondary station is 500m. By analysis of electromagnetic interference
characteristics, it shows that the transmission line would not have impact on
transmitting of TV and FM broadcast during operation and failure. Thus the
transmission line will not have impact on secondary tower of Yixing TV Transmission
Station.
At Tongguan Mountain peak, there is Yixing 173 Microwave Station, which is
belonged to Yixing Post-office. According to "Design Specifications of High-voltage
Transmission Line Impact on Radio Station (DL/T5040-95)", the protection distance
from 500kV overhead line to microwave station is 700m. Then the 500kV overhead
line is about 1.3km away from the nearest transmission line. It meets requirements of
the protection distance and the line will not have impact on 173 microwave station.
According to design information, the line will not be parallel to or crossing the major
4-43



communication line and not have unfavorable impact on the communication optical
fiber cable. Thus this transmission line will not affect the communication line.
There is no any radio facility within 2km range of line route and no any interference
on radio will be.
(3) Electromagnetic environment impact
The line is designed with two circuits at a same tower. The electromagnetic field will
be designed according to state design specifications and meet requirements of state
design specifications. Meanwhile, the line is away from active regions of village and
people, and electromagnetic field will not have unfavorable impact on people.

5. Analysis of Scheme
5.1 Alternative Schemes
5.1.1 Schemes in Analysis
In order to meet the requirements of future peak regulation capacity of Jiangsu power
system the following 2 schemes with same capacity and energy yield are proposed in
combination with features of energy sources of Jiangsu Province and in consideration of
the possibility of realization of peak regulation scheme;
Scheme 1: building Yixing Pumped Storage Power Project, installed capacity OOOMW
Scheme 2: building coal-fired generators sets
5.1.2 Scheme Comparison
5.1.2.1 Economic comparison
In this comparison a calculation approach on basis of least present value of total project
cost is adopted and the total present value of annual cost for each scheme is shown in
Table 5-1.
Present Value of Total Cost for Each Scheme
Table 5-1                                               Unit: 104 Yuan RMB
Scheme               Scheme 1                 Scheme 2
Present value of total cost   736111                  797504
It is seen from the above table that the present value of total cost for scheme 1 (Yixing
Pumped Storage Power Project) is the lower than that for scheme 2 (coal-fired generators
sets).
5.1.2.2 Comparison of environmental impact
(1) Impact on the environmental air quality
The thermnal power plant (coal-fired generators), which can meet peak-regulation
requirements of power system at a same extent as the Yixing Pumped Storage Power
Project, is used as alternative scheme in comparison with this project. The relative fuel
consumption in year 2010 for 2 schemes is shown in Table 5-2.
Comparison of Fuel Consumption
Table 5-2                                                    Unit: 104 t

On the basis of main pollutant quantity discharged from 1 ton burning coal for boiler
specified in "China Environmental Protection Guidance" (established by National Defense
University Publishing house in Dec. 1994) and relative fuel consumption for 2 schemes,
the pollutant discharge amount is shown in Table 5-3.
Pollutant Discharge Amount for Each Scheme
Table 5-3

Sulfur dioxide (SO2)     16.0(S*)           233(S*)          456(S*)
Note: S* means the sulfur content (%) of the coal.
It is seen from Table 5-3 the air pollutant discharge quantity of Yixing Pumped Storage
Power Project is only a half as compared with that of the coal-fired units with the same
capacity and it has the lowest impact on environmental air quality.
(2) Impact on regional water environment
During the operation of a thermnal plant, it will discharge warm water, buck and waste
water (including acid-base water, waste water with oil, washing water from coal delivering
system, waste water from acid-washing boiler, waste water from cooling tower, sanitary
waste from staff, etc.). The waste discharge quantity is large and has great impact on the
regional water environment.
In order to have clear energy, Yixing Pumped Storage Power Project will not discharge
any wastewater except the sanitary waste from staff. The power energy required for the
pumped storage station is from the redundant power in the power grid during lower load
or damped down by thermal plant before, and no any wastewater discharge quantity will
be increased in the original thermal system. It will have less impact on the regional water
environment.
According to the relative coal consumption amount of the schemes, it is estimated that 695
tons of ash water and 57 million tons of warm discharge water yearly from a middle scale
peak-regulation power plant will be reduced after operation of the Yixing Project. And it
will reduce the 'green house' environment impact from the discharge warm water.
(3) Impact on regional acoustical environment
During the operation of thermal plants, the generators, discharging gas of boiler, coal mills,
draught fans, forced draught blowers, transfer stations for delivering coal, and cooling
water towers will have certain noise, which will have great impact on the regional
5-2



acoustical environment.
During the operations of pumped storage station, the noise source is mainly from
generators. Yixing Pumped Storage Project has an underground powerhouse, which will
not have noise impact on the regional acoustical environment.
(4) Impact on ecological environment
In general, the area occupied by a thermal plant with a same peak regulation capacity will
be less than that of Yixing Pumped Storage Project. The thermal plant will be built at a
smooth area along a river and the occupied land sort is simple. It will have less impact on
the terrestrial ecological environment than that of Yixing Pumped Storage Project.
But after completion of Yixing Pumped Storage Project, it will not have production waste
water and any impact on the aquatic ecological environment. During the operation of a
thermal plant, it will discharge a great quantity of warm water, buck and waste water, and
has great impact on the regional aquatic water environment with a long term.
(5) Impact of solid waste
After completion of Yixing Pumped Storage Power Project, it will not discharge any solid
waste except the sanitary waste from staff and have less impact on the environment. The
coal waste quantity of a thermal plant with same peak regulation capacity will be 41900
t/year, which will cause a serious of environmental problems such as coal waste piling be
raised.
(6) Brief Summary of the Environment Impact
According to the analysis on the environment air quality, regional water, acoustic,
ecological environment, and solid spoil, it's obvious that the positive impact of the scheme
of the Yixing project compared with the scheme of the same scale power plant. It is
reasonable to build the Yixing Pumped Storage Power Project from the environment
viewpoint.
5.1.2.3 Comparison of peak regulation capacity of system
On basis of the peak regulation capacity provided for the power system by the power
station of a same scale, the regulating capacity of Yixing Pumped Storage Power Project is
two times that of the single cycle gas turbine generators sets or two-shift start-shutdown
thermal generators sets 100% for peak regulating, and 4 times that of coal-fired thermal
generators set 50% for peak regulating. Hence the regulating capacity of scheme with
Yixing Pumped Storage Power Project is much better than that of other ones.
5.1.2.4 Comparison of dynamic benefit of power station
5-3



Pumped storage power station has a fast load increasing speed and a short operation mode
changeover time. Generally, the changeover time from full-load pumping to full-load
generating is less than 400s (6.7 min), and that in emergency is less than 220s (3.4 min).
The investigation shows that the load increasing speed of various coal-fired generators
sets in Jiangsu power system is 1-2% output/min, and the time from start of generator to
its full-load operation is several hours, which will be longer in case of cold start. For gas
turbine generators the time from start to full-load operation is 7-8 min. hence the dynamic
benefit of Yixing Pumped Storage Power Project is much remarkable.
5.1.3 Comprehensive Comparison
According to the above comparison of economy, environmental impact, peak-regulating
capacity and dynamic benefit of, different power stations, scheme of Yixing Pumped
Storage Power Project is proposed.
5.2 Comparison of Installed Capacity of Yixing Pumped Storage Power Project
In the feasibility study phase of Yixing Pumped Storage Power Project two comparison
schemes of installed capacity 1000MW (4 x 250 MW, with daily full-generation utilization
time: 4h) and 800MW (4 x 200 MW, with daily full-generation utilization time: 5h) were
compared in following aspects:
(1) In view of requirements on peak-regulation, improvement of system operation
conditions and improvement of operation reliability of system, for Yixing Pumped Storage
Power Project the 1OOOMW scheme is better than that of 800MW scheme.
(2) In view of economical indicators, the investment per kW for 1000MW scheme is lower
than that for 800MW scheme. Calculated on basis of meeting the same quantity of
electricity, present value of total cost of 1OOOMW scheme is lower than that of 800MW
scheme. The coal consumption of OOOMW scheme is lower than that of 800MW scheme
by 45540 tons, which will greatly reduce discharge of pollutants and improve system's
economic benefit. According to economic analysis scheme of installed capacity 1OOOMW
for Yixing Pumped Storage Power Project is the optimal scheme, with the economic
comparison shown in Table 5-4.

(3) Due to the restriction in natural conditions and effective storage of upper reservoir, in
order to fully utilize the valuable energy source the installed capacity should be properly
increased and daily full-generation utilization time properly decreased. Hence 1000MW
installed capacity for Yixing Pumped Storage Power Project is reasonable.
On basis of power and energy balance of the power system, both 1000MW and 800MW
capacity of Yixing Pumped Storage Power Project can both fully regulate the peak and fill
the valley. However, the 1000MW scheme can supply peak capacity supplied 200MW
more than 800MW scheme in peak period, and absorb surplus 200MW more in valley load
period. This satisfies the requirement of peak-regulation of the Jiangsu power system to
the greatest extent. In consideration of the requirements of the power system, the existing
conditions of upper reservoir and the economic benefit, 1000MW scheme is selected for
Yixing Pumped Storage Power Project.

6. Economic Benefit and Loss Analysis for Environment Impact
6.1 Benefit
6.1.1 Social Benefit
(1) Improving power supply quality of electric system and releasing unbalance of supply
and demand
By end of 1998 the total installed capacity of Jiangsu power system was 16130MW, which
was entirely from thermal generators (with unit capacity 6000kW or more). The power
source is of a single structure and this system is merely a thermal power system. With
continuous fast economic development in Jiangsu Province, social energy consumption
constantly grows and the difference between peak load and valley load is continuously
widened, the power supply feature of system changes from entire lack-supply to
lack-supply during peak period. Currently, both the peak-regulating capacity and the idle
capacity in Jiangsu power system are provided by thermal power plants. However, they
have a much limited peak-regulating operations, especially during the valley period, they
can not run by banking fire, thus the fuel consumption of the system increases, the service
life of equipment shortens and fault ratio increases. This will not only result in serious
economic loss, but also is harmful to safe and economical operation of the power system.
Usually, the load requirement is unable to be satisfied and a high frequency occurs during
valley period.
After putting into operation, Yixing Pumped Storage Power Project will supply the system
OOOMW output for peak-load, which will greatly release the peak-regulating burden of
thermal power plants, correct the unstable frequency of the system to a certain extent.
Thus, it can function the condenser operation, spinning reserve and emergency reserve of
the system, eliminate the impact of fault on system and improve quality and reliability of
energy supply of the system.
(2) Facilitating execution of peak and valley price and promoting power tariff reformation
After putting into operation, Yixing Pumped Storage Power Project will absorb energy for
pumping during the valley period and supply power to the system in peak period. This
creates condition for establishing time-shared price for peak and valley energy, thus
turning the theoretical benefit of time-shared energy price to realizable economical
efficiency, and promote perfection of power management system of Jiangsu power system.
(3) Improving working condition and meeting the increasing domestic power demand
In order to reduce peak load and increase valley load Jiangsu power system had to regulate
product-shift system, by which the single-shift system or two-shift-system of plants was
6- I



changed to three-shift system. This regulation rendered the workers a certain of impact
and difficulty in family life, children education, care of the old, and health and generated
several unfavorable factors such as increase in enterprise's production cost, and municipal
traffic, etc..
After putting into operation of Yixing Pumped Storage Power Project some workers may
release from the disturbance by the three-shift system. Moreover, system's peak load
supply is enhanced and the supply reliability at daytime and night improved.
(4) The power station may become a new scenic spot of Yixing City and promote the
development of local tourism. It also creates employing condition for local inhabitants,
expands local labor market and promotes local social and economical development.
6.1.2 Economic Benefit
(1) According to investment estimate of power station, the unit static investment of Yixing
Pumped Storage Power Station is 4228 yuan RMB/kW, compared with that of coal-fired
thermal power plant, which may save construction investment about 494.86 million yuan
RMB.
(2) This station may bear 2000MW peak-valley difference, and offer the valley-filling
benefit that other types of power plants can not provide. Its putting into operation may
greatly reduce the peak-regulation amplitude of small thermal generators and save fuel
consumption of the entire system. According to the calculation, compared with scheme of
coal-fired generators set, this scheme may annually save standard coal 0.13945 million
tons, calculated at a price 350 yuan RMB/t coal, which may annually save 48.80 million
yuan RMB expenses on fuel consumption. Compared with other scheme of gas turbine
generators set, though this scheme annually increases standard coal consumption of
0.1457 million tons, it annually saves 0.1217 million tons of fuel oil, calculated at a price
1570 yuan RMB/t fuel oil, which may annually savel40.07 million yuan RMB expenses
on fuel.
(3) The running cost of power station is low. Compared with scheme of coal-fired
generators, this scheme may annually save running cost 130.17 million yuan RMB, and
compared with scheme of gas turbine generators set, save running cost 54.35 million yuan
RMB.
(4) This station will annually generate 1.491 billion kW.h electricity entirely serving the
peak load. After deduction of the service power and the lines loss, annual quantity of
electricity supplied by it to system is 1.461 billion kW.h. Calculated on basis of 0.832
yuan RMB/kW.h (inferred on basis of loan payback condition), its annual sales income
may be 1.21531 billion yuan RMB.
(5) Putting into operation of the station will reduce the loss resulted from interruption and
6-2



restriction of power supply, improve the running ratio of enterprises, increase social output
value and taxation, and save expenses for night-shift production. Thus the economic
benefit generated by it can not be neglected.
6.1.3 Environmental Benefit
The thermal power plant (coal-fired generators), which can meet peak-regulation
requirements of power system at a same extent as the Yixing Pumped Storage Power
Project, is used as alternative scheme in comparison with this project. The scheme with
this project may annually save standard coal 0.13945 million tons. Under the requisite of
meeting the same load demand and reserve load, the scheme with this project can save
coal consumption, by which discharge of waste gasses such as carbon monoxide,
hydrocarbon, nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide as well as the slag-ash will be reduced, and
the contamination resulted from transportation and warehousing of fuel and piling of slag
will be greatly eliminated. Meanwhile, the construction of Yixing Pumped Storage Project
will also reduce the long term impact on the regional water environment and aquatic
ecological environment caused by the discharging warm water, buck and waste water from
thermal plants, as well as noise impact on regional acoustical environment caused by
operation of thermal plants.
6.2 Environment Loss
6.2.1 Project Acquisition and Resettlement Loss
Immersion of forestry land and farmland by reservoir is an irreversible loss. The
compensation for acquisition and resettlement is 30.3532 million yuan RMB.
6.2.2 Environment Loss during Construction
During construction, temporary acquisition, excavation, spoils, and discharge of
wastewater from construction site will impact local environment in a short term. The
corresponding measures and management plan, including investment in environmental
protection e.g. environmental monitoring, may be considered as environment loss.
6.3 Brief Analysis of Economic Benefit and Loss
The analysis of above profit and loss shows that the environmental, social and economic
benefit of this project is much obvious and is much higher than the environmental
economic loss, as shown in Table 6-1.

(2) Monitor time and interval
The monitor period is decided 6 years for the time being from commencing construction
to completion of the project.
7- 9



Annually, monitor should be made for 4 times in wet, mean and dry season, of which 2
times should be made in peak construction period. For section-4,5,6,8 and 9, additional
two limes of monitoring should be made the day after the raining day.
(3) Monitor items and analysis method,
For section 4,5,6,8 and 9, the items specified in "Quality Standard of Living Drink Water
Source" (CJ3020-93) should be monitored.
The monitor items for other sections include PH, SS, petroleum, permanganate index,
COD, BOD5, total N, total P, fecal coliform bacteria and TNT.
The analysis method is same to that of water quality monitor during operation.
7.2.3 Noise Monitor Program during Construction
(1) The noise should be monitored in accordance with "Technical Specification of
Environment Monitoring" (Noise Part) issued by the State Environmental Protection
Administration.
(2) In the functional area 10 monitor points are arranged (2 points by construction highway,
3 points at along-road villages, 2 points in constructors' temporary living area, and each
one point at Yixing TV Transmission Station, Yixing 173 Microwave Station and
production area of concrete mixing system). The two traffic noise monitor points set by
the highway are also used to measure annual traffic volume.
(3) Monitor items include Ln, Ld, Lnd and SD.
(4) Interval
One time of monitoring should be made during preparation phase, and during construction
period mnonitoring should be made twice every year (including one time during peak
construction period). Each monitoring should be made for successive 24 hours.
7.2.4 Environmental Air Quality Monitor Program During Construction
(1) Sampling and analysis should be made in accordance with "Monitoring and Analysis
Method of Air and Waste Gasses" issued by State Environmental Protection
Administration.
(2) The monitor items include SO2, NO2, CO and TSP and routine meteorological
elements are also simultaneously observed.
(3) Arranging monitor point
7- 10



Each one monitoring point is arranged at constructors' temporary living area at the lower
reservoir area, and at area between site of Yixing TV Transmission Station and Yixing 173
Microwave Station at upper reservoir area.
(4) Monitor interval
Annually, 4 times of monitoring should be made (once every season), and during each
time monitoring should be continuously made for 6 days (effective duration: 5 days).
Every day 4 times of sampling should be made (Beijing time: 02:00 hour, 07:00 hour,
14:00 hour and 19:00 hour).
7.2.5 People's Health Monitor Program
During construction the diseases to prevent and treat mainly include water-borne
infectious diseases (dysentery, hepatitis and typhoid) and natural infectious-focus diseases
(malaria, pulmonary schistosomiasis, and filariasis) and the main diseases to control are
dysentery, hepatitis and malaria.
The constructors should be subject to health inspection before entering project area and
those with infectious disease should be cured before working and dwelling in this area.
The constructors and dining workers should be subject to regular health inspection and
preventive measures and inoculation.
The hygiene and environment management in living area and production area should be
strengthened and the transmission pests such as fly, mosquito, rat, roach, mite, flea and
louse should be regularly inspected and killed.
7.2.6 Soil and Water Loss Monitor Program

County, Zhejiang Province, with an installation capacity of 1800 MW. The lower reservoir
is at the middle reach of Daxi river, with a normal storage level of 344.5m and total
3.
storage capacity of 8.6 million m3, in which effective storage for power generation is
3
8.05m , with daily water level fluctuate of 43.60m during normal operation. The upper
reservoir is taking use of natural pond after excavation, with a normal storage level of
905.2m and total reservoir capacity of 8.92 million m3, in which effective storage for
power generation is 8.05m3, daily water level fluctuate of 29.43m during normal operation.
Basically, the upper reservoir has no natural runoff and the reservoir basin is designed
with bitumen concrete impervious face.
The earlier stage work for Tianhuangping Station was started in June 1992 and the first
unit was put into operation in Sept. 1998. The dynamic pumping was started on July 23,
1998 from the dead storage level of 863.Om to the high storage level, and the water level
of the upper reservoir was up to 890.02m on Sept. 5.
In order to master the impact of bitumen impervious face on the water quality, the water
quality of the upper reservoir was monitored by Zhejiang Province Research and
Measurement Institute during initial impounding, with the monitoring items of polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons and benzene, etc. The monitoring times were Oct. 28, Nov. 28 and
Dec. 28, 1998, and sampling was at time when the station stopped operating. The
monitoring results basically reflect the water quality with the reservoir body under static
immersion.
The monitoring results show that no polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and benzene was
found in three times of monitoring, and it shows that the bitumen impervious face has less
impact on the water quality.

Predication of Non- continuous Pollutants in Reservoir
1. Water quality model
For predicting the concentration variation trend of the reservoir water after replenishment
the complete-mixing attenuation model recommended in "Technical Guidelines for
Environmental Impact Assessment"   ( HJ/T 2.1 - 2.3-93 ) issued by the State
Environmental Protection Administration is used, with the calculation formula as follow:
W+c,Q,, +( Ch   WO+CQ       exp(Kt)
Under equilibrium state:
(wo + CpQp
VKh
K  =Qh+    K1
V   86400
Where:
c-       pollutant concentration in the reservoir at time t, mg/L;
Qp       diversion flow rate, m3/s;
cp       pollutant concentration in the diversion water, mg/L;
Qh       outflow rate from reservoir, m3/s;
Ch -     pollutant background concentration in the reservoir water (at time
t=0 concentration of outflow water =0), mg/L;
W    o-  current pollutant inflow rate to the reservoir, g/s:
V-       effective capacity of the reservoir, m3;
K1 -     degradation coefficient of pollutants in the reservoir, l/d;
t        time span from the estimated time to the diversion time, s.
2. Determination of parameters
cp is the mean concentration of Tuanjiu Lake measured in 1997. CODw is 5. 10mg/L
and BOD5 is 2.80mg/L;
Qp is calculated on basis of maximum monthly replenishment 0.15 million tons, i.e.
Qp=0.0579m3/s.
The current pollutant inflow flow rate to the lower reservoir Wo is estimated on basis of
the observation data on 1998 by correlation method. The mean annual runoff in this
watershed is 1.2877 million m3 (from 1967 to 1997) and the water quality of Huiwu
Reservoir measured on June 9, 2000, CODmn is estimated 0.053g/s and BOD5, 0.082g/s.
9- 2



The total water storage of the upper and lower reservoir is 5.962 million m3:
k,  is generally taken as 0.01 - 0.10(1/d), and as 0.01(1/d) on for the
most-unfavorable case.
Ch is same to the initial concentration Cp.
Qh is taken as the estimated mean outflow rate of lower reservoir from 1967 to 1997:
Qh = 0.0168 m3/s.

Predication of Continuous Pollutants in Reservoir
1. Pattern of water quality
For predicting the concentration variation in some sustainable pollutants (such as heavy
metals) of reservoir water after replenishment the complete-mixing decay pattern
recommended in "Technical Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment"  (HJ/T
2.1-2.3-93)issued by the State Environmental Protection Administration is used, with the
calculation formula as follow:
wO+ +              o+C 
c   =     Q   +   h c   -        JCPQ  exp  Qh -tJ
Qh       QC ¶h                k    v}
Under equilibrium state:  c = (W0 + cPQP)IQh
Where:
C      pollutant concentration r away from the pollution source at time t, mg/L;
Qp-diversion flow rate, m3/s;
cp -pollutant concentration in the diversion water, mg/L;
Q/, outflow rate of reservoir, m3/s;
Ch-    pollutant background concentration in the reservoir water (at time t=0
concentration of outflow water), mg/L;
WO- current pollutant in-flow rate of the reservoir, g/s;
t - time span from the estimated time to the diversion time, s;
___                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~3
V      effective capacity of the reservoir, m
2. Determination of parameters
The background pollutant concentration cp: total is the mean concentration of each
pollutant in 1997, (since the total Cr concentration in 1997 is zero, in consideration of the
unfavorable case, the mean Cr concentration in 1996 is used.) i.e., total As concentration is
0.011 mg/L, total Cr, 0.002mg/L, total Pb, 0.009 mg/L, total Cd, 0.002mgfL.
The pollutant concentration in the diversion cp is the mean concentration of pollutants in
1997.
The total storage v.of upper and lower reservoir is 5.962 million cubic meters.
The diversion inflow rate Qp and outflow rate Qh are based on the inferred hydrological
series values from 1967 to 1997, as shown in Table 9-2.
The current pollutant inflow rate of upper and lower reservoir is estimated on basis of both
the inferred hydrological series values from 1967 to 1997 and the measured water quality.

environmental protection, it agrees to have the construction according to planned
alternative.
2. The following works shall be carried out well for the next stage construction:
(1)   Make out the environmental protection measures and compile monitoring
management planning during the construction period in detail, make sure of the
environmental protection cost, and surely implement each environmental protection
measure proposed in the Report.
(2) Strengthen the ecological protection and implement the soil and water conservation
planning well. According to the characteristic of soil and water loss for each stage
during the construction period, necessary measures and biological prevention
measures shall be adopted for the spoil area, quarry, construction site, the
construction area for water pipe line of the water supply works, and auxiliary road.
The vegetation within project scope shall be up to 50% after completion of the
project and be restored to over 80% after 3-5 years operation of the station.
(3) Strictly control the environmental pollution during the construction and operation
period. Five sewage and waste water collection and treatment systems shall be
completed in the project preparatory stage. To strengthen monitoring during
construction, and prevent impact on water source by waste water from TNT blasting.
The measures of relocation, controlling blast type, reasonably arranging working
10- 1



time, etc. shall be adopted for preventing impact caused by noise, construction
excavation, flying stone from blasting and vibration on Yixing TV station, 173
microwave station and other sensing objects.
3. In the project construction, it shall strictly carry out the "Three Synchronism"
management system, i.e. design, construction and putting into operation of
environmental protection facilities in synchronism with that of main project. After
completion of the project, the construction unit shall apply for environmental
protection accepting according to the relative procedure. The project can only be put
into operation after its' quality accepted.
4. Jiangsu Provincial Environmental Protection Bureau and Wuxi City Environmental
Protection Bureau are required to be responsible for the monitoring and checking

Appendix 3:
Assessment Report of Impact on Terrestrial Plant and Wild Animal
by Yixing Pumped Storage Project
Yixing Pumped Storage Project is located at the suburban of Yixing City,  where is under
the jurisdiction of Environmental Science Institute and Forestry Farm of the city. Based on
the census survey of wild animal of Jiangsu province in 1998, the specie of wild animal
has: Breast-feed specie-wild boar, wildcat, hedgehog, yellow weasel, squirrel, pangolin,
hare and bat; Birds specie- oriole, wild duck, pigeon, magpie, bamboo partridge, domestic
swallow, tit, windflower, owl, sparrow and pheasant; Amphibious specie - frog, creek frog,
toad and newt; Crawl species- tortoise, turtle, cabrite, red-chain snake, cauliflower snake,
grass snake, yellow snake, dark snake, water snake, pallas pit viper, bamboo-leaf-green
snake(Trimeresurus gramineus). In which, the pangolin and newt is of Grade-I1 national
protection wild animal. There is distribution on the history, but not discovered in the
survey. (The detailed information is stored in the Agricultural Department of Jiangsu
Province.) For the rest, they are not belonging to the national protection wild animal.
There is no breeding area of wild animal in the forestry farm of the project site.
The vegetation at the upper reservoir and rounding area of Yixing Pumped Storage Project
is mainly for pine forest (mason pine, dark pine and foreign pine) spreading some Mao
bamboo forests. The vegetation at the lower reservoir and rounding area is of pine forest,
China fir forest (China fir, wetland pine, pond China fir) and tea garden. Our technical
people do not discover the treasure and rare or national key-protective wild plant in the
scope of forestry center for a long time. Moreover, the construction of power station
occupies only 0.78%(600000mu) of gross area of forestry center. Therefore, the impact
from the construction of Yixing Pumped Storage Project to wild animal for Yixing City is
very tiny.

Appendix 4:
Assessment Ikeport of Impact on Aquatic Wild Animal
by Yixing Pumped Storage Project
The construction of Yixing Pumped Storage Project is mainly at the mountainous area.
The main aquatic wild animal in Yixing area is of silver carp, bream, crucian, grass carp
and black carp, etc. There is no national-grade aquatic wild animal here, so that there is no
impact by the construction of Yixing Pumped Storage Project to aquatic wild animal for
Yixing City.
