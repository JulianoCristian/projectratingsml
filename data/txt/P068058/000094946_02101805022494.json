"The Yixing Pumped Storage Power Project,\n            entails water resources development, consisting of two\n            reservoirs, an underground power generating/pumping station,\n            designed to sustain power during daily periods of high\n            electricity demand, and installation of 35 KV transmission\n            lines to connect to power grids. Construction of dams for\n            both reservoirs, and of power pump facilities and\n            substations, will cause not only the need for resettlement\n            (discussed separately in the Resettlement Action Plan), but\n            forest, and vegetation degradation, and soil erosion\n            resulting from land leveling and blasting practices, in\n            addition to ecological adversity in, and around the vicinity\n            of construction sites, affected by water and air pollution.\n            Mitigation measures during construction call for: adequate\n            waste management practices for both liquid, and solid\n            wastes; dust and emissions control will be enforced\n            preventing noxious pollutant substances; daylight working\n            schedules will be established to minimize noise\n            disturbances; sanitization of the reservoirs will be\n            conducted, in particular, vegetation removal will take\n            place, to be restored once construction is complete. During\n            project operation, to control adequate aquatic life, screens\n            will be installed at the intake water pumping station;\n            reservoirs will be enclosed, and protected from the public\n            as a safety measure."}, "docdt": "2002-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
