This resettlement action plan\n            (RAP) identifies those project affected people (PAP), as\n            those persons who have a property title, interest in\n            structures, land, or any other asset; or persons who use the\n            structures, land or assets as described above; or persons\n            whose business, occupation, work, residence or habitat will\n            be adversely affected; or, persons whose standard of living\n            is adversely affected as a result of land acquisition. Based\n            on consultations with PAPs, and following an assessment on\n            statistical population data and socioeconomic conditions,\n            the RAP sets the compensation framework as follows.\n            Compensation for loss of houses, buildings or structures,\n            will be paid at replacement costs; losses concerning crops,\n            will be paid based on seasonal output values - no\n            compensation will be paid for crops timely harvested, while\n            lost crops, liable to be replanted will be compensated based\n            on crop fees, and lost seedlings compensated at reasonable\n            market prices; cultivated land will be compensated based on\n            the mean output value of the three years preceding land\n            appropriation, based on a threshold of up to 18,000 yuan per\n            hectare; woodland compensation will be paid at six times the\n            mean output value of cultivated trees of the last three\n            years prior to appropriation; land compensation will be at\n            replacement values; and, temporary losses will be\n            compensated based on market output values.
