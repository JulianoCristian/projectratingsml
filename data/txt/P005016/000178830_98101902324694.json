to determine the feasibility of producing\n            during the first stage up to 3.5 million and ultimately up\n            to 7 million tons of beneficiated rock per year through long\n            wall and/or other mining techniques. (ii) Carrying out the\n            necessary laboratory testing to verify the suitability of\n            the New Valley phosphate rock to manufacture phosphoric acid\n            and other phosphate fertilizer intermediates and carry out\n            pilot tests for the purpose of establishing design data for\n            the full scale beneficiation and phosphoric acid plants;\n            (iii) undertaking further studies of the location and of the\n            capital and operating costs of the full scale phosphoric\n            acid plant, including the required infrastructure with\n            respect to the railway and its operating procedures as well\n            as the port facilities; and (iv) should experience gained\n            from the operation of the experimental mine and the results\n            of the various studies confirm the economic, financial and\n            technical feasibility of converting New Valley phosphate\n            rock into phosphoric acid or other phosphate intermediates,\n            preparation of the necessary feasibility study for the first\n            stage of the project."}, "docdt": "1979-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
