7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The development objective of the project is to increase the productivity of the Honduran private sector,
thereby improving Honduras' competitiveness. The immediate objective of the project is to improve
Honduras investment climate and its local firms' capacity to export in order to prepare Honduras to take
advantage of trade opportunities under existing and new Trade Promotion Agreements.

Original Outcome Indicator in PAD: "Improvement in Honduras' ranking in the World Economic Forum's
Competitiveness list, from 75th (in 2003) to 65th (in 2008). This improvement should be driven mainly by
an improvement in Microeconomic Competitiveness ranking (Business Environment and Companies
Performance), for which the goal is that Honduras should move from 78th (in 2003) to 65th (in 2008). (The
Macroeconomic Index, which is the second determinant o f the overall Competitiveness Ranking and is
outside the scope of this project, is also expected to improve based on the Government's planned
macroeconomic reforms.) As agreed at the Project Concept Document Review Meeting, after the ICA
study is completed, this indicator will be replaced by a figure (from the ICA study) that is easier to monitor
and more directly related to the interventions financed under the project."

Current Outcome Indicator: As noted in the March 2009 2nd order restructuring Project Paper, the PDO
indicator was replaced by Honduras' ranking in the Ease of Doing Business index. This change was
considered a refinement of the original outcome indicator, rather than a material change to it, given the
temporary nature of the original indicator noted in the PAD.


7b. Revised Project Development Objectives/Outcomes [if applicable]

This restructuring would eliminate the current Ease of Doing Business outcome indicator.

                                       Proposed Changes

a. What are the proposed changes, as applicable, in the project's development
   objectives, outcomes, design, and/or scope?

There would be no changes to the project's development objectives (PDOs), outcomes,
design, or scope. However, the current PDO indicator would be eliminated based on the
following considerations:
    ·   The 2003 Project Appraisal Document only defined a temporary PDO indicator
        that was to be replaced after the Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) for
        Honduras was completed. This temporary indicator was never included in the
        Development Credit Agreement or Project Agreement1.
    ·   No adequate indicators from the ICA were identified, so the temporary indicator
        was substituted for the Doing Business ranking, as noted in the March 2009
        restructuring Project Paper.
    ·   Recent experience within the FPD network suggests that using Doing Business
        rankings to evaluate project performance can be problematic, since, among other
        things, they are too dependent on the exogenous performance of other countries.
    ·   No other country-level indicators are available that have a direct causal link to the
        project given its relatively small size (US$28 million) and broad scope (a wide
        range of disparate competitiveness activities). Indicators considered but discarded
        include gross capital formation, exports, foreign direct investment, and various
        competitiveness rankings and perceptions from the Global Competitiveness
        Report (World Economic Forum). These indicators will be useful to get an overall
        sense of the country's progress in the Implementation Completion and Results
        Report (ICR), but they cannot be directly linked to the project interventions.
With the elimination of the Doing Business PDO indicator, the project will be evaluated
based on the performance of the component indicators that are currently included in the
Project Agreement.

B.1, B.3, C.3, D.3, D.4(a), E.1, E.3, and F.1 of the Project. For the rest of the Project, the

If, yes, please explain:

The extension would allow programmed activities of the Credit to be completed. The
activities were delayed as a consequence of the events following the June 28, 2009
removal of the President of Honduras. The Project Implementation Unit has prepared an
action plan, calendar, and monitoring indicators for the completion of activities by end-
December 2010.
