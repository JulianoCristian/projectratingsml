"The objective of the Trade Facilitation\n            and Productivity Enhancement Project for Honduras is to\n            improve the Borrower's investment climate and local\n            firms' capacity to export in order to prepare the\n            Borrower to benefit from trade opportunities under existing\n            and new trade promotion agreements. The project\n            restructuring aims at addressing some minor shortcomings in\n            the original project design, which were identified in a July\n            2006 midterm review and in two supervision missions in\n            October 2006 and April 2007. The corresponding adjustments\n            are expected to remove minor roadblocks to project\n            implementation. In particular, the restructuring includes,\n            first, small changes in the set of activities to be financed\n            within certain components. These changes are aimed at\n            eliminating activities that are no longer viable or\n            necessary and to add others that are deemed critical to\n            generate the expected project outcomes and to facilitate the\n            achievement of the project's development objectives.\n            Second, the restructuring includes revisions in the\n            expenditure categories to be financed within existing\n            activities (e.g. adding the financing of minor works or\n            equipment in activities where only consultancies had been\n            included in the original budget). Changes are also proposed\n            in the overall maximum amounts to be financed within each\n            expenditure category.  Third, the restructuring also\n            includes changes in relevant definitions and loan covenants."}, "docdt": "2007-07-17T00:00:00Z"}
