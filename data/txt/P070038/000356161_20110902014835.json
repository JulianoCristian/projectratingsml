for Honduras were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory; the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate; the Bank's performance was\n            moderately satisfactory; and the Borrower's performance\n            was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: an overly complex design with too many components\n            and activities leads to a project that is difficult to\n            implement, supervise, and evaluate. A complex design also\n            makes it challenging to establish an overall objective that\n            is focused and near impossible to identify clear Project\n            Development Objective (PDO) indicators. Procurement\n            practices should be applied in a predictable way. Housing\n            the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) in an entity outside\n            of the government has both advantages and disadvantages. It\n            is important to design realistic sustainability mechanisms\n            for technology centers (CITEs) from the outset of the\n            project. Risks that buildings constructed with project\n            resources are used for purposes outside the scope of the\n            legal agreement need to be carefully managed."}, "docdt": "2011-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
