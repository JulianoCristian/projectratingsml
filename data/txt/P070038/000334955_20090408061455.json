The\n            changes make more explicit and clarify the financing of\n            works that were envisaged in the previous restructuring of\n            July 17, 2007. Specifically, the construction of the\n            national metrology laboratory will be added to a\n            sub-component and the construction of a technology center\n            will be made more explicit in another sub-component. This\n            project paper also describes all of the works being financed\n            by the Project, given that previous amendments have expanded\n            the number of works from what was originally foreseen in the\n            project appraisal document (PAD). Finally, some adjustments\n            are made to the output indicators. A reallocation of loan\n            proceeds and partial extension of the project closing date\n            are being processed separately in line with Bank guidelines."}, "docdt": "2009-03-03T00:00:00Z"}
