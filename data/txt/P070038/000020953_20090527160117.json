The immediate objective of the\n            project is to improve Honduras' investment climate and\n            local firms' capacity to export in order to prepare\n            Honduras to take advantage of trade opportunities under\n            existing and new Trade Promotion Agreements. The objective\n            of the Environmental Assessment Report and Environmental\n            Management Plan is to present based on an analysis of\n            various aspects of environmental issues, an analysis of\n            potential environmental impacts and the measures required\n            for ensuring environmental sustainability of investments.

Activities likely\n            to generate environmental and social impacts include:\n            Selection of areas for the location of the workshops or work\n            areas for materials or hazardous substances; Excessive use\n            of chemicals to improve productivity; Transport and storage\n            of raw materials to the workshop or work area."}, "docdt": "2008-04-01T00:00:00Z"}
