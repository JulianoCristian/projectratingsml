This improvement should be driven mainly by\n            an improvement in microeconomic competitiveness ranking\n            (business environment and companies' performance), for\n            which the goal is that Honduras should move from 78th (in\n            2003) to 65th (in 2008). The macroeconomic index; which is\n            the second determinant of the overall competitiveness\n            ranking and is outside the scope of this project, is also\n            expected to improve based on the Government's planned\n            macroeconomic reforms. The extension will allow programmed\n            activities of the credit to be completed. The activities\n            were delayed as a consequence of the events following the\n            June 28, 2009 removal of the President of Honduras. The\n            project implementation unit has prepared an action plan,\n            calendar, and monitoring indicators for the completion of\n            activities by end-December 2010."}, "docdt": "2010-03-24T00:00:00Z"}
