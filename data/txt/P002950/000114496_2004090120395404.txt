     Re:  SIDA Grant Related to Credit Number 1934-UG
          (First Health Project)
          Second Amendment
Dear Minister:
     We refer to: (a) the SIDA Grant Agreement for the above -
referenced Project dated April 25, 1989, between the Republic of
Uganda (the Recipient) and the International Development Association
as Administrator (the Administrator) of Grant Funds provided by the
Swedish International Development Authority (SIDA) whereby the
Administrator agreed to extend to the Recipient a grant in the
amount of up to three million eight hundred thousand Swedish Kroner
(SEK 3,800,000); and (b) to the exchange of letters between the
Administrator and the Recipient dated September 12, 1990 and October
4, 1990, respectively, whereby the amount of the Grant was increased
from SEK 3,800,000 to SEK 25,800,000.
     Since through a further exchange of letters between SIDA and
the Administrator, SIDA has increased the amount of the Grant by an
additional SEK 9 million, we propose to further amend the SIDA Grant
Agreement by deleting the words "twenty-five million eight hundred
thousand Swedish Kronor (SEK 25,800,000) in paragraph (c) of the
Preamble and in Section 2.01 of the SIDA Grant Agreement, and
substituting therefor the words "thirty-four million eight hundred
thousand Swedish Kronor (SEK 34,800,000)".
     Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing proposed
amendment of the SIDA Grant Agreement by signing, dating and
returning the enclosed copy of this letter to us, at which time the
proposed amendment shall constitute a binding agreement between the
Recipient and  the Administrator.
                                   Very truly yours,
                                   INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT

                                   as Administrator of Grant

                                   Provided by the
                                   SWEDISH INTERNATIONAL
                                   DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
