selected health\n            care facilities and build a hospital in Rakai district; (b)\n            to promote health status through strengthening preventive\n            health programs; and (c) to improve the internal efficiency\n            as well as the long-term effectiveness of health care\n            delivery. Regarding the rehabilitation program, the project\n            will carry out essential rehabilitation activities so that\n            key services, water and electrical supplies and sewage\n            systems, are reestablished. It will also provide essential\n            equipment and upgrade staff quarters. Regarding health\n            education, the project will finance a multi-disciplinary\n            health education program. The project will also provide for\n            the development of programs in counselling and patient\n            management for AIDS-infected people and their families.\n            Regarding long-term sustainability, the project will develop\n            skills and capabilities in planning, monitoring and\n            evaluation, strengthen management capability in the health\n            sector and study alternative schemes for financing the\n            health sector."}, "docdt": "1988-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
