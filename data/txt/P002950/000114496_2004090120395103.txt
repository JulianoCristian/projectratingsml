          Re:  SIDA Grant Related to Credit Number 1934-UG -
               Amendment
               (First Health Project)
Dear Mr. Minister:
     We refer to the SIDA Grant Agreement for the above-referenced
Project dated April 25, 1989, between the Republic of Uganda (the
Recipient) and the International Development Association as
Administrator (the Administrator) of Grant Funds provided by the
Swedish International Development Authority (SIDA) "whereby the
Administrator agreed to extend to the Recipient a grant in the
amount of up to three million eight hundred thousand Swedish kronor
(SKr 3,800,000).
     We also refer to an exchange of letters between SIDA and the
Administrator whereby SIDA agreed to increase the SIDA Grant by a
supplemental amount of twenty-two million Swedish Kronor (SKr
22,000,000) to assist the Recipient in the implementation of the
above-referenced Project.
     We, therefore, propose to amend the SIDA Grant Agreement by
deleting the words "three million eight hundred thousand Swedish
Kronor (SKr 3,800,000)" in paragraph (c) of the Preamble and in
Section 2.01 of the SIDA Grant Agreement, and substituting therefor
the words "twenty five million, eight hundred thousand Swedish
Kronor (SKr 25,800,000)".
               Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing
proposed amendment by signing, dating and returning the enclosed
copy of this letter to us, at which time the proposed amendment
shall constitute a binding agreement between the Recipient and the
Administrator.
                         Very truly yours,
                         INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
                         As Administrator of Grant Funds
