                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project closes on June 15, 2011 and all contractual works are now complete (one last contract is in its final stages of implementation), with the installed infrastructure being taken

                         over by the Council for Development and Reconstruction (CDR). Approximately US$3 million is likely to remain uncommitted as of June 15, 2011. There is now a full-time Director
                         General at the Beka'a Regional Water Establishment (BRWE), who is making efforts to increase target subscription rates. Albeit this, the Project continues to seriously lag in this
                         regard, and more strenuous efforts will need to be made to increase subscriptions. It is also expected that the additional Technical Support Unit (TSU) specialists hired in November
                         2010, will assist the Director General in strengthening utility operations.
