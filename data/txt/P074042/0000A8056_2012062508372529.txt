                         Physical connections to the water network amount to 25,664, close to 95 percent coverage within the Baalbeck-Nabi Chit project area. Accordingly, a majority of project recipients are
                         receiving water supply on a consistent basis as per project design. However, subscriptions to the network have lagged significantly behind physical connections and as such the
                         water utility continues to lack the income needed for autonomous operation.

                         After long delays, the construction works for the diversion of untreated wastewater towards the Iaat WWTP are now complete and the site visit confirmed that influent flows have
                         reached 8,000 m3/day. Household connections have reached only 50% of the target, so wastewater volumes will continue to grow with the connection program. The treatment plant
                         is operating effectively (achieving BOD removals in line with national and international standards). Financing of the operation and maintenance (O&M) contract, which would ensure
                         that the treatment plant, and associated water distribution and sewerage collection networks continue to be operated efficiently past the Loan closing date, has to date not been
                         secured.

                         The Beka’a Regional Water Establishment (BRWE) lacks adequate numbers of trained staff, one major reason that the institutional strengthening goal has not been met. However,
                         they are in the process of recruiting and training 102 permanent employees through the Council for Public Service, and have hired a service provider to make available contractors on
                         an as needed basis. This is considered a highly positive step which, in the medium term, will increase BRWE’s capacity to operate, maintain and manage its operations.
