Borrower              The Socialist Republic of Vietnam
Implementing          The State Bank of Vietnam
Agency
Financing Data        SDR 99.3 million (US$150.0 million equivalent). Standard IDA terms for
                      blend countries: 35 year maturity with a 10-year grace period.
Operation Type        A Ninth Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC 9), as the fourth
                      operation in a cycle aimed at implementing Vietnam's Socio-Economic
                      Development Plan (SEDP) 2006-2010, approved in June 2006.
Main Policy Areas     The present operation provides continuing support to Vietnam's reform
                      program. The current cycle of PRSCs is a vehicle for the World Bank, and
                      the international partner community more broadly, to support a country
                      that is emerging from the effects of the global financial crisis and has a
                      track record of economic growth and poverty reduction. It also recognizes
                      the government's efforts to pursue and deepen reforms.
                      The proposed operation comprises policy actions in areas such as state-
                      owned enterprise reform, financial sector reform, public financial
                      management, the social sectors, natural resources management, public
                      administration and legal development. This comprehensive program, with
                      the same broad coverage as the SEDP 2006-2010, provides the foundation
                      for sustained growth, social inclusion, environmental sustainability and
                      improved governance.
                      The preparation of the proposed operation, like previous operations in this
                      cycle, has helped improve the content of strategically important policy
                      actions, to ensure the timeliness of their adoption, and to monitor the
                      impact of the overall program on broader development outcomes. This
                      support is all the more important given that this could be the last cycle of
                      general budget support operations on concessional terms, hence providing
                      an exceptional window for high-level policy access in a country that is not
                      aid-dependent.
Key Outcome           Outcome indicators were identified at the beginning of this PRSC cycle,
Indicators            together with targets for 2011, in the Program Document for PRSC 6
                      approved by the Board in June 2007. The indicators cover the four pillars
                      of the program (economic, social, environmental and institutional). A
                      mid-term evaluation of progress towards attaining the objectives was
                      completed during the preparation of this operation.
Program               The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) submitted to the Board in January
Development           2007 concluded that the SEDP of the government incorporated the
Objectives and        necessary poverty reduction principles, was broadly sound and was a plan
Contribution to CAS   that could both deliver growth and reduce poverty. The CPS defines the


                                                i
                 PRSC as one of the modalities to support the implementation of SEDP.
                 The Program Document for PRSC 6 charts the second cycle of PRSC
                 operations (PRSCs 6-10). The CPS allocates US$ 150 million to each of
                 the PRSCs in this cycle. In practice, the amount for PRSC 6 was US$ 175
                 million, PRSC 7 was US$150 million, and PRSC 8 was US$ 350 million,
                 approved under the Fast Track Facility in 2009. The PRSC 8 amount was
                 increased in response to the government's request to support the fiscal
                 stimulus package. The CPS Progress Report was prepared and presented
                 to the Board in December 2009.
Risks and Risk   The risk of macroeconomic turbulence, especially those related to balance
Mitigation       of payments and debt sustainability, continues to exist. If the authorities
                 do not succeed in convincing the market of their determination to pursue
                 macroeconomic stability, inflation pressure may continue, and along with
                 it, the downward pressure on the dong. On the other hand, if the market
                 becomes exuberant about Vietnam's potential, it could reignite large
                 capital inflows causing the economy to overheat again. The authorities are
                 aware of the risks and are monitoring developments in the economy. The
                 Bank is engaged with the government in on-going discussion on both
                 informal and formal basis, jointly with the IMF. An ongoing technical
                 assistance project helps strengthen capacity for managing public finance
                 and debt. The dialogue carried out through PRSC series seeks to enhance
                 the quality and effectiveness of financial sector regulation and supervision,
                 and to enhance information disclosure.
                 Probably a higher risk is that the pace of reforms will slow because of the
                 leadership's preoccupation with maintaining macroeconomic stability and
                 with the Party Congress in 2011, a major political event in the country.
                 The aim of this operation is to keep the momentum for the medium-term
                 reform agenda. State sector reform is tackled from several different
                 angles to this effect, including the recommendation to ensure transparency
                 and competition when the state equitizes its assets, and separating the
                 exercising of state ownership rights from the regulator function. Reforms
                 in advancing gender equality, including female participation in elected
                 bodies were also pursued in this operation.
                 The longer term risk is that Vietnam will fail to address governance issues
                 in a systematic and fundamental way. Accountability, especially
                 downwards, access to information, checks and balances are challenges for
                 all countries at varying levels, and Vietnam needs to continue decisively
                 down the path on which it has embarked. As the Vietnam Development
                 Report 2010 Modern Institutions has shown, improving governance
                 requires increasing transparency at various levels. This area receives
                 special attention in the proposed operation, including actions to improve
                 transparency in public administration, informing the public of court
                 judgments, and strengthening the audits of government operations.

                              IDA PROGRAM DOCUMENT FOR A
              PROPOSED NINTH POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT CREDIT
                        TO THE SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF VIETNAM


                                     I.      INTRODUCTION


1.      Emerging from massive poverty at the launching of Doi Moi in 1986, Vietnam is now on the
verge of becoming a middle-income country. There was a noticeable acceleration, starting around
2001, in the government's drive towards relying on market mechanisms, building a multi-stakeholder
economy and further integrating with the region and the world. Over these years, comprehensive
economic reforms have led to rapid economic growth and remarkable progress on poverty reduction
and other development outcomes. The share of the population living below the poverty line fell by
nearly half; from 28.9 percent in 2002 to only 14.5 percent by 2008. Many of the remaining poor are
from disadvantaged groups (e.g. ethnic minorities) or live in more isolated regions. Attaining middle-
income status is seen as more than a threshold level of GDP per capita, but as a way to emphasize the
need for a set of modern institutions. It entails further financial deepening to support capital
mobilization, the regulation of access to and pricing of infrastructure services, the gradual
development of modern social insurance, more effective tools for environmental protection, legal and
judiciary reforms, and the effective governance, among others. The Socio-Economic Development
Plan (SEDP) 2006-20101 approved in June 2006, articulates this vision.
2.      The proposed credit is the fourth in a five-year cycle aimed at supporting the implementation
of the SEDP. This cycle follows the first one of five operations (PRSCs 1-5). Poverty Reduction
Support Credits are well-suited to address the challenges mentioned above. The cross-cutting nature
of the policy dialogue they support strengthens coordination among line ministries and government
agencies. Their emphasis on a selected number of policy actions facilitates an in-depth discussion of
their content. The annual programming is demanding, but provides the government with predictability
for planning purposes, and also helps maintain the reform momentum.
3.      The PRSCs are designed to be forward-looking. The negotiation of each PRSC operation
includes an agreement on a list of policy measures that will, in principle, be supported by the
following operation. These policy measures, or "triggers," are based on the SEDP 2006-2010 as well
as other key documents and strategies, and are considered to have strategic importance to attain the
SEDP objectives. The ten or so triggers included in each operation are not conditions. It is
understood that some triggers may not be fully met while others may be exceeded. In addition to the
"triggers," the policy dialogue conducted under PRSCs addresses a broader set of issues, articulated as
"benchmarks." These benchmarks are reported for the purpose of conveying the scope of the reforms
being implemented, and are not conditions.
4.        The two PRSC cycles have served as a platform for aid coordination. The PRSCs 6-8 had 10-
11 co-financiers and more development partners participating in policy dialogue areas where they
have comparative advantage. The proposed operation is expected to have 9 co-financiers; some of the
co-financiers have started to phase out their aid program, as Vietnam moves out of the low-income
country status; some donors experienced changes in policy orientations in their capitals. A. single
policy matrix is used by all participating partners. Indeed, the relatively large number of benchmarks
is justified by the committed participation in the PRSC process of close to two dozen government
ministries and agencies and more than a dozen development partners.

5.      As this PRSC cycle draws close to the end, the Government of Vietnam and development
partners have approached the World Bank to discuss possible successor operations to PRSC. The
form of such operations is still under discussion, but one possibility is an overarching instrument,
which is focused on macroeconomic and a few cross-cutting issues, accompanied with more in-depth
sectoral development policy operations, which would drill down to second generation reforms. A
preparatory study is currently underway for this purpose. The World Bank is committed to providing
assistance in a broad spectrum of areas, including social sectors, even as the country joins the ranks of
middle-income countries. Studies of other countries' experiences and in-depth analysis of debt
management and sustainability are currently conducted jointly with the government so as to find the
best partnership strategy for the country for the coming years.

RECENT ECONOMIC TRENDS
6.      Global crisis and its effects. The 2008-09 global financial crisis led to a slowdown of
economic growth in Vietnam. International commodity prices declined in the third quarter of 2008,
export orders for garments and other main industrial products collapsed in the fourth quarter, and a
slowdown in manufacturing became noticeable. The impact was acute in the first quarter of 2009,
when GDP increased only by 3.1 percent compared with the same period in 2008, more than 4
percentage points below the historic trend.
7.       The global financial crisis was the latest in a series of major external shocks. In late 2007 and
early 2008, in the aftermath of its accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), Vietnam was
confronted with massive capital inflows. Attempts to sterilize them were inadequate to prevent a
boom in banking credit, an acceleration of inflation, a ballooning trade deficit and asset price bubbles.
The bubbles were amplified by sizeable infrastructure investments by central and provincial
governments. The investment decisions of large state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and "Economic
Groups,"2 which took advantage of their access to finance to diversify into booming sectors,
contributed to fanning the flames. The impact of overheating was further aggravated by the surge in
the international prices of food and energy in early 2008.
8.      Government responses. The government responded to the overheating with a stabilization
package. In March 2008, it adopted the "eight groups of measures" to bring inflation down and reduce
the trade deficit. This package combined the tightening of banking credit, enhanced supervision of
vulnerable banks, postponement of non-urgent public investment projects, modest cuts in recurrent
government expenditures, and temporary interventions in international trade. The (unofficial)
crawling peg of the dong to the US dollar was not abandoned, but the floatation band was broadened.

          "Economic Groups" are groups of enterprises each with distinct legal status, which are bound together
through mutual investments, capital contribution, merger, acquisition, reorganization or other forms of
affiliation; share common long-term economic interests, technology, market and/or business services; and
constitute a consolidated business entity in which the enterprises are organized into two or more levels, as parent
companies and subsidiaries, as set forth in the Enterprise Law of 2005 and Decree 139 of September 5, 2007.

9.       In the fall of 2008, when the policy response was beginning to work, the government had to
change gear from stabilization to stimulus, as the effects of the global financial crisis on Vietnam
became evident. In November 2008, the "five groups of measures" aimed at supporting economic
activities were announced. This time, the package included cuts and deferrals in payments of
corporate and personal income tax as well as in value-added tax for small and medium enterprises. It
also included a small program of cash transfers to poor households for the occasion of the Lunar New
Year. Other measures followed in February 2009, including a short-term interest rate subsidy scheme
for working capital, which was de facto used to re-finance enterprise debts contracted on very onerous

                                                            3
terms during the stabilization period. This scheme turned out to be instrumental in keeping credit
flowing to the economy, and prevented financial distress in the corporate sector.

10.     Inflation, which peaked around the summer of 2008, had been declining steadily until the
summer of 2009. In the second half of 2009, however, the trends reversed (Figure 2) as the
expansionary monetary policy during the stimulus period has led to rapid credit growth, which reached
39.6 percent at end 2009 (Figure 3), above the target of 30 percent for 2009. Inflationary pressures
were one of the reasons for which market participants shifted their portfolio from dong-based to
foreign currency-based assets. Towards the end of 2009, the government shifted gears once again to
balance the stimulus and macroeconomic stability objectives.
11.     Since November 2009, the base rate was raised from 7 to 8 percent, the dong was devalued
twice by a total of approximately 9 percent, and the floatation band was narrowed from    5 percent to
  3 percent. The interest rate subsidy scheme for working capital was terminated in December 2009
as originally planned, further contributing to monetary policy tightening. The cap on lending rates in
dong for medium to long term borrowing was de facto removed, allowing flexible interest rates to

                                                  4
allocate resources better and to entice households to shift some of their assets from dollar-based to
dong-based assets, contributing to a smoother operation of the foreign exchange market.

12.      Economic Performance. For 2009, GDP growth was respectable 5.3 percent, helped in part by
the stimulus package. Growth in the last quarter of 2009 was particularly strong, reaching 6.9 percent
(year on year). Construction and services, two sectors buoyed by domestic demand, led the recovery,
while agriculture and manufacturing sectors still grew below the historic trend. The first has been
affected by unfavorable weather conditions in 2009 while the second was hit very hard by the effects
of the global financial crisis in the developed countries.
13.     Government Budget. The government's overall fiscal deficit is estimated to have been 8.9
percent of GDP in 2009, substantially above those of previous years, as the stimulus package came on
top of an already expansionary budget plan. In addition to the measures adopted to stimulate
economic activities, the fall in oil prices and the slowdown in economic activities have resulted in a
decline in the government revenue. This decline was partially offset in the second half of 2009, as
both international commodity prices and domestic economic activities became more buoyant.
14.     External sector. The external balance held up reasonably well during 2009 despite the global
crisis. Vietnamese exports declined by 8.9 percent in 2009 from 2008. The decline was less than in
most other developing countries, but made 2009 the first year with negative export growth since the
beginning of Vietnam's economic reforms in 1987. The decline would have been larger if the sizeable
gold exports of early 2009 were not included. An even more dramatic decline in imports, by 13.3
percent, succeeded in reducing the trade deficit. Despite the faster recovery of imports than exports in
the last months of 2009, and the decline in remittances from abroad, the current account deficit
decreased to 8.0 percent of GDP in 2009, down from 11.9 percent in 2008. FDI inflows are down, but
Official Development Assistance (ODA) increased in 2009, resulting in an estimated capital account
surplus of around 11.5 percent of GDP in 2009.
15.      Even though the capital account surplus was sufficient to cover the current account deficit,
international reserves appeared to have declined in 2009, reversing the recent trend of slow
accumulation. The increasing demand for foreign exchange by importers and the market expectations
of dong devaluation led to a shortage of foreign exchange, which was particularly severe in May-July
2009, and again in November. Economic Groups were among the entities holding on to their foreign

                                                   5
currency earnings. The uncertainty regarding the level of international reserves also encouraged a
precautionary demand for and hoarding of gold and hard currency. These developments resulted in
depreciation pressures on the exchange rate, with the dong trading at the weaker end of the floatation
band for an extended period, and the spread between interbank and parallel exchange rates widening to
between 3 and more than 10 percent at various times (Figure 1).

16.      The Banking Sector. The banking sector was adversely affected by the succession of asset
price bubbles, monetary tightening and growth slowdown. The real estate bubble of end-2007 and its
subsequent bursting in early 2008 made it difficult for several commercial banks to recover their loans;
the rapid disinflation in late 2008, at a time when interest rates were still very high, substantially
increased the debt service burden faced by enterprises because of the rapid rise in real interest rates.
During the stabilization phase of late 2007-early 2008, the SBV upgraded its supervision efforts, and
in parallel, raised minimum capital requirements. By the end of 2008 all commercial banks, including
the nine small joint stock banks that seemed most vulnerable, had met the new requirements. This
process continues, with the minimum charter capital set at 3 trillion dong (about $150 million at
today's exchange rate) by end 2010. All banks need to submit plans on how they will meet this target
no later than June 2010. Banks which fail to meet this requirement will be forced to merge with other
larger banks, or will have their business licenses revoked.

17.      The fraction of bad debt (calculated based on days in arrears) for the banking sector was on
the rise until mid-2009 (generally a few percentage points), but has started to decline more recently.
Non Performing Loans (NPLs), calculated using international standards based on borrower risks,
would be at a much higher level (2-3 times higher), but are not known with certainty. In the absence
of the interest subsidy scheme, rapidly changing inflation and interest rates combined with weak
orders due to the global financial crisis would have resulted in an even more substantial deterioration
of bank portfolios. The increase in bad loans came after an overall improvement in the quality of
lending as a result of several years of efforts by the State-owned Commercial Banks (SOCBs) to clean
their portfolios in preparation for equitization. The recent reversal of this trend of increasing bad loans
suggests that the gradual recovery of economic activities is helping enterprises cope with their
financial obligations.
18.     Poverty Reduction. Poverty has fallen rapidly in Vietnam, from 58.1 percent of the population
in 1993, to 28.9 percent in 2002, and only 14.5 percent by 2008, the last year for which comparable
poverty estimates are available.3 (Figure 4) Inequality remains low, although poverty has become
increasingly concentrated in rural areas and among certain social groups (viz. ethnic minority
populations). There are growing concerns about poverty and living conditions in Vietnam's cities and
peri-urban areas due to high rates of urban population growth (including a heavy influx of migrant
workers), excess demand for urban services, and a continuing rise in the cost of living. Urban poverty
is back on the development agenda. Regional differentials also continue to be important. Poverty
levels vary substantially across regions. Poverty headcounts are highest in the mountainous and more
isolated Northwest region, as well as in the North East and the Central Highlands. All regions have
witnessed progress in recent years (Figure 5) although disparities remain.

19.      Progress at reducing poverty has been more difficult in the last several years. Inflation rose
rapidly throughout the first half of 2008, with food prices reaching a peak by mid-year before
stabilization measures were put in place. The construction sector was hard-hit by the credit squeeze in

        Poverty data are based on the Vietnam Living Standards Surveys (VLSS) of 1993 and 1998, and on the

2002, 2004, 2006, and 2008.

the middle of 2008 and agriculture suffered a series of shocks. The most recent poverty estimates for
Vietnam reflect the situation in 2008 but not more recent impacts of the global financial crisis.
Although the 2008 VHLSS shows continued progress at reducing poverty, it was at a somewhat
slower rate than earlier periods: the poverty headcount fell by around 1 percentage point each year
between 2006 and 2008, compared to 2-3 percentage points a year in earlier periods (VHLSS 2002,
2004, 2006).

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
20.      The outlook for 2010 is challenging. The stimulus program, while succeeding in encouraging
economic activities, has also contributed to increased external vulnerability during 2009.
Expansionary monetary and fiscal policies contributed to the return of a large current account deficit,
although smaller than that in 2008. Critical macroeconomic information such as the real size of the
stimulus package and international reserves were not made clear in a timely manner, which added to
uncertainty and exacerbated the foreign exchange shortage by inducing preemptive hard currency
hoarding. As the world economy recovers, the government has adopted tighter monetary and fiscal
policies commensurate with the available financing. The government also needs to redouble its efforts
in communicating and demonstrating its determination to pursue macroeconomic stability to the public
in general, and market participants in particular, in order to avoid the situation where inadequate
information breeds anxiety.
21.     External Sector. The Balance of Payments will continue to be a challenge for the authorities
in 2010. The trade deficit has been on a widening trend again since mid-2009. While medium to long
term capital inflows are expected to cover the current account deficit, it is also important to reverse the
apparent trend of declining international reserves. Devaluations and administrative efforts undertaken
by the authorities since December 2009 to ease the excess demand for foreign currency and gold, such
as instructing SOEs to render foreign currency holdings into the banking system, and tightening
supervision of gold trading, it is necessary to address the underlying causes of the excess demand for
foreign exchange. In this respect, the recent decision to allow negotiated interest rates for dong-


                                                    8
denominated medium and long-term loans was an important step in easing the foreign exchange
market pressure. The parallel exchange market rate is now within the official trading band, and the
dong appreciated by 0.28 percent in April. While the market interest rates prevailing today may be too
high to be conducive to nurturing the economic recovery, the authorities need to tread carefully among
the competing objectives of economic growth and stability. If the market sentiment swings in the
other direction and capital inflows accelerate, adequate sterilization will become necessary, as will
stepped up monitoring and management of systemic risks arising from short-term inflows and
exposure to exchange rate risks.
22.     Inflation. The inflationary pressure appears to be subsiding. The effects of devaluation, the
6.8 percent increase on average of the price of electricity in March 2010, and the 12.3 percent increase
in minimum wage and civil service salaries wages, effective May 1, 2010 have all worked their way
through, and in April the consumer price index recorded the lowest monthly growth since the
beginning of the year..
23.      Government Budget. The budget plan for 2010, which translates into a projected overall fiscal
deficit of 5.9 percent, entails a substantial contraction compared to 2009, but still expansionary
compared to previous years. The government is expected to reduce the deficit to pre-crisis levels by
2013 (Table 2). The deficit is expected to be financed with a combination of bond issuance, including
the proceeds of a sovereign bond offering of $1 billion completed early 2010, and increased ODA. At
the Consultative Group meeting held in December 2009, development partners pledged over $8 billion
(including both loans and grants), a sharp increase from $5 billion in the previous year. Even with the
caveat that the pledged figures do not directly translate into disbursements within the calendar year,
the ODA funds are expected to help finance the budget deficit. In the past, the government has not
monetized unfunded expenditure, preferring to adjust capital spending (including on-lending to lower
levels of government) when financing fell short of expectations.
24.     Debt. Vietnam's debt is likely to stay sustainable if the current economic recovery continues
and the authorities revert to the fiscal deficit of 3-4 percent in the next three years as expected.
Preliminary results of the debt sustainability analysis currently underway indicate that the public
sector debt was estimated to be 49 percent of GDP at the end of 2009, two-thirds of which (31 percent
of GDP) was owed to external creditors. Under the baseline scenario, this ratio was projected to
increase to just above 50 percent of GDP in the second half of this decade before starting to decline
again in the next decade. The large fiscal deficits in 2009 and 2010 do not affect the overall debt
sustainability significantly, as long as the government reverts to the pre-crisis levels of deficit in a few
years.
25.      Even with the recent borrowings on less concessional terms, nearly two-thirds of Vietnam's
debt is contracted on highly concessional terms. The ratio of debt service to exports is projected to
remain at or below 5 percent until 2013. The stress tests for the current exercise are not yet completed,
but the basic picture has not changed from the previous exercise conducted in 2009. The two main
risks to debt sustainability are likely to continue to be a one-time nominal depreciation of the dong of
30 percent and an increase in debt-creating flows by 10 percentage points of GDP. Both scenarios are
unlikely.
26.       The largest source of uncertainty and hence, unquantifiable risk comes from implicit
obligations that are not captured under public and publicly-guaranteed debt statistics. Contingent
liabilities might arise from off-budget statutory funds such as health insurance fund, large SOEs, or the
banking sector.       However, a clear definition and a reliable estimate of such liabilities are not
available, which limits the government's ability to manage associated risks.



      III.    THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM AND PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES

                                                     9
27.     The Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP) 2006-2010 emphasizes development
outcomes and the policy reforms needed to achieve them, unlike previous five-year plans, which
focused on quantitative targets. It relies on data analysis rather than administrative reporting to
substantiate its diagnostics and recommendations. It also led to the adoption of a framework to
monitor progress towards realizing development outcomes. The process through which the SEDP was
prepared was more encompassing than in the past. Extensive consultations were held, going beyond
the boundaries of government, and involving businesses, grassroots communities, overseas
Vietnamese and development partners (Box 1).
28.      In the SEDP, the government sets out intended actions that fall broadly into four main pillars:
(a) the promotion of growth and transition to a market economy; (b) reducing poverty and ensuring
social inclusion; (c) managing the environment and natural resources in a sustainable manner; and (d)
building institutions that can support the strategy. The first three pillars are explicitly listed in the
SEDP, whereas the fourth one is introduced in the monitoring and evaluation framework as the
foundation to make progress on the other three.
29.      Development partners have chosen to align their efforts behind the SEDP a testimony to the
strong ownership of the reform program by the government of Vietnam. The alignment also reflects
satisfaction with the process through which the SEDP was prepared. At the same time, development
partners recognize that some of the reforms will be challenging. The SEDP represents a sustainable
development strategy only if macroeconomic management remains prudent. Moreover, the list of
policy reforms considered by the SEDP is remarkably broad, which necessitates prioritization and
sequencing. There is consensus that supporting the reform agenda of Vietnam does not entail favoring
one of the SEDP pillars over others. But it requires being selective within each of the pillars, and
paying attention to the content of the most important measures. This is seen as a critically important
time for engagement by the international community. Vietnam's ability to sustain its remarkable
growth trajectory over decades to come, and eventually become an industrialized country, may be
determined during the next few years. The reforms associated with sustaining growth beyond middle-
income status are more complex than those needed to graduate from a low income country. Active
engagement should contribute to improving the content and coherence of such reforms.



    Box 1. Participatory Process for the Government's Socio-Economic Development Plan 2006-2010

The SEDP 2006-2010, a milestone in the modernization of planning in Vietnam, presented an outline of
policy measures needed for Vietnam to advance to middle-income status by the end of the decade and
marked a clear break with past five-year plans. Previously, all national plans were prepared directly from the
top down approach and on the socialist premise that the government was in full control over the delivery of
goods and services with a long list of wishful production targets, with consultation processes which involved
only government agencies, and with self-reporting instead of any genuine assessment of results. In contrast, the
SEDP 2006-2010 set the framework for government action and resource allocation which is much more focused
on attaining development outcomes. The SEDP framework was widely consulted with stakeholders outside
government, from grassroots communities to the overseas Vietnamese. Also, for the first time, the SEDP ­ as
the government's primary planning document -- was used as a basis for guiding and allocating ODA.

The preparation SEDP 2006-2010 was built on the experience with the Comprehensive Poverty Reduction
and Growth Strategy (CPRGS). )Several initiatives were undertaken since the late 1990s to support modern
planning processes. In June 2001, given the shortcomings of both traditional five-year plans and targeted
poverty reduction programs, the Minister of Planning and Investment (MPI) was given the responsibility to
produce a broader document, addressing poverty issues in a comprehensive way. The content of this document
represented an important step toward genuine analysis and assessment. Instead of relying on administrative
records, the document combined high-quality quantitative and qualitative data into the discussion. This led to a
better coverage of sensitive issues, i.e., the challenge of addressing ethnic minority poverty and the problems

                                                      10
faced by urban migrants in accessing basic services. The document shifted from the description of inputs and
the setting of targets towards the statement of development objectives. As part of this process, the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs) were localized. There were also efforts to connect policy actions and resource
allocation, with a rudimentary "costing" exercise for the VDGs. CPRGS, which provided the foundation for the
first series of PRSC operations in Vietnam, was approved in May 2002, covering a three-year period.

The process leading to the preparation of the SEDP 2006-2010 had important strengths. There was a
serious effort to collect inputs from different groups of the Vietnamese society. In addition to internal
discussions within government, consultation workshops were held with local officials, groups of academics, the
domestic business sector, international and local non-governmental organizations (NGOs), people living with
disabilities (PWD), overseas Vietnamese, women and women's groups, and donors. A series of participatory
research exercises involving local experts and international NGOs also helped to gather feedback from poor
communities in 17 sites across the country. The draft SEDP was declassified for the first time ever. It was
discussed by the National Assembly (NA) in November 2005, a departure from previous practice of deferring its
discussion after the Party Congress. This innovation gave representatives more inputs into the content of the
document than in previous planning cycles. There was also a second round of consultations within government
and with donors and NGOs following the first discussion at the NA.

With the support of the NGO Resource Center, civil society organizations participated actively in the
organization of consultations for the preparation of SEDP. NGOs were also actively involved in the analytical
work underlying this series of credits, with their contribution focusing on infrastructure (especially in the
relation to the needs of PWD), the social sectors and legal development. Substantive inputs were provided on
the interpretation of the key development issues in each area, the identification of the main strengths and
weaknesses of the government's strategy to address those issues, the prioritization of policy actions within the
SEDP framework, and the selection of the most appropriate outcome indicators to measure progress in each
area.

A well-functioning mechanism has also been in place in Vietnam to conduct consultations with business
associations and the private sector. Prior to both the year-end Consultative Group (CG) meeting between
government and donors and the informal mid-year CG meeting, the Vietnam Business Forum (VBF) gathers to
discuss the issues of concern to a range of chambers and associations representing the interests of enterprises.
The discussion is organized around topics such as investment promotion, transparency, tax, labor, and land. In
each of these areas, a list of main concerns is assembled, and the focus is on assessing progress towards solving
them. Many of those concerns are addressed through policy actions supported by the PRSC process.



30.      In addition to the ten-year Socio-Economic Development Strategy 2001-2010 and the five-
year SEDP 2001-2006, other important policy developments have influenced the reform agenda. By
mid-2003, the government decided to aim for a rapid accession to the WTO. In late 2003, a new anti-
corruption strategy started to emerge, with the emphasis shifting from punitive measures to increased
transparency and the strengthening of the systems through which the government operates. The new
comprehensive anti-corruption strategy was adopted in May 2009, setting out preventive, demand-side
solutions and monitoring mechanisms. The year 2004 saw the coming into effect of the new Budget
Law, which makes the National Assembly and People's Councils at all levels responsible for resource
appropriations. A reform road map was adopted in 2006 to prepare the banking sector for
liberalization in compliance with Vietnam's WTO commitments. The roadmap included revisions of
the SBV Law and Credit Institution Law, as well as preparation of Bank Supervision Law and Deposit
Insurance Law.

LINK TO CPS
31.     The CPS submitted in January 2007 concluded that the SEDP had incorporated the necessary
poverty reduction principles, was broadly sound and was a plan that could both deliver growth and
reduce poverty. The CPS defined the PRSC as one of the modalities to support the implementation of
SEDP. The Program Document for PRSC 6, submitted to the Board in June 2007, charted the second
cycle of PRSC operations (PRSCs 6-10). The CPS allocated US$150 million to each of the PRSCs in
the second cycle. In practice, however, the amount for PRSC 6 was increased to US$175 million.
PRSC 7 was presented to the Board in June 2008 for the amount of US$150 million. The amount for
PRSC 8 was increased to $350 million using the Fast Track Facility, in order to respond to the
government's request to help finance the stimulus package. The amount of credit the CPS allocates to
PRSC 9 is also US$150 million.
COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS
32.     The International Monetary Fund has not had a program in Vietnam since the Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility expired in April 2004. However, the IMF remains fully committed to
continuing an effective partnership with the government of Vietnam. It maintains a regular policy
dialogue through Article IV consultations, interim staff visits, and its resident representative office in
Hanoi, and seeks to build capacity through training activities for the officials in Vietnam and abroad.
It supplements this dialogue with technical assistance (TA) in areas of its expertise. The IMF and the
World Bank continue to collaborate closely in Vietnam to ensure harmonized dialogue with the
government of Vietnam.
33.      The PRSC operations serve as an aid harmonization device, supported by a large number of
development partners. The PRSCs have been co-financed by bilateral and multilateral agencies, either
through grants or parallel lending (Table 3). More importantly, the process saw a transition in the role
of co-financiers, from providers of finance to partners engaged in the preparation of the operations and
the policy dialogue with the government. This dialogue is organized by policy areas, in which
development partners engage selectively, based on their interests and technical capacity on the ground.
The PRSC framework also serves as a coordination device for TA provided by development partners,
and the TA in turn provides valuable inputs to the policy dialogue.
34.      The volume of resources mobilized so far is significant. About US$2.4 billion have been
committed in budget support over the first eight PRSC operations. Of this amount, some US$2.2
billion have already been disbursed, with the rest to follow before June 2010 (Table 4). Over the ten
PRSC operations, some US$3 billion could be channeled to Vietnam. However, when compared with
the national budget, the PRSC operations amount to less than 2 percent of public expenditures, which
means that Vietnam is not aid-dependent, and chooses to engage in dialogue with the donors for the
knowledge and expertise brought to the table. This fact raises the bar for the policy dialogue, giving
prominence to its analytical underpinnings.

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS
35.    The CPS is organized around the four pillars of the SEDP, with the policy dialogue to help
implement Vietnamese reform program. The PRSCs are the apex of policy dialogue, while sector
development policy operations (DPOs) delve deeper into sector-specific dialogue. High-level actions

                                                            13
fall under PRSC, and more detailed ones are treated under sectoral DPOs. A program comprising
investment lending, analytical work, and technical assistance supports implementation at the sectoral
level. There is a strong complementarity between the different components of this program. The
overall direction of the policy dialogue is informed by the analytical work. Concrete policy measures
are often made possible by preparatory TA work. Investment credits also provide an opportunity to
pilot new initiatives and approaches, which are then scaled up through the policy dialogue. The
reforms supported by the latter, in turn, enhance the effectiveness of sectoral investments.
36.     Eight PRSC operations have supported the implementation of Vietnam's reform agenda so far.
PRSC 1, a two-tranche credit, was approved by the Board in June 2001. Its focus was mainly on the
structural reform agenda. The second tranche of PRSC 1 was released in December 2002. PRSC 2, a
one-tranche operation like all its successors, was approved in June 2003. This operation was aligned
with the Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy (CPRGS) of the Government, which
made it possible to broaden considerably the range of reforms supported. In addition to the mainly
structural aspects covered by PRSC 1, this second credit included various policy actions aimed at
keeping development inclusive and building modern governance. PRSCs 3 to 5 were approved in
June 2004, 2005 and 2006 respectively and had a broad sectoral coverage. The sixth PRSC, approved
in 2007, launched the second series in the program. The seventh and eighth PRSCs were approved in
June 2008 and June 2009 respectively. The operations in this second cycle added natural resource
management and the environment to the program.
37.      When there is a need for a more focused sector policy dialogue, sector DPOs complement the
PRSCs, as is the case with Program 135 Phase 2 Support (Cr 4580-VN), Higher Education
Development Policy Program (Cr 4604-VN), Public Investment Reform DPL (Loan Number 7838-
VN), and Power Sector Development Policy Operation (P115874). Some of the policy issues that
were originally included on the reform agenda at the beginning of this PRSC cycle are transferred to
sectoral DPOs once a strategic policy decision has been made. For example, Program 135 Phase 2
aims at community development in poor districts, whose habitants tend to be predominantly ethnic
minorities. This program is focused on reducing poverty at grassroots level, whereas PRSCs seek
strategic policy reforms that would have broader but perhaps more indirect impacts on poverty
reduction. Similarly, the separation of power transmission and generation assets and the regrouping of
transmission assets under a single National Power Transmission Corporation had been accomplished
under previous PRSCs, as had been the adoption of a pricing system for electricity from renewable
energy. Follow-up issues are now being addressed through the Power Sector DPOs. The First and
Second Higher Education Projects (Cr 4606-VN and P079665). The first sectoral DPL operation
complements the PRSC series by delivering a more comprehensive set of higher education reforms
than can be delivered through the multi-sectoral PRSC instrument, notably in the areas of governance,
financing, quality assurance and public financial management.
38.      Several of the ongoing or pipeline investment projects and AAA products are particularly
complementary to the PRSCs. In the financial sector, Financial Sector Modernization and Information
Management System Project (P088759) is focused on SBV capacity building. AAA work is
supporting SBV in revising regulations on loan-loss classification and provisioning and prudential
ratios (P117058) as well as working with MOF in looking options for making operations of policy
banks more effective (P118933). The program is also leveraged through IDF grants supporting
Development of Legal Foundation for Vietnam's Banking System (P104484) and Strengthening
Accounting Capacity of SOCBs (P104702) work hand-in-hand with the PRSCs' efforts to modernize
the central bank, increase disclosures of relevant financial information, and contribute to the
development of the financial sector in general.
39.    In the education sector, the Bank's lending operations and non-lending activities complement
the PRSC's focus on fundamental education strategy and policies in the areas of quality, equity and
accountability. Investment lending supports the development and implementation of standards-based
approaches to education delivery, especially to disadvantaged groups of children (Primary Teacher

                                                 14
Development Project (P051838)), Primary Education for Disadvantaged Children Project (P044803)
and School Education Quality Assurance Project (P091747)) and the exercise of autonomy (combined
with accountability) at higher levels of the education sector (First and Second Higher Education
Projects (Cr 4606-VN and P079665)). The first sectoral DPL operation complements the PRSC series
by delivering a more comprehensive set of higher education reforms than can be delivered through the
multi-sectoral PRSC instrument, notably in the areas of governance, financing, quality assurance and
public financial management.
40.      The lending program has been complemented with IBRD resources starting in FY2010 after
the Progress Report of the Country Partnership Strategy was approved by the Board of Executive
Directors in December 2009. The financing priorities for IDA and IBRD include energy, transport,
tertiary education, financial, water, urban, and health sectors. One IBRD-IDA blend and one IBRD
operations have been approved so far. These are the Power Sector Development Policy Operation
(P115874) and the Public Investment Reform DPL (Loan Number 7838-VN), as noted earlier.

LESSONS LEARNED
41.     One of the lessons learned from the previous operations is the need to have a comprehensive
approach to economic reform for several reasons. First, there are linkages between policy actions
across sectors, so that a piecemeal approach would end up being less effective. For instance,
improving the delivery of social services requires an appropriate balancing of government finances, in
addition to the understanding from the demand-side. Good public financial management is an
essential ingredient to improved results in health and education sectors. Another example is the inter-
linkages between the anti-corruption dialogue and improving business environment. As different
ministries and agencies are in charge of these agenda, PRSC's overarching framework is useful in
addressing the underlying issues holistically.
42.     Second, there are differences in the readiness of the leadership to embrace reforms in different
areas, with the window of opportunities difficult to predict. As a result, it is useful to accumulate
various technical building blocks necessary across the entire policy spectrum, so that ambitious
reforms can be supported without delay whenever the opportunity arises.
43.     Finally, the PRSCs serve as a framework for the interaction between the government and the
donor community. When coordinating the numerous donors with different interests and agenda,
excessive selectivity has proven impractical. In addition, it could also represent a lost opportunity, as
the large number of partners translates into a wider range of technical expertise than when IDA is
acting alone. Hence, the policy action matrix tends to contain large number of items at the beginning
of each operation. The policy action matrix narrows down somewhat over the course of preparing the
operations, as the dialogue evolves and the readiness of the government counterparts becomes clearer.

ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS
44.     The Vietnam Development Report (VDR) 2007, entitled Aiming High, provides the main
underpinnings for the current PRSC series. The preparation of this report was built on the analytical
work done over the first PRSC cycle, on structural reforms (as summarized in the VDR 2006, on
Business), institutional modernization (VDR 2005, on Governance) and on social inclusion (VDR
2004, on Poverty). The process was led by the World Bank with a large number of development
partners participating, several of them contributing extensive written inputs. Participants included the
co-financiers of the first PRSC series as well as other development partners not formally involved in
direct budget support, including the United Nations agencies and international non-governmental
organizations. A Reviewing Committee of recognized Vietnamese experts and policy-makers advised
on each of the policy areas and on the overall thrust of the report.
45.    A new series of VDRs goes more in depth into each of the four pillars of the SEDP 2006-
2010. The first volume in this series, the VDR 2008 on Social Protection, examines the challenges

                                                   15
remaining in relation to poverty alleviation, with a focus on the plight of ethnic minorities. While
representing only 14 percent of the Vietnamese population, ethnic minorities account for a large share
of the poor. Even though their poverty rates have been declining steadily in recent years, the gap with
the Kinh majority has not narrowed, and some ethnic groups remain especially deprived. The VDR
2008 also analyzes the structural shifts affecting the Vietnamese society, resulting from the
demographic transition and rural-to-urban migration, and the change in the nature of the shocks
experienced by Vietnamese households, from greater exposure to international fluctuations to the
growing importance of communicable diseases. These shifts and shocks have important implications
for the design of public policies and programs, supporting the development of more institutional social
protection mechanisms and the transition to a risk-based approach and demand-side financing in the
case of the health sector.
46.      The VDR 2009, Capital Matters, focuses on constraints to the mobilization of resources for
accumulation and on the efficiency of investments by both the public and the private sector. Some of
those constraints are common to many developing countries, whereas others are more specific to the
transition from planned to market economy. The report reviews the operation of the main channels
used to mobilize resources for investment in Vietnam, including tax revenues, bond issuance, equity,
and ODA. In the case of public investments, it identifies weaknesses in the selection, appraisal and
implementation of projects. Some of those weaknesses result from the different speed at which
decentralization, public financial management and environmental policies have progressed in recent
years. Special attention is devoted to state capital, and the potential risks created by weak corporate
governance in SOEs, conflicts of interest in the Government between ownership and regulation, and
the ability of large groups of SOEs to control financial institutions, thus undoing previous efforts to
harden the budget constraint.
47.      The policy dialogue in the energy sector is informed by extensive analytical work over the
past ten years. Recent analytical work includes support for the preparation and passing of the
Electricity Law (2004) and the Roadmap for Reform of the Electricity Sector (2006), Electricity
Licenses (2006 and 2007), Conceptual Design of Competitive Generation Market (2008) and
Framework for Thermal BOT Tenders (ongoing), Development of Market Rules for the Competitive
Generation Market (ongoing), Grid Code and Distribution Code and Metering Code (ongoing). Work
on restructuring of the electricity sector includes Restructuring the Power Transmission Business
(2005), Equitization of the Power Sector (2006), a policy note on Restructuring for the Competitive
Generation Market (2008). Pricing studies include on the Bulk Power, Distribution Margin, and Retail
Tariff Design study (2005), Retail Tariff Methodology (2008), Tariff Calculation Model (ongoing),
and Transmission Pricing Methodology (ongoing). The Bank has also reviewed energy plans and
planning processes, particularly Power Master Development Plan No.6 (2006) and the Gas Master
Plan for Southern Vietnam (2008). In addition, Vietnam Gas Sector Development Framework was
completed in 2010.
48.     Gender issues have been studied from various angles. Recent analytical work informing the
policy dialogue include Women Retirement Age Increase Gender Equity Dimension (2008), a study
funded by the World Bank and authored by the Institute of Labor, Science and Social Affairs
        4
(ILSSA) , and Socio-Economic Impacts of WTO Accession on Rural Women (2009) authored by
ILSSA, UNIFEM, and AUSAID.
49.     Forest and forest land management by communities and farmers in Vietnam have been a
subject of many studies. These studies include A Brief History of Forest Policy Work from the Field
                              5
(2002) by PROFOR Vietnam, Review of Policy and Implementation Framework for Decree 200

(2005) prepared by Forest Sector Support Program framework. This review was conducted for the
purpose of identifying and developing the main strategic issues that are critical for understanding the
impact of State Forestry Enterprise reform and its future direction. The Vietnam Land Policy
Stocktaking Study (2008) assessed the progress, consolidated lessons learned, identified knowledge
gaps, and defined areas where future work and policy dialogue could be usefully targeted. The report
finds that land issues are implicated in a variety of ways in Vietnam's ongoing and accelerating
economic and social transformation. The nature of rights to land, and the extent to which they are
perceived as secure and accessible, play key roles in shaping economic options and livelihood
strategies across all sectors of society. Land use policies and practices greatly influence the
availability of and access to land and the prospects for sustainable management of natural resources
and the environment. Land as a source of revenue is gaining increasing prominence in thinking about
public and private finances at all levels. A study titled Policy Note on Improving Land Acquisition
and Voluntary Land Conversion in Vietnam (P114036) was also conducted by the World Bank in
2009, focusing on reforming compensation procedures for land acquisition.
50.     Review and Analysis of the Pollution Impacts from Vietnamese Manufacturing Sectors (2008)
informs the policy dialogue on pollution control, although the proposed operation does not specifically
address the manufacturing sectors. The study was prepared by the World Bank team in partnership
with International Center for Environmental Management as well as the Ministry of Industry and
Trade (MOIT) and MONRE. An additional World Bank study on pollution issues in industrial estates
of the Dong Nai and Nhue-Day river basins is being completed at this time, as well as a review of
industrial development and environmental management (both are expected to be published in early
2010).
51.      The Water Sector Review (2008), prepared for the Office of the National Water Resources
Council on behalf of the Government of Vietnam, funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB),
informs the water sector dialogue. The coverage of the study includes the current status of water
resources and water-related environments, water supply and sanitation, flooding and natural hazards,
irrigation, aquaculture and fisheries, river basin management.
52.     The VDR 2011 on managing the natural resources in a sustainable way, the final report in the
cycle of five, is now under preparation, and is expected to be completed in December 2010.
53.     The VDR 2010, Modern Institutions, explores the devolution of power from the central
government apparatus to various institutions, including local governments, service delivery units, legal
and judiciary systems and institutions of oversight, the latter including entities as varied as the
National Assembly, mass media and official bodies investigative bodies. It analyses the mechanism of
accountability for these institutions. The focus of the report is the outcomes perceived by citizens and
private sector. It also profiles the governance module added to the 2008 Vietnam Household Living
Standards Survey (VHLSS). Several of the central themes of the VDR relate directly to the current
operation, especially the problem of access to information of all sorts, including basic government
documents, judicial decisions, etc. The need to strengthen the merit-orientation of the civil service
was highlighted, as was the imperative to strengthen the fight against corruption.
54.     A Public Expenditure Review/ Integrated Fiduciary Assessment (PER-IFA) and a Country
Fiduciary Accountability Assessment (CFAA) were carried out in 2005 and 2007, respectively. While
noting the progress made, they pointed out areas that are in need of further improvements. These
include the process of budget development, accessibility of financial information, and accounting and
auditing framework. These recommendations form the basis for policy dialogue conducted through
the PRSC series.


                              V.      THE PROPOSED OPERATION


                                                  17
OPERATION DESCRIPTION
55.      The proposed operation is important in keeping the momentum for the reforms set out in
SEDP, as the minds of the leadership are likely to be occupied with macroeconomic management to
mitigate the aftershocks of the global financial crisis and with the upcoming Party Congress, a major
political event of the country. It is also the last year of the current Socio-economic Development Plan
and SEDP when much strategic thinking about the future takes place along with the preparation for the
new 10 year strategy and the five year plan. The PRSC represents a well-established mechanism to
provide a coordinated technical advice from development partners. In addition, as the leadership
prepares for the Party Congress in 2011, this and the next PRSC operations provide a framework to
start thinking about the partnership modality beyond the current PRSC cycle.
56.      The medium-term policy matrix was developed at the beginning of this PRSC cycle (Annex
2). The development outcomes were also selected at the same time (Annex 3). The policy actions
included in the matrix are based on the SEDP 2006-2010 and other strategic documents and analytical
work. Some of the policy actions are adjusted as new issues arise, new studies become available, or
the original plan becomes no longer applicable. The policy reforms to be discussed in each PRSC are
chosen every year through a process involving sector teams at the World Bank and participating
development partners. Each year, the matrix starts from nearly 200 initial proposals in September to
about 50 policy actions for the official discussion with the government.
57.      Each year, the policy matrix contains two types of policy actions. The first type is "triggers,"
which are deemed to be more strategic, because of their potential impact on development outcomes
over time. These actions are selected during the previous PRSC operation, and are reported in the
minutes of the negotiations (PRSC 8 in this case, see Table 5). The "triggers" represent a collective
understanding of what measures need to be taken to address immediate concerns (for example,
revising regulations to better assess commercial banks' portfolio risks), and which medium-term
structural reforms should be tackled as priority (for example, strengthening competition, merit-
orientation, and transparency in public administration).
58.      In addition to the triggers, the policy matrix also contains additional reform actions undertaken
by the government. This broader set of actions, or "benchmarks," does not represent the use of
conditionality. It reflects the breadth and scope of the reforms being undertaken by the Government of
Vietnam, and is a way to engage in the substances of the reforms. By providing a more
comprehensive picture of developments in each policy area, this matrix allows a better understanding
of the progress being made in each of the four pillars of the reform program.
59.      The technical meetings are coordinated by the PRSC Coordination Unit at the SBV. The
Coordination Unit reports to the Steering Committee for the PRSC process, which is chaired by the
first Deputy Prime Minister. The Coordination Unit identifies the relevant line ministry or
government agency for each of the proposed policy actions. The technical meetings with those
ministries and agencies provide an opportunity to go into the specifics of each action, to comment on
draft policy documents, and to agree on a time frame for their completion. As a result of these
technical meetings, some measures are deemed completed, some may be consolidated, and others may
be postponed to the next operations. Pending issues regarding policy actions which are considered of
strategic importance (either in terms of content or timing) can be raised to the attention of the Steering
Committee.

POLICY AREAS
60.     The PRSCs 6-10 address four pillars of the SEDP, namely business development, social
inclusion, natural resource management, and modern governance, in a balanced way. The 11 triggers
chosen for the preparation of PRSC 9 are evenly distributed across the four pillars.


                                                   18
61.      Out of the 11 triggers, six were achieved fully. These are the regulations on commercial
banks, national targeted program for rural water supply and sanitation, conservation of water, internal
audit decree, civil service management, and procurement. Three triggers, education, state sector
reform, and health, are assessed to have been achieved partially. The education trigger has been
delayed, but cost estimates for full-day schooling have been produced, and consultations with
stakeholders have been initiated. The consultation process is expected to take a few months to
complete. The decree on improving corporate governance of State-owned Economic Groups was
issued, and the Law on Examination and Treatment was adopted. These two were a step in the right
direction, but left many issues to be addressed through the subsequent or lower-level legal documents
to be issued in the future. Two triggers, gender and access to information, were not met. The
establishment of gender equality indicators could not be completed in time, but is expected to be done
by the end of the year. The draft Law on Access to Information was not submitted to the National
Assembly as planned. Ministry of Justice attributed the delay to the government's deeming it
necessary to do more preparatory work to ensure swift implementation of the Law once it goes into
effect. Not enough information is available to ascertain that the delay is purely technical or if the
sensitivity of the issue made the leadership prefer to wait until after the Party Congress in 2011 to
move ahead. This issue will continue to be pursued in several ways, including high level dialogue and
preparatory work for implementation at technical level. More generally, the reforms which were not
achieved fully during this operation will be followed up in the next operation.

62.      The fact that not all triggers are on track is a reflection of 2009-2010 being difficult years. It
also reflects how ambitious these programs are: PRSC triggers are aimed high enough so that they are
challenging. The expectation has always been that not all triggers will be met fully, while others
might be exceeded. The performance under PRSC 9 is roughly comparable to PRSCs 7 and 8: PRSC
8 had 11 triggers of which 7 were fully met, two were partially met, and two were missed; PRSC 7 had
14 triggers, with 8 met, 5 partially met, and one missed. There were no triggers in PRSC 6, which was
the first operation in the cycle. In the first cycle, all 15 triggers were met in PRSC 5, whereas
performance was mixed under PRSC 4 (3 out of 15 triggers partially met) and PRSC 3 (1 out of 14
triggers was not met and 2 were partially met). There were no explicit triggers in PRSC 2.
63.      The task team's assessment is that the setbacks are delays rather than a waning of commitment
to reforms. Some are due to weak technical capacity and others are due to underestimation of the time
it takes for a political consensus to emerge. Annual processing of PRSCs, which affords
predictability, works as a constraint for some triggers, as not all important reforms fit neatly in the
PRSC cycle. Of the four triggers in PRSC 8 which were less than fully met, the social protection
trigger "approve a strategic plan to ensure prudential and effective investment of social security funds"
has made progress since then. The strategic plan was submitted to the Prime Minister in July 2010,
who instructed the Vietnam Social Security agency (VSS) to ensure that the plan was compatible with
the Social Security Law in effect, and to implement the plan after the revisions and approval by the
governing board of VSS. The World Bank is providing further technical support to VSS through the
Social Security Modernization Project (P106624), under preparation. The health trigger "adopt
standards for certification of health care practitioners and classification of private hospitals" was
followed up in PRSC 9, and the legal framework for adopting the standards of certification of health
care practitioners was put in place. The education trigger "formulate education development strategy
to 2020 focusing on equity of learning outcomes and relevance of contents" will be completed when
the strategy is adopted with the new SEDP. The anti-corruption trigger, "prepare a revised Press Law
to encourage accurate, objective and responsible reporting on corruption," is still waiting for the
political consensus to emerge. The task team intends to continue working with the authorities
achieving as much progress as possible on all PRSC 9 triggers in the coming months and beyond.
That PRSCs are a programmatic operation affords the flexibility of pursuing the reforms that take
multiple years to complete.
64.     The policy areas are discussed briefly below by pillars.


                                                    19
Pillar I: Business development
65.      The Recipient has issued regulations on state-owned economic groups for better
corporate governance and setting limits for cross share holding. Better corporate governance of
large SOEs (Economic Groups and General Corporations 90 and 91), improving how the state
ownership for those enterprises is exercised, and strengthening market discipline in running these
entities are critical elements in state sector reforms. How these reforms are handled is increasingly
important as Vietnam joins the ranks of middle-income countries, and seeks to complete the transition
to market-economy with socialist orientation. The state sector reforms have not advanced swiftly,
partly because the issues are complex and there are competing thoughts and examples from around the
world on how best to use SOEs and large conglomerates to achieve the goal of rapid economic growth.
The slow pace also reflects a struggle among the vested interests on the one hand, and the natural
tendency for the government wishing to avoid mistakes on high-stakes policy changes on the other. In
addition, transferring the responsibility of exercising the ownership rights away from the State
agencies requires non State entities and persons receiving this responsibility to have the necessary
capacity to perform the duties adequately. While on-the-job training arguably provides the best form
of capacity strengthening, the government's uneasiness in entrusting the exercise of ownership rights
in some of the highly technically specialized areas is understandable. Consequently, steps have been
taken both forward and backward in the state sector reform area. The recent appointment of a current
SBV employee as the main representative exercising the State-ownership rights to the boards of
                                 6
Vietcombank and Vietinbank, the two recently equitized banks, is a worrying development. On the
other hand, Ministry of Finance has confirmed that separation of the regulator function and exercise of
the state-ownership rights, and ensuring transparency and competition in the sale of state assets are the
principle guiding its efforts in state sector reform. Major policy decisions are unlikely before the Party
Congress in 2011, but the government issued a Resolution (No. 10/NQ-CP dated February 23, 2010)
assigning the research institute of the Ministry of Planning and Investment to conduct studies on
improving corporate governance of SOEs and on separation of the regulator and ownership. Some of
the concerns are addressed by this prior condition and other policy reforms achieved during this
operation, and the remaining issues will be followed up in the next operation.
66.      The Recipient has finalized regulations to better assess commercial banks' portfolio
risks, enhance public disclosure, and strengthen supervision. Even though the banking sector came
through the two crises without major problems, improving how the portfolio risks are assessed remains
an urgently-needed reform. Not having relevant information to assess the health of banks and the
banking sector is an obstacle for investors and analysts alike, and can lead to unfounded speculation
that is detrimental to the sector and the economy as a whole. The State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) has
been strengthening its supervision function, and it intends to move the focus further towards risk
management from compliance monitoring. Capacity strengthening at both the SBV and commercial
banks would be needed to accomplish this shift. The three legal documents, the draft Law on Credit
Institutions submitted to the National Assembly for adoption, the Circular 13 dated May 20, 2010 and
revised Decision 493 awaiting issuance, represent an important step in strengthening the banking
sector of the county.

67.      In addition to the two prior conditions discussed above, policy reforms were made in
increasing competition and efficiency of the pharmaceutical sector, separation of the exercise of the
ownership rights from the regulatory function in the unequitized SOEs, improved competition and
transparency in the sale of state capital in equitization process, facilitating bank mergers and
restructuring, improving regulations on securities to foster development of domestic capital market,
improving disclosure of audited financial information of public companies, improving disclosure
requirements of audited financial information of public companies, and strengthening legal framework

              Pillar I: Business development
State sector reform     The Recipient has issued regulations on state-owned economic groups for better
                        corporate governance and setting limits for cross share holding
Financial sector        The Recipient has finalized regulations to better assess commercial banks'
reform                  portfolio risks, enhance public disclosure, and strengthen supervision
            Pillar II: Social inclusion
Education               The Recipient has produced cost estimates and initiated public consultation on
                        full-day schooling for primary education
Health                  The Recipient has adopted a law establishing a framework for national standards
                        and a unified licensing system for all health care practitioners
           Pillar III: Natural resources
Land and forests        The Recipient has developed a proposal to continue the current NTP for rural
                        water supply and sanitation, which focuses on promotion of rural sanitation and
                        addresses personal hygiene
Environment             The Recipient has issued technical guidelines for efficient use of water resources
                        to complement the irrigation services fee waiver policy
           Pillar IV: Modern governance
Public Financial        The Recipient has formulated a regulation for internal audit development and
Management              implementation and defining organizational responsibilities
Public                  The Recipient has issued regulation and developed pilot schemes to strengthen
administration          competition, merit orientation, and transparency in the recruitment, appointment,
reform                  and promotion of civil servants
Fighting corruption     The Recipient has (a) carried out annual procurement compliance and performance
                        audits of projects funded by state budget; (b) made public the findings of selected
                        audits; (c) adopted a pilot procurement code of ethics for participants; and (d)
                        launched an open access electronic bidding system

Pillar II: Social inclusion
68.      The Recipient has produced cost estimates and initiated public consultation on full-day
schooling for primary education. For primary education, almost universal enrollment is already
attained. One of the most pressing and compelling issues remaining in Vietnam is quality, and full-
day schooling is an important component to enhance quality. Full-day schooling is currently a source
of inequality, as only the children of families who can afford the additional fees receives it. The
government is committed to addressing this inequality, and producing sound cost estimates is a pre-
requisite to ensure adequate preparation for rolling out the program nation-wide. As part of the cost of
implementing full-day schooling is likely to fall on parents, at least in initial years, public
consultations are critically important for the success. By sending an official letter to stakeholders,
Ministry of Education and Training has initiated this process. It plans to follow up in the coming
months to ensure wide consultations, including in remote areas of the country.
69.     The Recipient has adopted a law establishing a framework for national standards and a
unified licensing system for all health care practitioners. The Law on Examination and Treatment,
which was adopted in 2009, stipulates the national standards shall be adopted and licensing system is
to be unified to strengthen the technical quality of health practitioners, and thus, to ensure the quality
of health service delivery. The Law stipulates decentralized administration of the licensing system
which will make it a challenge to implement it in a unified manner. Ministry of Health (MOH) plans
to issue implementing regulations to ensure that the licensing system is unified. This issue will be
followed up in the next operation.
70.      In addition to the two prior actions discussed above, policy reforms made on conducting
student learning assessment surveys, treatment on waste and water discharged by health care facilities,
disclosure of financial and operational information regarding the health insurance fund, and updating
the official poverty line to reflect current conditions. During the period of this operation, necessary
apparatus was put in place to implement the Law on anti-domestic violence. Advancing gender-
equality agenda was pursued during the policy dialogue, and while some of the proposed actions, such
as adopting measures to increase women representation in representative bodies, were not completed
fully during the timeframe of this operation, substantive progress was made, and many are expected to
be completed in the coming months.


Pillar III: Natural resources

71.      The Recipient has developed a proposal to continue the current NTP for rural water
supply and sanitation, which focuses on promotion of rural sanitation and addresses personal
hygiene. Water supply and sanitation is the area where Vietnam may miss the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs). In order to maintain the reform momentum in this area, the government
has developed a proposal for a successor to the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation (RWSS) National
Targeted Program II, which is scheduled to be completed in 2010. The proposal focuses on promotion
of rural sanitation and addresses personal hygiene. MARD is considering scaling up the use of the
Output Based Approach piloted in the Vietnam Rural Water Supply Project.

72.      The Recipient has issued technical guidelines for efficient use of water resources to
complement the irrigation services fee waiver policy. A regulation (Decree 115/2008/ND-CP) was
issued in 2008 to provide financial relief to poor farmers through a policy of irrigation services fee
waiver. There was a concern, however, that this policy might reduce farmers' perception of the
economic value of irrigation water and water services and diminish incentives to conserve water. A
situation of water scarcity already exists in some crucial river basins, and irrigation is the largest user
of water resources. Therefore, guidelines for water use efficiency is an important complement to
Decree 115, where poor farmers are not unduly burdened by irrigation service fees but still are obliged
to follow the guidelines to ensure efficient use of scarce water resources.

                                                    22
73.      In addition to the two prior actions discussed above, policy reforms were achieved on
initiating transparent nation-wide surveys for urban sanitation and collection of national environmental
data.

Pillar IV: Modern governance

74.      The Recipient has formulated a regulation for internal audit development and
implementation and defining organizational responsibilities. Progress in internal audit was cited
as one of the most urgent priorities in the latest CFAA jointly prepared by the government and
development partners. This issue becomes even more important if the government intends to
decentralize further to the local levels. The legal framework for internal audit did not provide clear
definition of the concept, scope and nature of internal auditing and its role in the internal control
framework of the government. Without legal clarity, agencies were hesitant to establish and operate
an internal audit function. There was also a need to review the responsibilities for directing internal
auditing in the public sector between MOF and the State Audit of Vietnam (SAV). In compliance
with the current regulations in place, SAV has led the preparation of an internal audit decree, but the
separation of organizational responsibilities between SAV as an external auditor and the
administration, which is tasked to carry out internal audit, is stipulated in the prepared decree. It is
expected that the decree will provide enough clarity and guidance to the administrations to implement
internal audits.
75.      The Recipient has issued regulation and developed pilot schemes to strengthen
competition, merit orientation, and transparency in the recruitment, appointment, and
promotion of civil servants. The Law on Civil Servants, adopted by the National Assembly in
November 2008, is a major step towards improving the quality of civil service. However, as the Law
spells out only the broad principles, the details were left to the subordinate legal documents guiding
implementation. The government has now issued one of the main implementation decrees and
prepared pilot schemes to test new human resource policies. Together, these step represent a major
step in the direction of enhancing competition, merit-orientation, and transparency in the recruitment,
appointment, and promotion of civil servants.
76.     The Recipient has (a) carried out annual procurement compliance and performance
audits of projects funded by state budget; (b) made public the findings of selected audits; (c)
adopted a pilot procurement code of ethics for participants; and (d) launched an open access
electronic bidding system. With the adoption of the Law on Procurement in April 2006, the legal
framework was already in place for good procurement practices, an important element in preventing
corruption. The government has not only carried out annual procurement compliance and
performance audits of project funded by state budget, but started to put findings in the public domain,
which represents a breakthrough in increasing transparency and accountability in government's
procurement functions. The government has also embarked on insisting on code of ethics among
participants to procurement as well as on electronic bidding system, which are expected to help
increase efficiency, transparency, fairness, and accountability in procurement. These steps in turn are
expected to foster public confidence in governmental institutions.
77.     In addition to the three prior conditions discussed above, policy reforms were achieved on
strengthening urban planning and urban infrastructure management, strengthening the legal framework
for taxing the use of non-agricultural land and capital gains, increasing systematic and widely-
accessible publication of court judgments, developing legal framework for consumer protection,
developing an enabling legal framework to protect and reward witnesses and whistle-blowers, and
improving the reporting system for income and asset declaration.


Triggers for PRSC 10


                                                  23
78.      During the negotiation of the proposed credit, an agreement was reached on a list of measures
that will in principle be supported by PRSC 10. These measures are grounded in the SEDP and other
strategic documents, are deemed strategically important, to make economic sense, feasible in the
timeframe for PRSC 10, and possible to monitor. The list builds on the progress made over the current
PRSC cycle, and also is designed to follow-up on the areas where there was an agreement that further
work was necessary. They should not be interpreted as conditions, but as a guide to frame the policy
dialogue during the next 12 months. Progress towards meeting these triggers will be assessed in the
second half of 2010 in order to launch the formal preparation of the next and final operation in the
cycle.

79.     Develop a time-bound plan to separate the exercising of the state-ownership rights from
regulatory function in Economic Groups and large General Corporations. This trigger follows up
on the prior condition and other policy reforms achieved during the preparation of this operation. The
government's determination to continue moving the SOE reform agenda forward is expressed in
Resolution 10/NQ-CP dated February 23, 2010, which assigns MPI to conduct a study and develop a
time-bound plan by July 2011 on the issue of separating the exercising of the state-ownership rights
from regulatory function in Economic Groups and large General Corporations. It is expected that MPI
will have produced a near-final version of the draft plan by May 2011 to meet the deadline of July
2011 stipulated in Resolution 10.
80.      Enhance public disclosure and communication of SBV policies and banking sector
statistics. Though there is an improving trend, SBV provides limited statistics on its operations.
There is also limited banking sector statistics available publicly. A central bank is considered
transparent when it provides at all times sufficient information for the public to understand the policy
regime, to check whether the bank's actions match the regime and to pass judgment on its
performance. Vietnam does not currently meet the IMF data dissemination standards for presentation
and release of central bank data relating to coverage, periodicity, timeliness of data and access by the
public. Greater transparency and availability of information would allow decisions to be better
informed, while better accountability imposes firmer discipline on decision-makers. Together, they
can contribute to higher-quality decisions in central banks. SBV is preparing a circular to improve
public disclosure, which is expected to include the scope of information to be disclosed on its policies
and banking sector statistics, and the focal agencies for disclosure.

81.     Formulate a roadmap to improve corporate and government bond markets to foster
financial and economic growth. Bond market strategy is a component of Financial Market
Supervision and Bond Market Development plan. The economic crisis has led to increased demand to
improve the government and corporate bond markets to help finance economic growth. Vietnamese
policy-makers in general, and the SBV in particular, are more aware that developing the bond market
offers an opportunity to provide alternative funding sources to ease banking liquidity pressures, reduce
the impact of external shocks, and improve access to capital for the private sector and reducing
financing shortage in key development sectors such as infrastructure and housing.

82.      Approve a Gas Master Plan to 2015 with visions to 2025, including a time-bound
instruction to MOIT to prepare a Gas Market Reform Roadmap for consideration by the Prime
Minister. According to Vietnam Gas Sector Development Framework (2009), Vietnam needs to
increase electricity supply to meet its rapidly growing demand. It is highly advisable to move to clean
sources of energy in doing so. There is also a need for a market for gas to be in place when the next
phase of sector reform (a wholesale generation market) is due to be completed in 2014. Getting an
early start on the preparation of the Gas Market Reform Roadmap is a strategic move to set in motion
the necessary reforms.

83.    Institutionalize regular nationwide assessments and participation in international
assessment programs of student learning outcomes. Improved testing and assessment are required
to monitor and evaluate curriculum reform. There is much public interest in more transparent and

                                                  24
reliable testing and accreditation. There is also increased attention both by public and the government
to students' learning, in addition to enrolment and completion, as a means to assess effectiveness and
efficiency of the education system, especially in the light of Vietnam becoming a middle-income
country. Alignment of national learning outcomes data with international would be helpful, as would
increased focus on appropriate methodologies, transparency and coherent linkages between policy
development initiatives in multiple sub-sectors. Better assessments of learning outcomes would
improve efficiencies and return on sector investment can be anticipated from improvements in
integration of academic, vocational and professional accreditation.
84.      Ensure the national licensing system of health professionals is unified. Ministry of Health
plans to formulate decrees guiding the implementation of the Law on Examination and Treatment.
Having a regulatory mechanism in place the MOH will reinforce the unity of the licensing system
across the country, limit the opportunities for corruption, and thus make the roll-out of the Law more
efficient and effective. Issuance of decrees is planned for the end of 2010. It is understood that
unified system means existence of single set of clear standards; standardized handling of complaints of
professional misconduct, inspections and disciplinary actions thereof; unified registry of licensed
health professionals and license revocations; centralized mechanism to enforce compliance with the
law and regulations.

85.       Issue a set of national gender development indicators and criteria for sex-disaggregation
in the national statistics. This trigger is designed to follow up on the dialogue carried out in the
current operation under "establish indicators, identify gaps, and adopt a plan to address them in
monitoring of gender equality in priority areas," which was not completed during the time frame of
this operation. The delay is technical in nature, and was caused by the fact that information on gender
is scattered across many types of statistical instruments and administrative data systems in Vietnam.
An inventory study of available gender-related data which also identifies gaps and areas of concern
was commissioned by the World Bank in 2009. The study also provided information on how these
data align with current international gender indices. General Statistics Office (GSO) has included
several gender equality indicators in its new set of national indicators under the expanded National
Statistical Indicator System, which is awaiting approval. Resolution 57 (dated December 1, 2009) on
the Action Plan to implement the Party's Resolution 11(dated April 27, 2007) mandated MPI to work
with MOLISA to develop and issue a set of national indicators to monitor gender equality outcomes.
The indicators are expected to be broader and more detailed than those collected in the national
statistics system. MPI in turn has assigned GSO to complete this work by December 2010.

86.     Issue technical guidelines for application of SEA in the process of socio-economic
development planning. The Law on Environmental Protection (2005) stipulates the requirement of
conducting SEA for strategic policies, programs and plans. One of the guiding regulations issued to
implement the Law, Decree 04/2008/ND-CP, contains provision for obligatory application of SEA in
the development of socio-economic Master Plans. Although the SEA concept and requirement have
been introduced in the government legislation for some time, systematic application to the planning
processes remains a challenge. The major constraint for the application of SEA at present is the lack of
technical guidelines and regulation on financing mechanism. Despite the regulation to allocate 3
percent of the total budget for developing or revising socio-economic Master Plan, it remains unclear
how to use these funds. As the new cycle for socio-economic Master Plans will begin in 2011, the
adoption of specific SEA technical guidelines for this process would help ensure environmental
sustainability in Vietnam's economic development planning.

87.       Enhance the management of transport infrastructure assets through decentralization
and adoption of financial mechanisms for investment, operation and maintenance. Regulations
on management of transport infrastructure assets are of strategic importance, as transport infrastructure
is a critical input to socio-economic development of Vietnam. The regulation is expected to cover a
wide range of policies related to infrastructure, from budget allocation, investment, management, to
maintenance. Main objectives include further decentralization of management responsibilities from
central to local levels, improved fund mobilization for investment in infrastructure, and improved
financial mechanisms guiding rational utilization, fee collection and maintenance of transport
infrastructure assets, which allows recovery of both capital and maintenance costs in transport
projects.
88.      Issue PAR Master Plan for 2011-2020 and accompanying results-oriented M&E system.
This trigger follows up on the dialogue conducted under the current operation on the comprehensive
and analytical review of the implementation of the Public Administration Reform Master Program
2001-2010. The next stage of reform on public administration reform would be based on the lessons
learnt from the previous phase and with clear and focused objectives. In order to enhance efficiency of
the public administration, the Master Plan would include results-oriented mechanisms to monitor
performance of the public sector at different administrative levels. The review mentioned above is
expected to be completed by October 2010 and the new Master Plan to be developed by the end of
2010. The accompanying monitoring and evaluation system is a new element to be introduced. There

                                                      26
are available (e.g. VHLSS Governance Module, Provincial Competitiveness Index) and planned
surveys which could inform the results-oriented M&E system.

89.     Develop framework for monitoring progress on the implementation and results of efforts
to combat corruption.         The government's Anti-corruption strategy tasks the Government
Inspectorate with developing a system of indicators to track corruption and anti-corruption by
December 2010, and to develop jointly with MPI and Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry
annual citizen and enterprise surveys on unofficial payments, which should inform the "results" part of
the monitoring framework.



                              Box 2. Good Practice Principles for Conditionality

 Stakeholder consultations were held in February 2009 in Hanoi in the context of world-wide review of DPL
 evaluations, conducted by OPCS.
 Ownership. There is general agreement across the stakeholder groups that the PRSC series have been firmly
 rooted in the government's own reform agenda, as expressed first through the CPRGS and then the SEDP. In
 both the donor and NGO consultations, participants mentioned that this was "best practice."
 Harmonization. Alignment to the CPRGS and the SEDP helped development partners work more coherently
 in support of government outcomes. There was general acknowledgement that the PRSC operation was a
 complex one, bringing together multiple ministries and donors. Government participants were particularly
 appreciative of donor efforts to coordinate assistance around the SEDP and PRSC. There was still concern
 over the current framework for accountability, i.e. , the PRSC framework being similar, but not identical, to
 the SEDP monitoring framework. There were views that donors should resist the temptation to use
 independent monitoring mechanisms. Inputs from NGOs emphasized how accountability works in practice,
 outlining the need to engage alternative and independent viewpoints. Donors also emphasized how
 harmonization could be improved, suggesting a more structured approach to engagement in the PRSC process.
 This would enable "newcomers" to the process (which grows annually in terms of number of participants) to
 understand better their roles and obligations.
 Customization. The general sense was of that the process had become increasingly tailored to the country
 priorities. The need to balance the wish to promote desirable reforms and the respect for the country's
 priorities, perhaps described as "the art of the possible," was recognized. A repetitive theme refers to building
 the analytical capacity within the Government, so that the Government, rather than development partners, can
 lead the process of determining which actions should be prioritized in the agreements. Currently the
 prioritization and sequencing of actions and triggers was undertaken more by donors than by the Government,
 although the Government owns the broad agenda from which the PRSC operations are derived.
 Criticality. The size of the policy matrices is relatively large, but is slowly being reduced, balancing
 criticality with an active policy dialogue across the reform agenda. A multi-sector, multi-agency, multi-donor
 operation is likely to need a spread of "benchmarks" in order to keep the operation inclusive and motivating
 for all participants. While this number of benchmarks is higher than in other countries, it is justifiable in
 Vietnam, as the Bank and all co-financiers use the same policy matrix to decide on their level of support,
 thereby providing a single harmonized platform for the policy dialogue and disbursements.
Transparency and predictability. Both predictability and transparency had increased over recent years. The
PRSC process has led to disbursements to the budget on an annual basis, thus meeting the objective of aligning
aid to domestic budget cycles. Since PRSC 2, commitments were made in June of each year, which is the time
when the preparation of the budget starts. The budget is approved by the National Assembly towards
November, for the following calendar year. The submission to the National Assembly already factors in the
amount of resources expected from PRSCs. Although the World Bank inputs were predictable, there was less
predictability over the timing and level of co-financier resources that would be available. Not all donors were
able to commit to financing beyond the current years and as levels of co-financing increase, this adds an element
of uncertainty into the operation.



                                                       27
                           VI.      OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION


POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS
90.      The reforms supported by the PRSC series have led to a fundamental transformation of the
Vietnamese economy, including increasing reliance on market mechanisms and growing integration
into the world economy. Vietnam's rapid economic growth is a testimony to the soundness of the
program. This rapid transformation, however, has had large social impacts: greater economic
fluctuations from increased integration with world markets, potential financial instability due to
exposure to capital flows, growing inequality as agglomeration effects play out and the economic hubs
of the country sail ahead, and possible vulnerabilities as market mechanisms develop throughout the
social sectors. The PRSC operations address these concerns through various measures such as
strengthening and extending the coverage of the pension programs and health insurance, taking
measures to improve the stability of the banking sector, and improving the monitoring of capital flows,
and developing policies to mitigate potential adverse effects of integration.
91.      There are winners and losers in any reform process and the reforms supported by this series of
PRSCs seek to maximize the number of families and individuals who participate in Vietnam's
economic transformation. The country's rapid rate of poverty reduction bears witness to their success.
The reforms supported by each PRSC are assessed carefully to ensure they do not adversely affect
poor and vulnerable groups. In cases where the reform program affects identifiable groups, the PRSC
supports measures to offset adverse impacts. In the case of PRSC9, revision of the Labor Code and
consumer protection law, monitoring implementation of the gender equality law, developing a unified
licensing system for health care professionals, and reforms in the pharmaceutical sector are examples
of strengthened protection of the population at large. Actions such as the revision of the poverty line,
better targeted poverty-reduction programs, and enhanced allocation of forest lands to the communities
are examples of measures addressing the poor specifically. Supporting full day schooling for primary
education promotes equality in education outcomes; children from better off households often receive
private tutoring to supplement the limited supply of public education services. The governance reform
agenda would also benefit the poor, as they suffer disproportionately from corruption and inadequate
public services.
92.     Assessing the wider social impacts of a transformation of this magnitude is challenging. Good
tools exist to assess the consequences of trade liberalization, an important component in earlier phases
of the PRSC cycle. However, a retrospective assessment of the studies conducted at the time
concludes that they were not able to foresee the actual consequences. In a similar vein, more recent
attempts to identify ex ante winners and losers from the WTO accession have proven inconclusive.
The WTO accession matters because it brings competition in services, raises standards or increases
financial openness, and none of this can be easily captured with the tools at disposal. A review of a
dozen studies based on computable general equilibrium models and almost as many sectoral studies
(reported in VDR 2006 Doing Business) shows that few results are robust across the studies,
suggesting a high sensitivity to the methodology and assumptions used. To fill this gap, increasing
emphasis has been put on monitoring and evaluation in all areas of the program (linked to the M&E
framework in the SEDP) and the team recently completed a broader review of social protection issues
(VDR 2007 Social Protection).
93.      The Social Protection VDR updates Vietnam's poverty assessment. It identifies the main
shifts and shocks being faced by the Vietnamese economy through a period of fundamental
transformation, rather than dealing with potentially adverse impacts on a policy-by-policy basis.
Identifying the right policy responses is also challenging. In many other parts of the world, cash
transfers (conditional or otherwise) are seen as a clean tool to achieve compensation and enforce the

                                                  28
Pareto principle. However, Vietnam makes limited use of cash transfers. This is partly due to
implementation issues: handing over cash is fraught with fiduciary risk, as shown by a recent attempt
to make one-time payments (the Lunar New Year bonuses) to poor households so as to offset the
economic downturn. There have been numerous reports of misuse of these funds and there is little
evidence that Luna New Year bonuses have helped to offset the emerging consequences of the recent
economic downturn. More generally, there is a concern about the dependence created by cash
transfers, and a vision that resources should be better used by promoting the participation of the poor
and near-poor in universal programs, or increasing spending on local infrastructure and services in
poorer regions of the country. In terms of the former, households classified as "poor" according to
criteria developed by MOLISA are eligible for social services that would otherwise have a cost (e.g.,
exemption of school fees, payment of health insurance premium, and access to credit without
collateral). Community development programs like P-135 and the recently initiated 61 Poor Districts
Program are examples of the latter.


ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS
94.      The proposed operation is likely to have positive effects on the environment, forests, and other
natural resources. As required under Operations Policy 8.60, the task team determined if there are
significant effects on the country's environment, forests, and other natural resources. "Significant
effects" are defined as "environmental changes of sufficient magnitude, duration, and intensity as to
have non-negligible effects on the natural resource base and on human welfare." 7
95.      There are a number of policy actions that are included precisely with the objective of
generating a significant positive environmental impact.           Others, while not being strictly
environmental, are also expected to result in positive environmental externalities. A number of policy
actions raised at least theoretical possibility of negative environmental impacts, and needed to be
analyzed carefully. The following Table 7 provides summary information on these triggers and policy
actions, the intended positive impacts, an analysis of possible negative impacts, and an analysis of
status (likelihood of achievement and actions being taken or to be taken to enhance likelihood of a
significant impact or to mitigate negative impacts). Triggers are in bold. Policy actions that do not
have any environmental implications are not included in the table. The table also includes triggers that
are proposed for PRSC 10.
96.    Many potential environmental implications of growing investment programs in Vietnam are
most suitably addressed through the strengthening of national capacity in environmental impact
assessment. Under the World Bank's parallel DPL on Public Investment Reform, the Government has
engaged to carry out a number of regulatory reforms and capacity building initiatives in the areas of
environmental impact assessment (EIA) and strategic environmental assessment (SEA).

IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION
97.      The PRSC operations have been included in a number of evaluations of budget support
operations, policy lending, and application of good principles in conditionality. A Quality at Entry
Assessment (QEA) for the first PRSC cycle was conducted shortly after the approval of PRSC 2. The
QEA rated the proposed series as highly satisfactory in terms of its strategic relevance and approach
and to its poverty reduction and social inclusion aspects. All other dimensions were considered
satisfactory. A review of Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs) by the Independent Evaluation
Group (IEG) reached similar conclusions. Based on the relevance and achievements under most
objectives, the overall outcome of the first PRSC cycle was rated satisfactory. Another assessment
was conducted after PRSC 4, as a part of a broader evaluation of general budget support,
commissioned by 24 donors and conducted by the University of Birmingham in seven countries. This
assessment showcased Vietnam as a successful example of government-donor collaboration, with
strong impact on policies. The assessment for Vietnam was updated after PRSC 5 by the same
research team, by then working in a consulting firm (Mokoro). This update was financed by the
World Bank as an input for the preparation of the current PRSC cycle. The updated assessment
concluded that PRSCs were effective at supporting policy reforms, at linking policy and budgets, at

                                                      30
strengthening financial management, and at helping harmonization. The inclusiveness of process was
highly valued. At the same time, PRSC operations were judged less effective at supporting policy
breakthroughs and at helping policy implementation. Two more evaluations are ongoing at present,
both at global level. One of them is by IEG, and its findings will soon be submitted to the Board. The
other is conducted by the World Bank in preparation for the mid-term review of IDA 15. In this
context, consultations will major stakeholders were conducted in Hanoi in February 2009.
98.     Progress in the implementation of the reform agenda in the PRSCs 6-10 is monitored through
a set of development indicators, as described in the Program Document for the sixth Poverty
Reduction Support Credit (2007). The indicators were chosen based on the monitoring framework for
the Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP), but they are fewer in number. In the case of
governance, the set of indicators goes beyond the SEDP monitoring framework. This was an area
where the experience in monitoring was limited, and the use of enterprise and household surveys, as
opposed to administrative self-reporting, was not yet common. At the beginning of this PRSC cycle, it
was deemed impractical to monitor the progress towards development outcomes on an annual basis
because collecting and processing survey data take time, and policy reforms are unlikely to yield
outcomes immediately. The Board of Executive Directors approved that the assessments be done
twice during this PRSC cycle, towards the middle of the cycle and at the end of it.
99.     A midterm review of the progress towards development outcomes was conducted during the
preparation of this operation. Detailed analyses and the indicators are presented in Annex 3. The
progress towards achieving the development outcomes is summarized in the Figure 4.
100.    Poverty Reduction Support Credits are designed to be holistic. Evaluating the impact of socio-
economic policies is always difficult, because policies are not implemented in a vacuum, and there are
many other factors at play. It is not easy to assess which part of the change in a broad development
indicator is due to a specific policy as the channels through which outcomes can be produced are
diverse, and causes and effects do not always have a linear one-to-one relationship. Any convincing
analysis requires a credible counterfactual to appraise what would have happened in the absence of the
policy being evaluated, but such a study is outside the scope of the PRSC operations in Vietnam.
Therefore, the mid-term review focuses on the progress made in attaining the targets based on the
indicators defined at the outset of this SEDP and PRSC cycle.
101.     Overall, progress has been made towards achieving the development outcomes. Among the
45 indicators for which updated figures are available, 37 have made strides towards achieving the
targets, 11 of which have already attained the goals (Figure 4). Whether the targets have been
achieved or not depends on how ambitious the targets were and the nature of the indicators. Some
indicators tend to make linear progress while others might have a J curve or a step-function.
Therefore, the fact that they are already achieved should not be a reason for complacency, nor should
slow progress be deplored without examining the reasons. Even with these caveats, the fact that
progress is made in over 80 percent of the diverse areas covered under the program is credit to the
Vietnamese government. It has managed to achieve these results despite the often-cited weakness in
capacity, slow decision-making process, and two economic crises in the intervening years. According
to these indicators, the progress was particularly solid in the areas of state sector reform, private sector
development, infrastructure, education, social protection, water and sanitation, and legal development.

102.     The results of policy dialogue, measured as the share of outcome indicators making progress,
are noticeably better for the business environment and social inclusion pillars than for the natural
resources and modern governance pillars. It could be due to the choice of policy reforms pursued in
the dialogue, strength and weaknesses of ministries and agencies in charge of the specific sectors, the
selection of indicators, the speed at which outcomes could be expected to improve in different areas,
natural comparative advantage of the PRSC as an instrument, effectiveness of the dialogue in a
particular domain, among other things.
103.    If the goal of PRSC series is to achieve as many targets for the outcome indicators as possible,
the emphasis should shift towards the last two pillars. If the goal of the policy dialogue is to specialize
in the most effective areas, the future policy dialogue should be held in areas under the business
development and social inclusion pillars.
104.     Any lesson would remain tentative, because the attribution problem cannot be solved and
credible counterfactuals do not exist. Whatever the merits and shortcomings of the PRSCs, it is clear
that the first three PRSCs in this cycle have accompanied progress in diverse areas. The lesson for
development partners may be that even though the progress seems slow at times, it is unmistakably
there when observed in a 4-5 year horizon. However, it is sobering that none of the indicators for
environment is making progress, and this may be one area that calls for attention and concerted efforts
in the future operations.

FIDUCIARY ASPECTS
105.      Fiduciary arrangements. The fiduciary risks of the current public financial management
systems, (budgeting, accounting, reporting and auditing) are assessed as moderate. Since the IMF
does not currently have a program in Vietnam, it is not possible to rely on its assessment of the control
environment of the SBV. However, the enactment of the Audit Law in 2005 helps address the issues
related to audit and accounting arrangements. The Audit Law has established the State Audit of
Vietnam (SAV) as an independent institution reporting to the National Assembly with the Auditor
General being appointed and dismissed by the National Assembly. Audit reports were made public for
the first time in 2006. The SBV is subject to auditing by SAV on an annual basis.


                                                    32
106.    Deposit account (DA). To address fiduciary risks in the foreign exchange control
environment, the Borrower will open and maintain a dedicated DA in US dollars for the Borrower's
use once the Credit is approved by the Board. The DA will form part of the country's official foreign
reserves. An equivalent amount will be credited to an account of the government available to finance
budgeted expenditures. If after deposit in the DA, the proceeds of the Credit or any part thereof are
used for ineligible purposes, as defined in the Financing Agreement, IDA will request the Borrower to
refund the amount directly to IDA. Amounts refunded to IDA shall be cancelled.
107.     Through SBV, the Borrower will report the exact sum received into the DA, ensure that all
withdrawals are for "eligible" expenditures, indicate to IDA details of the Treasury account to which
the Vietnamese dong equivalent of the Credit proceeds will be credited, and submit a report on
receipts and disbursements for the DA. The Government will, if considered necessary by IDA, allow
an independent external audit of the dedicated foreign currency DA. These processes and controls are
intended to provide assurance that IDA funds have arrived at their intended destination to be used for
their intended purposes, and are subject to the Borrower's rules and regulations.


DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING
108.     Disbursement, reporting and auditing arrangements. The Credit will follow IDA
disbursement procedures for development policy lending operations, and the Credit proceeds will be
disbursed in compliance with the stipulated release conditions. Various measures have been taken to
ensure that the overall fiduciary policies and institutions are adequate to proceed with support from
IDA and other development partners. Analytical underpinnings for the operation include the 2002
Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR), the 2005 PER-IFA and the CFAA (2007).
Disbursement will not be linked to any specific purchases and no procurement requirements will have
to be satisfied.


RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION
109.    The risk of macroeconomic turbulence, especially those related to balance of payments and
debt sustainability, continues to exist. If the authorities do not manage to convince the market of its
determination to pursue macroeconomic stability, inflation pressure may continue, and along with it,
the downward pressure on the dong. On the other hand, if the market becomes exuberant about
Vietnam's potential, it could reignite large capital inflows causing the economy to overheat again.
The authorities are aware of the risks and are monitoring developments in the economy. The Bank is
engaged with the government in on-going discussion on both informal and formal basis, jointly with
the IMF. An ongoing technical assistance project helps strengthen capacity for managing public
finance and debt. The dialogue carried out through PRSC series seeks to enhance the quality and
effectiveness of supervising capital flows, and improve communication and information made
available to public.
110.     Probably a higher risk is that the pace of reforms would slow because of the leadership's
preoccupation with maintaining macroeconomic stability and with the Party Congress in 2011, a major
political event in the country. The aim of this operation is to keep the momentum for the medium-term
reform agenda. State sector reform is tackled from several different angles to this effect, including the
recommendation to ensure transparency and competition when the state equitizes its assets, and
separating the exercising of state ownership rights from the regulator function. Reforms in advancing
gender equality, including female participation in elected bodies were also pursued in this operation.
111.    The longer term risk is that Vietnam fails to address the governance issue in a systematic and
fundamental way. Accountability, especially downwards, access to information, checks and balances
are challenges for all countries at varying levels, and Vietnam needs to continue decisively down the
path on which it has embarked. As the Vietnam Development Report 2010 Modern Institutions has

                                                   33
shown, improving governance requires increasing transparency at various levels. This area receives
special attention in the proposed operation, including actions to improve transparency in public
administration, informing the public of court judgments, and strengthening the audits of government
operations.
112.     Vietnam is now at a crossroads. The authorities have managed to weather the external shocks
with increasing skillfulness, and have delivered impressive poverty reduction results. However, as the
country approaches and reaches the middle-income status, there will be fewer easy reforms, and less
external support in the form of concessional financing. It is time for the authorities and the
development partners to prepare the medium-term engagement plan, and brace for more complex and
difficult challenges. The World Bank is prepared to accompany the authorities in this transition
through an array of complementary programs and projects, while ensuring that its overall partnership
strategy remains well coordinated within the Bank and with other development partners. The
remaining two operations in this PRSC cycle are very important for the country to enter the new phase
with a strong momentum for reform.

             ANNEX 3. MONITORING PROGRESS TOWARDS DEVELOPMENT OUTCOMES


I.     INTRODUCTION

1.     The framework for measuring the progress in the implementation of the reform agenda
supported by Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) 6-10 was determined during the
preparation of PRSC6 in 2007, and is described in Vietnam Development Report (2007) titled
Aiming High. Section 2 of this report (pp14-28) describes in detail how the monitoring
framework was prepared, what should be measured, strengths and weaknesses of the proposed
framework, and the availability (or lack thereof) of data. The PRSC series is designed to support
implementation of the reform agenda of the Socioeconomic Development Plan (SEDP) 2006-
2010, and as such, its monitoring framework is adapted from that for SEDP 2006-2010. During
the adaptation process, the number of the indicators was reduced, and emphasis was placed on
measurable indicators of outcomes.
2.     Evaluating the impact of socio-economic policies is always difficult, because policies are
not implemented in a vacuum, and there are many other factors at play. It is not easy to assess
which part of the change in a broad development indicator is due to a specific policy. Any
convincing response requires a credible counterfactual to appraise what would have happened in
the absence of the policy being evaluated.
3.      Even though this problem cannot be overcome, monitoring indicators were identified in
order to gauge the general progress in the reform agenda, which is considered to be correlated to
the overall effectiveness of the policy dialogue. Conceptually, the desired outcome, such as
healthier citizens, are mapped to policy variables (inputs), which are under direct government
control, such as a decision to subsidize the health insurance fees for the poor. Between inputs
and outcomes, there are "outputs," for example, an increased access to health care services,
which are immediate consequences of implementing a particular policy.
4.       In this example, even if there is a consensus that the Vietnamese citizens in general are
healthier in 2010 than they were in 2006, and the government did introduce a policy of
subsidizing the health insurance premium for the poor, the attribution problem is not solved.
First, there is a measurement problem of how to determine whether the Vietnamese in general
are healthier. They may be healthier in some respects (longer life expectancy, for example) but
not in others (incidence of lung cancer, for example).
5.      Second, even if a general measure of health can be agreed upon, the causality between
the policy instrument (health insurance subsidy) and the outcome/output cannot be proven. The
Vietnamese maybe healthier because they have more affordable access to health care facility or
the country enjoyed milder climate during the last 5 years. Even the relationship between inputs
and outputs is tenuous, as the increased visits to health clinics can be attributed to easier access
thanks to the affordable health insurance or to a higher incidence of sickness in the population
due to an epidemic.
6.     Third, even if it can somehow be established that the health insurance subsidy was a
useful policy, it does not prove that it was the best policy for the given cost (for example,
additional training of doctors, financed through the funds used for the subsidy scheme, may have



                                                49
led to higher incidence of health). In addition, it may only have been useful because there was a
breakthrough in public financial management, which allowed additional funds to be allocated to
subsidizing the health insurance for the poor.
7.     On the other hand, even if the implemented policies were exactly right, they may fail to
bring about the desired outcomes due to external reasons, such as natural disasters or a new
virus. It may also take more than a few years for a particular policy to achieve the intended
outcomes, and the progress in intervening years rarely comes in steady, monotonic
improvements.
8.      In-depth analyses of counterfactuals from similar countries (after controlling for country-
specific characteristics) which did not implement similar policies or implemented different sets
of policies are outside the scope of this review report.
9.      Imperfect though it is, the evaluation frameworks selected for SEDP and PRSCs 6-10 are
an improvement over their predecessors, which focused heavily on quantitative output target (for
example, how many tons of rice to be produced). They recognize the outcomes as the targets of
the policies, and represent an attempt to link these targets with the policies being implemented.
10.    While bearing in mind the limitations described above, this report does mainly three
things: it describes the outcome indicators, reports the progress made in achieving these
outcomes, present the policies that could have contributed to bringing about the outcomes, and
lessons that could be used for future operations, PRSC10 and beyond.
II.     DESCRIPTION OF THE OUTCOME INDICATORS

11.     There are four pillars in the SEDP and PRSCs, business environment, social inclusion,
natural resource management, and modern governance. Each pillar is has several areas, 17 in
total. Three development outcome indicators were selected in each of these areas, resulting in 51
indicators.
12.     The selection criteria were that the indicators summarize the progress in a particular area,
that they are measurable, that they are (likely to be) available for the baseline year and
periodically thereafter, and that a target value for 2011 is available in some strategic document.
It was not easy to find such indicators, and in retrospect, not all of them were well-suited for the
purpose.
13.      In addition, not all of them were well-defined, and the availability turned out to be a problem for
some of them. At the time of writing, 6 indicators are still missing out of 51. These indicators are (i)
client satisfaction with customs, (ii) child malnutrition rate; (iii) the quality of surface water; (iv) quality
of air, expenditure; (v) user satisfaction with government services; and (vi) households having suffered
from corruption.
14.     The indicators concerning satisfaction of government services and corruption, (i), (v) and (vi), are
survey-based qualitative measures, which present special challenge in evaluating outcomes overtime,
even if identical questions are asked to respondents selected using the same sampling technique. As is
discussed in detail in VDR 2010 Modern Institutions, the surveys found evidence for both improving
services and declining satisfaction, implying that enterprises and households are becoming more
demanding over time. Further complicating the problem is that the surveys do not always ask the same




                                                      50
questions or use the same sampling techniques, so even when similar survey results are available, direct
comparisons over time is not possible.
15.      For child malnutrition rate, the metric of "malnutrition" was changed in 2007, rendering 2005 and
2008 results incompatible. If the figures are taken at face value, the rates went up, although this is almost
certainly not the case. A research project is underway at National Institute of Nutrition to manipulate the
earlier data, so that the break in the time-series can be overcome.
16.      The two environmental indicators, on surface water and air, were not defined at the beginning of
the PRSC cycle. Subsequently, it was determined that for air quality indicator, using continuous
monitoring data from two major cities, Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City of total particular suspension (TSP)
will give a broad overview of the air quality in urban areas across long enough time-series. The efforts to
collect the historic and current data are underway. What the target value should be has not been identified
in strategic documents. It proved more difficult to determine what might constitute a good broad
indicator for surface water quality. Scientists from the government and development partners suggested
that Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) from major rivers as a candidate. Availability of such data across
long enough time-series is being investigated. Unavailability of these two indicators is unfortunate, as
anecdotal evidence seems to suggest deterioration in these areas, and policy changes would be necessary
to reverse such trends, if true.

1.    Preparations for a new survey have started, to be completed in 2011.
2.    Share of capital that was owned by the State in 2006 (excluding Economic Groups and General Corporations
      -- there was no decision to equitize these) transferred to SCIC (measuring the flow, not what is owned by
      SCIC, as SCIC divests and makes its own investments too).
3.    Figures for 2006 and 2007 are approximate, as the total number of GCs is not reported.
4.    Growth centers are defined as Red River Delta, Da Nang and South East. Quang Ninh is not included in
      RRD. The number of registered enterprises is a census until 2008. After 2009, GSO uses a 20% sample
      survey for firms (fewer than 10 workers) and census for larger firms.
5.    Changed the definition from "fraction of population living in houses not meeting government standards" to
      "Fraction of the population living (i) in temporary houses (ii) without access to clean drinking water, and (iii)
      without access to adequate latrine" as we could not reconstruct the baseline figure of 25% which was in the
      original matrix from VHLSS 2006. In the VHLSS questionnaire, (i) is straight forward; (ii) sum of three
      categories: "other well (non filtered)," "rain water," "river, lake, or pond (surface water)"; (iii) sum of two
      categories 'directly over water' and 'other.'
6.    Defined as "age-appropriate children living with disability attending primary or lower secondary school"
      (from the district FSQL audit). This is not directly comparable with the base line data, which is based 2006
      VHLSS. The 2006 VHLSS has primary enrollment of disabled children as 56.7% using a high threshold for
      disability that drops children with more mild functional difficulties. If those children are included, the
      enrollment rate is 68.7%. Total number of disabled children -- using lower threshold is 63, using higher
      threshold is 40. But those are raw observations, while the percentages are created using weights.
7.    Metric was changed in 2007. Following up to see if the baseline year can be calculated using the new metric.
8.    No change until the elections (every 5 years). Thirty-three percent of candidates were women. By May
      2011, new candidate list is expected to be available. The target for 2011 is from the National Strategy (5 year

9.    The CRCs of 2004 were carried out in certain cities and for certain services, with sampling targeting poor and
      migrant areas of the cities. The VHLSS Governance Module of 2008 covered the same cities and similar
      services, but for a random sample of households. Due to differences in sampling, comparisons are highly
      tentative. Wording of the questions was similar but not identical. 2004: "(F42) How do you rate your
      overall satisfaction with the land/house registration services? Very satisfied 1, Somewhat satisfied 2,
      Undecided if satisfied or not 3, Somewhat dissatisfied 4, Very dissatisfied 5." 2008: "(M91c4_1) In general,
      which is your level of satisfaction with the following services? (Issuance of land use right and house
      ownership right certificates) Very low 1, Low 2, Neither high nor low 3, High 4, Very high 5, Don't know 9"
      The numbers presented represent the simple average across 4 cities/provinces (Hai Phong, Nam Dinh, Da
      Nang, and TP-HCM). See "Note on Monitoring Indicators" for details.

      agreed that there is no one single indicator that can summarize the overall quality of surface water. Any one
      indicator would be more misleading than useful.

14.   Agreed with MOF that the so-called "off-budget" items should not be included in this indicator, but only the
      "unreported statutory funds (defined in CFAA)" should be counted. Of 19 such funds, only 8 are centrally
      controlled. MOF said 2 funds dominate everything else (social security and health insurance). MOF
      provided some information about 5 statutory funds for 2006 and 2007 (filed separately). Some doubt about
      whether statutory funds are the only unreported expenditures.

      migrant areas of the cities. The VHLSS Governance Module of 2008 covered the same cities and similar
      services, but for a random sample of households. Due to differences in sampling, comparisons are highly
      tentative. Wording of the questions was similar but not identical. Differences in sampling make these very
      tentative comparisons. In addition, it should be noted that the baseline was extremely positive.

    January 2008, respectively. There was a difficulty arising from Hanoi and Ha Tay merging in early 2009.
19. Cannot be determined as indicators differ over time. However, VHLSS Governance Module asks if
    respondents think corruption is getting better, worse, or no change. Among users of services: Primary
    education: 27% said improving, 9% said worsening. Central health: 24% said improving, 22% said
    worsening. Police: 24% said improving, 16% said worsening. Courts: 23% said improving, 17% said
    worsening. In every case, most respondents said no change.
20. The WB Enterprise Surveys of 2005 and 2009 has similar, but not identical, questions on the percentage of
    sales paid in bribes. 2005: "We've heard that establishments are sometimes required to make gifts or
    informal payments to public officials to "get things done" with regard to customs, taxes, licenses, regulations,
    services etc. a. Does this occur for establishments in your industry (not necessarily yours)? __ q65a___ 1
    =Yes; 2=No (If NO, go to 66). b. On average, over a year, what percent of annual sales value would such
    expenses cost a typical establishment in your sector? q65b (% of sales)" 2009: "It is said that establishments
    are sometimes required to make gifts or informal payments to public officials to "get things done" with regard
    to customs, taxes, licenses, regulations, services etc. On average, what percentage of total annual sales, or
    estimated total annual value, does establishments likes this one pay in informal payments or gifts to public
    officials for this purpose?"
21. Response categories were identical. Questions were very similar. 2005: "Please tell us if any of the
    following issues are a problem for the operation and growth of your business. If an issue poses a problem,
    please judge its severity as an obstacle on a four-point scale where: 0 = No obstacle 1 = Minor obstacle 2 =
    Moderate obstacle 3 = Major obstacle 4 = Very Severe Obstacle". 2009: "As I list some factors that can
    affect the current operations of a business, please look at this card and tell me if you think that each factor is
    No Obstacle, a Minor Obstacle, a Moderate Obstacle, a Major Obstacle, or a Very Severe Obstacle to the
    current operations of this establishment." Samples are identical since the responses of panel firms are
    reported. N=239.

III.    PROGRESS

17.      Overall progress towards achieving the development outcomes has been notable. Among
the 45 indicators for which updated figures are available, 37 have made strides towards achieving the
targets, 11 of which have already attained the goals. These 11 are: (1) export orientation; (2) SOE
performance; (3) quality of loan portfolio in the banking sector; (4) stock market capitalization; (5) private
domestic investment; (6) learning outcomes in primary school; (7) wage employment among women; (8)
river basins with inter-provincial management; (9) share of debt in GDP; (10) fraction of civil judgments
enforced; and (11) provincial departments with one-stop shop model. Of the 9 indicators that have still
ways to achieving the targets, there is no quantifiable progress in six: (i) share of strategic investors'
ownership in SOCBs; (ii) protection of biodiversity; (iii) provincial screening of public investment; (iv)
adoption of integrated regional planning; (v) extent of unreported public expenditure; and (vi) public
agencies with internal auditing functions. Two indicators are showing mixed results or deterioration: (a)
share of female delegates in the National Assembly; and (b) forest quality.
18.     Whether the targets set out at the beginning have already been achieved or not obviously depends
on how ambitious the targets were and the nature of the indicators. For example, some indicators tend to
make linear progress while others might follow a J curve or step-function. Therefore, the fact that they are
already achieved should not be a reason for complacency, nor should slow progress be deplored without
examining the reasons.
19.      Even with these caveats, that over 80 percent of the indicators in diverse areas covered under the
program are on track is good progress, and the Vietnamese government should be commended for it. It has
managed to achieve these results despite the often-cited weakness in capacity, slow decision-making
process, and two economic crises in the intervening years. According to these indicators, the progress was
particularly solid in the areas of state sector reform, private sector development, infrastructure, education,
social protection, water and sanitation, and legal development.
20.      The two deteriorating indicators are not necessarily a cause for concern. That the share of female
delegates in the National Assembly declined from 27 percent in 2006 to 26 percent in 2007 is not a welcome
trend, but the magnitude of decrease is hardly alarming. The female candidates represented 33% of the total
in 2007. The share of female delegates will not change until the next elections, expected in 2011. The
decline in the "proportion of land area under forest with a closed canopy, multi-story-age profile and species
diversity, abundance and distribution," that is, the decline in the land area which is natural forest, is
certainly not a good news. However, this indicator is expected to have a very long lag time, as natural
forests do not grow in a few years. Perhaps more of an immediate concern is that official figure for this
indicator is not readily available, and that the authorities do not appear to be implementing policies that
would reverse the trend. Even though this indicator is probably not very well-adapted to measuring the
effectiveness of the policy reforms achieved through PRSCs, it would still be worthwhile to pursue dialogue
in the PRSC framework to reverse this trend of natural forestry losses.
21.     Out of the six indicators not showing progress, three are moving in the right direction, but tend to
have lumpy outcomes: these are the share of strategic investors' ownership in SOCBs, extent of unreported
public expenditure; and public agencies with internal auditing functions. Discussions between the two
equitized SOCBs, Vietcombank and Vietinbank, with potential strategic investors had been interrupted
because of the crises, but have resumed and are expected to yield results in coming months. There is
information that the discussions at Vietinbank are particularly advanced. Reforms to incorporate all state
expenditures into the reporting system are underway. The revised State Budget Law, a proposed trigger for
PRSC10 is expected to contribute further to this effort. A decree on internal audit is under preparation,
supported by a trigger in this operation. Public agencies will develop internal auditing functions when this
decree goes into effect.

22.      As for the remaining three indicators, whether they were indicators well-suited to measure the
effectiveness of PRSC policy dialogue is questionable. The number of wetlands of international importance
(measured by Ramsar criteria) is not something that can be expected to change rapidly as a result of policy
reforms. The other two indicators, provincial screening of public investment and adoption of integrated
regional screening, measure progress at sub-national levels. While central government does exert certain
amount of control on sub-national governments, decentralized structure of the government makes it unlikely
that policy changes taken at the central level will translate rapidly into outcomes at sub-national levels.

V.         LESSONS AND CONCLUSION

24.     The results of policy dialogue, measured as the share of outcome indicators that are deemed
to be making progress, are noticeably better for the business environment and social inclusion
pillars than for the natural resources and modern governance pillars. They could be due to the
choice of policy reforms pursued in the dialogue, strength and weaknesses of ministries and
agencies in charge of specific sectors, the selection of indicators, the speed at which outcomes
could be expected to improve in different areas, natural comparative advantage of the PRSC as an
instrument, effectiveness of the dialogue in a particular domain, among other things.
25.     If the goal of PRSC series is to achieve as many targets for the outcome indicators as
possible, the emphasis should shift towards the last two pillars. If the goal of policy dialogue is to
specialize in the most effective areas, the future policy dialogue should be held in business
development and social inclusion pillars.
26.     Any lesson regarding effectiveness of the policy dialogue as measured by the progress
towards achieving the indicators would remain tentative, because the attribution problem cannot be
solved and credible counterfactuals do not exist, as discussed at the outset. Whatever the merits
and shortcomings of the PRSCs, it is clear that the first three PRSCs in this cycle have
accompanied progress in diverse areas. The credits are due to the authorities who executed the
policy reforms. The lesson for development partners may be that even though the progress seems
slow at times, it is there when observed in a 3-5 year horizon. However, it is sobering that none of
the indicators for environment is making progress, and this may be one area that calls for attention
and concerted efforts in the future operations.
27.     Another type of lesson is how to choose the indicators. In retrospect, some of the indicators
were not very adapted to measuring the impact of the policy dialogue held under the PRSC
framework. These include the indicators with time-frame mismatch, such as the area of natural
forest. Another such example is the areas where no policy breakthrough was needed, such as the
share of merchandise exports to GDP. Finally, there are indicators for which data do not exist or
do not exist on a consistent basis. What was intended to be measured could have been appropriate,
but if the baseline and updated data and target value are available on a consistent basis, it is not
possible to measure any progress. This group included quality of air and surface water, as well as
the indicators based on qualitative surveys. Ideally, indicators should not be changed in mid-
program, so efforts to avoid such problems at the beginning would have been useful, as would an
early taking stock, say after the first year of the program, of availability of data, so that the
indicators might be adjusted earlier rather than later in the 5 year program cycle.

                       ANNEX 5: PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT IN VIETNAM

Recent Developments and the Way Ahead


1.     This operation provides general budget support to the Vietnamese Government and will be executed
through the Government's public financial management (PFM) systems. This annex summarizes the current
state of these systems and the ongoing reforms with the aim of assessing the attendant fiduciary risks with
respect to the proceeds of this development policy operation.


2.     Public financial management reform is one of the four focus areas of the Government's Public
Administration Reform Master Program for the period 2001-2010. Other focus areas are organizational
restructuring, pay and employment reform and institutional development. The PFM reforms have seven
priorities: budget management, revenue management, debt management, SOE fiscal risk management,
financial market supervision and government bond market development, public asset management, and
price management.


3.     Over the past decade, Vietnam has made strides in establishing a sound public financial management
system. With the adoption of the first organic budget law in 1996 and its revision in 2002, a legal
framework for public resource management has been put in place. A centralized treasury system has been
set up with branches extending from the center to all provinces and districts to provide basic essential
financial services to all government agencies. Steady progress has been achieved in making the budget
more predictable and pro-poor, and the budgeting process more transparent and participatory. Substantial
efforts have also been made in recent years to improve transparency in the use of public resources through
disclosure of information on detailed government spending as well as expenditure policies, regulations and
procedures.


4.    Public debt management has improved both in terms of legal framework and institutional
arrangements. The Debt Management Department was established in May 2009 with the role of a modern
debt management office under the MOF. Although not all of the tasks relating to public debt management
have been consolidated to this Department, the organizational structure of the department is similar to the
debt management office according to international practices, with 6 divisions functioning as front office,
one division performing the middle office functions, and one division performing the back office functions.
Meanwhile, the first-ever Law on public debt management was approved by the National Assembly in June
2009 and came into effect in 2010. The Law introduced substantial reforms in managing and monitoring
comprehensively public debt and government commitments (including domestic sub-national debts and on-
lending), and addressing many weaknesses in the public debt management in Vietnam. Special attention
was paid to strengthening risk management and developing forward-looking debt management strategy and
program.


5.     The country's public financial management system has a range of internal oversight mechanisms. In
the past, the focus was on inspection rather than systematic review to provide regular and timely feedback to
the management on the use of public resources. Internal auditing is an important element of a sound public
financial management system, which helps increase effectiveness, efficiency and financial control. This
issue becomes even more important if the government intends to decentralize further to the local levels.
Under the timeframe of this operation, the legal framework for the organization and operation of internal
audit is being developed. Although implementation will be challenging, this has been a very encouraging
step towards establishing a sound internal audit system in Vietnam in the coming years.



                                                     78
6.    There is still a number of off-budget-balance expenditures, i.e., expenditures not counted in the
calculation of the budget deficit. These include government bonds issued to finance infrastructure projects
and education facilities, recapitalization of entities such as the Vietnam Development Bank or the Vietnam
Social Policy Bank, and borrowings by sub-national governments and their affiliated entities such as local
development funds. However, these so-called off-budget expenditures in Vietnam can be considered on-
budget in several respects. They are included in the budget that is reviewed and approved by the National
Assembly, and their execution was done through the Treasury and subject to the same disclosures and
scrutiny as standard budget expenditures. There are attempts under the ongoing revision of the State Budget
Law to adjust budget structure and coverage to be more in line with the international norms.


7.    Contingent liabilities might be arising from these "off-budget-balance expenditures" and other
implicit sources. A systemic definition and a reliable estimate of such contingent liabilities are not available,
which limits the government's ability to management of such risks properly. More broadly, as Vietnam is
reaching middle-income status, it will need to engage more long-term finance from both domestic and
external sources. Under the recently improved debt management, initial attention from the government on
risk management and monitoring of contingent liabilities has been observed.


8.    The composition of public expenditure remains skewed in favor of capital expenditure. The
processes for prioritizing expenditures remain ineffective. Budgeting is done separately for capital spending
and for recurrent spending, by the Ministry/Department of Planning and Investment and by the
Ministry/Departments of Finance, respectively. The expenditure is planned annually without reference to
medium-term resource constraints due to the absence of a longer-term framework. The ongoing revision of
the State Budget Law introduces Medium-Term Fiscal and Expenditure Framework, to be mainstreamed in
the annual budget cycle. There are also initial discussions on reforming budget planning toward output- and
program-based budget elaboration.


9.    The shortcomings in Vietnam's PFM information systems, which made it difficult to monitor a fully-
consolidated budget as well as the fiscal position, are being addressed progressively. The Treasury and
Budgetary Management Information System (TABMIS) has been developed since 2007, piloted in 2009,
and recently rolled-out in central ministries and provincial and district treasury and financial agencies. It is
expected that the system will become fully operational in 2012 upon its nationwide roll-out. TABMIS will
provide the capability to record and control commitments, improve cash flow management and arrears
management, and strengthen expenditure management and controls. There are initial staged plans for
TABMIS consolidation and expansion, in both terms of both functionality and coverage, towards the
Integrated/Government Financial Management Information System (IFMIS).


10. There are also shortcomings in Vietnam's and public accounting regulations. In the past, the lack of
common accounting structures, and system of integrated, electronic data recording necessitated laborious
manual consolidation and manipulation of the data from multiple satellite databases, which resulted in
financial reporting that is neither timely nor accurate. These deficiencies contribute to the poor flow of
budgetary information between government ministries, provinces and the public. Public sector accounting
standards are still lacking, existing government accounting regimes are incomplete, and accounting practices
have yet to be aligned with international standards. In parallel with TABMIS project, a unified Treasury
and Budgetary Chart of Accounts have been developed. This has provided consistency of classification of
revenues and expenditures in budgeting, accounting and reporting with expenditures classified on an
administrative, economic and functional basis. For future TABMIS expansion, development of a unified and
uniform chart of accounts for the public sector (including the Spending Units) is now envisaged. A staged
roadmap for adoption of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) is also being
considered.


                                                       79
11. Independent scrutiny of PFM has increased, with external oversight of budgetary affairs by the
National Assembly and the recently independent State Audit of Vietnam (SAV). The functional committees
and deputies of the National Assembly, and the local People's Committees have been given greater
prominence in examining, decision-making and oversight of the state budget. There is steady expansion of
external audit coverage and quality and legislative oversight. Encouragingly, the SAV audit report was
made public for the first time in 2006, and regularly since, triggering serious debates on the usage of state
budgets. However, the capacity of these institutions, especially the SAV, is limiting the coverage and scope
of audits. It is difficult for the SAV to manage the increasing workload including compulsory audit for
100% of SOEs, and to consider the move towards performance audit.


12. There are significant weaknesses in revenue administration. Customs are still considered low
productivity, inconsistent and vulnerable to corruption. The Customs administration will need to change
significantly, shifting its mindset from a culture of domestic protection and control of all transactions to one
that facilitates foreign trade and promotes private sector development. The tax administration is also
characterized by low compliance and vulnerability towards corruption. Five areas of tax administration
have been identified as in need of special attention: (1) the fragmentation of the legal framework related to
tax administration; (2) the absence of effective coordination and information-sharing between the tax
administration and other government agencies; (3) taxpayers' lack of knowledge about the tax laws and
compliance procedures; (4) inadequate professional skills and training of tax administration; and (5)
information technology system which is lagging behind the requirements of a modern tax administration. In
addition, tax laws and policies will need further reforms to broaden the tax base, and to reduce the number
of rates and exemptions. Reforms in the management of revenue are progressing with clearer allocation
rules and decentralized responsibilities; however classification of revenue in line with international
standards needs to be introduced and enhanced consultation on revenue targets is needed to improve the
quality of revenue budgets.


13. Financial market supervision has been fragmented and government bond market is still
underdeveloped. At present, many agencies participate in financial market supervision, leading to
overlapping responsibilities and ineffective management and supervision. There is a need to consolidate
market supervision function into a single agency and to separate state management and supervision
functions. Vietnam's government bond market is still small scale, low liquidity, and the maturity structure
is skewed toward short-term. The number of market participants is relatively small and supporting
infrastructure, such as depository, clearing and information systems, is yet to be developed. Therefore,
considerable efforts are required to develop a full-fledged government bond market and coordinate it with
development of related markets such as capital, security and real estate. A bond market development
roadmap is being prepared towards these visions.


14. The Government's PFM reform program highlights that state assets budget resources and human
resources need to be managed in an integrated way for efficient and effective service delivery, and reforms
are being gradually introduced. The legal framework and market principles in asset management were
recently adopted under the Law on State Asset Management. The requirements for management reporting
systems are being defined, but reform in this area has been slow. Initially, attention is needed for developing
consistent and comprehensive asset accounting and asset management policies in line with international
standards and practices. Further study needs to be carried out to determine the most appropriate solutions to
address the government's accounting and asset management requirements.


15. Within the MOF, there is still a lack of experienced, technically-qualified and experienced managerial
staff to meet the reform challenges of the Ministry. The MOF is moving towards developing a human
resource management system which is synchronized, fair and transparent. Financial management capacity


                                                      80
constraints is a cross-cutting issue across sectors and sub-national government and support is needed to
implement decentralized PFM reforms.


16. Vietnam has increased its level of fiscal transparency. Budget plans and budget execution accounts
are being made available publicly, and there is increasing compliance with reporting regulations. However
there is still room for improvement, particularly in relation to consistency in quality of reports and their
timeliness. To enhance the quality of financial reporting, consistency between budget and accounting
classifications needs to be maintained. The number of budget execution reports needs to be rationalized.
Content and presentation of financial information needs to be improved in line with existing government
regulations in the publicly available budget execution reports to make them more informative. The
Government should start producing and issuing annual financial statements in line with international
practices. Financial reporting of the government as a whole should include cash and asset information. The
State annual accounts and financial statements need to be issued faster than the current 18 months after year
end to enhance their relevance.


17. Good progress has been made in establishing legislation and the environment for greater financial
accountability and transparency of financial information. Regulations on financial disclosures of the
State Budget Law, Accounting Law and State Audit Law have been issued increasing the scope and range of
required disclosures by entities at all levels of government. Information is being made available on public
accessible websites. However, implementation remains the challenge. To further increase transparency, the
content of budget documentation and the final accounts could be enhanced by including analysis,
explanations and information in line with international practices. Disclosure of financial information,
particularly spending at unit level should be actively monitored to ensure compliance with the enhanced
disclosure requirements. Published financial reports should be timely, and a calendar for disclosures issued
publicly.


18. Progress and impact of the PFM reforms and development initiatives are difficult to measure as there
has been no official monitoring framework, and baseline performance measures have yet to be established.
The Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) Measurement Framework provides a
recognized measurement of the performance of the public financial management of government. Similarly,
the Debt Management Performance Assessment (DeMPA), adapted from the PEFA framework, but is
focused on debt management issues, would provide a baseline assessment of debt management capacity.
Although the Government has agreed in principle to introducing these measurement frameworks through
self-assessment process, no decision on timeframe and firm commitment of resources have been made.


19. At the policy level, the series of Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs) and the recent Public
Investment Reform Loan, have been nurturing constant policy dialogue on the strategic elements of a broad
and cross-cutting reform agenda including PFM modernization. Meanwhile, these operations have been
strengthening coordination among line ministries and government agencies, and triggering chances to reach
endorsement on reforms at the highest decision-making level. At the technical level, there are currently three
active Bank-funded projects in PFM area, namely the Public Finance Management Reform, Customs
Modernization and Tax Administration Modernization projects. In addition, there are two Multi-donor Trust
Funds (MTDF) established to tackle one of the main bottlenecks in the implementation of reform in
Vietnam -- limited government capacity -- which mainly finances the needs of technical assistance and
capacity building activities, and analytical and diagnostic work laid out in the government strategy.


20. In addition, a series of AAA works have been undertaken to provide sound analytical underpinnings
to the implementation of the Government-led PFM reform program. These include the joint IMF-World
Bank study of 1999 "Towards Fiscal Transparency"; the joint 2000 Government-donor Public Expenditure

                                                     81
Review; the 2001 Country Financial Accountability Assessment; the 2002 Country Procurement
Assessment Report, and mostly recently are the joint government-donor 2004 Public Expenditure Review
and Integrated Fiduciary Assessment (PER-IFA) and the 2007 Country Financial Accountability
Assessment (CFAA). The CFAA 2007 proposes a set of recommendations to help the government design
and continue implementing reforms and capacity building programs to modernize and strengthen public
financial management and enhance transparency and accountability arrangements in support of sound
economic management and improved governance


21. There is strong ownership in the Vietnam government of the PFM reform agenda. The
government actively engages with donors and demonstrates a strong commitment to PFM reform in
Vietnam. The "Single Document" issued in 2007 articulates the government's strategy for mobilizing both
national and international resources to advance reform in PFM. Support to the implementation of reforms is
coordinated through the PFM partnership group which overarches the activities of government, donors, and
working groups, meeting half yearly to discuss progress.


Conclusion


22. Financial management and accountability systems of the Government have steadily improved, and
progress made has mitigated the risks associated with direct budget support. But there is not yet full
compliance with the new laws and regulations, and new PFM systems (such as TABMIS) and associated
reforms are still being prepared and await effective implementation. Although the public accounting system
and financial management arrangements are well documented and regulated, financial management risks
arise from gaps and overlaps in the systems, and in particular, from weaknesses in implementation and
compliance gaps.


23. The quality and extent of independent audit oversight remains low given the financial audit programs
of SAV do not as yet accord with international standards and the development of an effective internal audit
function is only at an embryonic stage in Vietnam. As assessment of the SBV internal controls is not
available as, although the SBV has been subject to audit by SAV, the results of these audits are not made
public and there is currently no IMF program in Vietnam to draw upon.


24. The overall financial management risk to properly use, control and report funds is assessed as
moderate, in line with the outcomes of the most recent CFAA. Additional fiduciary arrangements are
proposed, including a dedicated foreign exchange account and the Bank retaining the right to subject this
account to audit.

                                  Vietnam--Assessment Letter for the World Bank1
                                                 March 5, 2010


1.       Vietnam has so far managed to weather the global crisis relatively well. After a sharp slowdown
in the first quarter, economic activity picked up in the remaining quarters, and real GDP growth ended 2009
at 5¼ percent, supported by an aggressive stimulus program including monetary policy easing and a sizable
fiscal package.

2.      However, the stimulative policies and emphasis on growth resulted in imbalances and
heightened macroeconomic risks. Through end-2009, private credit grew 38 percent, the trade deficit
expanded to 9 percent of GDP, and the fiscal deficit widened to 9 percent of GDP. Inflation began to rise in
late 2009 and reached 8½ percent in February 2010. As a result, the dong came under strong depreciation
pressure during the year. Despite significant intervention by the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV), the dong
remained at the weaker end of the official band throughout the year and, by the fourth quarter, parallel
market rates dropped to the level of more than 10 percent outside the band. Gross reserves are estimated to
have fallen by around US$9 billion to US$14 billion (about two months of imports) at end-2009.

3.       Against this background, the authorities shifted their policy priorities to stability toward the
end of 2009. In late November, the government announced a number of measures, including a rise in policy
rates by 100 basis points, devaluation of the official central exchange rate by 5½ percent, and elimination of
the interest subsidy scheme for short-term loans at end-2009. While these measures helped calm the market,
private trading within the band remained very limited and parallel rates stayed outside the band. On
February 10, the SBV announced a further devaluation of the dong by 3.4 percent. The authorities have also
taken welcome steps to increase the flexibility of lending rates.

4.       A planned tightening of fiscal policy would support the process. Staff projects that the overall
fiscal deficit (including off-budget expenditure and net lending) for 2010 could decline to 6½ percent of
GDP, provided any revenue overperformance relative to the conservative budget projections is saved. Such
a deficit reduction, especially if communicated clearly, would not only help boost fiscal policy credibility,
but also support monetary management. A robust framework for financing Vietnam's public infrastructure
needs, with contributions from equitization and public-private partnerships, will be crucial to assuring the
soundness of public finances over the medium term.

5.       Safeguarding banking sector stability remains crucial. Vietnamese banks have so far
experienced limited direct effects from the global crisis. Further enhancing the SBV's bank regulation and
supervision capacity will be important for minimizing banking vulnerabilities. In this context, the SBV's
interest in participating in a Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) is welcome.

6.       The short-term outlook depends on whether the authorities can convince the market by
tangible and preemptive actions of their determination to pursue macroeconomic stability. With the
world economy beginning to show signs of recovery, the growth outlook for Vietnam is reasonably good.
Staff projects GDP growth of 6 percent for 2010, provided that firm and timely policy measures to contain
inflation and restore confidence in the dong are taken. Realizing Vietnam's good potential to sustain robust
medium-term growth will also hinge on the government's commitment to implementing sound
macroeconomic policies and to sustaining the momentum of reforms in its next five-year development plan.
