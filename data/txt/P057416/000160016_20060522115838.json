PROJECT", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The Bolivia Indigenous Peoples\n            Development Project had an unsatisfactory outcome, is\n            unlikely to be sustainable, and had a negligible\n            institutional development impact. Bank performance was\n            satisfactory and Borrower performance was unsatisfactory.\n            Several lessons were drawn from this project including the\n            following: 1) Culturally-based productive initiatives of\n            indigenous producer groups can constitute a financial and\n            economic valid alternative for improving their incomes and\n            for poverty reduction. 2) Indigenous peoples can improve\n            their incomes by accessing markets through the provision of\n            products and services that are not necessarily\n            \"indigenous.\" 3) It is useful to differentiate\n            support for productive initiatives from support for local\n            development plans. 4) Project Directorates involving social\n            organizations need to reflect the specific composition of\n            the intended beneficiaries. 5) Direct transfers induce\n            positive effects beyond the objectives of subprojects\n            themselves. Effective empowerment is a result of new-found\n            confidence in managing projects and funds, and can have\n            large spill-over effects over other areas of community life.\n            6) Training indigenous people to participate in the\n            monitoring and evaluation of poverty reduction policies is\n            an important feature for future interventions to have\n            adequate impact. 7) A project such as this, which requires\n            setting up new institutional mechanisms, and involves actors\n            with low capacities, needs to be given sufficient time for\n            implementation. Testing out and failure need to be included\n            in the design, and sufficient time needs to be allotted for\n            follow up and evaluation beyond the investment phase. 8) A\n            key lesson learned in this project is the importance of\n            proper technical assistance. 9) The failure of the use of a\n            management services entity in this particular learning\n            process should not invalidate the use of a private\n            management unit provided that adequate procedures for the\n            selection and supervision processes are followed."}, "docdt": "2006-04-18T00:00:00Z"}
