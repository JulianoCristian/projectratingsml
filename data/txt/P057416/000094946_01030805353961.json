There are three project components. The first\n            component finances as a pilot a number of demand-driven,\n            community or small-producer initiatives, which aim to\n            improve the forms and conditions in which indigenous peoples\n            produce and sell their products and services. This component\n            also includes grant financing of pre-investment studies,\n            technical assistance, small works, goods and operational\n            costs for investments. The second component supports\n            institutional strengthening and training of national level\n            indigenous/campesino organizations and their regional\n            organizations. Activities to be strengthened include\n            operational monitoring, collection of basic information\n            needed for the learning process, participatory evaluation,\n            and feedback into the poverty reduction strategy's\n            social control mechanism. Assistance and training funded by\n            this component covers the hiring of consultants, training\n            and consultation workshops for project evaluation and\n            learning and for PRS adjustment, specialists to coordinate\n            the monitoring and learning process, designing and operating\n            a monitoring and evaluation system, and contracting for an\n            independent impact evaluation study. The third component\n            funds project coordination, financial administration, market\n            and demand studies, and equipment."}, "docdt": "2001-01-25T00:00:00Z"}
