India will provide continuing assistance initiated under\n            earlier credits to two states (Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat) to\n            expand and improve their social forestry activities, and\n            will initiate investment in two other states (Himachal\n            Pradesh and Rajasthan). It will increase supplies of fuel\n            wood, small timber, poles, bamboo, fodder, and other minor\n            forest products. It will also strengthen institutional\n            capabilities including the strengthening of the central\n            social forestry support office for better planning and\n            management of forestry resources, through provision for\n            additional staff, training of existing personnel, research\n            and additional vehicles, and equipment.
