The Dez irrigation\n            area is located in the upper Khuzestan on both banks of the\n            Dez river, about 120 kilometer (km) north of Ahwaz and has\n            about 125,000 hectares of irrigable land. Land leveling and\n            the re-alignment, improvement and construction of farm\n            irrigation channels, which were to be the responsibility of\n            the land owners with technical assistance provided by\n            consultants under the project, were delayed due to changes\n            brought about by the land reform program in the 1960s. The\n            next phase in the development of the project area, which\n            came to be called stage one, included the construction of a\n            re-regulating dam and a diversion dam near Dezful with\n            canals, drains, irrigation distribution systems, flood\n            protection works, and maintenance roads to serve an\n            additional 37,000 hectares. In early 1972, the Bank\n            appraised what was called stage two of the total project\n            area. This was envisaged as a project to provide irrigation\n            to the remaining 27,000 hectares not covered under other\n            projects, thus fully utilizing the irrigation water\n            resources of the Pahlavi dam. In 1972 the International\n            Finance Corporation approved a loan of United States (U.S.)\n            l. 25 million dollars for one of the agribusinesses involved\n            in the project area. The agribusinesses in the project area\n            were partly financed later on with Bank funds through two of\n            the three loans to what came to be called the Agricultural\n            Development Bank of Iran. This project completion report\n            relates specifically to Loan 594-IRN which helped finance\n            stage one. This report makes extensive reference to all\n            aspects in its effort to comprehend the results of\n            irrigation development in the Khuzestan area."}, "docdt": "1979-06-29T00:50:00Z"}
