During its appraisal\n            of the project the Bank concluded that there were serious\n            doubts about the justification of the irrigation portion of\n            the project and finally agreed with the Government to\n            finance only the Dez Pilot Irrigation Project (DPIP) of\n            20,000 hectares. This was included in Loan 247-IRN, male in\n            1960. The intention in financing only the DPIP was to test\n            on a relatively small scale, before proceeding to consider ~\n            larger investment, the capacity of the Government, the\n            landowners and the tenant farmers to solve the\n            organizational, administrative and technical problems\n            involved in transforming a very backward area to achieve\n            agricultural production at the level .needed to justify the\n            cost of development. The measures required to overcome the\n            problems had never before been introduced nor even attempted\n            in Iran. This paper examines the measures applied, assesses\n            their effectiveness and describes, in relation to the\n            experience of the DPIP, some additional measures on the\n            application of-which the Bank has now obtained assurances\n            from the Government for the new loan for the construction of\n            the first phase (stage one) of the larger development."}, "docdt": "1969-03-24T23:06:02Z"}
