                     The Dez Pilot Irrigation Project (DPIP)


    1.   Introduction
               As presented to the Bank by the Government of Iran in 1957-1958
    _for consideration for financing, the Dez M.tltipurpose Project included the
0   irrigation of about ll0,000 hectares. During its appraisal of the project
    the Bank concluded that there.were serious doubts about the justification
    of the irrigation portion of the project and finally agreed with the Govern-
    ment to finance only the Dez Pilot Irrigation Project (DPIP) of 20,000 hec-
    tares. This was included in Loan 247-IRN, male in 1960. The intention in
    financing only the DPIP was to test on a relatively small scale, before
    proceeding to consider ~ larger investment, the capacity of the Government,
    the landowners and the tenant farmers to solve the organizational, adminis-
    trative and technical problems involved in transforming a very backward
    area to achieve agricultural production at the level .needed to justify the
    cost of development. The measures required to overcome the problems had
    never before been introduced nor even attempted in Iran.
              This paper examines the measures applied, assesses their.effec-
    tiveness and describes, in relation to the experience of the DPIP, some
    additional measures on the application of-which the Bank has now obtained
0   assurances from the Government for the new loan.for the construction of the
    first phase (Stage I) of the larger development.     .
    2a   The Problems
         (a)   Background
              The project area, consisting of deep alluvial soils depleted by
    centuries of cropping, had been irrigated for thousands of years by primi-
    tive systems fed from run-of-the-river water. Farming practices were
    backward and crop yields low even compared with other parts of Iran. The
    rural population, living under very insanitary conditions in mud-brick vil-
    lages, was largely illiterate and disease-ridden. Most of the land was
    privately owned by a few large family clans,.who cultivated it through
    tenants under a crop-sharing system based on five production factors: land,
    water, draft animals, seed and labor. The production of the land, estimated
    at 110 million rials on the 20,000 ha of the project, was largely consumed
    for the subsistence of the tenants and. the landowners, the surplus being
    sold in poorly~organized local markets. The tenant was usually in a poor
    bargaining position at the time of sale because of his ignorance and h1debtad-
    ness to the merchants o
                                         - 2 -


              The.Bank recognized that a very large effort by Governnent in
    organization and administration, a substantial investment and an equally
    formidable organization by the landowners and a greatly increased labor
    effort by the tenant farmers would be necessary to achieve the production
    increases required to · justi.:f,'y the investment needed to transform the irri-
    gation system~ ·
        (b)   Specific Problems
              (i)     Landowner Participation
                      The landowners would have to participate fully in the de-
              velopment by investing in on-farm development including irrigaM.on
              channels, buildings and farm machinery and by organizing and ma-
              naging their lands much better than they or aeybody else in Iran
0             had previously done. This would require, amorigst other things,
              hiring and training a large staff of supervisors, foremen and
              mechanics. At the time of appraisal the landowners had not been
              informed of their obligations nor of any incentives there .might
              be to encourage them to participate.
               (ii)    Assess~nt o~   a Water Charge
                         Landowners had previously provided water to their tenants
               through the existing systems a.nd had been compensated by receiv-
               ing a,n additional share of the tenant farniers 1 crop. The replace-
               ment of this system by a per-hectare charge, wh:i,.ch the Bank con-
               sidered the most effective means of assuring full utilization
               of the land, had not been considereQ. by the Government nor had
               it been discussed with the landowners, and there was no law
               under which. such a charge could be established and enforced.
0              (iii)     Improvement of Land .Tenure System
                         The existing system.provided inadequate incentive to
               tenant farmers to improve productivity but no alternative
               system had been agre~d with the landowners.
               (iv)    Establishment of an Qperating Agency
                           The new facilities to be constructed under the project
                 would have to be operated and maintained by an agency responsible
              ·. for water deliveries to farm boundaries • Iran had no previous
                 exper~ence of the organization and operation of such an authority,
                 whose responsibilities would have to include, in addition to
                 the irrigation system, the operatiQn of a research station, an
                 extension service, a training center and probably a village
                 development service. These functions would require a l~ge
                 staff, all, the senior mem'Qerf! of which would have to be expatriates.
                 The autJ:iority would als9 4av~ to·pJ;'OV'ide for services such as
                 road~, scho0ls apd a public hea+th program.                       ·
                                             - 3 -


                  (v)    Credit Facilities
                          A new system was needed to provide long-term credit
                 to landowners for land imp:rovement and mechanization and
                 working capital to landowners and tenants.            ·
                  (vi)   Marketing
                           A satisfactory marketing system would have to be
                  established after necessary studies had been made.
    ·3·   The Measures Applied and Their Effectiveness
          (a)    Landowner Participation
0             As a condition of disbursement for the irrigation portion of the
    loan (except for consultants• fees, to which the restriction did not apply),
    the Bank required the Government to produce evidence that landowners would
    cooperate in the project to utilize the irrigation water effectively. This
    evidence was produced in August 1961 and the irrigation portion of the loan
    became effective in September 1961.
              The Land Reform Law (Phase I was decreed in January 1962 and
    Phase II in July 1964) brought about great and sudden changes in the project
    area. It changed the status of the landomers and gave security of tenure
    to the tenants. However, it introduced uncertainties and unforeseen prob-
    lems which delayed the implementation of the project through depriving
    landowners of incentives to make long-term investments in their land. On-
    farm development work was affected immediately and doubts by tenants and
    landowners as to the wisdom of this investment in the new circumstances
    kept the rate of progress low until the project authority introduced finan-
0   cial assistance measures in 1967.
           (b)   Establishment of Project Authority
              The Plan Organization, which had prepared the project, continued
    to have responsibility for its initial implementation, with the' assistance
    of consultants. The Khuzestan Water and Power Authority (KWPA) was estab-
    lished, under a charter approved by the Baruc, in 1960 and assumed full
    responsibility from then onwarc1s. The consultants, Development and Resources
    Corporation (D & R), USA, were retaj,ned to provide project management and,
    with the assistance of Nederlandsche Heidemaatschappij, Holland, ~s sub-
    contractors to them, to design and supervise construction. During the early
    years of project implementation project management functions were provided
    almost whoJJw by D & R, .but as 13taff were trained KWPA assumed greater
    responsibility until by 1966 Iranian staff had filled all but six of the
    179 staff positions in the DPIP (see Annex 1).
              A Bank supervision mission at tr.ds time reported that KWPA had
    created an excellent organization, through which improved farming practices
                                           - 4-


    (improved seeds, chemical fertjJizers, pesticides, mechanization, better
    irrigation methods and supervised credit system) had been extended to a large
    portion of t.he primitive farm commupity within a short period of time.
              The activities of KWPA•s DPIP Division included at this :time:
              (:i:) Field Trial    Farm·

                       160 ha· of irrigated land in the center of the DPIP, 1
              on which eJCper:i,Irientation on new variet~es and crops and better
              cultural practices for the traditional· crops were being car-
              ried out by Iranian staff under expatriate stJpemsion.
              (ii)    Village Production Service
0                      Entirely staffed· by Iranians, the- Service had one
              supervisor, five village agent leaders, 37 village agents
              and small labor crews for teaching i.rnproved practices to
              farmers. Amongst other activities it prepared farm plans
              for all villages for both suinmer 'and winter crops~
              (iii)    Farm Equipment Service.
                       Also staffed entirely by Iranians, this Service had
              over forty tractors together with combine-harvesters and a
              wide range of other equipment which by 1966 was undertaking
              mechanized cultivation work on.about 10,000 ha under credit
              arrangements.
              (iv)    Livestock Service

0                       Providing vaccination q.nd advice on improvement of
              animal s::µl:itation and upgrading of livestock.
                               '                   '

              ( v}    Irrigation Operation and Maintenance Service
                         Consisting of an all-Iranian technical staff of about
              20 men, responsible for delivering regulated flow of water to
              all head.gates serving all farm land in the DPIP and maintain-
              ing the canal and water control system and the roads. In
              addition, it ma.de hydrological and cliinatological observations
              an:I recordingse               ·
              (vi)    Education and Health Services
                       By 1966, 31 of the 58 villages in the DPIP had been
              provided witp schools, as against two prior to the project.
              Public bathhouses "With adjoining health clinics, staffed by
              a village health agent~ had been built in t,be five largest.
                                      - 5-

               villages, and four mobile health clinics served the other
               villages. Active campaigns were being carried out against
               malaria, bilharzia and trachoma. Statistics gathered by
               the clinics showed a definite improvement in nutrition and
               in material well-being in the area.

               (vii) Agricultural Credit Service
                         Providing supervised credit to over 90% of the farmers,
               on the. basis of production plans made by the Village Production
               Service. The repayment record was not very good, however,
               being 80% of loans due for repayment at the time of the report,
               and reflecting difficulties whi~h the Bank considered were
               likely to increase as the scale of lending was enlarged.
         (c)   On-farm Development
0             It had been intended that land levelling and the realigment,
    improvement and new construction of farm irrigation channels would be done
    by the landowners, with technical assistance provided under the project by
    the consultants. It was assumed that the work, including 18,140 ha of
    land levelling, would be completed by 1964. In the meantline the existing
    farm channels wou~d continue to be used for irrigation.
              However, by 1966 on-farm development had been completed on only
    about 530 hi:i., of .which 200 ha was in the Field Trial Farm. By 1968 the
    total area which had been levelled and provided with a well-planned system
    of irrigation channels was only 1,500 ha.             ·
              The main reason for this slow progress was the uncertainty of
    tenure and consequent lack of incentive to invest in land development after
    the application of the Land Reform Act. A second reason was the lack of
    clear land oW'pership •. Twenty-five percent of the land in the project area,
0   having been sold to farmers, i-las now owned communally by the village. A
    consensus of all owners in such villages was needed before land levelling
    could be done. Fifty-eight percent of the land was beipg leased by land...
    owners to farmers on JO-year leases.. The approval of the landlord - and
    arrangements as to cost-sharing - were necessary before this leased land
    could be levelled. Reluctance to level land also arose from the high cost
    of the operation (then e~timated at US$ 120 to 140 per ha), inadequately
    demonstrated benefits from the operation under the prevailing tenure ar-
    rangements and cropping pattern, lack of financial resources and failure
    to allocate benefits and costs adequately between· the parties concerned.
              In 1967, KWP/i. introduced financial assistance measures and en-
    larged its force-account.land development section to speed up the work.
    The rate of progress then improved, but was still un;:iatisfactory at the
    close of 1968.
                                    . - 6 -


         (d) Marketing Service
              Relatively slow development of agricultural production in the
    early years of the project, due largely to the slow rate of on..farm develop ..
    ment, led to a decision by KWPA, supported by Bank missions, that it was
    premature to develop a marketing assistance service until production in-
    creased greatly. Some attempt was made to study marketing needs in 1964,
    but no marketing assistance service was set up.
         (e) Adoption of Water Charges
                    KWPA's charter gave them the power to levy water charges
    three years after the commencement of regulated water supply. Difficulties
    e~'Perienced initially with landowners about the value of their existing
    water rights having been resolved, KWPA commenced collecting· charges in 1968.

    4. Project Implementation
        (a.)   Cropping Patterns
              At the time of appraisal in 1959, winter cropping was projected
    to reach 11,900 ha and summer cropping 14,900 ha by 1973, at a cropping
    intensity of 134%. The actual average area under cultivation for the two
    years 1965/66-1966/67 was 14,770 ha of winter crops and 6,510 ha of sunnner
    crops, at a cropping intensity of 106%. Details are shown in Annex 2.
              The cropping pattern by 1967 stiJJ. consisted almost entirely of
    the traditional crops. Though a wide range of new crops, including sugar-
    beet, oilseeds, fibers, vegetables and citrus, has been tested in the Field
    Trial Farm, the slow progress of on-farm development work was acting as a
    constraint on the adoption of the improved irrigation methods which would
0   make the cultivation of such crops, especiaD.y summer crops, possible.
        (b)    Yields
               The projections of yields made in the appraisal report of major
    crops for 1966 and 1973 and the achievement by the 1966/67 crop year are
    shown in .Annex 3. By 1966/67, the yields projected for that year for wheat,
    beans and sesame had been exceeded handsomely and those for barley and rice
    had been almost achieved. The remaining crop shown in the project, cotton,
    had not been grown on a field scale. Yields were projected on the assump-
    tion that the irrigation distribution system would be completed in 1963;
    in fact, the work was not completed until 1965-66 and thus results far
    exceeded expectations. Though the improvements in yield were significant
    they were still at a low level compared with some other countries with
    similar agricultural conditions.

          (c)   Construction of Project Works
               The DPIP portion of the project was scheduled for ~ompletion in
     19630 Delays in construction occurred due to the inexperience of the
     Iranian contractors. KWPA was obliged to carry out some of tlJ.e work by
     force account, after canceJJ.ing contracts as a result o~ non-performance
     by contractors. The works were not completed until 1966.
          (d)   Project Costs
                Annex 4 compares the costs estimated at the time of appraisal
      (total, US$ 26e4 m:iJ.lion) with actual costs (total, US$ 27.3 million) as
      reported in 19680 The estimates included US$ 1.9 m:illion for land-level-
    - ling but only US$ Oo2 mil],ion was spent, on 3% of the estimated worl{. Had
      all the land~levelling been done, it is est:ima.ted that total project costs
0     would have been US$ 32.3 million, 22% higher than the estimatese
     5.   Lessons of the DPIP
               As-a result of experience gained in the DPIP the following pro-
     visions were included in the Dez Irrigation Project, Stage I (DIP) :
          (a)   Construction of project facilities
                 KWPA will continue to retain D & R as project consultants., The
     Bank will be given an opportunity to corriment upon the consultants' key
     personnel. KWPA will set up a project planning office to plan and coordi-
     nate the construction work and the agricultural development. Because the
     project will make heavy demands on their organization and management capa-
     city,, .the Bank has reque~ted KWPA, and they have agreed,, not to embark
     upon Stage II of. the project without the approval of the Banko
0         (b)   On-farm development
                lrifa.ter distribution channels down to field level will be con-
     structed_, and land-levelling carried out,by KWPA under the project on all
     irrigable land which will be farmed by improved traditional methods both
     in the lands served by the new irrigation system and in the DPIP ..
          (c)   Cost Estimates
               In 1960 there was no basis of experience on which cost estimates
     could be constructed. Actual costs, including both unit costs,and per ha
     costs have proved to be higher than the 1960 conjectures. This has been
     taken into account in the new project.

            (d)        Operatiop and maint.ena.I}Clj! Of J?rOject facilities

                    The need £or close supervision ot operating procedures and dili-
        gent. maint.enahce was recognized and provided £or. In particu1ar; KWPA will
        Inaintain all lesser irrigation and drainage channels, including distribu• .
        taries and ~or drains, in thB interests of efficient use of water, until
        such time as t~e farmers are capable of undertaking the work efficiently
        themselves. A special study will be made by the consultants of the functions
        of the Agricu1tural Semces Department and a detailed plan of operations
        prepared br July 1969 for the consideration of the· Bank.               ·
            ( e) · AfWicultural Gredit .
                   KWPA will e:rigage an experienced firm of consultants accepj;able
        to. the Bank to investigate the credit o.rganization, policy and capital re•
    0   quiremants needed for a satisfactory credit program. KWPA will also make
        adequate provision, ·under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank, for
        the agricultur~ cJ;"edit. requirements revealed by the study and as agreed by
        the Bank. Special attention will be paid to the prQVision of credit for
        farmers to purchase farm machinery, finance fol' which is included in the
