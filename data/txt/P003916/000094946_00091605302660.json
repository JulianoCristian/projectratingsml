In addition, the performances of\n            both the Bank, and Borrower were rated as satisfactory,\n            given the strong, and continuous dialogue with the\n            Government, who focused on much more than the agreed project\n            objectives, identifying sector issues discussed with the\n            State Electricity Corporation. Lessons reinforce the need\n            for full Government commitments, to enhance coordination\n            among suppliers, contractors, consultants, and donors, and\n            achieve appropriate management capacity. Conversely, the\n            successful Bank responsiveness to the financial crisis,\n            through an increase of loan disbursement percentages for\n            local expenditures, was instrumental in avoiding potential\n            delays due to shortage of counterpart funds. But, realistic,\n            and sound project cost estimates would have certainly\n            avoided the large amounts of loan cancellations.\n            Furthermore, the high cost of the Independent Power Producer\n            to meet its financial objective, indicate the need for risk\n            analysis, and, the use of a \"rate of return on revalued\n            assets\" covenant to measure financial performance, is\n            not appropriate for an entity with a very large investment program."}, "docdt": "2000-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
