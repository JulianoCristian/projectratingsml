The findings of the Thematic Overview suggest\n            that the radically changed circumstances in the Indonesian\n            power sector, are conducive to the Bank's continuing\n            reluctance to support new generation projects, which may\n            have to be reconsidered, and alternative ways of structuring\n            mixed public-private generation projects need to be\n            explored. Lessons drawn from the performance assessment of\n            these two projects include: 1) meticulous coal quality\n            monitoring is essential for a plant where minor differences\n            in coal characteristics can have a significant impact on\n            boiler efficiency, with substantial financial consequences;\n            2) a secure long-term supply contract for coal with the\n            optimal characteristics for the Suralaya boilers may justify\n            the payment of a price premium, because of the financial\n            consequences of a poorer heat rate, plant unavailability due\n            to more frequent outages, and increased maintenance costs;\n            3) an automatic tariff adjustment mechanism can only operate\n            satisfactorily under relatively stable macroeconomic\n            conditions: variations in the exchange rate, fuel prices,\n            and inflation, cannot be dealt with, through a technical\n            formula that is de-linked from socio-political\n            considerations; and, 4) project objectives should be\n            directly linked to project components. Furthermore, compared\n            to Specific Investment Loans, an Adaptable Program Loan\n            would appear to be a more appropriate lending instrument for\n            the pursuit of sector reforms that require consensus\n            building, and are particularly suitable instruments in\n            countries where the Bank has a regular sequence of lending\n            operations in the same sector."}, "docdt": "2003-05-21T00:00:00Z"}
