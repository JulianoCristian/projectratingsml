MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED L(,AN TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA FOR
THE SURALEYA THERMAL POWER PRO_JECT
1.    The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Republic of Indonesia for $423.6 million is submitted for approval. The proposed
Bank loan would be for 20 years, including five years of grace, at the Bank's
standard variable interest rate and would help finance the Suralaya Thermal Power
Project. The proceeds of the loan would be onlent to the State Electricity
Corporation (PLN) for 20 years including a grace period of five years; the
onlending rate would be equal to the Bank's standard variable rate on the loan,
plus a variable fee equal to the average of the annual rate of change in the
value of Rupiah during the previous three years with respect to the U.S. dollar,
plus one percent. The Government will bear the foreign exchange risk. The
project will be cofinanced by the Asian Development Bank ($350 million), Germany
(about $70 million) and export credits (about $693 million).
Backcround
2.    Indonesia is richly endowed with energy resources including oil, gas, coal,
hydropower and geothermal energy. To maintain the level of its export earnings,
a major objective of the Government's energy policy has been to diversify
domestic energy consumption away from heavy reliance on petroleum products
towards alternative and more econom.ical fuels for which there is a nonexportable
surplus (gas and coal) or which are nontradeable (hydropower and geothermal).
The power subsector is playing an important role in this respect. It offers a
sizeable market for alternative fuels, and allows their development to take
advantage of economies of scale in production and transportation infrastructure.
3.    Indonesia's electric power subsector comprises:  (i) PLN, the State
Electricity Corporation, with 9,100 MW of installed capacity, (ii) captive plants
installed by private parties for their own use, with about 6,800 MW of capacity,
(iii) a small number of rural electric cooperatives, and (iv) a large number of
informal microenterprises providing electricity to clusters of customers in rural
villages not served by PLN. PLN's supply facilities have grown rt 'idly during
the past decade. Its installed capacity increased by 255 percent, to 9.1 GW; its
sales grew by 320 percent, to 27.7 TWh; the number of consumers grew 317 percent,
to 11.5 million. Despite this rapid growth, the per capita electricity
consumption in Indonesia in 1990/91 was only about 250 kWh, compared to 450-550
kWh per capita in the Philippines and Thailand, and about 300-350 kWh in India
and Pakistan which have lower per capita income than Indonesia. Only about 30
percent of all households in Indonesia are electrified. PLN's current targets
for 1999/2000 are to increase installed capacity to about 24.0 GW, and the share
of electrified households to 56 percent.
Sector Issues and Stratecw
4.    The objectives that the Government has set for the power subsector are to
improve the welfare of the population and to support the growth of economic
activity by meeting electricity requirements in an efficient and reliable manner.
The sector is also being used as a primary means to substitute oil consumption in
the domestic market by alternative, more economical fuels, such as natural gas,



- 2 -
coal, hydro power and geothermal. The stratec,_ in the power subsector is being
focussed on strengthening the technical, commercial and financial capability of
PLN to ~jonstruct, operate and maintain efficiently the growing electricity
network. The priority issues being addressed in the power subsector include
(i) development of a stable long-term financial framework for meeting PLN's
investment requirements, and improvement in PLN's internal cash generation
capacity; (ii) promotion of efficiency by increasing the financial and managerial
autonomy and accountability of PLN, and decentralization of authority within the
organization; and (iii) promotion of private sector participation in the
development of the power subsector to achieve competition and additionality.
These issues are being addressed through policy dialogue and lending operations.
Experience With Past Operations in the Sector
5.    Since 1969, the Bank has financed a series of power projects to help PLN
expand its generation, transmission and distribution facilities in a least-cost
manner by, inter alia, diversifying its sources of fuel and taking advantage of
geothermal and 1.1droelectric resources. These projects, and the technical
assistance that was provided concomitantly, have also enhanced PLN's
institutional capabilities in many areas of utilities operation and management,
including project implementation. The Bank's support has also focussed on
developing PLN into a modern and efficient utility by: (a) strengthening PLN's
financial performance; (b) strengthening technical and corporate planning;
(c) improving operating efficiency; and (d) developing human resources. Project
Performance Audit Reports (PPARs) and Prcject Completion Reports have been issued
for the first eleven power projects in Indonesia. The lessons drawn from these
are consistent with international experience reviewed in OED's report of 1990,
entitled "Evaluation Results for 1988: Issues in World Bank Lending Over Two
Decades", that evaluated the outcome of 180 Bank-financed projects from 1974 to
1988. The OED report recognized the impo:tance of adequate electricity tariffs
for good financial performance and highlighted the following as other major
factors contributing to satisfactory performance: (a) continuing efforts for
strengthening institutional capacity; (b) taking steps for timely project
implementation, including procurement and land acquisition; and (c) providing
greater financial and operational autonomy for the utility. These lessons have
been taken into account in the design of the proposed project.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
6.    The rationale for Bank involvement with the proposed project arises not
only from the financing requirements of Indonesia's large power program to meet
its development objectives but also from the need to continue developing PLN into
a modern, commercially oriented utility. The Bank has been financing a large
proportion of PLN's facilities and assisting in building up PLN's institutional
capabilities. The proposed project would continue implementation of this
strategy by ensuring that adequate generating capacity is available to meet
increases in electricity demand. The project would also provide a vehicle for
initiating changes in PLN's institutional structure to promote greater
efficiency, furthering the dialogue on the strategy for financing the power
sector investment program and making progress towards establishing a mechanism
for formula-based periodic adjustment of electricity tariffs.



- 3-
Proiect Obiectives and Description
7.    The objectives of the project are to:  (a) expand PLN's generating capacity
in Java; (b) promote economic use of coal for electricity generation; (c) develop
PLN's institutional capacity to operate and maintain thermal power plants; and
(d) strengthen PLN's financial position. To achieve these objectives, the
proposed project will improve PLN's institutional capability by greater
decentralization and delegation, eliminate subsidy in the Bank funds onlent by
GOI to PLN, and enhance dialogue on the appropriate size of the investment
program in the sector, related financing strategy and a mechanism for periodic,
formula-based adjustment of electricity price. The project includes: (a) the
construction of three coal-fired units (Nos. 5, 6 and 7) of 600 NW each at
Suralaya, including associated works and a 500 kV transmission line from Cilegon
to Cibinong, with associated substations; (b) consulting services for
engineering, design and construction supervision of the proposed units; (c)
feasibility study for a high voltage submarine cable link between Java and
Sumatra; (d) engineering and design of a thermal power plant at Banjarmasin in
South Kalimantan; (e) consulting services for PLN's institutional development;
and (f) training of PLN's staff in public utility practices. The proposed Bank
loan would help finance procurement of goods and works, consulting services and
training costs. Schedule B provides the details of the items proposed to be
financed by the Bank and the cofinanciers. The total financing requirement for
the project is estimated at $2,360.5 million equivalent, with a foreign cost
component of $1,976.3 million (83.7%), including interest during construction. A
breakdown of cost and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and
methods of procurement, allocation of the loan proceeds and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events
and the status of Bank Group operations in Indonesia are given in Schedules C and
D respectively. Relevant maps are also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No.
10550-IND dated June 3, 1992 is being distributed separately.
Environmental Aspects
8.    The project will be designed, constructed, and operated to ensure
compliance with the applicable environmental regulations and guidelines of the
Bank as well as of the Government of Indonesia. Detailed Environment Impact
Assessment studies have been carried out with respect to air pollution, water
pollution and factors affecting other ecological aspects. The main environmental
impacts of the project are: (a) emission of sulphur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen
and dust into the atmosphere, as products of combustion of coal in the steam-
generators; (b) pollution due to discharge of warmer cooling water into the sea,
discharge of liquid effluents from the chemical processes in the plant, and
runoff water from the ash disposal and coal storage areas; and (c) use of land
for laydown area and for the construction of the transmission lines. The air
quality standards will be maintained by using low sulphur coal (0.5% or less),
having electrostatic precipitators remove 99.5% of the particulates from the flue
gas and wide dispersal of emissions with stack heights of 275 meters. No flue
gas desulphurization is found necessary. Air quality monitoring stations will be
established at selected locations to confirm compliance with the regulations,
during the plant operation. The thermal pollution will be minimized by ensuring
that the temperature rise in the mass of sea water closest to the plant does not
exceed 2° C. All liquid effluents from the plant, the coal yard and the ash
disposal area will be treated and neutralized in a waste water treatment plant,
prior to discharging them to the sea. Acquisition of about 15 ha. of
agricultural land, adjacent to the plant, will be required for use as a laydown



area for construction equipment and materials. the land is owned by about 60
families of whom six reside on the land. For tle transmission line, only the
land required for locating the towers will be acquired. Compensation and
rehabilitation of the affected families will be carried out in accordance with
plans to be approved by the Bank. An Environmental Assessment Summary for the
project was circulated to the Board on June 5, 1991 (Sec.M 91-708). Appropriate
consultations with local communities have been carried out.
Sustainabilitv
9.    The projecz. is designed to meet the expected electricity demand in a least
cost manner and operate for over twenty five years. The revenue from the sale of
electricity would be adequate to meet all the financial costs for operation,
maintenance and debt service, and also generate profits. PLN has adequately
trained staff and competent management to operate the proposed facilities
efficiently.
Ptooram Obiectives
10.   The project will create necessary infrastructure to sustain the economic
development and welfare of the people. It is designed to be environmentally
safe.
Actions Aqreed
11.   The followinq agreements were reached during the negotiations of the
proposed loan.
(a) With GO! (i) Cofinancing for the transmisfion component to be effective by
December 31, 1993; (ii) export credits for the steam generators and associated
equipment to be effective by September 30, 1993j (iii) submission of proposals by
September 30, 1993 'or periodic formula-based ti:iff adjustment; (iv) take all
such actions as shall be necessary to enoure th!t the transfer of profits from
PLN to DPS (Overall Development Fund) shall not prevent PLN from implementing the
agreed investment program.
(b)  With PLN  (1) Adopt and implement measures that will enhance PLNks
institutional efficiency; (ii) procure coal for Suralaya units 5, 6 and 7 using
procurement procedures satisfactory to the Bank; (iii) operate Suralaya Thermal
Power Plant to comply with environmental guidelines satisfactory to the Bank;
(iv) establish air quality monitoring stations at selected locations;
(v) improve coal receiving, ash disposal and dust control facilities at Suralaya;
(vi) award contracts for goods, works and consultant services in accordance with
an agreed schedule; (vii) compensate and rehabilitate the families affected by
land acquisition, in a manner satisfactory to the Bank; and (viii) appoint a
senior manager to coordinate project implement-ation.
12.   The following agreements, in substance the same as those under the ongoing
Power Transmission Project (Loan 3349-IND), were also agreed under the proposed
project: (i) annual review of PLN's investment program; (ii) audited accounts
and reports; (iii) revenue requirements; (iv) debt limitation; (v) long run
marginal cost and tariff review; (vi) financing planning; and (vii) asset
revaluation.



- 5 -
13.   The project was approved for implenentatio!i by the Central Commission for
Environment, Ministry of Mines and Energy, GOI on December 9, 1991.  Subsequent
supplementary air quality studies have resulted in the change of stack heights
from 250 meters to 27s meters, and reduction in the maximum sulphur content of
coal from 0.7% to 0.5%. These changes have also been approved by the Central
Commission for Environment. Submission of a document indicating ouch reapproval
will be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan. In addition,
execution of a subsidiary loan agreement between GOI and PLN satisfactory to the
Bank and effectiveness of the proposed ADS loan for the project will be
conditions of effectiveness of the proposed loan.
Benefits
14.   The project would help PLN supply electricity And meet increases in
electricity demand. The project would also help strengthen PLN's financial
position by supporting the development of a mechanism for the periodic adjustment
of electricity tariffs, and improve its institutional capL.ilities.  The intorna'.
economic rate of return (lERR) for PLN's 'nvestment program in Java for 1991/92-
1997/98, which includes the proposed project, is 20 percent; it would be 11
percent, if the consumer surplus was excluded from the benefits.
Risks
1S.   The main risk relates to possible delays in implementing the large project,
due to slow procurement actions and ineffective coordination of different
implementation activities. PLN has agreed to ensure effective coordination of
implementation activities through its central Directorate of Construct'-on and by
the appointment of a senior manager as project coordinator.
Recommendation
16.   I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the
proposed loan.
