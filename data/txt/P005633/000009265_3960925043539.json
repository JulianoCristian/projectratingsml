The\n            original closing date was December 31, 1983, but was\n            extended four times up to December 31, 1986. This paper\n            represents the Bank's view of the Project rather than\n            an overview of the National Bank of Tunisia (BNT) Completion\n            Report. The main objectives of the Third Agricultural Credit\n            Project in Tunisia were to increase agricultural production\n            and incomes of small and medium farmers as well as to\n            improve the system of agricultural credit distribution by\n            strengthening the agricultural credit operations of the\n            borrower, BNT. Analysis by BNT of the project results\n            indicates that the objectives of increased agricultural\n            production and incomes, particularly of the target group of\n            small and medium farmers, were largely surpassed. The\n            project can also take responsibility for improving\n            agricultural credit delivery, its other main objective. The\n            sustainability of benefits from the project should be good,\n            both for the benefits of the investments financed by the\n            sub-loans and for the benefits realized by BNT. For the\n            farmers, unless relative prices were to change dramatically\n            against them, they should be able to realize high rates of\n            return from their investments and to repay their sub-loans.\n            For BNT and for agricultural credit delivery in general, the\n            improvements in BNT's operations and in its loan\n            recoveries should continue into the indefinite future."}, "docdt": "1991-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
