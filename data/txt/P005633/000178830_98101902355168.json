"The Third Agricultural Credit Project\n            will finance part of BNT's agricultural three-year\n            lending program for medium and long-term credit to small and\n            medium farmers, production and service cooperatives,\n            commercial farmers, and agro-industries. It will also\n            provide for the strengthening of BNT's and the Ministry\n            of Agriculture's credit extension program. The Third\n            Agricultural Credit Project will improve the organization\n            and effectiveness of BNT's agricultural lending\n            operations. The incomes of the direct credit beneficiaries,\n            about 2,250 small and medium farmers, 900 large farmers, the\n            members of 170 production cooperatives and 25 service\n            cooperatives will be substantially increased. This will\n            affect about 11,800 farm families totalling 70,000 members\n            of whom 43 percent, or 30,000, are expected to come from the\n            target group. About 1,100 permanent jobs, 900 seasonal jobs\n            and 1,200 man-years of additional family labor will be\n            generated from investments in farm development. This\n            employment generation will affect another 12,000 people in\n            farm families, of whom about 11,000 are expected to come\n            from the target group."}, "docdt": "1980-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
