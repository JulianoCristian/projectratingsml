POR A TRRELTIOIS POJCT
1.       The following memorandum aud recommendation on a proposed
development credit to Benin for SDR 12.5 million ($16 million equivalent)
is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA
terms with 40 years maturity and would help to finance the rehabilitation
and extension of the telecommunications network. The project would be
cofinanced by the African Development Bank for SDR 12.5 million ($16.0
million equivalent), the European Investnent Bank for SDR 10.9 million ($14
million equivalent), the Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Econamique of
France for SDR 7.0 million ($9.0 million equivalent), the Ponds d'Aide et
de Cooperation of France for SDR 0.2 million ($0.3 million equivalent) and
the Canadian International Development Agency for SDR 2.7 million ($3.5
million equivalent).
2.       Background.  There has been significant recent investment in the
telecommunications (TC) sector in Benin, amounting to CPA? 11.1 billion in
the period 1980-85 or about 3Z of total capital investment. International
services have improved but the overall quality of the national TC network
remains poor. Investments have in general been poorly planned and
coordinated, and deficiencies in local telephone cable networks in
particular create bottlenecks. The network provides service to about
13,000 subscribers, equivalent to half of the present estimated demand for
service. The existing infrastructure has furthermore been deteriorating
because of poor maintenance standards, and the average of
3 faults/subscriberlyear is one of the highest in the subregion. As a
result, the economic and financial benefits of these investments have not
been fully realized--the average subscriber revenue of CFAF 320,000 per
annum is low by regional standards. The poor financial position of the
sector is compounded by very low collection rates that have averaged 552
over 1982187. In net terms, OPTB has been drawing on, rather than
contributing to, GOB Treasury in part to finance past investments. Sector
management in the past has lacked the required flexibility and commercial
orientation to remedy the situation. GOB has nonetheless recognized the
potential benefit from improved sector performance and has taken a number
of positive steps. Through PPF advances approved in March 1984 and June
1987, studies for local network rehabilitation and expansion have been
financed. Diagnostic analyses of, and recomendations for, financial
management improvement have been prepared. Master plans for long term
network development and for maintenance improvement have been completed.
The project will support the execution phase of these measures as well as
GOB and OPTB's more recent initiatives for improved sector organization and
management in the context of the public enterprise (PE) reform program.
3.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  IDA is takl;eg a 'eading role in
the reform of the PE sector through the ongoing PE project and through
operations in a number of discrete sectors including TC. TC has potential

objectives for the years 1989-91 would be included as OPTB
obligations under the program contract. In addition, it was
agreed that OPTB would:
(i)  improve billing and collection procedures adequate to reduce
non-govertment telecommunications receivables to 120 days
equivalent no later than December 31, 1990;
(ii) ensure minimum rates of return on appropriately valued net
fixed assets as follows: at least 42 for fiscal years
1988-89; at least 6Z for fiscal years 1990-91; and at least
10? for fiscal year 1992 and beyond;
(iii) ensure net internal cash generation in any one year equivalent
to at least 252 of the average investment requirement in that
year and the succeeding two years; and
(iv) undertake no new investment over $1 million equivalent during
the project period without prior review by IDA.
(b) that the following other conditions would apply:
'i) the audited accounts of OPTB would be submitted to IDA withir.
six months of the end of the fiscal year; and
(ii) IDA would participate in an annual reviews of OPTB's three
year rolling investment program; of the execution of the
program contract; and of the adequacy of the GOB budget for
the costs of telecommunications services.
(c) that before credit effectiveness the following would be achieved:
(i) the adoption of the new OPTB statutes;
(ii)  the finalization and signature of the program contract;
(iii) the award of contract for the Cotonou local network;
(iv)  the effectiveness of cofinancing from EIB and ADB; and
(v)  the signature of the agreement for onlending the IDA credit
from GOB to OPTB.
7.       Benefits.  The proposed project has an estimated economic rate of
return of 28X. The project would help rehabilitate and develop an
essential infrastructure sector and improve productivity in other sectors.
The project will help meet unsatisfied demand through improved service
quality and efficient network expansion, especially in Cotonou and Porto
Novo. The project will contribute to the realization of the SAP, inter
alia, through improved investment programming and public resource
management in the telecommunications sector.
8.       Risks.  The risk that poor investment coordination could lead to
inappropriate decisions is already being minimized, inter alia, through the
