Excellency:
Please refer to the above-mentioned Development Credit Agreement between the 
People's Republic of Benin,(the Borrower) and the International Development

We are pleased to inform you that the Association hereby agrees to waive the 
cross effectiveness of the Development Credit Agreement with the ADB Loan Agreement, 
and proposes to amend the Development Credit Agreement in the following manner:
1.
In Section 5.01, paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) are renumbered (f), (g), and (h); 
a new paragraph (e) is added as follows: (e) The ADB Loan Agreement shall have failed 
to become effective by March 30, 1990, or such later date as the Association may 
agree; provided, however, that the provisions of the paragraph shall not apply if the 
Borrower establishes to the satisfaction of the Association that adequate funds for 
the Project are available to the Borrower from other sources on terms and conditions 
consistent with the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement".
2.
In Section 6.01 (b) the words "and the ADB Loan Agreement" are deleted.
Please indicate your agreement to this amendment by signing and dating the form 
of confirmation on the enclosed copy of this letter and returning it to us.
Sincerely yours,
