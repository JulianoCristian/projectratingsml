APPRAISAL OF A HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The economy of Rwanda, a small, mountainous country in the heart
of central Africa, is greatly dependent on road transport. Roads provide
the only means of communication between most areas of production and con-
sumption as well as the main links between economie centers and world mar-
kets. The economy is still quite primitive with subsistence agriculture
accounting for over half of the gross domestic product. Growth of the
monetary part of thle economy, which is largely dependent on external trade,
is hlampered because of high transport costs. The Government recognizes the
importance of transport in the'economy and policy is directed to the de-
velopment of reliable and efficient routes to the sea and to the improve-
ment of interregional connections.
ii.       Tlhe Bank Group's first lending operation in the transport sector
of Rwanda was designed to answer the first of these objectives. A credit
(196-RM) of US$9.3 million was made in 1970 for the construction of a 79 km
paved road between Kigali, the capital and main economic center, and Gatuna
on the Ugandan border. This road connects with the Ugandan road/rail system
over which 90% of Rwanda's exports and imports are carried. Work on con-
struction began early in 1972. The project also included the purchase of a
small amount of equipment for the maintenance of the Kigali-Kakitumba road
which, until completion of the more direct route, will carry most of the
traffic routed through Uganda.
iii.      The present project will answer the country's most pressing needs
in terms of improving communication between domestic centers of economic ac-
tivity. UIhile major construction cannot be justified on most routes because
of low traffic volumes, substantial benefits can be derived from minor bet-
terment works and improved road maintenance. The project is the first phase
of an 8- to 1u-year maintenance program designed to improve the condition
of the most economically important roads and to provide the foundation for a
higliway maintenance organization capable of keeping the national road network
adequately maintained.
iv.       The four-year project includes the following:
(a) the reorganization and strengthening of maintenance oper-
ations, including the training of maintenance personnel at
all levels;
(b) the purchase of maintenance equipment, spare parts, fuel
and materials;



- il -
(c) the construction and equipping of maintenance work-
shop facilities;
(d)  tie improvement of routine and periodic maintenance oper-
ations over the national road network; and
(e)  the betterment of selected roads and the eliminatior
of a backlog of deferred maintenance.
v.        The total capital co0t of the project is estimated at US$5.1 mil-
lion with a foreign exchange component of US$4.4 million. The costs will
be shared by the Association, the United Nations Uevelopment Programme (UNDP),
tLe Federal Republie of Germany, and the Government. The IDA credit of
US$3.0 million will be used to help finance the purchase of equipment, spare
parts, fuel and materials, and construction of a maintenance depot at Ruhen-
geri; the UNDP will help finance the cost of consultants (US$1.1 million);
and the Federal Republic of Germany will help finance the construction and
equipping of a central workshop at Kigali (US$500,000). In addition to
meeting approximately US$500,000 of the local capital costs of the project,
the Government will be obligated under the project to provide sufficient
f unds to cover recurrent maintenance requirements including renewal of the
equipment fleet. This necessitates a gradual increase in Government expendi-
ture over the project period from the present level of expenditure to about
US$1 million. This amount, which represents about 5% of total Government
expenditures, appears reasonable in view of the importance of road transport
to the economy.
vi.       The Directorate General of Roads and Bridges will be responsible
for the execution of the project. It will be assisted by consultants pro-
vided under the project as well as by its foreign advisors who, under bi-
lateral aid from the Federal Republic of Germany and Belgium, have been as-
sisting the Government for a number of years. Both donor countries have
aissured continuation of their aid programs.
vii.      While the entire national road network will benefit froni the proj-
e'Ft, the economic analysis stresses the benefits to be derived from thle
betterment and deferred maintenance operations on specific higli priority
rcoads wliere traffic volumes are highest. Savings in vehicle operating costs
o.- about 600 km of these high priority roads and on an additional 1,b00 km
which will receive improved maintenance are estimated to yield an economic
return of 28% on the investment. The most significant benefit to be expected
from the project, however, is the establishment of a base on whicli a compe-
tent and self-sufficient hiighway organization can be built. Tlie project is
suitable for an IDA credit of US$3.0 million equivalent to the Government
of Rwanda.



RWANDA
APPRAISAL OF A HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Improved highway maintenance was identified as a high priority need
in Rwanda as early as 1967 when the Bank's Permanent Mission in Eastern Africa
prepared a project which included a highway maintenance study and the purchase
of an emergency supply of maintenance equipment. A credit for such a project
was negotiated in late 1968, but the Government subsequently decided to seek
financing from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for a highway
maintenance study as well as for detailed engineering of the Gisenyi-Ruhengeri
road.  The highway maintenance study, for which the Bank was executing agency,
was completed by the Italian consultants, Electroconsult, in February 1971 and
has formed tlhe basis for the present four-year highway maintenance project.
The program recommended by the consultants - that is, a six year program cost-
ing about US$11.5 million of which almost half would be local costs - is
considered to be too ambitious in terms of the financial and human resources
which can be made available by the Government. Instead, a two-phased program
of 8 to 10 years has been determined as the more appropriate means of grad-
ually strengthening the highway maintenance capacity and of improving the
condition of the network to a level satisfactory for traffic requirements.
The project (Chapter 4) makes up the first four-year phase of this long-
term highway maintenance program.
1.02      The total cost of the project is estimated at US$5.1 million, with
a foreign exchange component of about US$4.4 million. Project costs will be
met by the Association, the UNDP, the Federal Republic of Germany, and the
Government. The Association's share, amounting to about 60% of total project
costs, will be met by an IDA credit of US$3.0 million which will be used ex-
clusively to help finance foreign exchange expenditures. In addition, exist-
ing technical assistance will continue to be furnished over the period of
the project by Germany and Belgium at no cost to the project (para. 4.15).
1.03      This will be the second Bank Group lending operation for the trans-
port sector of Rwanda. In 1970, the Association made a credit (196-RW) of
US$9.3 million for the construction of a 79 km paved road between Kigali, the
capital, and the Uganda border at Gatuna and for the purchase of an emergency
supply of maintenance equipment. The construction contract was awarded to
the Belgian/Italian contractor, Safricas-Impresa Astaldi Estera, and construc-
tion began early in 1972. A 23 km gravel road from the Uganda border to
Kabale links the project road with the paved highway network of Uganda. The
existing link is scheduled for improvement and paving under Credit 164-UG,
but its reconstruction has been delayed because the initial bids, which were
55% above the appraisal estimate, have been rejected ty the Government. The
high bids were apparently a reflection of the risks viewed by the contracting
industry in bidding for a relatively small contract in this isolated area,
particularly since relations between the Governments of Uganda and Rwanda
were strained at the time. Relations between the two Governments have since
improved and the Ugandan Government and the Association are presently review-
ing the steps which can be taken to obtain a reasonable bid for these works.
The existing gravel road is expected to be able to handle the Rwanda traffic
for the near term.

1.04      This report is based on the UNDP-financed maintenance study, and
on the findings of a mission, comprising Messrs. G. Ludwig (engineer), H.
Brandreth, Il. Yamaoka (economists), and Miss J. ifurpliy (editor), wtiicih vi-
sited Rwanda in July 1971.
2. BACKGROUNlD
A.   Economic Setting
2.01      The Republic of Rwanda is a laedlocked country in thte heart of
central Africa with an area of 26,340 km or about two-thirds the size of
Switzerland. The terrain is mountainous, changing only gradually from
tie very rugged western part of the country, distinguished by a chain of
active volcanoes in the northwest, to the rolling plateau which characterizes
the east. Transport is rendered extremely difficult by the mountainous
terrain and road construction is costly.
2.02      The country is bordered by Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi and the
Republic of Zaire.  Since political separation from Burundi in 1962 wnen
Rwanda gained independence, relations with neighboring countries have been
extremely sensitive because of internal tribal conflicts and tie sheltering
of political refugees in neigh'oring lands. Rwanda's dependence on trans-
port through these countries for the movement of exports and imports inakes
its landlocked position a particularly vulnerable one.
2.03      The population, which is growing at about 3% annually, approximates
3.7 million, making Rwanda, with about 140 inhabitants per km , among the
most densely populated countries of Africa.  Population density is highest in
tihe mountainous western half of the country where most arable land is located
and where rainfall is sufficient year-round to permit several crops to be
grown annually. The population is rural, the only urban concentrations
being found at the few administrative centers established under the Bielgian
trusteeship. Kigali, the capital and largest town by far, has about 25,0()0
inrlabitants.
2.04      The gross domestic product (GDP) in 1970 was about US(20i8 million
ecquivalent or about US$56 per capita. The major economic activity is agri-
culture. Subsistence crops such as bananas, sweet potatoes, cassava, maize
and sorghum dominate, accounting for one half of per capita income, but cof-
fee, tea and more recently rice are also produced. Industry is very limited;
most manufactured gooda, fuel, textiles and machinery, as well as some food
items, must be imported. Exports consist almost exclusively of coffee and
tin ore, supplemented by pyrethrum and by a growing volume of tea.
B.   The Transport System
2.05      By far the most important form of transport in Rwanda for both in-
ternal and external traffic is road transport. There are no railroads; none
of the rivers are navigable for any significant distance; and while there is



- 3-
some water transport on Lake Kivu, it is not of national significance. Sched-
uled air transport is limited to international connections through Kigali
airport, which is equipped to handle modern long-range jet aireraft. Because
of the dominance of road transport no problems of modal coordination exist.
2.06      The road network totals about 6,000 km of roads, of which the vast
majority are unengineered dirt tracks which wind in serpentine fashion over
the mountainous terrain. In terms of area covered, the network is perhaps
the densest in Africa, but considering the population it serves, it is not
particularly extensive (Table 1).
C.   Transport Policy
2.07      une of the major objectives of Rwanda's transport policy is the
social and economic integration of the country through the improvemenit
of interregional connections. The Government envisages, over the long term,
the reconstruction or improvement of primary routes linking Kigali with tlhe
various regions of the country. The Government recognizes, however, that
much can be done to improve the condition of the existing road network
through adequate maintenance.
2.08      A second major objective is the development of efficient and re-
liable routes for the transport of exports and imports. The monetary part
of the economy is greatly dependent on external trade. In 1970, for exam-
ple, the value of exports equaled about 26% of monetary GDP and that of
imports, about 30%.
2.09      Under Belgian trusteeship, many of Rwanda's foreign markets were
reached via routes to the Atlantic Ocean. But since Rwanda, Burundi and the
Republic of Zaire achieved independence, these have been abandoned in favor
of shorter routes to the Indian Ocean ports.  Two routes are presently util-
ized: the nortlhern road/rail route via Kampala (Uganda) to the Kenyan port
of 'lombasa, and the southern road/lake/rail route via Bujumbura (Burundi)
and Kigoma (Tanzania) to the Tanzanian port of Dar es Salaam. The northern
route is the most economic for the more productive northwestern part of the
country and about 90% of Rwanda's external trade goes through Uganda. The
isig,ali-(;atuna road, being constructed under the first highway project, will
replace the longer Kigali-Kakitumba road which presently carries most import-
export traffic routed through Uganda.
2.10      ln adcition to maintaining and improving existing roads, Government
policy is to increase the number of its routes to the sea in order to avoid
situations encountered in the past when, as the result of political disagree-
ments, one or all of the routes through Burundi, Uganda and the Republic of
Zaire to foreign markets were cut. With this in mind the Government is active-
ly pursuing the possibility of a third route to the sea:  a road link from
Musumo in southeastern Rlwanda to Ikusule in Tanzania which is connected with



- 4 -
Dar es Salaam by rail. Rwanda is planning to improve tlhe road link with Ru-
sumo (now a rouglh track for the last 20-25 km) and construct a bridge over
the Rusumo Falls with its own resources. The contract for the bridge con-
struction has already been awarded. The Tanzanian portion consists of an
earth and gravel road reputedly in good condition. While this route to
Dar es Salaam may have a long-run potential because of the somewhat shiorter
distances involved (about 1,500 km versus about 1,750 km for the existing
routes), it is unlikely to attract much traffic for some time because of the
poor quality of the road, the lack of organized heavy vehicle transport, and
thie relatively undeveloped state of the area througli which tlhe route passes.
Though from an economic standpoint this route has low priority, the Govern-
ment is giving it high priority on political grounds.
3. THE HIGHWAY SECTOR
A.   The Road Network
3.01      The 6,000 km road network consists almost exclusively of low stan-
dard earth and gravel roads, with sharp curves and varying road widths. The
only paved road other than that being built under Credit 196-RW is a 10-km
stretch between Kigali and the airport. The network is in extremely poor
condition, largely as the result of inadequate maintenance. The most heavily-
travelled routes are characterized by "washboard" surfaces, large ruts and
potholes, and in wet weather by deep mud.
B.  Traffic Growth and Characteristics
3.02      Traffic volumes are light throughout the country.  Only 10% of the
network carries over 100 vehicles per day; heavy trucks, however, account
for a large percentage of this total. The most heavily travelled routes are
Kigali-Kayonza-Kakitumba (194 km), Kigali-Gitarama-Burundi border (163 km),
Kigali-Ruhengeri-Gisenyi (162 km), and Cyangugu-Bugarama-Burundi border (38
km). On the basis of fuel consumption and traffic statistics over the past
five years, traffic overall is growing at about 7%. annually.
3.03      The vehicle fleet (Table 2) is small, but it has been growing ex-
treinely rapidly; the average annual increase over the past six years is about
21%. This growth is not fully reflected in the growth of interurban traffic,
indicating increased activity in and around the major urban centers. In 1970
registered vehicles totalled about 6,000, of which 64% were passenger cars,
23% were light trucks and vans, and 13% were heavy trucks. These figures
understate considerably the number of road users since most import-export
traffic, which accounts for about 60% of total traffic volume in terms of
ton-km, is carried by trucks registered in Uganda.



-5-
C.   Road Transport Industry
3.04      All international and most domestic transport is handled by two
competing Belgian companies, Agence Mfaritime Internationale and Transitra,
which act as forwarding and receiving agents, contracting required road
services to private truckers. Trucking rates charged are close to maximum
rates set by the Government and appear to be reasonable. Most external
transport is carried by Ugandan road haulage firms. The domestic industry
is growing, however, and an increasing aumber of small trucking firms are
working indiependently or as sub-contractors to foreign enterprises.
3.05      Government policy is to encourage development of the domestic road
transport industry. There are no regulations applicable to trucking services
and no administrative restrictions on the importation of vehicles.  A trade
license is readily obtainable and is all that is required to enter the trans-
port business. Conditions of virtually free competition therefore exist.
Scarcity of capital seems to be the main impediment to growth of the industry.
3.06      A public bus company, Regie des Transports Publics, has been pro-
viding, inter-city passenger service since 1968. It now serves a 3,468 km
network througnout the country. There are no other organized passenger ser-
vices in Rwanda. About 20 "bush" taxis operate in the countryside.
D.   Road User Charges
3.07      Road users contribute to Government revenues in several ways.  Im-
port duties amount to 20-30% for passenger cars, 10% for trucks, and 5-10%
for spare parts. Duties on gasoline and diesel oil are very low, amounting
to only RF3 (USe 3) per kilogram, and there are no excise taxes on fuel.
This results, in spite of the high cost of transporting fuel from refineries
in Mombasa and Dar es Salaam, in a fuel price slightly lower than in neighbor-
ing Uganda, and Ugandan truckers arrange to purchase fuel in Rwanda.
3.08      Road users contribute directly to the Government's annual revenues
through annual vehicle registration taxes and toll charges.  Vehicle regis-
tration charges range from US$2.70 equivalent for small cars to about US$220
for heavy trucks. The only toll road is the Kigali airport road for which
trucks pay US$0.55 equivalent one way and cars, US$0.11. There is, in effect,
a toll on all international movements since each time a foreign registered ve-
hicle enters Rwanda, a tax of US$30 equivalent is payable while vehicles re-
gistered in Rwanda pay about US$10.
3.09      Total revenues collected from road users (Table 3) have been in-
creasing steadily over the past five years and in 1970 amounted to almost
US$1.2 million equivalent. These revenues are not earmarked in any way for
highiway expenditures which have been considerably less than revenues collect-
ed (see para. 3.15).



- 6-
E.   Highway Administration
3.10      The Directorate General of Roads and Bridges (I)RB) in tbe Plinistry
of Public Works and Power is responsible for the construction and maintenanice
of the national road network comprising about 2,200 kni of the most important
roads. The remaining 3,800 km of district and communal roads are maintained
by the local authorities.  The D)irectorate includes three divisions, with re-
sponsibility for planning and construction, maintenance, and equipment.
Maintenance works are carried out through 10 prefectural offices.
3.11      The DRB suffers from an acute shortage of trained personnel.  The
staff includes only 12 engineers and technicians, of whom 9 are provided by
technical assistance from the Federal Republic of Germany and Belgium.
Neither the Maintenance Division nor the Equipment Division has senior or
supporting staff, and in actual practice, the Secretary General of Public
Works, through the Director General of Roads and Bridges, handles day-to-day
administration of these divisions. The staffing situation is expected to im-
prove over the next 5-10 years, provided that nationals now studying engineer-
ing abroad can be given adequate practical experience upon graduation. Such
training will be initiated under the project and the DRB will be reorganized
to assure its efficient operation. This reorganization will eventually re-
quire about 25 engineers and technicians; under the first phase, 17 will be
required (see para. 4.04).
F.   Engineering and Construction
3.12      The Planning Division of the DRB designs and supervises minor im-
provement works and has responsibility for major construction works wiich
are engineered and supervised by foreign consultants. Two roads are presently
under study: the study of the Kigali-Gitarama-Burundi border road (163 km)
is being financed by the European Development Fund, while the study of the
Ruhengeri-Gisenyi road (62 km) is being financed by the UIHDP with the Bank
as executing agency.
3.13      Road construction is let to contract after competitive bidding.
The only major contract presently underway is that for the IDA-financed
Kigali-Gatuna road (79 km), recently awarded for US$4.6 million.
G.   Highway Financing
3.14      Capital investments in highways have been financed largely from
foreign aid. The only major construction undertaken in the past ten years
was the Kigali airport road financed entirely by the Federal Republic of
Germany.  Government expenditures for highway development have been mainly
devoted to minor construction works. The highway development budget is fi-
naniced from the sale of Government bonds and has, over the past five years,
averaged about $150,000 annually.



- 7-
3.15      Expenditures for highway administration and maintenance, which are
financed from the general budget, have averaged about US$660,000 over the
last five years (Table 4). About 50% of expenditures has been for salaries
and wages and about 40% for materials, spare parts and fuel; the remaining
10/% represents the Governient's contribution to the local authorities for the
maintenance of urban and communal roads. In its study of highway maintenance
needs, Electroconsult found that this allocation was totally inadequate and
identified insufficient funds as one of the primary reasons that the DRB has
been unable to keep the network in adequate condition. The Association es-
mates that about US$1 million is required annually to assure adequate road
maintenance and renewal of the equipment fleet. During negotiations, a fi-
nancing plan for the project was agreed between the Government and the Asso-
ciation which will assure the gradual increase in maintenance expenditures
to a satisfactory level (para. 4.21).
H.   Maintenance
3.16      As noted above, the DBR programs and supervises maintenance of the
approximately 2,200 km national road network, allocating equipment to the
prefectural offices which organize the maintenance crews. To the extent that
equipment is available, maintenance operations such as reshaping and regravel-
ling are carried out by mechanized units. But equipment in good working con-
dition is in extremely short supply, and therefore, not available for regular
work. As a result, maintenance of most of the network is limited to the
clearing of shoulders and the filling of potholes with roadside soil which
is often unsuitable.
3.17      The one exception to this situation is a mechanized unit strengthen-
ed with an emergency supply of supplemental equipment provided under the firat
highway project and supervised through German technical assistance. Of neces-
sity, this unit has had to concentrate its efforts on a few very important
roads, such as the Kigali-Kakitumba road which presently carries most import-
export traffic.
3.18      The DRB's regular equipment fleet consists of only a few obsolete
and aging pieces which, because of the lack of standardization require a wide
range of spare parts. Although the Directorate has a small workshop in Ki-
gali for the repair and maintenance of equipment, the facilities are very
limited and the workshop has been unable to keep the fleet in working order.
Due to the lack of skilled labor, proper tools and spare parts, equipment may
sit idle for months awaiting repair. Only about half the existing useable
equipment is presently operable.
3.19      The maintenance study identified a number of measures which should
be taken to correct the deficiencies noted above in order to establish a DRB
organization with the technical capacity to maintain the country's road sys-
tem adequately. The Association estimates that eight to ten years are re-
quired to establish such an organization and to rehabilitate the national
road network. The project will provide the foundation for this organization
and will enable the DRB to undertake the first phase of this long-term high-
way maintenance program.

4. THE PROJECT
A.   Description
4.01      The project consists of a four-year highway maintenance program
wihichi is the first phase of an 8- to 10-year program to improve maintenance
operations throughout the country. The project, which will be implemented
with the assistance of consultants, consists of the following:
(a) the reorganization and strengthening of maintenance
operations including the training of maintenance
personnel at all levels;
(b) the purchase of maintenance equipment, spare parts, fuel
and materials;
(c)  the construction and equipping of maintenance workshop
facilities;
(d) the improvement of routine and periodic maintenance
operations over the 2,200 km national road network; atid
(e)  the betterment of selected roads and the elimination
of a backlog of deferred maintenance on about 600 km
of the above roads.
Reorganization and Strengthening of the DRB
4.02      A prerequisite for the successful implementation of an extensive
highway maintenance effort is the reorganization and strengthening of the
highway organization. The main deficiency of the present organizatioln is
over-centralization, with every decision, from the purchase of fuel to the
allocation of equipment, being taken at the ministerial level. While an
elaborate organizational structure is not required, the functions of the
various divisions need to be adequately defined and levels of responsibi-
lity established. The present situation is largely the result of the
acute shortage of qualified staff, and any decentralization must be accom-
panied by an intense training effort.
4.03      Under the proposed reorganization (see Chart) the DRB will have
four divisions. The Administration Division, which will be the only new
one, will deal with all administrative matters, accounting and personnel.
The Planning Division will be responsible for the planning of new roads
and bridges, related economic and engineering studies, and supervision of
new construction. The Equipment Division will operate the central work-
silop at Kigali, keeping the equipment fleet in good repair. The Maintenance
Division will program and supervise regular maintenance of the national road
network as well as minor betterment works. Four mechanizëd maintenance units,
equipped under the project, will be established in the Maintenance Division.



-9-
Under the first phase, these units will operate under the direct supervision
of headquarters, but as qualified staff become available and the capacity of
the DRB improves, maintenance works are expected to be decentralized. Under
the second phase, maintenance centers would be established at Ruhengeri and
Butare to serve the northern and southern regions respectively. Maintenance
operations in the central region would be directed from existing facilities
at Kigali. Headquarters would continue to be responsible for major repairs
and betterment works. The proposed organization was agreed between the
Government and the Association during negotiations.
4.04      The present staff of the DRB, even including the experts being
provided under bilateral technical assistance, is inadequate to implement
the proDosed organization. At a minimum, five additional engineers and
technicians will be required under the first phase of the maintenance pro-
gram to supplement the present DRB staff. These five experts will be pro-
vided by consultants under the project and will, along with the German and
Belgian experts already working in the DRB, fill the required positions at
headquarters and supervise the mechanized maintenance units in the field
(see Chart). Table 5 indicates the total technical assistance requirements
over the project period and the positions these experts will fill. The
foreign experts will train counterpart Rwandan staff as qualified nationals
become available for such training. Three Rwandan engineers and technicians
are already working at headquarters. In 1973 and in each of the years there-
after, at least two additional engineers or technicians are expected to join
the staff after completion of studies abroad. By the end of the first phase,
therefore, 10-15 nationals will be receiving on-the-job training at head-
quarters; by completion of the second phase, 20-25 qualified nationals will
have been absorbed into the DRB staff.
4.05      In addition to the training to be provided counterpart staff at
headquarters, the foreign experts will train maintenance personnel at all
levels of the highway organization. The consultants' team, in cooperation
with the Gernan experts in the Equipment Division, will organize a compre-
hensive training program for both existing and new equipment operators and
mechanics (Table 6) well in advance of the arrival of the new equipment.
The curriculum will be set up at the Equipment Division and the consultants
and the German experts will develop the course of instruction. On-the-job
training in shop and field repair techniques, parts control, lubrication,
inspection, etc. will be stressed along with classroom work using visual
training aids (charts, manufacturer's handbooks, etc.).
4.06      The consultants will also train supervisors at the intermediate
level, such as road foremen and maintenance inspectors, in the proper use
and maintenance of equipment, personnel administration and keeping of job
records. The training program is expected to be continued into the second
phase.



- 10 -
Purchase of Equipment, Fuel, and Materials
4.07      While many highway maintenance operations can be done by handl,
certain operations, such as the haulage of materials, fuel and water, the
transporting of laborers, and the compaction of road surfaces cannot be
carried out efficiently or to the required teclnical degree except with
proper equipment. The present DRB equipment fleet of operable or salvage-
able equipment is totally inadequate, consisting of a total of 16 pieces,
including a few dump trucks, rollers, a tractor, etc. The project provides
for the purchase of the most essential pieces (Table 7) needed to supplement
the existing fleet as well as the purchase of spare parts for the rehabilita-
tion of existing equipment. The equipment needs were estimated by Electro-
consult and revised by the Association in agreement with the DRB taking into
account the available labor supply, the number of seasonal working days,
traffle served by the different types of roads, and the output of the
equipment under average working conditions in Rwanda. The equipment will
be allocated to the four maintenance units established under the project.
The fuel and materials required to run these units will also be provided.
Construction of Maintenance Facilities
4.08      The foremost need of the Equipment Division is an adequate cen-
tral workshop where supplies and spare parts can be stored, and where
maintenance equipment can be repaired without undue delay. At the moment,
the Division has only a small office building, a few open sheds, and very
few tools. Under the project, a central workshop will be constructed and
equipped. The Federal Republic of Germany has agreed to build the required
workshop and to stock it with the necessary machines and tools at an esti-
mated total cost of about US$500,000 equivalent. The German Government has
confirmed that it will finance this portion of the project.
4.09      Under the project, a maintenance depot will be constructed at
Ruhengeri for equipment servicing and fueling. This depot will eventually
serve as a regional maintenance center when maintenance operations are de-
centralized under the second phase.
First Phase Maintenance Works
4.10      The four maintenance units to be equipped under the project are
expected to be in operation early in 1973. Under the first phase, two of
these units will be devoted to routine and periodic maintenance on the
2,200 km national road network. Headquarters will direct and supervise
the works, allocating the equipment as needed; work crews will continue to
be organized by the prefectural offices.
4.11      Under the first phase, the DRB will also undertake a program of
betterment works and deferred maintenance on about 600 km of national roads
selected on the basis of traffic volume and condition (Table 8). About 250
kn of roads have been identified which warrant minor improvement works such
as correction of alignment, resurfacing and construction of culverts. Another



- il -
350 km of roads urgently require regravelling. These works will be carried
out under the project utilizing two of the mechanized maintenance units to be
provided.
4.12      While the details of the second phase of the maintenance program
can only be elaborated after experience is gained under the project, it is
presently envisaged that the road betterment and deferred maintenance pro-
gram would continue into the second phase, and that an additional 200 km
would be completed by the end of 1977. Once all works under this program
are completed, and sufficient trained personnel are available to enable
decentralization of routine and periodic maintenance operations through
regional maintenance centers, the DRB should be capable of taking over re-
sponsibility for the routine maintenance of an additional 1,300 km of local
roads or a total of 3,500 km. Each of the maintenance centers would have
a mechanized maintenance unit with the necessary equipment and personnel.
Tlhe iLlaintenance Division would retain one maintenance unit at headquarters
for emergency operations such as removal of land slides and large road
improvement and bridge works. During negotiations, the Government agreed
that it will, during calendar year 1975, consult with the Association to
define the second phase of the maintenance program and seek financing for
its execution.
4.13      By the end of both phases of the maintenance program, the DRB
will be responsible for the routine maintenance of 3,500 km of roads.
Wîhile taking into account the improved productivity which will be possible
with adequate equipment and training, this increased responsibility will
necessitate a sizeable increase in the labor force. The DRB presently
employs about 120 skilled and semi-skilled laborers at headquarters while
the prefectures employ, seasonally, some 10 laborers and an inspector for
every 10 km maintained. At peak periods, the total labor force amounts
to about 2,200) men.  With completion of the maintenance program, the labor
force at peak periods will total about 3,000 men, of whom about 470 will be
skilled and semi-skilled laborers required at headquarters and the regional
maintenance centers. Labor will continue to be used intensively on such
operations as cleaning ditches and culverts, trimming slopes and shoulders,
cutting grass and minor repairs.
B.   Project Execution
4.14      The DPB will be responsible for the execution of the project and
is capable of doing so with the assistance of its foreign advisors and of
the consultants to be provided under the project, who together will assist
the DR3 in (a) the reorganization of the DRB and the training of counterpart
staff; (b) the preparation of bidding documents for the purchase of equip-
ment and spare parts; (c) the supervision of the mechanized maintenance
units; (d) the construction of maintenance facilities; and (e) the training
of drivers, equipment operators, mechanics and maintenance personnel.



- 12 -
4.15      The project has been discussed with both German and Belgian
autlhorities who have assured continuation of their bilateral aid prograrns.
The UNDP has undertaken to finance the consultant services required under
the project. Signature of the consultants' contract is a condition for
effectiveness of the credit.
4.16      Equipment will be procured on the basis of international conmpe-
titive bidding in accordance with Bank/IDA guidelines through separate
contracts for each type or each group of similar types of equipment. This
was confirmed during negotiations. The contracts will provide for delivery
of about 60% of the equipment by the beginning of 1973, and of about 20% in
gach of the following years. Suppliers of trucks will be required to pro-
vide an adequate servicing organization in Kigali, including a supply of
spare parts, and equipment suppliers will be required to inspect periodically
important equipment operating in the field.

- 14 -
4.18       The costs of equipment (Table 7), spare parts, fuel and materials
are based on the consultants' estimates and are reasonable. The foreign
exchange component is based on CIF cost Kigali. The local component in-
cludes all taxes and local handling costs. A contingency allowance of
10% has been added for price escalation, estimated at about 6% per annum,
on both local and foreign costs and a contingency of about 6% has been
provided to cover miscellaneous additional equipment needs which may be-
come apparent after the bulk of the equipment has been delivered in 1973.
D.   Financing and Disbursements
4.19       The IDA credit of US$3.0 million equivalent will cover the foreign
exchange costs of equipment, spare parts, fuel and materials, as well as con-
struction of the maintenance depot at Ruhengeri. The Federal Republic of
Germany will finance the foreign costs of the central workshop (about US$500,000).
The UNDP grant of US$1.1 million will cover both the foreign costs (US$930,000)
and US$170,000 of the local costs of consultants. The Government will finance
the remaining local costs of the project, amounting to about US$500,000.
4.20       Disbursements from the credit account will be made on the follow-
ing basis:
(a) CIF cost (Kigali) of maintenance equipment, spare parts,
fuel for road betterment and deferred maintenance program,
and materials; and
(b) 80% of expenditures for the construction of a maintenance
depot at Ruhengeri, which represents the estimated foreign
component thereof.
Table 10 presents the forecast for disbursements assuming the credit
becomes effective by mid-1972.
4.21       In addition to meeting approximately US$500,000 of the local costs
of the project, the Government will have to allocate sufficient funds to meet
the recurrent costs of road maintenance. Total capital and recurrent costs
which must be met by the DRB over the project period will rise from about
US$460,000 equivalent in 1972 to about US$920,000 in 1976 (see Table 9). In
1977, the first full year after completion of the project, the DRB's recurrent
highway expenditures should total about US$1 million equivalent (see Table 11)
which is the annual allocation necessary to assure adequate maintenance of the
network and regular renewal of the equipment fleet. This amount, which repre-
sents about 5% of the Government's total annual expenditures, appears reason-
able in view of the importance of road transport to the economy. During ne-
gotiations, the Government confirmed that it will meet the local capital and
recurrent costs of the project and that, upon completion of the project,
sufficient funds will be allocated annually to the DRB to insure adequate
maintenance of the national road network.



- 15 -
5. ECONOHIIC EVALUATION
5.01      Road transport plays a vital role in the economy of Rwanda, with
almost all transport of goods and passengers being carried by roads. While
the network îs densely developed over the country, only a few roads assure
reliable all-weather service. The bulk of the network consists of low-
standard earth and gravel roads in very poor condition. Consequently,
transport costs are extremely high, raising the prices of imported goods
as well as the few locally manufactured products, and narrowing their
domestic markets. High transport costs also tend to aggravate the dis-
advantages inherent in Rwanda's land-locked position, affecting export
development adversely.
5.02      The first phase of the highway maintenance program was defined in
the course of project appraisal, taking into account the length of roads
which most urgently require deferred maintenance or improvement as well as
the availability of local technical staff to implement the project and of
local funds to meet capital and recurrent costs. Definition and program-
ming of the specific works to be undertaken were determined on the basis
of route condition and traffic volumes, mobility of maintenance units, and
future highway construction plans.
5.03      The success of the project is dependent on a variety of inputs
which, because of their interdependence, have all been treated as a package
investment in the analysis. Particular consideration was given, however,
to the scope and timing of technical assistance to be provided in view of
the large portion of project costs attributable to this element (24% of
total capital costs). The number and type of experts were determined after
a careful assessment of the minimum technical expertise required to under-
take the maintenance programn even on the limited scale envisaged.
5.04      In the final analysis, however, the real success of any mainte-
nance program such as the present one is measured not by the efficiency
with which the particular works are carried out but by the ability of the
highway organization to function effectively on its own once the program
is completed. While building a competent, self-sufficient organization
naturally takes time, it is expected that the training to be undertaken
during this first phase will provide a nucleus of able technicians and
skilled laborers on which a strong highway organization can be built.
5.05      For the purpose of analysis, costs of the project have been
defined as the difference between the total capital and recurrent costs
required and the recurrent expenditures which would nornially be allocated
to highway maintenance. The contributions of the UNDP and Germany for con-
sultants' services and provision of a central workshop have been included,
but not the technical assistance provided by Germiany and Belgium since



- 16 -
this assistance would continue even without the project. In the analysis
it has been assumed that without the project, annual recurrent expenditures
would be equal to the average annual expenditures of the DIJ over the past two
years and that these would be sufficient to maintain the network in its
present condition. The network has actually been deteriorating with this
modest budget, but use of these amounts rather than the higher allocations
necessary to maintain the status quo, provide a more conservative analy-
sis.
5.06      On the benefit side, the entire national road network of about
2,200 km will benefit from improved maintenance under the project. The
main quantifiable benefits are those arising from savings in vehicle
operating costs on the approximately 600 km of road included in the road
betterment and deferred maintenance program as well as on the remaining
1,600 km of road on which routine maintenance will be improved. Addi-
tional benefits from the project, such as generated traffic and reductions in
the rate of accidents, may also be realized, though these have not been in-
cluded in the analysis.
5.07      Traffic estimates are based on counts taken by the consultants
and the DRB over the past year. On the basis of fuel consumption and
traffic statistics over the past five years, as well as past and projected
growth of the monetary part of the economy, traffic is expected to grow at
7% annually over the next decade. For the analysis of the project, a plan-
ning horizon of ten years has been adopted. This is equivalent to
the conservative assumption that improvement benefits for the various
roads in the road betterment and deferred maintenance program (Table 8)
will be realized for an average of only six to seven years. In a similar
conservative assessment, benefits from routine maintenance were assumed
over a period of only four years.
5.08      To determine the economic return which will result from the
proposed investment, the annual savings in vehicle operating costs have
been compared with the incremental capital and recurrent costs of tlhe
project (Table 12). For the approximately 250 km of roads to be improved,
unit savings in vehicle operating costs (Table 13) of 15% for liglht vehi-
cles and 18% for heavy vehicles are assumed throughout the planning period.
Savings of three-quarters this amount are expected for the regravelling
works on about 350 km of road. Unit savings of 5% in vehicle operating
costs are expected on the remaining 1,600 km of roads as a result of im-
proved maintenance standards. Again, the assumptions in the unit savings
of vehicle operating costs are conservative, as they neglect the constant
deterioration of the road network which would result if the "status quo"
of the present level of maintenance were continued. On the basis of these
data, assumptions, and qualifications, the economie return of the total
investment is 28%. The benefit-cost ratio, at a discount rate of 10%, is
1.64:1.



- 17 -
5.09      Sensitivity of the analysis to variations in traffic growth rate
and vehicle operating cost savings has been tested. If the annual traffic
growth is 5% rather than 7%, the economic return is 23%. If unit savings
in vehicle operating costs are reduced by 20%, the return is 19%. Even in
the very unlikely event that both the traffic growth rate is 5% and the unit
savings in vehicle operating costs are only 80% of the best estimate, the
return is still 15%. The overall conclusion that the project earns a satis-
factory economic rate of return is therefore firm.
6.  AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
6.01      The following are the major project matters on which agreement
was reached with the Government during credit negotiations:
(a)  reorganization of the DRB (4.03);
(b)  consultation with the Association on the definition and
financing of the second phase of the maintenance program
during calendar year 1975 (para. 4.12); and
(c)  the annual allocation of sufficient funds to the DRB to
ensure adequate maintenance of the national road network
(para. 4.21).
6.02      Signature of the consultants' contract is a condition for effec-
tiveness of the credit (para. 4.15).
6.03      The project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$3.0 million equiv-
alent to the Government of Rwanda.
