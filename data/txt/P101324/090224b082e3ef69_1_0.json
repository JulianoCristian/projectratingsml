        Partnership Project received a satisfactory development\n            outcome with moderate risk to development outcome. The Bank\n            received a satisfactory rating for their performance while\n            the Borrower received a highly satisfactory performance\n            rating. There were several restructuring this project went\n            through, five in total. The result of each restructuring was\n            an extension of the closing date. The first restructuring\n            was to address a financing gap arising from unanticipated\n            circumstances, and to scale up project activities. The\n            second procurement was due to delays in procurement\n            processes required an extension of the closing date to allow\n            for the full disbursement of the technical assistance\n            component. The third restructuring provided an extension to\n            allow for the implementation of two consultancies (a\n            feasibility study on a train network and an Economic Master\n            Plan for the Belo Horizonte metropolitan area) in the\n            technical assistance component. The fourth restructuring\n            extended to closing date to be able to use remaining funds\n            under the TA component to extend the scope of the Economic\n            Master Plan consultancy by including 14 additional\n            municipalities in the study. The final restructuring\n            extended to closing date due to delays in approving the\n            procurement of the last contract (Economic Master Plan\n            consultancy). Several lessons were taken from this project\n            including the following: (1) the importance of a technical\n            assistance component to foster innovation, (2) the\n            value-added through technical assistance provided by the\n            Bank, (3) the importance of technical assistance as a\n            vehicle for continued dialogue, (4) disbursement-linked\n            indicators as a performance push, (5) attention needs to be\n            given to the design of the DLIs, and (6) the financing of\n            eligible expenditure programs (EEPs) can serve to protect\n            certain categories of spending in certain sectors."}, "docdt": "2015-04-29T11:20:00Z"}
