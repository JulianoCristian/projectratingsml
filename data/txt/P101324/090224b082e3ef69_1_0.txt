Bank engagement with Minas Gerais
The Bank has supported the reform program of the State Government of Minas
Gerais (GoMG) to introduce and mainstream result-based management systems
across its most important public management functions, since 2006 through the
“Minas Gerais Partnership Series (MGPS)” of operations. The MGPS was composed
of three successive Bank operations, which sought to help the GoMG expand and deepen
its public sector management reform program.

The GoMG’s reform program started in 2003 with what is known as Choque de
Gestão – Management Shock. The Choque de Gestão was based on an initial fiscal
adjustment, and a series of management and human resource reforms to allow the
implementation of a series of Government priority programs (e.g. in the health, transport
and education sectors) and the close monitoring of their related performance indicators.
The targets were negotiated with sector secretariats that became accountable for delivering
program results. The Bank’s support started in 2003 through technical assistance and was
operationalized in 2006 through the Minas Gerais Partnership Development DPL
(P088543) of US$170 million. That engagement was followed by the Minas Gerais
Partnership II SWAp – object of this ICR – to support the reform program which had
entered into a second phase - the Estado para Resultados (State for Results). In this phase,
indicators were negotiated at the departmental level, with monetary rewards linked to the
achievement of goals. Subsequently the Government strategy evolved to a focus on citizen
participation, called Estado em Rede (Management for Citizenship) with the aim of
consolidating the previous phases, increasing efficiency and building a permanent
constituency through citizen participation while ensuring the model’s sustainability,
through devolution of performance management to individual secretariats. This third phase
of the State’s reform program was supported by the Third Minas Gerais Partnership for
Development DPL in 2012 (P121590) of US$450 million.

The evolving series of reforms undertaken by the State grew to impact every facet of
its economic and administrative management. The reforms undertaken since 2006
supported the State’s economic recovery as well as improving service delivery. In effect,
it transformed Minas from a bankrupt and poorly managed under-performer to a fiscally
responsible state, which set up and fine-tuned a results-based management system of
monitoring and evaluating results. This improvement has led to an increase in efficiency
and effectiveness of public resource use in public institutions. This comprehensive
management reform was one of the first of its kind in Brazil and is regularly mentioned as
a benchmark for other (state) governments in Brazil and elsewhere.

Preparation and implementation of the SWAp
The Government asked the Bank to go beyond its traditional investment lending
instruments in providing support for the reforms. Although Minas was in a position to
borrow from other sources, it chose the Bank as its preferred partner due to its capacity to
focus on cross-cutting issues in an integrated multi-sectorial program, for its knowledge and
for its technical skills. The support requested involved not only investments, but also needed
to link disbursements to the achievements of indicators, specialized technical assistance and
day-to-day advice on a variety of issues.
The operation included two components covering Public Sector, Private Sector
Development, Health, Education, and Transport. The first component (SWAp), of
US$1,413 million (including an additional financing) was disbursed to the State Treasury
against expenditures incurred under Eligible Expenditure Programs (EEPs) –specific
Government priority programs included in the Government Pluri-Annual Plan (PPAG).1
Disbursement, which occurred at three to six month intervals, was also dependent on the
achievement of Disbursement-Linked Indicators (DLIs) measuring the progress of the EEPs.
A Technical Assistance (TA) Component in the amount of US$18.5 million supported the
implementation of EEPs and the achievement of the DLIs through consultancies, and
disbursed as a traditional investment lending operation.

Results and achievements
This was a highly successful project whose overall impact and success cannot be
captured solely by assessing the achievement of the PDO indicators. The project paved
the path for significant reforms and a culture change in the public administration of Minas
Gerais. As one of the first successful models of result-based management in Brazil, it had
spill-over effects to other states and countries, which adapted the system. Certain sector
policies, such as in education, influenced national policy-making taking Minas as a
successful example.
The operation also served as incubator for innovative operational approaches. The
SWAp modality as a lending instrument heavily influenced the discussion for the need to
adjust Bank instruments to the needs of clients, especially in middle-income countries,
which eventually led to the introduction of the PforR instrument. Another element to be
taken into consideration when assessing the overall outcome of the project is its innovative
nature at the time of preparation, as well as its size, both in multi-sector coverage and
lending amount. The project served as a pioneer in many of those aspects and valuable
lessons were learned from its success, but also from its shortcomings. Those lessons served
to further develop the SWAp instrument and have been integrated in similar operations
elsewhere.

  Examples of EEPs include Government programs for “Professionalization of Public Managers”,
“Improvement of Quality and Efficiency of Secondary Education”, “Regionalization of Health Care”, and
“Pro-Acesso Municipality Road Surfacing Program”. The complete list of EEPs can be found in Annex II.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.     Minas Gerais can be considered a microcosm of Brazil. Its income level is close
to Brazil’s national average (ranked 10th out of 27 States in 2012), and the State has deep
regional disparities mirroring those at the national level. For instance, the State’s northern
region has conditions of poverty, subsistence agriculture and semi-arid climate similar to
the Brazilian Northeast, the poorest region in the country. Minas Gerais also has Brazil’s
second largest population (19.9 million, representing 10.2 percent of Brazil’s total) and the
economy is the third largest after São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, and about the size of Peru.

2.      Back in 2002, Minas Gerais’ fiscal situation was one of the most difficult in
Brazil, and it was one of seven States (out of 27) that had been unable to meet the
Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL) targets. The incoming administration in 2003 thus
inherited a bankrupt state with large levels of debt, poor management and low investment.
Consequently, the Government launched a results-based management reform program,
“Choque de Gestão” (Management Shock), which was based on programs that were of
priority to the Government (e.g. in the health, transport and education sectors) and
performance indicators to manage them. As the system evolved these targets were
negotiated with sector secretariats that became accountable for delivering program results 2.

3.      At the time of appraisal of the SWAp in early 2008, the administration had
been overwhelmingly re-elected to a second term, ensuring continuity of its reform
process. From 2004 to 2008 Minas Gerais had consolidated the fiscal adjustment efforts
initiated in 2003, significantly improving revenue and operating balances, increasing
investments and reducing debt. By 2006 the State had improved its fiscal situation
sufficiently that the Federal Government allowed it to borrow again.
4.      The reforms had also led to improvements in poverty and social indicators.
The poverty headcount ratio in Minas had fallen from 25 percent of the population in 2002
to 15.4 percent in 2006, implying a poverty headcount of about 3.9 million, representing
the third lowest headcount in Brazil and a relatively high per capita family income,
although issues of inequality remained.

5.      By 2008, reforms building on the “Choque de Gestão” entered into a second
phase - the “Estado para Resultados” (State for Results). Implementation of this
subsequent phase was based on the signing of Results Agreements between the Governor
and the Secretariats associated with the identified “results areas”. Each Secretary committed
outcome, output, process and input indicators, and in return the Governor committed to
giving the Secretariats sufficient resources to implement the strategic projects and

 This comprehensive management reform was one of the first of its kind in Brazil and is regularly mentioned
as a benchmark for other State governments. Because of its relevance, this ICR contains a separate analysis
of these reforms, summarized in Annex X. This annex also presents the results of a survey with approximately
2,000 government employees regarding their perception of the management reforms of this period.

reform process in Minas Gerais, from 2003 until 2014.

Rationale for Bank Involvement

6.      The Bank’s engagement with the State of Minas Gerais had begun in the early
2000s through analytical and knowledge activities. This continuous dialogue prompted
the State to partner with the Bank for the implementation of its reform agenda. The first
loan under the Minas Gerais Development Partnership Series was a two-tranche DPL of
US$170 million (P088543), in 2006, supporting the “Choque de Gestão”.
As Minas Gerais moved into the second phase of its reform process, it asked for
additional Bank support for the implementation of the State for Results Program.
Although Minas was in a position to borrow from other sources, it chose the Bank as its
preferred partner due to its capacity to focus on cross-cutting issues in an integrated multi-
sectorial program, for its knowledge and for its technical skills. In its request for the new
operation, GoMG asked the Bank to go beyond its traditional investment instruments,
because it needed a simultaneous combination of investments, results-based disbursements
and management support, specialized technical assistance, and day-to-day advice. This
operation presented an opportunity for the Bank to increase its role at the state level in
Brazil and address complex development challenges in an integrated and multi-sector
fashion, in line with the Brazil Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for 2008-2011 3.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
7.      The original Project Development Objective was to (i) help the Borrower improve
the efficiency and effectiveness of public resource use and allocation for economic and
social development; (ii) support the adoption of innovations in public management by the
Borrower; and (iii) support the Borrower in strengthening its results-based management
system of monitoring and evaluation of results.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification
8.      An Additional Financing 4 (AF) of US$461 million was requested by the GoMG in
2010 in order to withstand the unanticipated deep global and domestic recession and fiscal
challenges resulting from significant drops in state and federal revenues. The original
project was restructured to include support to the Government’s rural poverty reduction
program, trigger additional safeguard policies, change the financing percentage, and
introduce new and modify existing intermediate indicators. The Project Development
Objective and its indicators remained the same, although some targets were revised.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
9.      The gains from improved public sector efficiency were shared by the majority
of the population and particularly the poor population. More specifically, the transport
component improved the connectivity of mostly poor municipalities by providing them
with paved access to the city. The education component focused on public schools, which
generally have a higher proportion of students from poor backgrounds. Similar to the public
education sector, through self-selection, the public health system and centers treat those
who cannot afford more expensive private care.

1.5 Original Components
10.     This Sector-Wide Approach (SWAp) operation included two components
covering Public Sector, Private Sector Development, Health, Education, and
Transport. The first component (SWAp), of US$957.5 million, disbursed to the State
Treasury against expenditures incurred under Eligible Expenditure Programs (EEPs). EEPs
are Government programs included as specific lines in the Government Pluri-Annual Plan
(PPAG) and in the annual budget law. 5 Disbursement, which occurred at three to six month
intervals, was also dependent on the achievement of 24 Disbursement-Linked Indicators
(DLIs) measuring the progress of the EEPs. A Technical Assistance component in the
amount of US$18.5 million supported the implementation of EEPs and the achievement of
the DLIs. The TA component disbursed as a traditional investment lending operation
against statements of expenditures (SOEs).
11.    The project provided a package of financial, policy, and technical support in the
priority sectors as well as support on key cross-cutting and multi-sectorial issues. EEPs

  Examples of EEPs include Government programs for “Professionalization of Public Managers”,
“Improvement of Quality and Efficiency of Secondary Education”, “Regionalization of Health Care”, and
“Pro-Acesso Municipality Road Surfacing Program”. The complete list of EEPs can be found in Annex II.

                                                     3
funded the sector objectives and institutional reforms. Some, such as the public sector
program and the private sector program, did not involve large expenditures but had
important implications for the other programs in terms of cross-cutting institutional and
policy reforms and contributed to the PDO’s cross-cutting focus on public sector
efficiency, innovation and implementation of the results-based management model. The
education and health programs were relatively large, but expenditure focused more on
recurrent expenditures and needs. Finally, the transport program was among the largest and
funded considerable public works, but also promoted institutional reforms. These sector
programs were linked to the PDO as they contributed to insert the goals of efficiency and
effectiveness of public resources, innovative approaches and finally, the implementation of
results-based management on a sectorial level.
12.    Public Sector Management (PSM). As reflected in the PDO, an overriding goal of
the Government was to extend the culture of results management across all line secretariats,
thus PSM was ranked among the most important results areas, addressing four cross-cutting
challenges: (i) implementation of the results agreements; (ii) professionalization of public
managers; (iii) continued improvement in budget and financial management; and (iv)
continued strengthening of the procurement system.
13.      Private Sector Development. Contributing to the PDO by supporting innovation,
this area focused on the five main objectives of the Minas Gerais Integrated Development
Plan 2007-2023, which were to increase dynamism and innovativeness to promote
economic growth and sustainable social transformation. An improved investment climate
was seen as the best way to establish the conditions for long-term growth and continuous
job creation. Activities focused on fostering innovation and adopting technology,
facilitating the creation of new firms, and strengthening the State’s leading role in
implementing Public Private Partnerships (PPPs).
14.     Health Sector. The Minas Gerais health sector faced challenges such as (i) unequal
access to basic and specialized care; (ii) low quality and insufficient coverage; and (iii)
little coordination among health care providers among different levels of care with
implications for resource allocation and management, quality of spending, and ultimately
health outcomes. Those challenges were addressed by improving the quality of hospitals
and family health care, and strengthening the efficiency of hospital management through,
inter alia, hospital accreditation and the implementation of standardized cost systems. The
contribution to the PDO was a more efficient use of resources in the health sector and the
implementation of innovative approaches, such as the PROHOSP (Hospital Strengthening
and Quality Improvement Control Project), a State program which uses targets and
performance indicators to evaluate hospitals.
15.     Education Sector. The two most pressing challenges in the education sector were
insufficient information on student learning achievement and low early primary school
literacy levels which highlighted the need to improve the quality of education in the State.
This was addressed by strengthening the management of elementary education services,
improving secondary vocational education programs, and supporting personnel
expenditures of the State Secretariat of Education, while contributing to the PDO through
more efficient use of public resources.



                                             4
16.     Transport Sector. The State’s long-term development plan emphasized reducing
transport costs and expanding access to markets through a safe road network while
overcoming transport bottlenecks to better integrate the competitive economy and help
develop underperforming regions. Increased efficiency and improved quality of spending
was to be achieved through a results-based approach to management in the transport sector,
and private sector participation in the provision of transport infrastructure through PPPs and
other mechanisms. Furthermore, State programs for highway maintenance and rehabilitation,
and road surfacing were supported to ensure paved access to every municipality.
17.    In addition to the five priority sectors, the operation included indicators for
the monitoring of social and environmental aspects. While not linked to a specific sector
EEP, two DLIs monitored the number of indigenous health teams and certified indigenous
teachers. These fit into both the education and health areas and also addressed social
safeguards and inclusion concerns. Another DLI linked PSM efficiency and environmental
management as it tracked the average time to obtain certain environmental licenses.
18.     The Technical Assistance Component supported activities in each of the five
priority sectors. The activities under this component were carefully and specifically
selected with the objective of supporting and complementing the fulfillment of DLIs in all
areas; some TA activities explicitly supported the achievement of DLIs, while others were
for more general institutional strengthening, including safeguards.

1.6 Revised Components
19.    The original components were maintained when the Minas SWAp was scaled-
up through the Additional Financing. Rural Poverty was added as a new sector to
provide additional direct support to the Government’s poverty reduction strategy by means
of supporting the application of the Government’s results-based management approach to
programs aimed at poverty reduction. The Rural Poverty Reduction Program was included
as an EEP and linked to five new DLIs to measure rural poverty reduction.

1.7 Other significant changes
20.     During its lifetime the project was extended a total of five times. The first
extension occurred with the AF to allow for disbursement and TA implementation of the
scaled-up project. Although funds under the SWAp component were fully disbursed by
2011, four subsequent extensions were approved to allow for the use of remaining TA funds. 6
This enabled the Government to commission a series of consultancies and studies that
informed further development of the Government agenda. One of the most important is the
Economic Master Plan for the Metropolitan Region of Belo Horizonte that lays out an
integrated vision on the economic and social development of the state capital.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

 1st extension to 3/2012 (9 months); 2nd extension to 3/2013 (12 months); 3rd extension to 12/2013 (9

                                                     5
21.    Project preparation was fully in line with the Country Partnership Strategy
2008 - 2011, which highlighted the Bank’s increasing role at the State level in Brazil.
The operation was the second sub-national SWAp in Brazil, preceded only by the Ceará
Multi-Sector Social Inclusion Project (P082142).
22.     The GoMG asked the Bank not only to help with specific aspects of sector policy,
but also to support the implementation and strengthening of its ability to handle cross-
cutting issues. The selection of the SWAp modality as opposed to a DPL allowed the Bank
to respond to this request in a unique manner, through support for their priority expenditure
programs, technical assistance, and on-going Bank support and guidance. The multi-sector
design of a SWAp facilitated the collaboration between secretariats during the reform
process. Furthermore, the SWAp modality was particularly suited to this phase of the State’s
reform agenda given the mutual focus on multi-sector performance.
23.      The preparation of the operation was complex due to the number of sectors
and agencies involved, the size of the loan, and the fact that the SWAp modality was
still a novelty. During Project preparation Bank specialists were present in Minas Gerais
almost on a weekly basis to work closely with the counterparts. The importance of this
close engagement has since been stressed by both the Bank and the Minas Gerais teams.
24.     However, the design of the project had some shortcomings. While the multi-
sector nature of the project made it challenging to establish and measure an overarching
outcome, the PDO intended to overcome this difficulty by comprising three sub-PDOs,
which were somewhat intermediate objectives. Some of the PDO level indicators measured
outputs rather than outcomes and the number of indicators measuring sector achievements
were not reflecting the relative share of the sectorial EEPs, leading to a slight disconnect
between the scope of project activities and PDO.
25.     During preparation a review of national procurement legislation was carried
out. One of the challenges was ensuring compatibility of the Bank procurement requirements
with State and Federal legislation. This included finding an acceptable manner to embed
antifraud and corruption clauses in the procurement documents, and to prepare specific
reports on eligible expenditures under the SWAp component. As one of the first SWAp
operations in Brazil, the review helped to define certain standards for subsequent operations.
26.     Although the specific risks of the project were seen to be low, the overall risk
at the time was rated ‘moderate’ due to the size and visibility of the operation. Most
risks were correctly identified and adequate mitigation measures put in place.

2.2 Implementation
27.     Overall implementation was ‘satisfactory’ throughout project cycle. The loan
was signed on August 8, 2008 and became effective on September 23 of the same year. ISR
ratings for overall implementation progress of the project remained as ‘satisfactory’
throughout the operation. Some delays were encountered in the initial phases of
implementation, due mainly to the lack of familiarity of both the Bank and the Borrower with
each other’s procedures and mechanisms related to procurement and financial management,
especially in the context of a SWAp.



                                              6
28.     Project restructuring at mid-term. No mid-term review (MTR) was carried out
as the restructuring (accompanying the AF) took place at around the time when a mid-term
review would have been undertaken, and entailed a far more in depth review of the project
than an MTR. In addition, at the time MTRs were not mandatory. The AF modified some
of the indicators to delete or adjust those that had already been achieved, or to add new
indicators to better reflect progress towards the PDO.
29.     Strong Borrower performance coping with - staff turnover and coordination
challenges. The continuous and strong commitment of the GoMG throughout the project
was of great importance to the successful implementation. While there was staff turnover
due to rotations and a change of Governor, the high quality of the technical staff involved
in the project on the Borrower’s side was instrumental and ensured follow-through. The
number of sectors and agencies involved in the operation was initially seen as a potential
risk but was quickly overcome and led to better coordination among Government entities.
That trend has continued and can be considered as a direct result of the project.
30.     Technical Assistance was critical. While particular difficulties regarding Bank
procurement procedures arose early on in the implementation process, it is important to
note the impact of the Technical Assistance component of the loan and the fundamental
role that it played in generating innovation within the Government. Most of the TAs were
highly successful, because the government team had precise expectations from the
consultants and saw an opportunity to undertake activities that the Government normally
would not have been able to set resources aside for. The successful TAs were in general
those with a clear link to the operation and close oversight by the implementing agency.
31.     Additional Financing triggered by global financial crisis. Although identified in
the original PAD as moderate, one of the potential risks of the operation, “a major significant
world-wide shock”, did materialize in 2009. Following the global financial crisis the state
suffered from plummeting commodity prices and less demand for their agricultural
products and the GDP of Minas contracted more than the national GDP. The AF supported
the original project’s activities which might have otherwise been postponed and possibly not
fully implemented.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
32.     The Project’s M&E framework is considered ‘satisfactory’. Strengthening the
system of monitoring and evaluation of results in Minas Gerais was part of the PDO,
therefore integral not only to the operation itself but also to the Government program.
33.     Working together with Bank specialists, the GoMG developed an extensive
framework to monitor the implementation and outcomes of its programs at many
levels. The existence of this framework ensured the continuous and thorough monitoring
of indicators and helped Government agencies create a new organizational culture focused
on achieving results. Some indicators were only measured until 2011, when the SWAp
component was concluded. However, most of the indicators continued to be monitored by
the State, given their importance to the Government program.
34.     However, the Bank’s M&E system showed some inconsistencies. For instance, the
Project Appraisal Document (PAD) classifies some indicators as both PDO and Intermediate,
causing discrepancies in the ISRs, where they are associated with only one indicator category.
                                              7
Further complicating the monitoring and evaluation process, a number of indicators appear in
the ISRs under different names as those in the original project documents, and some were
included in the ISRs only in later years.
35.      Changes in the Bank’s operational procedures. Since project approval in 2008,
the Bank’s operational procedures underwent a number of changes, and the design and use
of indicators became more sophisticated and integral to reporting on development
effectiveness. The ISR format underwent two significant sets of changes, which affected the
ability of the Bank team to consistently and coherently monitor the indicators.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Safeguard Compliance
36.     The operation was a Category “B” with six safeguard policies triggered. While
the original project triggered four safeguard policies, the project’s Safeguard Frameworks
(i.e. Environmental Management Framework, Resettlement Policy Framework and
Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework) were revised at the time of the Additional
Financing, which triggered two additional safeguards.

* Safeguard policies triggered with the Additional Financing

37.     Overall, and as expected, the project did not have negative social impacts. The
frameworks containing the set of policy principles to address the two social Operational
Policies, Indigenous Peoples (OP/BP 4.10) and Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12)
requirements that were triggered for both phases of the project were properly assessed, and
overall well prepared. These frameworks were also based on the Brazilian legislation.
Monitoring reports have confirmed the general appropriateness of this strategy and ISRs
throughout project life consistently rated safeguard compliance as ‘satisfactory’.
38.     However, implementation of the Social Safeguards had some shortcomings,
although the design of the instruments was in general adequate. Guidance provided by
the Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) in general ensured compliance of the policy
until the stage of compensations to affected people. However, at the time of the preparation
of the ICR, about 18 percent (or 500 of 2,776 processes) of the compensation processes
were not yet concluded and were in an administrative completion stage. The Government
has elaborated an action plan to finalize these processes. The Bank will continue to closely
monitor the implementation of that action plan until the pending compensation processes
are fully and satisfactorily completed.


                                                    8
39.     The Environmental Management Framework ensured compliance with
environmental safeguards. The project did not have any environmental safeguard
compliance issues and implementation was consistent as Category “B” as the impact was
limited in scope, localized, temporary and reversible. Having followed the environmental
safeguards agreed with the World Bank, the activities supported by the project are not
expected to cause any significant negative externalities.

Fiduciary Compliance
40.     Financial Management arrangements were considered ‘Moderately Satisfactory’
throughout project implementation, and required close support by the Bank team.
Because the use of country systems was prioritized, the adaption of the existing systems to
specific Bank requirements was somewhat challenging. Initial weaknesses in the reporting
system, the design of IFRs, and the use of spreadsheets to prepare financial statements led to
data inconsistences, which were resolved by close Bank support during implementation.
41.     However, the State was diligent in proposing alternatives and implementing
action plans to mitigate the identified issues. The lack of familiarity with the Bank’s
auditing arrangements during project preparation was overcome during implementation.
The Tribunal de Contas do Estado de Minas Gerais (TCE-MG) was an important partner in
strengthening executing agencies’ capacity and producing high quality auditing reports.
42.     In fact, the State’s financial management capacity was significantly improved
during the project. While the fiduciary overall capacity at the beginning was considered
rather weak, as a result of respective mitigation measures in the project’s fiduciary
arrangements, the counterpart improved monitoring, communication among state sectors
and TCE, and increased implementation awareness in sectors. The concept of a designated
account was adopted by the government for other operations and the adoption of
International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) had a positive impact on the
project.
43.    Procurement arrangements were considered ‘Satisfactory’ throughout
implementation. Despite initial challenges in applying the Bank’s procurement policy,
procurement throughout the project had no major issues and the Bank’s procurement rules
were complied with. The application of the Bank’s guidelines in the selection of consultants
had a positive impact on the quality of the service providers contracted.
44.     Complex disbursement rules. The complex reporting rules on the compliance
with the eligible expenditure programs also posed challenges during implementation and
sometimes caused delays in disbursements. However, as this was one of the first SWAp
projects, valuable lessons learned derived from this “learning-by-doing” experience for
later projects in other States.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase




                                              9
45.     The Third Minas Gerais Development Partnership DPL (P121590) 7
complemented the SWAp operation in the Partnership Series and supported the
GoMG in the next phase of its reform process. By 2012, the Government’s reform strategy
had evolved from the Estado para Resultados (State for Results), supported under the SWAp
operation, to a focus on citizen participation, named Estado em Rede (Management for
Citizenship). The aim of this operation was to maintain the support for the reforms being
carried out by the GoMG, consolidate previous phases, increasing efficiency and building a
permanent constituency through citizen participation while ensuring the model’s
sustainability, through devolution of performance management to individual secretariats.
46.     This longstanding relationship between the State of Minas Gerais and the
Bank is likely to continue in the future with the new administration. Following
elections in October 2014, a new administration took office in January 2015. A first step
will be the dissemination of the findings of this ICR with the incoming authorities to
explore potential areas of future collaboration.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

47.     The project and its objectives remain highly relevant. A significant indication
that the operation was not only relevant but that its results are sustainable is the fact that
the project’s priority areas continued to receive attention in the Government Action Plan
(PPAG) for 2012-2015. At the time of ICR preparation, the new State Government that took
office in January 2015 had not yet presented its policy program indicating its priority areas.
However, a proposal 8 for the new Government agenda indicates that the improvement of
public services especially in the health and education sectors will continue to be priorities.
48.     The choice of design proved to be an important factor for successful
implementation, and continues to be relevant. The operation supported the consolidation
and improvement of an innovative results-based public sector management model in Minas
which has since been emulated by other states and municipalities, as well as replicated
outside of Brazil. Similarly, the innovative design using a multi-sector approach and
disbursement-linked indicators gave further incentives to implement reforms across different
sectors and over an extended period of time. The instrument has since been replicated in
several projects, and indeed was the model that led to the creation of the Program for Results
(PforR) instrument in the Bank.
49.     Implementation arrangements and the availability of funds for technical
assistance played a crucial role in the achievements of the development outcomes. The
involvement of all relevant sector secretariats facilitated coordination of implementation
and further led to improved cooperation among different State agencies. This coordination

was and remains embedded in the day-to-day operations of the Government, and presents
an important achievement in the institutional change. The rather long implementation time
gave room to accompany reform efforts, supporting maturity through embedment into the
government’s culture and processes. The availability of funds for technical assistance under
Component 2 allowed for a certain flexibility beyond the Government budget to obtain not
only support for the implementation of government programs, but also for additional in-
depth and innovative activities, which otherwise might not have taken place, such as studies
on sectorial, economic and regional development and integration, which currently form an
active part in informing and influencing policy-making of the GoMG.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
50.      The overall efficacy of the project is rated “high”. The disbursement of funds
under the SWAp component (US$1,413 million) was completed in 2011, which marked a
de facto completion point for the project, as (i) almost 99 percent of the funds were
disbursed, and (ii) all (except one) DLIs had achieved their targets established for the
period of 2008-2011. However, as the technical assistance under Component 2 continued
focusing on a small number of consulting services, almost all indicators continued to be
monitored for the purpose of project reporting. This allowed for a snapshot of the project
at the time of completion of the SWAp Component, and for assessing the sustainability and
further progress until the final closing date of the project. Annex II describes in further
detail the achievement of the indicators at those different times in the project.
Achievements by PDO sub-parts
Part 1: To improve the efficiency and effectiveness of public resource use and allocation
for economic and social development.
51.     The achievement of the first part of the PDO was substantial. The existence,
measurement and tracking of cost information in the various sectors was one of the
indicators measuring the efficiency and effectiveness of public resources. All 21 of the
health facilities under FHEMIG administration have implemented a standardized costing
system to collect and monitor clinical and non-clinical costs, and the education management
information system (Sistema Mineiro de Administração Escolar – SIMADE) was
successfully developed and implemented. Nonetheless, the composite indicator measuring
achievements (changes in primary surplus and personnel expenditures) of the Fiscal
Adjustment Program (Programa de Ajuste Fiscal - PAF) was not fully achieved. This
indicator, however, was outside the direct influence of the project and was affected by
unexpected factors such as a teacher’s strike in 2011. In fact, one lesson learned from this
operation is to avoid indicators that are outside the control of the project.
52.     On the allocation side, efficiency and effectiveness were measured through
investment expenditure as a share of total expenditure and expenditure on the strategic
projects as a share of total expenditure. This was highly achieved as the percentage of
strategic programs in total expenditures, ensuring that resources are allocated in accordance
with State priorities, was more than doubled from 2007 to 2013. Efficiency of public
resource use and the effectiveness of public resource allocation were also enhanced by
supporting the PROMG program which aimed at rehabilitating and maintaining the state
paved road network through results-based contracts, and by assisting the State Roads

                                             11
Department (DER) and the State Secretariat of Transport and Public Works (SETOP) in
institutional strengthening activities. Success in increasing efficiency and effectiveness
was also measured by the average percentage delay of paving works concluded under the
Pro-Acesso road program which decreased from close to 40 percent in 2007 to around 10
percent within five years.

Part 2: Support the adoption of innovation in public management of the State.
53.     This part of the PDO was highly achieved. As originally envisaged, the success of
this section of the PDO was to be measured by the extent of implementation of Results
Agreements in key sectors, the number of PPPs contracted by the State, the percentage of
hospitals under the hospitals program (PROHOSP) assessed for accreditation by the
accreditation entity, and the percentage of state paved roads network under results-based
maintenance and rehabilitation contracts.
54.     The targets involving the successful implementation of results agreements were
surpassed, and by 2013 a total of 28 secretariats had achieved a performance of 70 percent
or more. Annex X provides more details about the results agreements focusing on the
education sector. By 2013 the PROHOSP Program supported 140 hospitals in the State, 78
percent (109 hospitals) of which had been assessed for accreditation by an institution certified
by the National Accreditation Organization (Organização Nacional de Acreditação – ONA).
The number of PPPs contracted increased from one PPP in 2007 to four in 2010 and six in
2013, surpassing the targets established at the outset, and making Minas Gerais one of the
most advanced Brazilian States in terms of institutional setup of PPPs.
55.    Although the final target for the indicator that measured the percentage of state
paved roads network under results-based maintenance and rehabilitation contracts was
narrowly missed at the time of the SWAp disbursement, it was later achieved and
surpassed. The proportion of the State road network in good condition increased from 43
percent in 2007 to 72 percent in 2011, substantially contributing to the reduction of
transport costs for road users.

Part 3: Support the State in strengthening its results-based management system of
monitoring and evaluation of results.
56.     Although the original results framework 9 did not specify indicators for the
measurement, the relevance and efficiency of this part of the PDO are rated high. The
strengthening of Minas Gerais’ results-based management system was at the core of the
project and a cross-cutting theme and monitoring of results was essential for the entire
results-based management system established by the State. The project was instrumental
in the achievement of this part of the objective, primarily through technical assistance
activities and the engagement of Bank specialists with the Government team in the creation
and subsequent fine-tuning of the M&E system. Specifically, the successful introduction



9
  The table on results indicators in the original PAD (Table 1 in Section 1.2 of this ICR), identifies
“Satisfaction of vice-governor’s office and secretariats with available M&E information” and “Strengthening
of results/causal chains underlying the government’s program” as the two indicators to measure this PDO
part. As they were not reflected in the results framework, they were not monitored during the project.

                                                    12
of the first and second generation of results agreements (see Annex X) provides strong
evidence for the satisfactory achievement of the project objective.

Achievements by sector themes
57.     Public Sector Management. Rating: Substantial. Bearing in mind the GoMG’s
overriding goal to extend the culture of results management across all line secretariats, the
operation included a large number of public sector management indicators that
encompassed implementation of Results Agreements, strengthening M&E, and improving
information sources. Those were directly linked to the achievement of the PDO in the areas
of adopting innovations in public management and strengthening the State’s results-based
management system of monitoring and evaluation of results. The targets involving the
successful implementation of results agreements were surpassed. The percentage of
strategic programs in total expenditures, ensuring that resources are allocated in accordance
with State priorities, was more than doubled from 2007 to 2013. A very significant degree
of commitment on the part of the State ensured that the procurement reform that was carried
out as part of the “Fiscal Management Modernization” EEP greatly exceeded expectations,
and good practices have now become ingrained in the management culture of the State.
The composite indicator targeting two PAF targets, primary surplus and personnel
expenditures, was not fully achieved, which resulted in a US$1.44 million cancellation, but
otherwise the State met all targets in this sector. Given the relevance of the PSM sector in
this project, results achieved in this area are further analyzed in Annex X of this ICR. The
annex also presents the results of a survey with 2000 employees of the Minas Government
regarding their perception of these reforms.
58.     Private Sector Development. Rating: High. The GoMG believed that improving
the investment climate in the State was the best way to establish the conditions for long-
term growth and continuous job creation. The Minas Fácil units and Technology
Innovation Centers (hosted by Science and Technology Institutions) spread throughout the
State were deemed important for disseminating knowledge and supporting innovations and
entrepreneurial activities. Streamlining of time to start a business (consultations, taxes,
licensing, payments, and registrations) was an important efficiency measure to facilitate
such activity. The reduction of days necessary to start a business from 26 in 2007 to 6 in
2013 is a notable feat, and was possible due to the high degree of ownership and
commitment of the implementing agency. Furthermore, it is indicative of the project’s
innovative character that the number of PPPs contracted increased from one PPP in 2007
to four in 2010 and six in 2013, surpassing the targets established at the outset. Minas
Gerais is now one of the most advanced Brazilian States in terms of institutional setup of
PPPs. The maturing use of PPPs as a tool in public management directly contributed to the
achievement of the PDO, which called for the adoption of innovations in public
management.
59.    Health Sector. Rating: Substantial. The interventions supported by the project to
improve the State health systems included the introduction and consolidation of
management mechanisms and tools. These contributed to the achievement of the PDO by
improving the efficiency and effectiveness of public resource use. Quality assessments and
the implementation of a standardized costing system in a number of public hospitals have
improved efficiency in allocating public resources to effectively better public health

                                             13
outcomes. By 2013 the PROHOSP Program supported 140 hospitals in the State, 109 (78
percent) of which have been assessed for accreditation by an institution certified by the
National Accreditation Organization (Organização Nacional de Acreditação – ONA). All
21 of the health facilities under FHEMIG administration have implemented a standardized
costing system to collect and monitor clinical and non-clinical costs. Other State programs
like “Health at Home” and “Viva Vida” have been successful at the municipal level, with 841
municipalities benefited by the “Health at Home” program and 59 Viva Vida Centers
implemented. In addition, data on health outcomes shows that municipalities made great
progress in reducing infant deaths. The State Infant Mortality Rate decreased from 16.9 to
12.4 deaths per 100,000 live births in the last ten years, and Primary Health Care coverage
reached 79.5 percent in 2014.
60.     Education Sector. Rating: High. The Education sector effectively fostered
monitoring and evaluation, efficiency, and innovation. Concrete actions that contributed
toward the achievement of the PDO include the rising of 3rd grade literacy, the utilization
of the secondary school classroom-level testing program (PAAE), the development of the
SIMADE management information system, and the increase in vocational training program
enrollments (PEP). SIMADE is a system that incorporates student, teacher, school and
regional district information on results and human resources into a single integrated system
that allows calculation of unit costs by school, district, level of education, and program.
Furthermore, the operation helped the GoMG to scale-up its most promising and innovative
education programs. Those programs were not only scaled-up with success under the
program, but also influenced national education policy.
61.     Transport Sector. Rating: Substantial. The operation’s transport sector component
has particularly contributed towards achieving the PDO. Efficiency of public resource use
and the effectiveness of public resource allocation were enhanced by supporting the
PROMG program which aimed at rehabilitating and maintaining the state paved road
network through results-based contracts, and by assisting the State Roads Department
(DER) and the State Secretariat of Transport and Public Works (SETOP) in institutional
strengthening activities. Success in increasing efficiency and effectiveness was measured
by the average percentage delay of paving works concluded under the road program Pro-
Acesso which decreased from close to 40 percent in 2007 to around 10 percent within five
years. By increasing the number of highway PPPs and the percentage of the paved highway
grid under results-based maintenance and rehabilitation contracts, the transport program
also helped to support the adoption of innovations in public management of the State.
62.     Environment and Social Quality. Rating: High. This area included an efficiency
DLI relating to both the private sector and environmental efficiency, as well as two social
inclusion DLIs benefitting indigenous communities. All three indicators were achieved
before the target date of 2011. The environmental DLI called for the average time for
concession of environmental licenses for two classes of processes to be halved to 90 days
primarily through the use of IT technology. This had been achieved by 2009, and was
maintained through 2011. The number of certified teachers in indigenous areas was increased
from 137 to 213 during project life, leading to greater empowerment of indigenous
communities and contributed to a rise in the level of indigenous education. On indigenous
health, increasing the number of inter-disciplinary indigenous health teams from 12 to 16 in


                                            14
five years has contributed to the increase in quality of the service of Primary Indigenous
Health and Care in the State.
63.     Poverty Reduction. Rating: High. The AF provided additional direct support to the
Government’s poverty reduction strategy by supporting the application of the results-based
management approach to programs aimed at poverty reduction, and including the Rural
Poverty Reduction Project (RPRP) as a new EEP. Two DLIs were related to the EEP: the
number of families to be benefitted by the program, which was not only achieved before the
end target date, but also surpassed; and the intensive monitoring of the RPRP by SEPLAG
and the Instituto de Desenvolvimento do Norte e Nordeste de Minas (IDENE), which was
achieved by holding a total of 6 monitoring meetings a year in 2010 and 2011. The two
additional poverty DLIs were related to the health and education sectors. One called for the
State Secretariat of Education to develop 13 courses for initial job training in the area of
information technology. The target for this indicator (90 schools in the Great North Region
offering initial work preparation courses for the assembling and maintenance of computers)
was achieved in 2010. The final DLI measured the proportion of live births from mothers
with 7 or more pre-natal consultations in the Great North. The target for this indicator was
not only achieved, but the proportion of live births has increased from 46.1 percent in 2007
to 66.6 percent in 2013. As a comparison, the proportion of live births in the State of Minas
Gerais was 61.4 percent in 2007 and 71.5 percent in 2013.
64.     In addition, Technical Assistance (Component 2) activities in all of the sectors
contributed to the achievement of the Objectives. Those activities included
strengthening procurement and improving the knowledge base on which sector strategies,
budgets and targets were based. Some of the activities carried out were studies including a
household survey, impact evaluations in education, health and transport, a quality
assurance survey, and a study of output indicators and links to outcomes.
65.     The TA activities were directly linked to support the achievements of DLIs.
For instance, a study measuring the quality of service provision to businesses can be
directly linked to achievement of the DLI that measured the time necessary to open a
business in the State capital. Similarly, an assessment of the state capacity to handle road
safety and the identification of a set of actions to improve capacity informed the efforts of
the GoMG toward the achievement of DLIs in the transport sector.

3.3 Efficiency

66.     The overall efficiency of the operation is rated as substantial, as efficiency
gains are likely to have occurred. Given the multi-sectorial nature of the project, a broad
economic assessment was unfeasible and therefore only partially undertaken during project
preparation. A more detailed ex-ante economic analysis was conducted in the areas of
education and transport focusing primarily on economic returns to education and economic
rates of return based on calculations comparing traffic volume and cost.
67.    An analysis comparing current with pre-intervention outcomes in education,
health, and the security sector in Minas and other Brazilian States that implemented
management reforms was carried out. This 2013 World Bank analysis examined
changes in relation with regional trends and results achieved by other States to determine


                                             15
if the improvements depart in meaningful ways from the overall trend. 10 For the education
sector, the study finds positive results going beyond the average of the Southeastern region.
In the health sector, however, the study finds no direct impact of the reforms since trends
in health outcomes remained within the regional average.
68.     A simplified ex-post economic analysis was carried out for the transport
sector, which confirmed that the programs supported under the SWAp operation
remain economically viable. At project appraisal, a cost-benefit analysis was carried out
to evaluate the transport sector’s two principal programs, namely PROMG-Pleno and Pro-
Acesso. The NPV of investments under the PROMG-Pleno program was calculated as
R$2.245 at a 12 percent discount rate over an evaluation period of 20 years yielding an
IRR of 35.60 percent. The Pro-Acesso program’s NPV was estimated to be R$998 million
at a 12 percent discount rate with an IRR of 26.42 percent. However, a simplified ex-post
evaluation based on available traffic volume and cost data was carried out and came to the
conclusion that IRR and NPV have improved compared to the ex-ante evaluation in both
programs (see Annex III for details).
69.     To capture civil servants’ perception of the management reforms, a survey was
conducted of Minas’ Government employees. The survey results (see Annex X) indicate
that the majority of respondents welcomed the introduction of results agreements and have
a clear understanding of their role and objectives.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory
70.      Measured by the ICR guidelines, the overall outcome rating is considered
‘satisfactory’ as the project has largely achieved its development objectives. Despite
some design shortcomings, it has effectively contributed to the improvement and expansion
of the Borrower’s results-based management system of monitoring and evaluating results.
This improvement has led to an increase in efficiency and effectiveness of public resource
use in public institutions in Minas Gerais. Furthermore, the rating is based on the
operation’s positive efficiency ratings in the sectors it included and prevailing relevance,
particularly in the development areas tackled and the importance of results-based
management, not only in the State of Minas Gerais, but throughout Brazil. While most
impact and significant results were achieved by 2011, when the SWAp component was
disbursing, those achievements proved to be sustainable as most of the indicators showed
sustained or increased achievement through the subsequent years in which only TA
activities were under implementation.
71.    However, it should be pointed out that this was a highly successful project
whose overall impact and success cannot be fully captured by only assessing the
achievement of the PDO indicators. The project paved the path for significant reforms
and a culture change in the public administration of Minas Gerais. As one of the first
successful models of result-based management, it had spill-over effects to other states and
countries, which replicated the system with adaptations. Certain sector policies, such as in

No. 82592-BR. See also Annex X for more details.

                                                 16
education, influenced national policy-making taking Minas as a successful example.
Another element to be taken into consideration when assessing the overall outcome of the
project is its innovative nature at the time of preparation, as well as its size, both in multi-
sector coverage and lending amount. The project served as a pioneer in many of those
aspects and valuable lessons were learned from its success, but also from its shortcomings.
Those lessons served to further develop the SWAp instrument and have been integrated in
similar operations elsewhere.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
     (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
72.    The poverty rate in Minas Gerais has been drastically reduced since 2008. The
poverty rate decreased from 13.3 percent in 2006 to 5.4 percent in 2013. This implies that
over the same period the poverty headcount was reduced by 1.5 million from 2.5 million
in 2006 to 1 million in 2013. 11 Although the extent to which the project has contributed
towards the reduction of overall poverty is difficult to determine due to the many factors
influencing poverty rates, several DLIs related to poverty across various sectors, such as
education and health, showed considerable improvements. Also, State’s Rural Poverty
Reduction Project (RPRP) was supported by the project with the AF.
73.     The transport sector contributed to reduce poverty and inequalities. An impact
evaluation study 12 conducted by the client demonstrated that the Pro-Acesso program in
the transport sector contributed to alleviate poverty and to reduce inequality in rural areas
of the State through fostering economic growth. The economic development index 13 of the
225 municipalities under the Pro-Acesso increased by 51 percent between 2000 and 2010,
which is higher than the State average of 35 percent. While the index of the Pro-Acesso
municipalities was 24 percent lower than the State average in 2000, the difference had been
reduced to 17 percent by 2010.
74.     Components added with AF improved indigenous health outcomes. Targets set
to increase the numbers of certified teachers in indigenous areas and inter-disciplinary
health indigenous health teams were achieved and surpassed, leading to an improvement
in the quality of primary indigenous health care in Minas Gerais.

     (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

75.    Institutional strengthening was at the very core of this project. The
implementation of a results-based management system, the introduction of Results
Agreements and the procurement system reform significantly improved institutional
functioning. The Results Agreements, with their link to monetary bonuses, supported the

change towards a results-oriented culture in the administration, while the procurement
reform introduced an e-invoicing system which it is being used by both the State
administration and its suppliers The results of the survey with Minas’ civil servants (see
Section 3.6 and Annex X for more details) indicate that the majority of respondents believe
that introduction of results agreements helped them better understand their role and purpose
inside the organization.

   (c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts
76.     The operation leveraged the State’s successful results-based management
model as an example for other States. The Minas Gerais Partnership Series helped to
develop solutions to enhance public sector performance and service delivery issues which
were used by other States and countries. The success of the public sector reforms in Minas
Gerais proved to be an important model with continuing and useful demonstration effects
for Brazilian States and municipalities such as Pernambuco, Rio de Janeiro, Manaus, and
other countries facing similar development problems.
77.     Incubator for innovative operational approaches. This operation was one of the
pioneers of the SWAp modality for sub-national projects in Brazil. The approach then spread
out to projects in other Brazilian States and countries (i.e. Argentina), where the design of
performance-linked disbursement projects matured through further refinement and integration
of lessons learned from the implementation of the first operations. The SWAp modality as a
lending instrument heavily influenced the discussion for the need to adjust Bank
instruments to the needs of clients, especially in middle-income countries, which
eventually led to the creation introduction of the PforR instrument.
78.    Adjustment of procurement arrangements for SWAp operations. Significant
preparation work was done on the procurement arrangements of the operation, particularly
through an in-depth review of national procurement laws, which led to adjustments of the
procurement arrangements, including the acceptance of all competitive procurement
procedures under the national procurement laws and increasing procurement method
thresholds. The effort helped to set an example and define certain standards which were
then used for subsequent SWAp operations.
79.     Expansion of the Government agenda towards integrated regional
development. The preparation of the Economic Master Plan for the Metropolitan Region
of Belo Horizonte set a cornerstone for increasing the Government’s focus on strategic
economic development of the metropolitan area. The Master Plan has provided a long-term
vision of development needs in terms of social, economic, physical, and environmental
planning and infrastructure accompanying this development. Its implementation is now a
priority of the Government and intended to be replicated for other urban areas to foster
municipal development.
80.     Transition to the next reform phase. The activities and support for maturing the
reforms from the Choque de Gestão under the operation underpinned the State’s desire to
continuously expand and deepen reforms and led to the definition and transition into the
next reform phase. This phase, the Estado em Rede, was supported by a DPL operation and
focused on citizen engagement in priority setting of policies. (See also Section 2.5)

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
81.    A beneficiary survey was not conducted. However, the team conducted a
survey among public servants in Minas Gerais directly affected by the
implementation of results agreements. The survey was carried out in mid-December
2014 among public servants to capture their perceptions about the introduction and
expansion of the results-based public management system since 2003.
82.     The majority of respondents agreed or strongly agreed with the assertion that
the introduction of results agreements had improved the functioning of the public service
in Minas Gerais. Likewise, the majority of respondents believe that the results agreements
established are relevant to the overall mission of the respective institutions. 92.7 percent of the
respondents that work for the Minas Government for 5 years or more indicate that they have a
clear understanding of their role and goals at work. Two thirds of those respondents also assert
that they understand their role and goals better than five years ago.
83.     Limitations but overall robust findings. The survey was conducted ex-post and
the lack of a baseline and thus reliance on recall questions limit the validity of the findings.
In general, however, the survey is indicative of positive perceptions regarding the results-
based management reforms (see Annex X for survey results).

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

84.    Given the nature of the reforms supported by the operation and the ensuing results-
based management culture that is now embedded in the system, it is not expected that the
Development Outcome will be reversed or significantly changed in the foreseeable future.
However, as a new Government took office in January 2015, and the degree of future Bank
involvement in Minas Gerais is yet be determined, the assessment of the risk to
Development Outcome is considered ‘moderate’.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory
85.     Special attention was given to the preparation of the project. Given the
importance in the Brazil portfolio, the size of the project both in terms of sectors involved
and lending amount, and the complexity of the SWAp modality, the Bank deployed a large
team of sector specialists with the required knowledge and who were dedicated, in
cooperation with the counterpart, for the preparation of the project. As emphasized by current
and previous civil servants, the Bank’s technical support was extremely helpful in defining
the indicators during the preparation of the SWAp. The close preparation with the counterpart
did not only allow for designing a project that addressed the necessities of the Borrower, but
also laid the ground for a close relationship, which facilitated implementation.

                                                19
86.     At the time of preparation it was expected that changes to the original design
would be needed during implementation. As the operation was one of the first SWAp
operations in Brazil and the instrument was still in a stage of fine-tuning, changes to adjust
the design were anticipated during preparation. As part of the Additional Financing, the
majority of the original results framework was changed as the indicators and targets had
either already been achieved or were no longer relevant. Similarly, the achievement of
some DLIs was beyond the control of the implementing agencies.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory
87.     Supervision carried out by Bank staff occurred on a regular basis and, during
most of the project. In the first years of implementation, a close supervision by the Bank team
took place, including the preparation of the AF, support for the complex disbursement
arrangements and for the large procurement packages. Furthermore, Bank staff also supported
the preparation of TORs and gave guidance on the selection of consultants and firms, as per
Bank guidelines, which seemed to have an impact on the quality of the service providers.
88.     Of critical importance for the supervision was the high level of participation
of staff from the Brazil Country Office. Most of the time, at least one TTL was based in
the Brasilia office, as were the fiduciary staff and several sector specialists. This facilitated
the communication and ensured a responsive and continuous dialogue. Furthermore, the fact
that one of the TTLs had previous experience within the Government of Minas Gerais and
with the implementation of the Choque de Gestão proved to be a valuable asset.
89.     However, over the time of implementation, Bank supervision decreased. Once
the SWAp component had been fully disbursed in 2011 and only TA activities remained
to be carried out, supervision slightly decreased. Also, the quality of the ISRs varied over
the time of the project and sometimes lacked information; however, the format of the ISR
changed twice during the implementation period. During the extension periods of the
project, implementation of safeguards was not followed as closely, with the result that the
delays on completion of the compensation processes was not flagged as early as it could
have been.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
90.     The overall rating is satisfactory, as the Bank team was able to respond to and
successfully address the Government’s development issues through a highly complex
operation. Even though, the design at entry and the supervision during the extension
periods show some shortcomings, in the overall scheme, the Bank team prepared and
implemented a complex project, which at the time of preparation was a new, highly
innovative instrument with few predecessors. Therefore, adjustments to the project design
were expected (and desired) as they offered the opportunity to fine-tune the design based
on lessons learned during implementation.



                                               20
5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance

Rating: Highly Satisfactory
91.      The Government played an exemplary role during the preparation and
implementation of the project. The continuous commitment and high level of ownership
of the reforms was essential to the success of the operation. Prior to project implementation,
the Government had created an institutional framework that facilitated the implementation
of the SWAp. Arising implementation issues were addressed in a timely manner, and the
Bank’s large and sometimes intrusive supervision efforts were well supported.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
92.     Despite the challenges associated with the implementation of a project with such a
large scope, the implementing agency’s performance was satisfactory, which to a great
extent can be attributed to the high technical capacity of the Minas Gerais public servants,
which itself was a reflection of the success of the reform process initiated by the State in
2003. Throughout the life of the operation PDO indicators, Implementation Progress, FM,
Project Management, Procurement, M&E were rated at least ‘satisfactory’. The counterpart
team facilitated Bank supervision and played a crucial role in refining and consolidating
the Choque de Gestão, and in achieving the project objectives. However, the internal
control arrangements were at times considered weak due to high staff turnover, and the
implementation of the social safeguards lacked some attention.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Highly Satisfactory
93.     In aggregate, the overall borrower performance is rated highly satisfactory. The
rating is based on the strong commitment shown by the Government and the exemplary
responsiveness and performance of the implementing agency throughout the successful
preparation and implementation of this challenging and innovative multi-sectorial operation.

6. Lessons Learned
94.     The completion of this operation represents an important opportunity to draw
lessons learned. The importance and success of the project, both in terms of its multi-
sectorial, performance based-disbursement design and the public sector reforms, namely
in results-based management implemented by the State since 2003, have drawn attention
to the project during the years of implementation and have been adapted in other Bank
operations. Annex X presents additional lessons learned from the introduction of results-
based management in Minas.

Technical Assistance

                                             21
95.     The importance of a technical assistance component to foster innovation.
While the financial support for government programs was crucial for the financing of those,
the relatively small (US$18.5 million out of US$1,437 million) component reserved for
technical assistance activities proved to have a significant impact. Besides supporting the
implementation of government programs under the SWAp component, it allowed the State
to undertake projects which otherwise would not have been affordable; and innovative and
therefore somehow risky activities, which might not have been approved in the State’s
budget process. Those activities financed under the technical assistance also supported and
contributed input for Minas Gerais’ continuous fine-tuning of reforms as well as the
process towards next reform steps (such as integrated regional development and citizen
participation in priority setting of public policies).
96.     The value-added through technical assistance provided by the Bank. As
emphasized by current and previous government staff, the Bank’s technical support was
seen as one of the main value-added. Technical discussions during preparation and
implementation with sector specialist were received as a very valuable mechanism to
brainstorm ideas and to receive feedback on the government programs. Similarly, the
assistance from Bank staff in the definition of the indicators was seen as helpful.
Furthermore, the continuous assistance by fiduciary staff led to strengthening the State’s
capacity and quality of financial management and public procurement.
97.     The importance of technical assistance as a vehicle for continued dialogue. As
the activities under the technical assistance component required continuous Bank
engagement and was implemented at a slower pace, the dialogue between the Government
and the Bank continued beyond the end of the disbursement of the SWAp component. This
has led to a close and constant engagement with the State of Minas Gerais, including the
implementation of a Development Policy Loan in 2012 and strengthening the role of the
Bank as an important development partner for the State.

Performance-linked disbursement and multi-sectorial design
98.     Disbursement-linked indicators as a performance push. Tying disbursements to
targets seemed to have prompted progress that would not otherwise have occurred. As the
achievement of the targets was directly linked to the frequent disbursement of funds,
anecdotal evidence indicates that recalcitrant secretariats were incentivized to meet the
targets as they did not want to hinder disbursements. 14 Sectors such as health and education
have earmarked revenues linked to them and as such are prioritized. The link between the
DLIs and the Results Agreements probably contributed to the success of State
organizations in meeting their targets. A similar effect was observed in the budget
execution of the EEPs, where some previously underperforming programs significantly
increased their execution during the operation.
99.     Attention needs to be given to the design of the DLIs. The careful and appropriate
design of the DLIs is crucial to serve as a suitable incentive scheme. First, the achievement
of targets should be in the scope of control of the respective entity in charge. Otherwise,
targets might be perceived as unfair. Similarly, DLIs need to be properly defined so they

14
  For the this reason, the SWAp was considered more effective than a DPL (at least a one-tranche DPL) as
the Bank leverage lasted longer.

                                                  22
can be easily measured and tracked over a prolonged period of time, without giving margin
to alternative interpretations.
100. The financing of eligible expenditure programs (EEPs) can serve to protect
certain categories of spending in certain sectors. As the loan disbursed against eligible
expenditures, budget allocations could not be cut in those categories or sectors without
jeopardizing disbursements of the loan. While this had the advantage that sectors such as
transport benefitted by receiving higher budget allocations than previous to the operation,
and partially offset the traditional bias towards cutting investment in a crisis, it did have
the negative effect that the State could not re-assign funds to emerging priorities, as for
example, during the fiscal setback of 2009, when the State wanted to allocate more funds
to programs that would increase citizen participation.
101. The importance of aligning EEPs with the indicators. The relative
representation of EEPs should be aligned with the number of DLIs measuring
achievements in those EEPs to avoid that some sectors with less EEPS are expected to
contribute to a large amount of DLIs, and vice versa.
102. Trade-offs between a multi-sectorial approach and efficient implementation.
While the inclusion of multiple sectors provided a platform to approach cross-cutting issues
and ensured involvement and commitment across the Government, they can bear certain
difficulties for the implementation. For example, the involvement of multiple entities with
varying implementation capacity, staff turnover, and additional layers of reviews and
decision-making can slow down implementation.

Fiduciary Management
103. It is crucial that capacity building and familiarization with the Bank’s
fiduciary requirements is initiated prior to project effectiveness. Reporting can be
improved by synchronizing deadlines, for example, setting the same deadlines for financial
and procurement audit report, and for IFRs and disbursement requests. Particular care must
be taken when two different fiduciary arrangements (SWAp component and TA component)
are included in the same operation. Primary among the lessons learned from the project is
the need for a continuous and careful supervision effort on the part of the Bank.
Role of the Government and the Bank
104. One of the main success factors undoubtedly was the high Government
ownership and commitment. Starting with the Minas Gerais Partnership in 2006,
commitment and ownership to the reform process and the supporting Bank operations was
present on the highest political and technical levels in the State. Strong political leadership
from the Governor and Vice-Governor was perhaps the single most important factor in the
success of both the reforms and the Bank operation. Some high-level staff, such as the
Planning Secretary, remained throughout the life of the project. This ensured continuity as
well as a good working relationship with the Bank, both of which were of great importance
to the success of the operation. At the same time, the Results Agreements served as an
instrument to trickle down the implementation commitment to the technical secretariat-
level.
105. High capacity and fostering innovation. The overall high capacity of the
counterpart, including many motived and innovative young staff members facilitated
                                              23
preparation and implementation of this complex operation. Furthermore, the
administration, in part through this operation, provided a breeding ground for innovative
approaches and encouraged staff to engage in them. This environment contributed to
transforming Minas into a ‘good practice’ experience for results-based management and
other public administration reforms.
106. Bank involvement and support gave credibility to the process. Anecdotal
evidence suggests that the Bank financing, and more importantly the role of the Bank as a
partner and its technical expertise, gave legitimacy and credibility to the reform process
and the definition and monitoring of the results agreements. Similarly, the external
recognition provided by the Bank reportedly elevated staff’s morale and was fundamental
to help the teams achieve results.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
   (a) Borrower/implementing agencies
107. In the Borrower’s Completion Report, which was received by the Bank in
October 2014, and although was very complementary overall. However some detailed
problems were raised. Most of those issues were overcome and successfully addressed
during project implementation. With regard to the TA, the report regrets that, occasionally,
it took the Bank an unnecessary long time to send letters of no objection thus delaying the
hiring of personnel. The Bank recognizes the difficulties raised by the Borrower and can
report that lately there has been progress made to shorten approval processes and increase
responsiveness to client’s needs.
108. The comments provided by the Borrower on the Bank’s ICR were primarily
editorial and have been included in this version of the ICR.

Annex II. Outputs by Component

1.     The original project contained 24 indicators, all of which were Disbursement-
Linked Indicators (DLIs); with the Additional Financing, the number of DLIs was
increased to 32. DLIs were linked to Eligible Expenditure Programs (EEPs) which are
presented in the tables below in the beginning of each sector section, jointly with a
summary of the achievement of the indicators.
2.       The disbursement of the funds under the SWAp component (US$1,413 million)
was completed in 2011, which marked a de facto completion point for the project, as (i)
almost 99 percent of the funds were disbursed, and (ii) all (except one) DLIs had achieved
their targets established for the period of 2008-2011. However, as the technical assistance
under Component 2 with a small number of consulting services, almost all indicators
continued to be monitored for the purpose of project reporting. Therefore, the tables below
by sector show (i) the originally established target date, (ii) the year the final target was
actually achieved, and (iii) the latest available status. This allows to create a snapshot of
the project at the time of completion of the SWAp Component, and allows for showing the
sustainability and further progress until the final closing date of the project.

1.     An overriding goal of the Government was to extend the culture of results
management across all line secretariats. This was addressed in the operation by
including indicators that encompassed the successful implementation of results
agreements, strengthening M&E, and improving information sources. More concretely, it
included increasing the percentage of structural (priority investment) programs in total
expenditures to ensure resources were allocated in accordance with state priorities.
2.     Strengthening of the Choque de Gestão was done primarily by requiring seven
main secretariats to meet a 70 percent performance requirement. This indicator was
quickly met and surpassed, and by 2013 a total of 28 secretariats had achieved a
performance of 70 percent or more. The operation also supported expanding the results-
based management framework to secretariats, requiring that second stage results
agreements in eleven main agencies be evaluated by the end of the first quarter of the
following year. Annex X of this ICR provides a closer look into the results-based
management model pioneered by Minas in Brazil. The indicator “strengthening of
Evidence-based policy-making” focused on strategic projects making use of indicators,
again with the intention to strengthen an important facet of RBM framework monitoring
and evaluation.
3.      Procurement reforms under the project were highly successful and
contributed to the use of country systems. The procurement reform that was part of the
“Fiscal Management Modernization” eligible expenditure program had the following
objectives: (i) to rationalize purchases and contracting procedures for at least two service
families and (ii) design and implement standard pre-purchasing procedures in at least one
secretariat. These objectives were not only fulfilled, but exceeded their original scope. The
rationalization of purchase and contracting procedures included three groups of services
and three of goods, and the pre-purchasing procedures were piloted in six secretariats in
2010 and rolled out to a total of 22 in 2011, and to all purchasing units of the State
Government by 2014. The online publication of a unified procurement calendar for the
State has also been a result of this reform.
4.      One of the most remarkable aspects of procurement reform in Minas Gerais
is how seriously it was taken. To ensure different secretariats adhered to the reforms, so
that they were and remain sustainable, SEPLAG included both activities as indicators in
the results agreements that it signed with the secretariats.
5.     The ratio of personnel expenditures with respect to net current revenue
increased from 59.43 percent in 2007 to 63 percent in 2011 and further to 65.7 percent
in 2012. With this result, the Minas Government surpassed the PAF limit and did not

                                              28
achieve the DLI, which led to a reduced disbursement and a partial cancelation of loan
funds. The main reason for the increase in expenditures with personnel was the raise of the
wage floor (piso salarial) for teachers, doctors and police, in compliance with the federal
law. This raise reflected demands from teachers following the 2011 strike – when public
schools closed for several months - and a general pressure for improvements in the citizen
security sector. Minas Gerais had one of the lowest piso salarial for teachers in Brazil,
before the abovementioned increase. In retrospect, and after discussions with officials from
Minas, the Bank team believes that this type of indicator can be avoided in the future, as it
was already part of a commitment with the Federal Government (through the PAF) and as
such, from the point of view of the Borrower, it was a redundant indicator. The Bank team
which prepared the operation, however, mentioned that this indicator was positively seen
during Bank internal reviews and therefore it was kept as a DLI.
6.      The indicator regarding the participation of strategic projects in budget
expenditures was met. However, it is worth mentioning that both the Bank and Minas’
teams recognized that similar indicators should be avoided in the future, for a couple of
reasons: i) with high turnover of staff in Minas, the memory of calculus of this indicator
was lost a few times and different people calculated it in different ways, with different
results; ii) because “strategic projects” was not precisely defined, the indicator can easily
be manipulated to meet its target.

7.      The Government believed that improving the investment climate in the State
was the best way to establish the conditions for long-term growth and continuous job
creation. The Minas Gerais Integrated Development Plan 2007-2023 had as one of its main
objectives the need to increase dynamism and innovativeness to promote economic growth
and sustainable social transformation, making Minas Gerais “the best place to do business
in Brazil”. The Minas Fácil units and Technology Innovation Centers (hosted by Science
and Technology Institutions) spread throughout the State were deemed important for
disseminating knowledge and supporting innovations and entrepreneurial activities.
                                               29
Streamlining of time to start a business – consultations, taxes, licensing, payments, and
registrations – was an important efficiency measure to facilitate economic activity in Belo
Horizonte. The reduction of days necessary to start a business from 26 in 2007 to 6 in 2013
is a notable feat, and was possible due to the degree of ownership and commitment
presented by the implementing agency. Although not included as a DLI, the Government
also succeeded in reducing the numbers of days to close a business (from over 100 to 13
days). The reduction of the numbers of days to start and close a business was achieved
through a successful technical assistance contract. The Borrower considers this technical
assistance to have been highly successful due to its close definition and monitoring by
SEPLAG, and by the fact that the (local) consulting company knew the Minas context and
institutions well.
8.     Minas has the largest numbers of PPP contracts in Brazil. With funds from the
TA component, the State created a PPP Unit in the Secretariat of Economic Development
(Secretaria de Desenvolvimento Econômico – SEDE) and provided training to its staff
members. Some of the PPP contracts in Minas Gerais included a prison, an Integrated
Services Unit (Unidade de Atendimento Integrado – UAI), the “Mineirão” soccer stadium
and a highway (MG-050).

 Impact Evaluation of Viva Vida Centers      Excluded from the project in 2011

9.     The project supported activities focused on improving the State’s healthcare
systems through the introduction and consolidation of management mechanisms and
tools at all three healthcare levels (primary, secondary and tertiary). Progress was
                                                 30
observed in reducing inequalities in health services and increasing access to the Unified
Health System (Sistema Único de Saúde - SUS) network, especially in primary care. As
health was a Government priority, a significant and increasing amount of resources had
been allocated to the SUS, and health expenditures represented an important amount in the
municipal budgets. As a result, State programs such as “Health at Home” (Saúde em Casa)
benefited about 841 municipalities and under the “Viva Vida” Program with 59 Viva Vida
Centers inaugurated. However, those program required co-financing from the
municipalities, meaning more a political induction than a sustainable financial support.
10.     Municipal healthcare systems were improved by developing instruments that
supported an integrated coordination among different levels and strategies of the
healthcare system, as for example the Family Health Strategy with other levels in the
healthcare system, such as primary healthcare. This was implemented by setting up and
strengthening regulatory structures involving the Municipal Health Secretariats and
decentralizing responsibilities of the Family Health Units to the local level. Improvements
also included the re-organization of processes and protocols, introduction of electronic
patient charts and the expansion of the provision of specialized services at the municipal
level. While Minas has some mechanisms for integration among different levels of care,
especially referral and counter-referral systems, there is still a lack of integration among
different healthcare providers, insufficient policies for care of medium complexity cases
and further need for process and protocol enhancement.
11.    Data on health outcomes shows that municipalities made great progress in
reducing infant mortality, as the State Infant Mortality Rate decreased from 16,9 to 12,4
deaths per 100,000 live births in the last ten years, and Primary Health Care coverage
reached 79,5 percent in 2014. Nevertheless, these positive results cannot only be attributed
to specific programs or incentives, as the social and epidemiological dynamics of infant
mortality in the municipalities within the state are much more complex.
12.     The operation also supported the improvement of hospital infrastructure. The
PROHOSP (Hospital Strengthening and Quality Improvement Control Project), is part of
the State’s regionalization process, which was initiated in 2003 and is an umbrella program
that seeks to rationalize the set-up of the health care network and improve the quality of
care by reducing the amount of small, inefficient hospitals, and creating regional networks
with strong linkages among medical care organizations, developing information systems
to support the networks, and establishing incentives and accountability schemes to improve
hospital performance.
13.    PROHOSP uses targets and performance indicators to evaluate hospitals,
encouraged improvements in both organizational and physical infrastructure. In
return, participating and complying hospitals received funds transferred by the
Government of Minas Gerais. In 2013, the Program supported 140 hospitals in the State,
109 (78 percent) of which have been assessed for accreditation by an institution certified
by the National Accreditation Organization (Organização Nacional de Acreditação –
ONA) 15. Distinct patterns of influence in the municipalities were observed, with

15
   Accreditation is a formal process by which a body accredited by ONA assesses that a health care
organization meets applicable, predetermined and published quality-of-care standards. A hospital is


                                                31
regionalization being marked by important gains in institutionality and governance.
Nevertheless, inherent difficulties of context undermined greater advances. There is a
pressing need to broaden the territorial focus in government planning and to integrate
sectorial policies for medium and long-term regional development in order to empower
regionalization and to overcome obstacles to access to health care services in the State.
14.    The Hospital Foundation of Minas Gerais (FHEMIG) also played an
important role in this process, by using information derived from the use of hospital
cost management mechanisms as a management tool for strategic decision-making
hospital organizations. The hospital cost management provided information that was
more specific and accurate than the previous system of costing per absorption, and it
allowed to identify shortcomings and bottlenecks along the entire chain of hospital internal
processes. The 21 health facilities under FHEMIG administration now have implemented
a standardized costing system to collect and monitor clinical and non-clinical costs.

15.     The EEPs included elementary, secondary vocational, and personnel
expenditures, and constituted the main part of all expenditures under the SWAp. The
DLIs tracked the education secretariat’s implementation of its progress in raising 3rd grade
literacy (Proalfa scores), utilization of the secondary school classroom-level testing program
(Programa de Avaliação da Aprendizagem Escolar - PAAE), development of the SIMADE
management information system, and vocational training program enrollments (PEP).
16.     The objectives of the education component were to support expansion of
Minas Gerais’ innovations in student learning measurement and integrated
management information, as well as a new voucher program to offer state secondary
students a range of vocational training options through partnerships with private
(enterprises), quasi-public (“Sistema S”) and other public (municipal and federal)
providers of skills training. Minas has a tradition of education innovation and the goal of
the operation was to help the State expand some of its most promising programs. It is
impressive that the programs targeted for support under the SWAp were not only scaled-
up with success under the program, but also influenced national education policy. Minas’
early grade literacy program (Alfabetização na Idade Certa) and 3rd grade reading test were

                                               33
the inspiration for the Ministry of Education’s 2012 Programa Nacional de Alfabetização
na Idade Certa, PNAIC, and the national 3rd grade literacy test, ANA (Avaliação Nacional
de Alfabetização) beginning implementation in 2014.
17.     A second testing innovation supported under the program was the PAAE, also
a first in Brazil. The PAAE is an online item bank that the Secretariat, working with
secondary school teachers, has developed for all major secondary school subjects. The
PAAE program allows classroom teachers in 9th grade (the first year of secondary school)
to generate their own tests and apply these at the classroom level at the beginning of the
school year and again at the end of the school year. It generates confidential, classroom
level results for each student that helps teachers tailor their support to different students.
Comparing end of year results with students’ scores at the beginning of the year also allows
school directors and regional supervisors to compare the performance of different teachers
in generating learning improvements (value-added learning gains) for their students at the
classroom level. This is a state of the art educational assessment and has become an
important formative input for school directors and school system managers. There are no
stakes for individual teachers associated with these results, which would have destroyed
confidence in, and use of, the system. Instead, school directors use the results for informal
feedback to individual teachers and the Secretariat uses the results for training design.
18.     Minas’ vocational training voucher program, PEP (Programa do Ensino
Profissionalizante) has also influenced national education policy. In 2013, the Rousseff
administration launched PRONATEC, which, just like PEP, channels resources to different
training providers on a per capita basis, to fund a range of different short-term technical
and vocational training course options. Students take this training either concurrently with
their secondary school studies, or directly after they complete secondary school. Part of
Minas’ innovation was to establish a sound accreditation program to assure the quality of
the wide variety of course options and training providers permitted under the program. As
of 2014, PEP has effectively been absorbed into PRONATEC, after scaling up rapidly from
zero to over 170,000 (cumulative) students between 2007 and 2013.
19.     Finally, Minas’ education management information system, SIMADE, is now
the leading example in Brazil. SIMADE is a system that incorporates student, teacher,
school and regional district information on results (test scores, promotion/repetition) and
human resources (classroom and school assignments, promotions, salaries) into a single
integrated system that allows calculation of unit costs by school, district, level of education,
and program.

20.      The project’s transport sector supported two large and important road
programs in the State: Pro-MG and Pro-Acesso. The Pro-MG rehabilitated and
maintained the state paved road network through results-based contracts, and the Pro-
Acesso provided surfaced road access to poor, rural municipalities in order to improve their
integration into the State and regional economy. In addition, the Project assisted in
institutional strengthening activities for the State Roads Department (DER) and the State
Secretariat of Transport and Public Works (SETOP) mainly in the areas of traffic safety
and transport and logistics planning/management.
21.    Starting in 2003, the Pro-Acesso program has provided paved road access in
214 municipalities with a population of 1.3 million people. As a result, out of 853
municipalities in the State, 842 municipalities (98.7 percent) had paved road access to the
trunk State highway network by 2014. Out of 11 municipalities that had not yet been
concluded, six were delayed mainly due to natural incidents such as large-scale erosions,
and five were implemented by the Federal Government (DNIT). The Pro-Acesso
demonstrated very fast progress between 2008 and 2010 and most of the works were
concluded by 2011. The contracts in 61 municipalities with the value of R$1,183 million
were eligible for project financing, which accounts for 30% of the total investment of
R$3,910 million.
22.   Pro-Acesso contributed not only to reduce transport/logistics costs, but also to
improve the living standard of rural poor populations. The impact evaluation


16
   5,756km or 36.7 percent of the paved state highway network were under the result-based contracts in 2011.
While the value increased to 44.7 percent in 2012, it dropped down to below 40 percent after 2013 because
some contracts had not been renewed after the initial 4-year contract period mainly due to the sudden
elimination of the part of the gasoline tax dedicated to road infrastructure in 2011.


                                                    35
conducted by the client 17 indicated that the municipalities receiving Pro-Acesso works had
more rapid growth in economic indicators than ones that already had paved accesses before
the Pro-Acesso, resulting in a reduction of economic inequality among municipalities in
the State. Furthermore, according to a traffic count survey on several sample roads, traffic
volumes doubled after the completion of the works, which indicates that the program
stimulated local economic and social activities in rural communities.
23.    In total, 7,600km of the State paved road network in 14 (out of 40) sub-regions
were rehabilitated and maintained through the 4-year results-based contracts
(CREMA) under the Pro-MG program in the last 8 years. The project contributed to
the expansion of the Pro-MG between 2007 and 2012. Out of 22 contracts 18, three contracts
with the total value of R$375 million were eligible to the Project’s financing.
24.     The Pro-MG program enhanced sustainability of the State’s road asset: the
proportion of the State road network in good conditions increased from 43 percent in 2007
to 72 percent in 2011, which substantially contributed to reduce transport costs of road
users with both freight and passenger vehicles. Furthermore, the Pro-MG also ensured
sustainability of the Pro-Acesso program by including newly surfaced roads of Pro-Acesso.
However, the progress of the Pro-MG was slow in contrast to the Pro-Acesso, which had
strong political support from the state government.
25.     The project provided technical assistances to the DER and the SETOP in
strengthening institutional capacities mainly on road safety and logistics/transport
management. One of the main achievements was the creation of a logistics planning and
management unit under the SETOP, which the project assisted through the hiring of
consultants. The objective of the unit is to evaluate strategies on the State transport network
in consideration of territorial integration and supply chain improvement. The unit has
capacity of technical analysis on transport planning and has conducted economic feasibility
studies on the concession/PPP roads (MG-050 and ring road), micro traffic simulation,
demand analysis of agricultural products, and freight Origin-Destination (OD) survey in the
metropolitan area. Furthermore, the unit plans to revise the State highway concession
program and update the mid-term road investment plan. The project also financed the
feasibility study on the Northern Minas railway to improve mineral transport. These analyses
provide a solid grounding for decision-making in transport/logistic policies in the State.
26.      The project also supported initiatives on road safety though the Bank did not
finance the activities. By 2014, DER has installed 240 speed control units as well as 18
intelligent radars which can automatically read plate numbers, resulting in reduction in
traffic accidents by 35 percent on road sections with speed control units. Furthermore, the
Bank team assisted the SETOP in conducting the road safety capacity review study funded
by the Global Road Safety Facility and in organizing a workshop to disseminate the results.
Also the team helped organize a study tour in Spain to learn best practices in this area.

27.     As in the other sectors, activities under the SWAp component in the
environmental and social quality sector were concluded in 2011, with all three
indicators achieved. The environmental DLI called for concession of environmental
licenses for two classes of processes to be halved to 90 days primarily through the use of
IT technology. This had been achieved by 2009, and was maintained through 2011.
However, by 2013, the duration had increased to 93 days, slightly over the initially
established target.
28.     The number of certified teachers in indigenous areas was increased from 137
to 213 during project life. This led to greater empowerment of indigenous communities
and contributed to a rise in the level of indigenous education through the creation of the
Intercultural Training of Indigenous Teachers at the Federal University of Minas Gerais.
On indigenous health, increasing the number of inter-disciplinary indigenous health teams
from 12 to 19 within the project’s duration and surpassing the final target. This contributed
to increase the quality of the service of Primary Indigenous Health and Care in the State.

29.    The original project addressed poverty reduction in an indirect manner, by
supporting measures expected to promote growth through improvements in public
sector management, the business environment, and the quality of public service
delivery. The Addition Financing provided additional direct support to the Government’s
poverty reduction strategy by supporting the application of the results-based management
approach to programs aimed at poverty reduction, and including the Rural Poverty
Reduction Project (RPRP) as a new EEP.
30.     Three DLIs supported the government’s Rural Poverty Reduction Program.
The first was the number of families to be benefitted by the program, which was not only
achieved before the end target date, but also surpassed. A second DLI called for intensive
monitoring of the RPRP by SEPLAG and the Instituto de Desenvolvimento do Norte e
Nordeste de Minas (IDENE). This was achieved by holding a total of six monitoring
meetings a year in 2010 and 2011. The third DLI also targeted the impoverished Great
North Region of the State. The Bank had assisted the State in the formulation of a
Household Survey, the first being carried out in 2009. The 2010 target called for publishing
the results of this Survey and preparing the 2011 survey. In 2011 a report was prepared
which analyzed the statewide and Great North data and contributed to improved policy
design and monitoring.
31.     The two additional poverty DLIs were related to the health and education
sectors. One called for the State Secretariat of Education to develop 13 courses for initial
job training in the area of information technology. The courses lasted from 40 to 60 hours
and were offered to secondary school students. The target for 2010 for this indicator (90
schools in the Great North offering initial work preparation courses for the assembling and
maintenance of computers) was achieved, but the Program was discontinued in 2011. The final
DLI measured the proportion of live births from mothers with seven or more pre-natal
consultations in the Great North. The target for this indicator was not only achieved, but
the proportion of live births has increased from 46.1 percent in 2007 to 66.6 percent in
2013. As a comparison, the proportion of live births in the State of Minas Gerais was 61.4
percent in 2007 and 71.5 percent in 2013.

   2. Technical Assistance Component

32.     Technical Assistance (TA) activities were introduced to help achieve the stated
management for results objectives. Those activities included strengthening procurement
and improving the knowledge base on which sector strategies, budgets and targets were
based. Some of the activities carried out were studies including a household survey, impact
evaluations in education, health and transport, a quality assurance survey, and a study of
output indicators and links to outcomes (see list below for all TA activities).
33.     The TA activities were directly linked to support the achievements of DLIs.
For instance, a study measuring the quality of service provision to businesses can be
directly linked to achievement of the DLI that measured the time necessary to open a
business in the State capital. Similarly, an assessment of the state capacity to handle road
safety and the identification of a set of actions to improve capacity informed the efforts of
the GoMG toward the achievement of DLIs in the transport sector.
34.     In the transport sector, the project provided technical assistances to the DER
and the SETOP in strengthening institutional capacities mainly on road safety and
logistics/transport management. One of the main achievements was the creation of a
logistics planning and management unit under the SETOP, which the project assisted in
through the hiring of consultants. The objective of the unit is to evaluate strategies on the
State transport network in consideration of territorial integration and supply chain
improvement. The unit has capacity of technical analysis on transport planning and has
conducted economic feasibility studies on the concession/PPP roads (MG-050 and ring
road), micro traffic simulation, demand analysis of agricultural products, and freight
Origin-Destination (OD) survey in the metropolitan area. Furthermore, the unit plans to
revise the State highway concession program and update the mid-term road investment
plan. The project also financed the feasibility study on the Northern Minas railway to
improve mineral transport. These analyses provide a solid grounding for decision-making
in transport/logistic policies in the State.
35.      The Economic Master Plan for the Metropolitan Area of Belo Horizonte has
resulted in being a policy guiding document. The purpose of the Economic Master Plan,
prepared by a consultancy firm hired through Technical Assistance, was to serve as a guide for
the development of the Metropolitan Region of Belo Horizonte in the next 20 years. The Plan’s
objective is to improve the State’s ability to attract foreign investments to the region in the
medium and long term. This plan is now the basis for an integral strategy of economic and
regional development for the Metropolitan Area of Belo Horizonte, streamlining economic and
social needs and the required infrastructure for a sustainable economic and social development;
it also integrates the participation of state and municipal level administrations.
36.    The State Secretariat of Health prioritized use of the TA funds to finance the
process of change management in the implementation of electronic records systems in
two areas: (a) family health and (b) urgent and emergency health care. Specifically, an
Organizational Change Management plan resulted in the successful implementation of a
Hospital Management System in the urgent and emergency care units of 19 selected hospitals.

Annex III. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.      No comprehensive economic assessment was undertaken at preparation. The
original Project Appraisal Document (PAD) states, that as a multi-sectorial operation
supporting government programs and activities in different areas and of different natures,
a comprehensive economic assessment did not apply and therefore was not undertaken.
However, in the cases of education and transport a more detailed ex-ante economic analysis
was carried out and included in the original PAD.
2.      Although economic rates of return are difficult to compute in public sector
reform projects, efficiency gains are likely to have occurred in the areas targeted by
the project components. At project completion, due to a lack of information no extensive
ex-post economic assessment was carried out to measure whether the assumptions of the
ex-ante analysis had materialized. The effectiveness of the interventions is difficult to
assess due to the lack of a true counterfactual. However, drawing on different sources and
methodologies (e.g., estimating the counterfactual by averaging pre-intervention data), and
widening the scope to additional sectors, evidence suggests that the project had an overall
positive impact.
3.      A recent World Bank study 19 on results-based management in several
Brazilian states shows improvements in several sectors. An analysis comparing current
with pre-intervention outcomes in education, health, and the security sector in Minas and
other Brazilian States was carried out by a World Bank team in late 2013. The analysis
examined changes in relation with regional trends to determine if the improvements depart
in meaningful ways from the overall trend. In addition, the study applied a truncated time-
series cross section to control for a number of additional factors influencing service
delivery outcomes in the examined sectors.

Education Sector
4.     In the original PAD, two kinds of empirical analysis were conducted for the
education sector. First, an exercise to calculate rates of return to each additional year of
education in the State of Minas Gerais indicated a rate of return of 4.46 percent for the
Primary level (Grades 1 to 8), 10.3 percent for the Secondary level (Grades 9 to 11), and
19.74 percent for the tertiary level. Second, a production function of test scores using data
from Portuguese and Mathematics test scores aggregated at the municipal level was used
to provide insight into the determinants of learning achievement in Minas Gerais. Results
pointed to the importance of socio-economic conditions, indicating how social inequalities
were reproduced by the existing educational system.
5.     For the education sector, the above-mentioned World Bank study finds that
positive results. Especially after the introduction of the second-level agreements in 2007,
Minas Gerais recorded a statistically significant improvement in the IDEB score from 3.40
in 2007 to 3.60 in 2010. A quasi-experimental before-and-after comparison of outcomes in
Health, Public Security, and Education revealed that when comparing Minas Gerais to

other states in the Southeastern region only improvements in education outcomes go
beyond the general trend (see Annex 10 for details).

Transportation Sector
6.      Cost-benefit Analysis in Transportation Component in original PAD. For
transport, a cost-benefit analysis was conducted to evaluate the two following programs:
1) paved highways rehabilitation and maintenance under the Pro MG-Pleno program, and
2) road surfacing under the Pro-Acesso program. The net present value (NPV) of
investments under the Pro MG-Pleno program was calculated as R$2.245 billion at a 12
percent discount rate over 20 years evaluation period. The internal rate of return (IRR) of
the program was estimated at 35.60 percent. The road surfacing component under the Pro-
Acesso program was estimated to have a NPV of R$998 million at a 12 percent discount
rate and yield an IRR of 26.42 percent. A sensitivity analysis switching values under
different scenarios showed that the economic returns of the Pro-Acesso and Pro-MG Pleno
programs were robust.
7.      The ex-post economic evaluation of the both Pro-Acesso and Pro-MG was
conducted through a simplified way due to the limited data availability, but it
confirmed that the both programs remain economically viable. While the ex-ante
economic evaluation model was developed with the HDM-4, software commonly used for
appraisal of Bank-financed road projects, most of data required to update to the ex-post
model are not available. Accordingly, the posteriori economic viability was examined
through assessing the two most important factors; traffic volume and costs, which
significantly affect the economic indicators.
8.      The ex-post evaluation for Pro-MG was conducted for the five regions (CRG)20
of the total extension of 1,825km. The total cost spent for the first four-year CREMA
contracts in these 5 regions was R$222 million (excluding inflation adjustments), which is
1.8 percent higher than the cost estimations used for the ex-ante HDM-model. Meanwhile,
based on the traffic count data 21, the annual traffic growth is 6 percent on average, which
is twice as high as the assumption used in the ex-ante evaluation (3 percent). Assuming
these cost and traffic growths in all regions, it is confirmed that IRR and NPV are better
than those 22 in the ex-ante evaluation 23.




20
   CRG1, 3, 16, 20 and 24.
21
   Available for only two regions: CRG4 and 17, both of which were eligible to Bank financing. The traffic
count surveys were conducted in 2009 and 2014.
22
   The IRR and NPV at appraisal were 38.77 percent and R$423million (a 12 percent discount rate) for the
first 5 regions.
23
   The ex-ante evaluation was conducted for 9 categories of roads with different pavement conditions and
traffic levels. For example, the category with the lowest IRR among all categories at appraisal was a group
of roads with medium traffic (730-1,700 per day) and good pavement conditions before the interventions.
It’s IRR has been improved from 11.54 to 15.62 percent after applying the revised cost (1.8 percent higher)
and annual traffic growth (6 percent). Due to the similarity of the model, applying the same cost and traffic
growth rates, the results of all other categories will be better than the original ones.


                                                    42
9.      Ex-post evaluation for Pro-Acesso. While the unit costs for civil works are on
average 9.2 percent more expensive 24 than ones used for the ex-ante evaluation after
adjusting inflation 25, the traffic volume has increased much more rapidly than expected at
appraisal. Based on the traffic count data on the three sections under the Pro-Acesso, the
traffic volume is on average 90 percentage higher than estimated in the ex-ante model.
Assuming that the same cost and traffic growth rates are applied to all Pro-Acesso roads,
the ex-post IRR and NPV of the Pro-Acceso program are further improved compared to
the ex-ante evaluation 2627.

Health Sector
10.     In the health sector, no assessment was undertaken in the original PAD,
evidence suggests a positive impact in the health sector. The 2013 World Bank study
finds no discontinuity in the trend that could be linked to the introduction of performance
agreements that was supported by the loan. While the rate decreased by 1.2 points between
2007 and 2010, child mortality levels remain above the regional average and the distance
between the two has been fairly constant. Minas Gerais’ trend is similar to that of the
Southeast region and that of Rio de Janeiro, a State not using performance-related pay in
the health sector.

Other impacts
11.     Positive Behavioral Changes. Despite those concrete improvements, it should be
mentioned that other outcomes of the project such as the introduction of a “culture of
achieving results” among civil servants are likely to have occurred but are difficult to
measure quantitatively. To capture civil servants’ perceptions of the management reforms,
a survey was conducted among Minas’ civil servants. The majority of respondents believe
that the introduction of results agreements helped them better understand their role and
objectives at work (see Annex X).
12.     High overall efficiency. To sum up, conducting a rigorous economic analysis is
not viable due to the lack of an appropriate counterfactual. However, considering the
achievement of most of the PDO and Intermediate indicators, the overall efficiency of the
project can be considered rather high.




24
   Based on the comparison of average unit costs for civil works used for the ex-ante evaluation with the
actual contract values with adjustment of inflation.
25
   Índice Nacional de Custo da Construçăo (INCC) was used to eliminate inflation effects from the costs.
26
   IRR and NPV of the ex-ante evaluation were 26.42 percent and R$998 million at a 12 percent discount
rate respectively for the 90 road sections of the Pro-Acesso.
27
   As an example, one road section in Santanta Deserto, which had the lowest IRR of 10.4 percent among
all road sections at appraisal, was re-assessed with applying the revised cost (9 percent higher) and traffic
(90 percent higher). The updated IRR and NPV are 14.1 percent and R$0.67 million which are better than
the ex-ante evaluation. Due to the similarity of the model, applying the same cost and traffic growth rates,
the results of all other sections will be better than the original ones.

See Annex X for the results of the survey that was conducted among public servants in
Minas Gerais directly affected by the implementation of results agreements. The survey
was carried out in mid-December 2014 among public servants to capture their perception

Annex VII. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

1.     This Annex summarizes the full version of the Borrower’s Completion Report
which was made available to the Bank on October 17, 2014 and was 91 pages in length.
The full version (in Portuguese) can be accessed online.
2.      The Borrower’s report is divided into five sections. The first section provides a
brief introduction to the project and its context. The second section presents the objectives,
design, components, stakeholders, and indicators of the project. Subsequently, the third
section deals with the implementation of the operation. This section includes a detailed
account of eligible expenditure programs (EEPs), technical assistance (TA),
disbursements, and safeguards. Section four displays the results of the operation by
presenting achievements in the monitored areas. The results show a significant
improvement of most of the indicators monitored. With regard to the observed
improvements, it is highlighted that no evidence exists that links the improvement of the
indicators with the operation. However, it is believed that the World Bank’s support had a
positive impact on the performance of the indicators monitored. The last section provides
an evaluation of the Borrower’s own performance as well as an evaluation of the
performance of the Bank. This summary focuses mainly on the last section of the
borrower’s ICR because its content is rather evaluative, as opposed to descriptive, and
therefore more relevant for the Bank’s ICR.

Evaluation of the Borrower’s own performance

3.      The Borrower’s evaluation of its own performance is primarily based on
interviews with public servants directly involved in the operation. Public servants
stated that the Bank provided the operation with a stamp of legitimacy which was vital to
cope with internal opposition. In addition, the Borrower benefited from the Bank’s
thorough monitoring of indicators in that it helped create a new organizational culture
focused on achieving results.
4.      Technical assistance generated valuable knowledge. Another important
condition that had a positive impact on the Borrower’s performance was the high amount
of financial resources reserved for contracting technical assistance. It allowed the State to
invest in the acquisition of knowledge in a way that would not have been possible without
the Loan. Additionally, the experience with coordinating such a large operation and the
frequent discussions between public servants and Bank staff generated knowledge that
could also be applied in future operations.
5.      However, the government encountered difficulties in defining which activities
to include. These difficulties eventually contributed to the delay in implementing the TA
component. For future operations involving TA, it is believed that a more centralized
communication between the State and the Bank would be more effective.
6.      In general, however, the TA component, despite making up a small part of the
resources available, was considered highly relevant to the success of the operation.
The contact with the hired consultants generated a strong learning experience for the teams
involved. The Bank’s contracting practice, i.e. placing greater emphasis on skills than on
price, helped recruiting highly qualified personnel capable of leveraging their skills to

                                             47
public servants. Several projects have resulted in the development of innovative processes
that have been effectively incorporated into routine public sector practices.
7.       Important lessons learned emerged from the TA component. It was found that
the success of the TA depends on clearly defining the goals of the activities. Furthermore,
it is crucial that the team is willing and able to adapt, replicate and improve in order to
internalize the knowledge produced by the consultants. Finally, a more thorough and
systematic evaluation of the TA portfolio should have been conducted to eliminate those
projects that have the highest risk of failure and discontinuity.
8.      At the same time, the size of the operation and the high number of technical
personnel involved generated inefficiencies and difficulties. Especially at the beginning,
auditing practices of the Bank had to be aligned with those of the State, and there was a
lack of clarity about financial reporting and responsibilities. Those difficulties were
exacerbated by two critical factors. One factor was the high turnover of technical personnel
involved on the Borrower side. The other was the missing of a structured knowledge
management process for the State Government. As a consequence, in several cases,
outgoing Government staff did not pass on knowledge about the operation adequately to
their successors, creating errors and inefficiencies. As a case in point, the report mentions
the Tribunal de Contas do Estado (TCE). The TCE’s audit process was significantly
hampered by the high turnover rate of State employees. In addition, the report laments a
delay between the start of the execution of the project and the start of the audit.
9.      Design issues recognized by the Borrower included misalignment of incentives.
The report highlights the fact that, in some cases, financial incentives were not targeting
the sector teams that were actually responsible for achieving certain pre-determined goals.
For example, the Health Secretary would receive financial compensation for fulfilling
indigenous safeguards despite the fact that there are only few opportunities to implement
indigenous safeguards in the health sector.
10.    In sum, the Borrower’s performance would have benefited from improved
knowledge management processes that are particularly important in an operation of this
size and length. A smaller operation over a shorter time span that focuses on only a few
areas might generate more profound results and suffer less of the difficulties associated
with high staff turnover.

Evaluation of the performance of the Bank

11.      The feedback of the surveyed public servants on the Bank’s contribution to
the Second Partnership Project with Minas Gerais is generally very positive. The
respondents indicated that the Bank’s team was very well qualified and extremely proactive
in finding solutions to the difficulties encountered during preparation and implementation.
It was noted that Bank staff added value by bringing in international experience and best
practices. Furthermore, it was stated that the Bank was very helpful in refining project ideas
and providing a critical eye from a broader perspective.
12.    Despite the generally fruitful cooperation, some initial difficulties occurred.
For example, financial experts from the Bank were not used to the rules of Brazilian public
accounting. However, those difficulties were overcome and successfully addressed by the
Third Partnership Program (DPL II). Another area that caused some confusion concerned
                                             48
the Eligible Expenditure Programs (EEPs). The Borrower was unsure about which
expenditures counted towards the EEPs, which resulted in delays in the submission of the
reports. With regard to the TA, the report states that, at times, it took the Bank an
unnecessary long time to send letters of no objection, delaying the hiring of consultants.
Another issue with the TA was that the Bank often criticized the design of activities without
giving concrete indications for improvement, thus further delaying approval processes.
13.    All in all, it shall be noted that the performance of the Bank was considered to be
highly satisfactory by the Borrower, and that the difficulties encountered had only a
punctual character.

Sustainability and continuation of EEPs

14.      The sustainability of the improvements is key to evaluating the success of the
operation. Therefore, the Borrower’s report includes a table listing the EEPs supported
under the SWAp operation that were kept in the Plano Plurianual de Ação Governamental
(PPAG) for the period 2012-2015. The table shows that the EEPs were continued in the
PPAG, even though in many cases under different names. For example, the “Network of
Technological Innovation” program became the “Technology and Innovation towards a
Knowledge Economy” program. The PPAG clearly reflects the continuity of programs
initially implemented under the Minas Gerais Second Partnership Program.

Annex X: An Overview of Minas Gerais’ Management Reforms

1.       This annex provides a more in-depth look into the management reforms
implemented by the State since 2003, and the role of the Bank in making it possible.
The analysis here presented follow three complementary methodologies: i) interviews with
selected government officials; ii) data analysis, and iii) a perception survey with Minas’
public sector employees regarding the introduction of performance agreements.
Management reforms carried out by Minas involved profound and multi-dimensional
institutional changes which have evolved over time; as such, the team does not expect to
draw any definite conclusion regarding its results, but simply to shed light into a couple of
aspects that emerged from the interviews, survey and data analysis. All of these
methodologies are limited in one way or another, and such limitations are highlighted in
the respective sections.
2.      Following this logic, this Annex is divided in three sections: Section (I) presents
an overview of Minas’ performance agreements with a focus on the education sector, based
on interviews with selected government officials. Section (II) presents a comparison of
results in the health, education and citizen security sectors achieved by Minas vis- à-vis
other Brazilian states. In section (III) we share the results from the questionnaire sent to
Minas’ civil servants in December 2014 regarding their perception of those reforms.
3.      While the data analysis points to a positive effect of results agreements on
service delivery outcomes – particularly in Education - it is important to note that
their adoption has not been implemented in isolation. Fiscal reforms and efforts to
strengthen planning and budgeting functions were important preconditions for their
adoption. In the education and health sector, the introduction of common metrics and
monitoring systems capturing the relative performance of every school/hospital,
municipality, and state has facilitated the measurement of results and distribution of
rewards. These common metrics have not only been effective in providing a basis for
comparison, but also have been important in motivating reform. Minas has also taken other
complementary steps, such as creating special careers for planning and management
professionals with a differentiated pay scale. In some cases, these specialists have been
deployed in front line units where performance is being measured to provide technical
assistance and support managers. In general, the survey of Minas’ staff is indicative of a
positive perception of the introduction of the results-based management model. Results
also indicate that the second-stage results agreements brought more improvements in the
way staff understand their role and objectives at work than the first-stage RAs. A
qualitative analysis of the open question answers shed light on the main critiques raised by
staff: wages remained low despite the productivity bonus, RAs added additional
bureaucracy to daily work, some targets were set low on purpose and, in some cases, staff
believe they were already working towards targets and as such the RAs were not necessary.
4.      To some extent, these critiques reflect lessons learned raised by Minas’ government
officials themselves. They acknowledge that the management reform became too big to be
manageable: internal political pressures to expand the RAs to all secretariats brought
additional challenges to the process, such as having to create and negotiate targets for
results areas that are not as measurable (e.g. culture) as others (e.g. education). Some
officials believe that, in order to be effective, the reforms should focus in a selected group

                                             52
of sectors considered of high-priority. This what the path followed by Pernambuco, for
example, which focuses on the health, education, and citizen security sectors.


I) The Performance Agreements in Minas Gerais - the case of Education 28

Background

5.      Over the last eleven years, the Government of Minas Gerais has introduced a
wide range of reforms in the way the State is managed. While the details have evolved
over time (and continue to evolve) one core element of the reform has been the introduction
of results agreements (acordos de resultados); signed agreements between the Governor
and the heads of each state secretariat setting out specific results to be achieved in the year
ahead, as well as specific programs and management reforms to be implemented. Since
2008, these have expanded to include similar agreements between each secretariat and its
subordinate departments and implementing organizations (schools, hospitals, etc.).
6.      The reform process began in response to a desperate fiscal situation. At the
beginning of the last decade, Minas found itself in a difficult fiscal situation. In 2002, the
state was running an overall deficit equal to three percent of revenues. Long-term debt
totaled R$35.3 billion29 or twice gross revenues and funds for capital investment had
disappeared. Although 2002 was an election year, expenditures on investment totaled only
R$755 million, or four percent of total expenditure.
7.     A new governor, Aécio Neves, was elected in 2002. Shortly after taking office, he
set about putting the State’s fiscal situation in order, cutting non-salary recurrent costs,
abolishing three thousand appointive positions, and centralizing the management of the
wage bill in order to improve control over payments and reduce fraud. To increase
revenues, he stepped up enforcement of the state’s principal revenue source: the value
added tax (ICMS).
8.       Since then, the fiscal results have been impressive. Neves was reelected by an
overwhelming majority of 80 percent in 2006. Although he resigned to run for the Federal
Senate in 2010, he was replaced by his vice governor, who was then elected in his own
right shortly thereafter. As shown in Figure 1, the state’s tax revenues have nearly doubled
in real terms since 2002. While this in part reflects a growing economy-- the state’s GDP
grew by 90 percent over the same period—it also reflects an increasingly effective system
of tax administration. Tax revenues were equal to 8.7 percent of GDP in 2002. That ratio
increased to 9.3 percent of GDP in 2005 and has remained roughly at that level ever since.
In absolute real terms, tax revenues dipped after the onset of the global economic crisis in
2009 but then made a swift recovery.

Management Reforms

9.       The newly-elected administration in 2002 recognized that fiscal adjustment
alone would not solve the problems and launched a major program of management
reforms, called ‘management shock’ (choque de gestão). The first phase consisted of:
(i) defining a set of priority projects and programs (the list of the original priority projects
is shown at the end of this annex), (ii) setting targets for their implementation, and (iii)
monitoring them closely. Inter alia, the Governor met every month with the heads of the
responsible secretariats to review progress and discuss problems with each activity. The
list of the original priority projects is shown at the end of this annex. It demonstrates a wide
range of activities across a variety of sectors. Three were reportedly ‘top priority’:
construction of the new government administrative center, renovation of the central historic
square in Belo Horizonte (Praça da Liberdade), and a program aimed at paving access
roads to remote municipalities. Spending on all 31 priority projects constituted seven
percent of total state expenditures in 2007. 30 This was targeted to increase to 9.5 percent
of the total by 2010.
10.      Another element of the reform was the introduction of results agreements
(acordos de resultado). These set out targets to be achieved by certain state organizations
and provided for salary bonuses if the targets were achieved. According to interviews with
current and former government officials, the reform started small, with only the Secretariat
of Finance and the Forestry Institute signing agreements in 2004; both organizations raising
their own revenues. Salary bonuses were granted on the basis of the revenue increases
achieved by each organization. In 2005/2006, the State extended the reform to the Secretariat
of Planning (SEPLAG) and State Attorney’s Office (AGE) with rewards based on reductions
in expenditures. The reform was then rolled out to all state secretariats in 2008. This
expansion was prompted by the desire of other state secretariats to give performance bonuses
to their own employees. As discussed below, performance targeting turned out to be more
suited to some secretariats (e.g., education) than others (e.g. culture).
11.     First Level Agreements. The 2008 reforms also brought a major expansion in the
content and coverage of the results agreements (Acordos). The Acordos now had two
levels. The first level was between the governor and the managers of the organizations
within each of 26 sector secretariats. (Although these agreements are often referred to as
taking place between the governor and each secretariat, the agreements in fact consolidate
all the organizations within a given sector (‘system’, in Minas parlance). Thus the
agreement with the health system was signed by the Secretary of Health, but also the
director of FHEMIG (Fundação Hospitalar do Estado de Minas Gerais) (which manages
the state hospitals and has the same organizational rank as a secretariat), the Director of the
Hematology Institute, and so forth. The second level was an agreement between the
manager of each secretariat, institute, foundation, etc. and its subordinate departments.
Thus FHEMIG has second level agreements with each of its hospitals; the Secretariat of
Education has agreements with each state school, etc.

12.     This section focuses on the Agreement with the education sector. This is partly
because education is a key function of the state, and a sector that lends itself to performance
measurement: a desired outcome (performance levels on standardized tests) can be
measured and a relatively direct line of causation can be drawn from the actions of the State
to that outcome.
13.      Outcome Indicators (Indicadores Finalísticos). The 2008 Acordo with the
education system had three parts. The first consisted of a table of outcome indicators and
targets (indicadores finalísticos e metas). The 2008 Acordo specified 14 of them:
 •   the proportion of third graders meeting recommended levels of literacy;
 •   the average proficiency score for literacy in the third grade of ensino fundamental (1st
     to 9th grade, equivalent to 6 to 14 year old) (EF);
 •   the average proficiency scores for Portuguese and mathematics in the fifth and ninth
     grades of ensino fundamental and in the third grade of ensino médio (15 to 17 years
     old) (EM);
 •   the level of age/grade distortion in ensino fundamental and ensino médio; and
 •   the graduation rates for ensino fundamental and ensino médio. The Acordo also
     includes separate targets for age/grade distortions in the northern part of Minas.

 Note: Proficiency is measured on the basis of standardized tests designed by the national institute for
 educational research (Instituto Nacional de Estudos e Pesquisas Educacionais - INEP) and reported in
 the system of educational statistics (Sistema de Avaliacao de Educacao Basica - SAEB). Scales range by
 subject and grade. For the ninth grade of ensino fundamental, for example, the scale for Portuguese
 ranges from zero to 350. The scale for math ranges from zero to 300. Age-grade distortion is defined as
 the percentage of students who are more than one year behind the grade appropriate for their age.

14.     As shown in Table 1, the Acordo called for modest but steady progress in most
of the indicators. The Agreement was methodical in setting out exactly how progress
against each target was to be measured, including the sources of data that were to be used.
For instance, the proficiency of third-graders in literacy was to be based on the state’s annual
PROALFA literacy test. Average scores in Portuguese and mathematics were to be based on
the annual state PROEB test. Graduation rates were to be taken from the annual school census
(censo escolar). At the outset, the achievement of each target was measured in binary terms.
No credit was given for coming close. Either the target was met or it was not.
15.      To consolidate the indicators into a single rating for this component of the
Acordo, each of the indicadores finalísticos was given a weight. The indicator ‘percent
of third graders reaching the recommended level of literacy was given the largest weight
with 18 percent. The reading proficiency score for third graders in ensino fundamental had
a weight of ten percent, while all the other targets had weights of six percent.
16.    Priority Projects (Projetos Estruturadores). The second part of the 2008 Acordo
with the education system required progress on the following eight priority projects and
programs.
  •   Acelerar Para Vencer, a program aimed, in this case, at reducing repetition rates in
      northern Minas and other poorer parts of the state;
  •   SIMAVE, an electronic reference library for teachers;
  •   expansion of full-day education to additional schools (as opposed to the current
      prevailing practice of short days with double shifts);
  •   introduction of ‘new standards of management for basic education’ which in turn
      included a program entitled ‘improvements in physical infrastructure, furnishings,
      and educational facilities in basic education’;
  •   Projeto Escola Viva/Comunidade Ativa, a program which encourages schools in
      underprivileged neighborhoods to offer courses to the community on weekends
      (According to its website, the state school Celso Machado, for example, offers
      courses in computers, taekwondo, dance, and residential electrical repair every
      Saturday);
  •   Promedio, a program intended to make ensino médio (grades 10-12) more attractive
      to recent and prospective dropouts. It includes the expansion of adult education
      programs, free evening meals for students attending night school, and courses
      providing basic work qualifications;
  •   Programa de Educação Profissionalizante de Minas Gerais (PEP/MG), which
      provides free slots in private technical schools for students in the second and third
      years of ensino médio, as well as recent graduates; and teacher training.



                                                   56
17.     In the 2008 Acordo, the target for progress on these eight priority projects was
broadly defined with 100 percent of the planned activities to be completed. The
Agreement nevertheless set out a fairly detailed description of how such progress was to
be evaluated. Each priority project was to be detailed according to the project management
methodology adopted by SEPLAG. These plans were to include a set of actions and
products to be achieved in the current year. The Central Superintendency for the Strategic
Management of Resources and Actions of the State (Superintendência Central de Gestão.
Estratégica de Recursos e Ações do Estado – SCGERAES) was required to intensively
monitor the rate of execution of these projects against the planned actions and targets.
18.     The system for scoring each project and consolidating them into a single score
for this component was complex. Essentially, each project was evaluated on the basis of
three criteria: the proportion of the target that was achieved, the timeliness of its achievement,
and the proportion of the original budget allocation actually spent. If the target for the project
was fully achieved on time and on budget, it received its full weight. If the target was only
partly achieved, it received a reduced weight. And if it were delayed or subject to cost
overruns its weight would be further reduced. Thus, for example, a project that achieved only
80 percent of its target with a delay of 30 days (but remained within its budget) would receive
only 88 percent of the weight to which it would otherwise be entitled. To consolidate the
rating for all eight projects, each project was assigned a weight – or more precisely two
weights; one based on the relative cost of the project (its original budget allocation for the
current year, divided by the budget allocations for all structural projects in the current year)
and the other, an equal weight (in this case, one-eighth of the total). The total score for the
component was calculated as the average of the two weighted scores.
19.      The third section of the Agreement concerned management reforms. There
were nine of them in the 2008 Acordo with the education system. They consisted of: (i) the
identification of ‘critical macro-processes’ and (ii) the redesign of at least three of them;
(iii) the development and testing of the new version of the state school management data
base (Sistema Integrado de Gestão – SIGESP) and (iv) its implantation in 695 schools; (v)
the development of a system for monitoring school construction; (vi) implementation of
the pedagogic program Programa de Intervenção Pedagógica (PIP) in 2600 schools; (vii)
increased use of SIMAVE (the target was 360,000 visits) and finally (viii,ix) two measures
aimed at processing of retirement applications and staff dismissals.
20.       These were also weighted to produce a consolidated score. The development of
the system for monitoring school construction was given the heaviest weight (30 percent).
The implementation of the SIGESP system in 695 schools was given a weight of 20 percent.
In principle, no credit was to be given for partial achievement of a target, although the Acordo
authorized the Evaluation Commission (see below) to award partial credit on an exceptional
basis. 31 Penalties were also imposed for delay. A project that was delayed by more than 60
days, for example, would receive only half the weight to which it was otherwise entitled. No
penalty was imposed for cost overruns. In order to yield a single consolidated score for the
education system as a whole, the score of each three components were then combined and


31
  The Acordo also explicitly granted credit for partial achievement of the seventh target. If the number of
visits to the virtual reference center for teachers was between 252,000 and 279,000 (rather than the targeted
360,000) for example, 60 percent of the credit for achievement of the task would be awarded.

                                                    57
weighted. The score on indicadores finalísticos was given a weight of 70 percent; the priority
projects, 20 percent, and the management reforms, ten percent.
21.     The content of first-level Acordos has changed somewhat over the subsequent
six years. There were five indicadores finalísticos in the 2013 Agreements with the
education system, down from the former 14 32, while the number of structural projects had
increased, from eight to eleven (of these, four were also in the 2008 Acordo). The number
of management reforms had decreased to eight. However, a new component has been added
aimed at encouraging improvements in expenditure management. The 2013 Acordo
includes eight such measures, including: the percent of items acquired through the state’s
electronic procurement system, the proportion of the state’s procurement plan actually
executed, the percentage of operational expenditures as a percent of total expenditures, and
the index of waste of supplies in stock.
22.      Second Level Acordos. The 2008 reform required that the targets specified in each
first level Acordo be broken down into individual results and targets for each working
group (equipe de trabalho) within the organization (secretariat, foundation, etc.). These
second level Acordos were to be signed by the head (dirigente maximo) of the organization
and the head of each working group. In the case of the education system, there were
separate agreements for each school, as well as agreements with each of the departments
in the central administration of the Secretariat of Education.
23.     The Acordos with individual schools contained only quantitative indicators.
According to the former secretary of Education of Minas, Joao Filocre 33, the 2008
Agreement tracked student performance (average proficiency levels and percentages of
students meeting recommended proficiency levels at various grades), drop-out and
graduation rates, age-grade distortions, and the proportion of students attending full day
programs (tempo integral). The 2013 second-level Acordos with individual schools tracked
16 indicators. These included ten of the 14 indicators tracked in the 2008 first-level Acordo
(see Table 1) dropping only the graduation rates for ensino fundamental and ensino medio
and the separate indicators of age/grade distortions in Northern Minas, while adding six
new ones. In addition to tracking average proficiency scores in Portuguese and math at the
fifth and ninth grade levels of ensino fundamental and the third grade of ensino médio, the
Acordo tracked the percentage of students performing at the recommended level in each
subject at each of the three grade levels.
24.     The initial targets for individual schools are based on a somewhat
sophisticated trend analysis (the Winters method). This established the starting point
for negotiations between the SEE and the individual school directors. To avoid the
incentive to set easy targets for each school in order to maximize its chance of success the
performance score for the Secretariat as a whole was largely determined by the aggregate
performance of the individual schools. Thus if a challenging target was set on the
Secretariat-level was automatically passed down to the level of individual schools.



32
   They are: the proportion of students in 3rd grade of EF meeting recommended literacy levels and the
proportion of students in ninth grade of EF and third grade of EM meeting recommended proficiency levels
in Portuguese and math.

25.      The 2013 second level Agreement with the SEE also included separate
agreements for various administrative units within the central administration. The
Acordo with the public relations department, for example, tracks four indicators: (i) the
number of articles published in the state government news magazine (Agência Minas) or
the Diário Oficial, (295, down from 250 in 2012); (ii) the number of press reports submitted
on time (eight, up from seven); (iii) the percent of staff with personal staff development
plans (planos de gestão do desempenho individual—PGDIs) prepared on time (92 percent,
down from 100 percent in 2012) and (iv) the ‘timeliness and quality of data provided to the
state strategic management monitoring system. In addition to quantitative indicators, the
Acordo requires the public relations department to produce three ‘products’: 15 good
practice videos; 16 televised round table discussions, and five new preparation courses for
the national high school (ensino médio) exam.
26.     Rewards. As noted earlier, the staff of organizations meeting their targets is
eligible for bonuses. At the end of a calendar year, (or more precisely, in the January
following the close of the fiscal year) each organization prepares a performance report
(relatório de execução) comparing actual results against targets. This is submitted to the
respective Comissão de Avaliação for each agreement. In the case of a first level agreement
between the Governor and the education system, the evaluation commission is comprised
of representatives of the Governor, the Secretariats of Finance, Planning, and Education,
and a representative of the staff of the SEE. In the case of a second level Acordo between
the SEE and an individual school, it is comprised of: (i) a representative of the Governor,
nominated by SEPLAG, (ii) a representative of the school, nominated by the school
director; (iii) a representative of the school employees, nominated by their union and the
employees themselves, and (iv) a representative of SEPLAG.
27.     The evaluation commissions review progress against targets and conclude with
a consolidated score for each school and a score for the secretariat itself. The score is
weighted. Surprisingly, only half of the bonus is awarded on the basis of the school’s
performance; the other half is based on the performance of the secretariat as a whole. 34 No
part of the bonus is based on the performance of individual staff—although staff are, in
theory, subject to individual performance evaluations (see below). Because the bonus is
calculated as percent of each individual’s salary, it is larger (in terms of Reais) for people in
higher paying positions. Thus a poorly performing staff in a highly-paid position would
receive a larger bonus than a high-performing staff in a lower paid position. And even if the
whole school failed to achieve its targets, staff would still receive a bonus—provided the
Secretariat as a whole achieved its targets for the State as a whole. 35
28.    Results. At first glance, the Acordos would appear to have had a remarkable effect
on student performance—particularly in the earlier grades. As shown in Figure 4, the
percentage of third grade students meeting the recommended level of literacy nearly

34
   In the earlier Acordos, 65 percent of the bonus was based on the performance of the Secretariat. Ten percent
was based on the performance of the regional office of the education secretariat and only 25 percent on the
basis of the performance of the individual school.
35
   Note that the bonus is a one time-payment, rather than a permanent increase in salary. According to mission
interviews, the state has not yet paid the bonus for 2012 and owes no payment for 2013 because targets were
not met. It is reported that the state has promised to pay 2012 bonus later in 2014.

doubled between 2006 and 2013, reaching 93 percent by the end of the period. 36 (All data
are for the rede estadual only.) There have also been impressive gains in the proportion of
students meeting recommended levels of proficiency in Portuguese and mathematics in the
lower grades. The proportion of children in the fifth grade meeting recommended
proficiency levels in Portuguese and math doubled over the eight year period. Progress,
however, tapers off somewhat at the higher grades. The proportion of ninth graders meeting
proficiency levels increased by a (still impressive) 55 percent over the period. But gains in
the third year of ensino médio were not as good. Proficiency levels in Portuguese and
mathematics both increased by about 33 percent. And at the end of the period, only one-
third of students in the final year of ensino médio were reading at the recommended level
and less than four percent of students were meeting recommended levels in mathematics. 37

29.     However, correlation does not prove causation. To derive lessons from the
Minas experience, one has to determine the chain of causality: the connection between the
actions taken by the State and the actual changes in literacy rates and student performance in
Portuguese and mathematics at the lower grades. Furthermore, identifying the role and
impact of the Agreements and their design, i.e. effectiveness of targets, choice of the priority
projects, and the monetary rewards. And most importantly, if and how any of these actions
affected the behavior of teachers in the classroom and the learning experience of students.
30.    According to interviews, the targets did help by defining explicit quantitative
goals gave a clear sense of the Governor’s priorities, from the Secretary of Education to
individual school directors and teachers. However, the impact of the other components of
the Acordos appeared to have varied. Most of the sectoral staff interviewed seemed to
regard the structural projects and expenditure management monitoring as unwarranted
micromanagement. The salary bonuses were also viewed as not particularly important


36
   Due to changes in state policy, this improvement may be less impressive than it appears. In 2006 (Minas
discontinued its policy of holding under-performing children back during the first three years of ensino
fundamental. Children are now automatically promoted to the next grade, regardless of performance. This
may, in part, explain the improvements in literacy rates among third graders.
37
   It also bears noting that most of the gains occurred in the early years of the reform: 2006-2010. After 2010,
there was virtually no gain (9th grade Portuguese being the one exception). In the last year of ensino médio,
proficiency levels actually declined in both Portuguese and math.

                                                                           60
motivating factors, although this may be because they were only remotely related to
individual teacher performance (or even individual school performance).
31.     Even if the targets were effective in setting out the government’s priorities,
how did this affect the behavior of teachers in the classroom? In many respects, school
directors are hamstrung in their ability to respond to performance targets as, for example,
they are not involved in staff recruitment, rotation or dismissal. However, reforms introduced
around the same time as the Agreements, gave school directors some ability to reward
individual performance. Prior to 2003, all teachers received automatic salary increases after
five years of service, regardless of performance. As of 2003, the automatic increases were
abolished for teachers hired after that date. 38 Instead, salaries now had two components: a
fixed component and a variable component based on performance. Performance was
evaluated on the basis of four criteria: professional development (15 points), interpersonal
relations (15 points), professional and institutional commitment (20 points), and technical
and professional ability (50 points). With respect to the last of these, performance was
evaluated on the basis of a teacher’s effectiveness in planning the work, making use of
student evaluations, teaching methods, management efficiency, and commitment to teaching
all students, including those with learning difficulties.
32.     The school director, however, did not have the authority to evaluate teacher
performance on his/her own. Instead, the evaluations were conducted by a commission
(Comissão de Avaliação) consisting of five members: the director of the school, two
teachers selected by their peers, and two members elected by the community. The
evaluations, moreover, were not particularly selective. In 2009, 42 percent of evaluated
staff received a rating of over 90 points and 51 percent received a rating between 80 and
90 points. As a result, individual performance bonuses may have little effect on teacher
behavior. 39
33.     In theory, performance evaluations also affect a teacher’s prospects for
promotion. To advance within grade, a teacher must have five positive evaluations
(defined as at least 70 points) along with the required academic credentials. Negative
evaluations can result in dismissals. The process for dismissal can be initiated after two
negative evaluations in three consecutive years, three negative evaluations in five, or four
negative evaluations in ten. Since the vast majority of teachers receive positive evaluations,
however, this presumably has little effect on teacher behavior. (The process of firing new
teachers who are still on probation is much simpler and has resulted in 600 dismissals (out
of a teacher corps of 160,000) according to Filocre. Although the number is small, Filocre
reports that the demonstration effect is powerful.)
                      Box 1. Human Resource Management Reforms
In addition to introducing bonuses for individual performance and bonuses for performance
at the work unit and secretariat level (through the Acordos), the Minas government
undertook several other reforms in human resource management in the period 2003-2014.
Inter alia, it consolidated the number of career streams in the state civil service structure,
reducing the number from 893 to 168. This considerably increased the State’s ability to

38
 Staff hired before 2003 have the option of switching to this system but most did not.
39
  In principle, this problem could be addressed by imposing a normal distribution on performance ratings.
According to mission interviews, such an approach would not be accepted in Minas at the present.

                                                   61
allocate staff efficiently. By broadening the definition of each career stream, staff can now
shift from one position to another without having to restart their careers from the beginning.
Human resources reforms included the introduction of a modern system for human
resource management (SISAP – Sistema de Administração de Pessoal) and a system for
performance evaluation (SISAD – Sistema de Avaliação de Desempenho), in 2005 and
2007 respectively. As such, information available before the introduction of the systems is
limited and doesn’t allow for a complete analysis over time.

34.     But perhaps the most important measure that accompanied the Acordos was a
program aimed at ensuring that all children were reading and writing by age eight.
The Programa de Intervencão Pedagógica (PIP) 40 was introduced in 2007, and provides
intensive on-site assistance in literacy training. Organizationally, PIP consists of a central
team of 46 literacy training specialists—one for each region. The central team has three
functions: (i) disseminating key concepts of the program in a form that is readily
understandable; (ii) monitoring the situation in each school in order to identify needs and
problems and (iii) training regional teams. Each specialist spends two weeks per month
visiting the regional office of the education secretariat (SRE) and its schools. The regional
teams spend four days a week visiting schools, focusing on the ones with the most problems
and lowest performance. At its peak, the regional teams had 1,800 staff, making 87,000
PIP visits per year.
35.      The PIP arguably played an important role for the remarkable increase in
literacy rates from 2006 to 2013. The targets in the Agreements prompted school directors
and decision-makers in the Secretariat of Education to focus on improving literacy rates and
focused attention on student performance, while holding them accountable for achieving the
targets. However, the managers tasked with achieving the goals needed the authority and the
technical support to do so, such as the PIP. However, giving school directors more control
over staff recruitment, assignment and promotion might have given additional room to
further improve student performance. Similarly, performance bonuses granted under the
Acordos could have given greater weight to the performance of individual schools and less
weight to aggregate performance at the state-wide level.
36.     Design issues on relevance of targets. While schools are just one of the targets of
Minas’ system of performance monitoring, they may be uniquely well suited to it. In some
sectors, it is more difficult to translate policy goals into quantifiable targets for specific
government organizations, which might result in targets, which are unrelated to policy
goals or targets that require organizations to achieve policy goals that they have little
control over.
37.     One example of the former is the set of targets for the public relations
Department of the Secretariat of Education. In this case, the targets required the
Department to produce a number of videos without referring to the video’s content or
objectives. Another example is one of the targets for the Gabinete of the Secretariat of
Economic Development. It required the Gabinete to increase the ratio of Minas’ economic

  According to Filocre, PIP has its own set of results agreements (Termos de Termos de Pactuação de Metas)
signed by the school director, the regional office of the SEE and the parent-student-teacher board (Colegiado
da Escola). As described by Filocre, the Termos de Pactuacão set out proficiency goals for 2008, 2009, and
2010. See Joao Filocre. Undated blog. Mais tempo para ensinar, mais tempo para aprender.

growth rate to the economic growth rate of Brazil as a whole, a target which is beyond the
Gabinete’s control.
38.     Similar causality issues are apparent in the health sector. The first-level Acordo
for the Secretariat of Health requires the Secretariat to reduce the rate of infant mortality
from 13.1 per thousand births in 2010 to 12.6 in 2013. But many of the factors that account
for infant mortality (including contaminated drinking water) also lie beyond the purview
of the Secretariat.
39.     However, many targets reflected actions that the Secretariat has some
influence over. An example is the target of a percentage of births, where the mothers have
had at least seven pre-natal checkups. By the same token, the indicadores finalisticos for
individual hospitals (in the second level agreement with FHMIG) include some of the
standard measures of hospital efficiency, including the average length of stay and the
hospital occupancy rate
40.     The Agreements also resulted in a high number of indictors to be tracked
across sectors. There are presumably 66,300 targets for state schools alone (17 indicators
for each one of the 3,900 state schools). There are 165 indicators for the state hospitals (15
indicators for each of the eleven state hospitals) as well indicators for the casas de saúde
(14 indicators for each of the four of them).
41.     Timing of implementation. The preparation for an annual Acordo begins after the
budget for that year has been submitted to the State Assembly, which generally happens
by September 30. The final agreement on an Acordo is typically not reached until March
of the year to come. As a result, the process starts before the results of the previous year
are available, which could serve as a basis to set targets. By the same token, the process
ends after the budget year is well underway and managers have time to influence the results.
One alternative would be to start the Acordo preparation process much earlier in the budget
cycle and rely on indicators from the previous calendar year or to include the preparation
of Acordos in the budget preparation cycle.
42.     Overall, judged solely on the basis of the focus of this review on the
Agreements in the education sector, this operation appears to have been worthwhile.
In retrospect, however, the Bank could have urged SEPLAG to be more conservative in
defining the scope of the Acordos—confining them to actions that are both meaningful and
under the control of the responsible organization. It could also have encouraged the state
to take complementary actions (beyond those included in other DLIs). These might have
included giving greater management authority to school directors – to the extent that the
federal law allows - and adjusting the performance bonuses to give greater weight to
individual school performance.
43.     In the next section we turn to the data to analyze Minas’ results in selected
sectors and those of the other Brazilian States. If Minas’ management reforms over the
decade were transformational, one would expect that Minas would have over performed
other States in crucial sectors such as education, health and citizen security.

II) Results in Minas Gerais vis-à-vis other Brazilian States 41

44.     This section compares the experiences of Minas Gerais, states implementing results
agreements (e.g. Pernambuco, Rio de Janeiro) and states that did not implement any form
of results-based management 42. We use nationally comparable outcome indicators such as
child mortality, homicide rates, and proficiency in Mathematics and Portuguese as
measured by IDEB scores. The analysis explores the relationship between performance
management and changes in sectoral outcomes using a variety of methods. The results of
the empirical analysis support the expectation that the implementation of team-level results
agreements is associated with significant and positive changes in outcomes in the security
and education sectors, at least in the short and medium term (not in health).
45.      Minas Gerais registered positive results in the education sector, surpassing the
average of the southeastern region. The state also has a lower homicide rate than other
states with the same GDP per capita. Similarly, Pernambuco has reversed a rising homicide
rate and recorded considerable gains in the education sector through the implementation of
performance agreements. In the case of Rio de Janeiro, the introduction of performance
agreements and a teacher bonus corresponded with the first positive change recorded in
educational achievements since 2005. Although Ceará is not using performance-related
pay, its monitoring system and results-based management model has translated into sizable
and consistent gains in the education and health sectors.


Health sector

46.     In the case of Minas Gerais, there is no discontinuity in the trend that could
be linked to the introduction of performance agreements in the health sector in 2004
or their refinement in 2008 (Figure 4). While the rate decreased by 1.2 points between
2007 and 2010, child mortality levels remain above the regional average and the distance
between the two has been fairly constant. Minas Gerais’ trend is similar to that of the
southeast region and that of Rio de Janeiro, a State which does not use result agreements
in the health sector.

   It is important to mention the limitations of this analysis: the reforms under consideration have not been
designed ex ante as randomized controlled treatments, with clear treatment and control groups. To mitigate
problems of causal inference created by the lack of a control group, a regression discontinuity and difference-
in-difference designs are used. Moreover, responsibilities for the provision of health, education, and security
services are shared across levels of governments and attributing results to state interventions can in some
cases be difficult. One exception is secondary education that is the sole responsibility of state governments.

47.      After three consecutive years of decline, the national homicide rate per 100,000
inhabitants started increasing again in 2007. In the following three years, the rate rose
by 9 percent. During that period of time, only 8 states recorded reductions (Figure 5). The
largest drop was observed in Pernambuco with a reduction of 25 percent of its homicide
rate, followed by Rio de Janeiro, Mato Grosso do Sul, and Minas Gerais with 15, 12, and
11 percent respectively. Yet it is important to bear in mind that Rio de Janeiro and
Pernambuco had some of the highest homicide rates in the country and their rate remain
higher than the value predicted by GDP (Figure 6).

48.    Minas Gerais’ homicide rate has remained below the regional average in the
southeast. Currently, the State has the second lowest rate in the Southeastern region after
São Paulo and the fourth lowest in the country. The State achieved considerable reductions
between 2004 and 2010, though it was surpassed by São Paulo that currently has the lowest
rate in the region. It is, nonetheless, important to highlight that the introduction of
performance-related pay in 2004 coincided with the change in trend in homicides.
49.     While displaying a declining trend since 2004, reductions were on average
higher after 2007 (2.7 percent for 2004-2006 versus 4 percent for 2007-2010). Between
1999 and 2004, the homicide rate had more than doubled in the State of Minas Gerais,
reaching the highest point in the states contemporary history. During that period, the State
trend was going in the opposite direction than that of the other three states that had started
to see declining levels of homicide since 2002.
Education Sector

50.     The national average IDEB score for public secondary schools have improved
at an average of 4 percent every two years since the index was adopted in 2005.
However, the improvement observed in the period 2005 to 2011 was more modest than
made in primary education. The change in the national average grade was of 13 percent,
compared with 31 percent in the initial years of primary education and 17 percent in the
final years of primary education. Between 2007 and 2011, the states of Goiás, Rio de
Janeiro, São Paulo, Santa Catarina, Roraima, and Tocantins registered much larger changes
than those for states that had the same score in 2007 (Figure 4). Many observed no change
or declining scores. Still, among others, Ceará and Minas Gerais have scores above the
predicted value for their GDP, while Rio de Janeiro falls much below what the score for its
income level.

51.    In the southeast, Minas Gerais has shown steady improvement in the IDEB
grade for secondary education and remains above the regional average. The
introduction of performance agreements does not appear, on the aggregate level, to have
generated any clear discontinuity. And, the distance between the score for the state and the
average for the region seems to be closing. On the other hand, the first generation of these
agreements was already in place when the IDEB began to be measured in 2005.

52.     When comparing the changes in Minas Gerais to other states in the southeast
region, it is possible to conclude that only improvements in education outcomes go
beyond the general trend. In child mortality, the change is very similar and the difference
between the state and the region remains fairly constant. The homicide rate for the period
after the introduction of the “Management Shock” policy is lower than the rest of the
region, but on average other states have had larger reductions. Conversely, the State
recorded a statistically significant improvement in the IDEB score, but not the average for
the rest of the region.
53.     Regression analysis suggest that, at least in the short and medium term, the
implementation of results-based management is associated with significant and
positive changes in outcomes in the security and education sectors. On average, states
using team level targets have 6.6 fewer homicides per 100,000 inhabitants than those that
do not, all else equal. Similarly, states that have introduced performance agreements and
a bonus for teachers and school staff have improved their Index of Basic Education
Development (IDEB) score for public secondary schools by 0.26 additional points.


                                                     67
With the implementation of the second generation performance agreements Minas
Gerais has achieved positive results in the education sector that go beyond the gains
of the southeastern region. Pernambuco has reversed a rising homicide rate and recorded
considerable gains in the education sector. In the case of Rio de Janeiro, the introduction
of the performance agreements and teacher bonus in 2010 corresponded with the first
positive change recorded in educational achievements in 6 years. While the analysis points
to a positive effect of results agreements on service delivery outcomes, it is important to
note that the adoption of these models has not been implemented in isolation. They require
clear planning and the disaggregation of goals to a level that can be linked to the action of
teams and individual members. Fiscal reforms and efforts to strengthen planning and
budgeting functions were important preconditions for their adoption. In the education and
health sector, the introduction of common metrics and monitoring systems capturing the
relative performance of every school/hospital, municipality, and state has facilitated the
measurement of results and distribution of rewards. These common metrics have not only
been effective in providing a basis for comparison, but also have been important in
motivating reform.


III) Survey with public servants of Minas Gerais 43

54.     During supervision missions, the Bank team often heard enthusiastic reports
of a “change in culture” or a “behavior change” resulting from the introduction of
performance agreements. According to those views, the government and its staff had
moved in the direction of working for results, instead of working to “fulfill processes”.
This anecdotal evidence of a change in culture inside the institution motivated the
elaboration of a broader perception survey that could reach a larger number of public
servants. The survey was conducted in mid-December 2014 among public servants of
Minas Gerais to capture changes in behavior and motivation that might have resulted from
the introduction and expansion of a results-based public management system since 2003.
A link to the online survey was sent via email to 17,000 public servants based in the
Administrative Center (Cidade Administrativa) out of which 1,926 (11.33 percent)
completed the questionnaire 44. The full list of questions and answers is presented below.
55.    Profile of respondents: approximately 70 percent of those who answered the
survey started working for the Government after 2003. As such, only 30 percent of
respondents witnessed the period pre and post management shock. Among those 70
percent, 26 percent started working between 2003 and 2008 and thus witnessed both the
introduction of 1st and 2nd –level performance agreements, in 2003 and 2008 respectively.
The remaining 44 percent started working between 2009 and 2014, when 2nd level
agreements were already in place. 68 percent of all respondents are in the 18-45 year old
bracket, and the majority (57 percent) of respondents are women. 41 percent of respondents

   The total number of active State employees is 400,203, which includes, among others, teachers, police
men and firemen.

occupy a technical/analyst position, and 11 percent are senior management staff (director
level and above, up to Secretary). The majority of respondents – 44 percent – work in line
secretariats such as Health and Education, and 21 percent are in central secretariats such as
Planning, Finance and the Governor’s cabinet.
56.     The vast majority of respondents stated that they know their role and goals at
work but a smaller percentage attributes this to performance agreements. 93 percent
of the respondents that work for the Minas Government for 5 years or more indicate that
they have a clear understanding of their role and goals at work (question 6). Moreover, 75
percent also assert that they understand their role and goals better than they did five years
ago (question 7). However, only 44 percent of respondents agrees or strongly agrees with
the assertion that the introduction of results agreements helped them understand what was
expected of them in their job (question 10); 29 percent neither agree nor disagree with the
statement, which seems to indicate that, although the vast majority of respondents have a
clear understanding of their role and goals, not everyone attributes this clarity to the
introduction of results agreements.
57.     50 percent of respondents think that, in general, the introduction of results
agreements has improved the functioning of the public service in Minas; 27 percent
neither agrees or disagrees (question 11). Similarly, 55 percent believes that the results
agreements established are relevant to the overall mission of the respective institutions, and
25 percent neither agree nor disagree (question 12).
58.     65 percent of respondents that work for the Government of Minas Gerais for
one or more years have received a performance bonus of any sort in the past five
years, and 5 percent said they do not know what a performance bonus is. The
remaining did not receive a bonus. 54 percent of respondents are dissatisfied with the
professional growth opportunities available in their jobs, in contrast to only 27 percent who
are satisfied (19 percent are neutral). Interestingly, 39 percent think that the opportunities
for professional growth have improved in the last five years, while 42 percent disagree.
59.     Open Question: The final question of the survey (question 13) “In what way did
the introduction of the results agreements affect your work?” was answered by 986
respondents. A qualitative analysis of the individual answers revealed mixed answers
ranging from strong positive to strong negative perceptions of the reform. In general, many
statements praised the fact that the reform introduced clear goals and objectives. On the
negative side, many statements point out that the reform’s effectiveness was hindered by
insufficient economic incentives (i.e., low bonus payments, low salaries) and political
influence. Several respondents indicated that they have always tried to do their work well,
regardless of having results agreements or not. A few respondents mentioned that they had
already worked with targets before and did not need the agreements to incentivize their
work. Other recurring criticisms are that the results agreements only added bureaucracy to
existing work and that the bonus payments had been often delayed.
60.     Regression analysis: To further disentangle the survey results, we divided the
respondents in three groups: 1 = respondents joining before 2003; 2 = respondents joining
between 2003 and 2008; 3 = respondents joining between 2009 and 2013. We control for
gender and age range, and have occupation and secretariat fixed effects. Regressions are
probit specification with dependent variable: respondent agree/strongly agrees with the

                                             69
statement. The interpretation is based on comparing the first intervention group (before
2003) with the second intervention group (2003-2008) and with the no intervention group
(2009-2013). The data should be interpreted with caution however, as tenure is likely to
blurr the results, since these are not true comparison groups. They do provide some
indication, however, of whether the interventions had any effect.
61.    Q6: Comprehension of goals and objectives: Workers exposed to both interventions
(in 2003 and 2008) are more likely to agree with the statement, indicating that both
interventions had incremental effects on comprehension of goals and objects.
62.     Q7: Comprehension is better than 5 years ago?: Workers exposed to the first
intervention are less likely to agree that comprehension has improved, relative to the
second intervention. In fact, workers exposed to the second intervention are significantly
more likely to report improvement relative to the control (workers not exposed to the
intervention) and relative to the first intervention. Results are supported by the regressions
as well (workers between 2003 and 2008 are significantly higher than either of the other
two groups: p<0.01 and p<0.05). This suggests that the second intervention brought about
more improvements than the first.
63.     Q9: Opportunities improved in the last 5 years: Workers exposed to the first
intervention and second intervention are not different from each other (p=0.27) but are
significantly more likely to agree that opportunities have improved in the last 5 years

a baseline and thus reliance on recall questions that are potentially subject to recall bias can
limit the validity of the findings. In general, however, the survey is indicative of a positive
perception regarding the introduction of a results-based management model. Survey results
also indicate that the second-stage results agreements brought more improvements in the
way staff understand their role and objectives at work than the first-stage RAs.
