        SECOND MINAS GERAIS DEVELOPMENT PARTNERSHIP PROJECT
                                P101324
                     LOAN 7547-BR AND LOAN 7871-BR

                                      Restructuring Paper

1.     The closing date for the Brazil - Second Minas Gerais Development Partnership Project
(P101324), loan numbers 7547-BR and 7871-BR (Additional Financing), will be extended from
March 31st, 2012 until October 31st, 2013. This will be the first extension of the Project after the
approval of the Additional Financing by the Board.
2.     The proposed extension of nineteen months, from March 31st, 2012 till October 31st,
2013, is consistent with the OP13.20 requirement that the additional loan closes within three
years of the closing date of the original loan that is in effect when the additional loan is
approved, which is March 31, 2012 given that a restructuring and extension of the original loan
was approved by the Board simultaneously with the approval of the Additional Financing. As
confirmed with LCSDE, since the proposed extension is below twenty four months from the
current Project closing date, as approved by the Board at the time of the approval of the
Additional Financing, this constitutes a level two restructuring.
3.      The project is in the final stages of implementation and has been making satisfactory
progress towards the achievement of its development objectives. Project implementation is also
rated satisfactory. Disbursements to date account to US$1.426 billion; which corresponds to 99.2
percent of total Bank financing (US$1.437 billion).
4.     The proposed extension is necessary for the project to be fully and successfully
completed, with special attention to the technical assistance component. The extension in closing
date was requested by the Borrower due to the following reasons:
       a. Additional time is needed to complete some technical assistance activities of strategic
          importance to the Borrower, related to the new institutional arrangements introduced
          for the management of the Metropolitan Region of Belo Horizonte (MRBH), the state
          capital. The activities seek to support the development of master plans to guide urban
          and economic development in key areas of the metropolitan region. In Brazil,
          metropolitan governance arrangements are becoming increasingly important, and the
          state’s proposal to develop master plans to guide economic and urban development in
          the MRBH is a key effort to generate strategic knowledge and concrete proposals to
          guide decision- and policy-making at the state and municipal level. This initiative
          could have potential demonstration effects for other metropolitan areas in Brazil. The
          procurement process for this activity is underway and the consultancy is expected to
          be hired by July 2012.
5.       The 2010 target for one of the disbursement-linked indicators (DLIs) was not met. As a
result, an amount of US$1,437,500 of Component 1 has not yet been disbursed. As provided for
in the Loan Agreement and Disbursement Letter, the unwithdrawn portion of the Loan resulting
from the non-compliance with a DLI may be carried forward. Considering that the DLI in

                                                 5
question may only be verified on an annual basis, it was agreed with the Borrower that the
undisbursed amount may be withdrawn if the target is achieved for the year 2011. This DLI may
only be verified in April 2012, after the issuance of the State’s 2011 financial statements. If the
indicator is found not to have been met, the Bank may decide to cancel the remaining amount of
US$1,437,500. An additional amount of USD 2,185,000 has not yet been disbursed by the
Borrower under Component 1 due to previous non-compliance with a DLI. The Borrower has
proven to have achieved the agreed target and this amount is now eligible for disbursement. The
Borrower intends to disburse this amount in April 2012.The project objectives continue to be
achievable and the performance of the Borrower and other project implementing agencies is
satisfactory. In addition the Borrower has prepared a specific action plan acceptable to the Bank
to complete the project, and the Borrower is in good standing vis-a-vis audits. Finally, neither the
loan in particular, nor Brazil in general, in under suspension of disbursement.
