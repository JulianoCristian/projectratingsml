The closing date for the project will\n            be extended from March 31st, 2012 until October 31st, 2013.\n            This will be the first extension of the project after the\n            approval of the additional financing by the Board. The\n            extension of nineteen months, from March 31st, 2012 till\n            October 31st, 2013, is consistent with the OP13.20\n            requirement that the additional loan closes within three\n            years of the closing date of the original loan that is in\n            effect when the additional loan is approved, which is March\n            31, 2012 given that a restructuring and extension of the\n            original loan was approved by the Board simultaneously with\n            the approval of the additional financing. As confirmed with\n            LCSDE, since the extension is below twenty four months from\n            the current project closing date, as approved by the Board\n            at the time of the approval of the additional financing. The\n            project is in the final stages of implementation and has\n            been making satisfactory progress towards the achievement of\n            its development objectives. The project implementation is\n            also rated satisfactory. Disbursements to date account to\n            US$1.426 billion; which corresponds to 99.2 percent of total\n            Bank financing (US$1.437 billion)."}, "docdt": "2012-03-27T00:00:00Z"}
