                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project implementation continues to be satisfactory. Targets of most Disbursement Linked Indicators have been met. Implementation of the technical assistance component has also
                         progressed although some delays in procurement processes will require an extension of the closing date of the project. A formal request from the State Government was received
                         and was granted to March 2013. A second stage of the extension is being processed currently. The team is awaiting the letter of approval for the second stage of the extension from
                         the Federal Government.
