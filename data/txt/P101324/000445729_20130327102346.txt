        SECOND MINAS GERAIS DEVELOPMENT PARTNERSHIP PROJECT
                             LOAN 7547-BR

                                      Restructuring Paper

1.      The closing date for the Brazil - Second Minas Gerais Development Partnership Project
(P101324), loan number 7547-BR, will be extended until from March 31st 2013 to December
31st, 2013.
2.      The project objectives continue to be achievable and the performance of the Borrower
and other project implementing agencies is satisfactory. Disbursements to date account to
US$1.430 billion; which corresponds to 99.5 percent of total Bank financing (US$1.437 billion).
There remain US$6.26 million undisbursed. The 2010 target for one of the disbursement-linked
indicators (DLIs) was not met. As a result, an amount of US$1,437,500 of Component 1 was not
disbursed, and will be cancelled. All other DLIs have been met and disbursement against them
made. In March 2012, the Borrower submitted a request for extension through October 31, 2013.
However, at that time the Guarantor only approved the extension until March 31, 2013, which
was granted by the Bank On December 17, 2012 the Borrower submitted a request for an
extension until December 31, 2013 to ensure sufficient time to finalize the last ongoing
consulting activities. The extension was approved by the Guarantor through COFIEX’s
Recommendation letter No. 706 of December 12, 2012 and a letter from Brazil’s National
Treasurer (STN) dated February 27, 2013. The main two main outstanding contracts relate to
consulting services for logistic studies for railways in the North of Minas Gerais (US$ 1 million,
signed August 2012) and for a metropolitan master plan for Belo Horizonte (US$2.8 million,
signed December 2012). These two contracts together with final payments from two other
consulting contracts fully account for the US$4.8 million still to be disbursed.
3.       The proposed extension is necessary for the project to be fully and successfully
completed. Additional time is needed to complete technical assistance activities of strategic
importance to the Borrower, related to the new institutional arrangements introduced for the
management of the Metropolitan Region of Belo Horizonte (MRBH), the state capital. The
activities seek to support the development of master plans to guide urban and economic
development in key areas of the metropolitan region. This initiative could have potential
demonstration effects for other metropolitan areas in Brazil. The contract with the consulting
company was signed in early December 2012.
4.     This will be the third extension of the project.
