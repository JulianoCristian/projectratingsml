Financing is to be\n            provided for a portion of the program and includes:  (a)\n            periodic maintenance of paved federal roads and bridges; (b)\n            provision of new, improved or expanded workshop facilities;\n            and procurement of road maintenance equipment.  In addition,\n            the project provides for  implementation of the Secretariat\n            of Communications and Transport's (SCT) equipment\n            overhaul and rehabilitation program;  training in equipment\n            operation, repair and maintenance and in road maintenance\n            planning and operations; and  consulting services for\n            training, studies and technical support to upgrade\n            maintenance planning, design and execution.  Since the needs\n            greatly exceed the funds available, the size of the program\n            is based on the budgetary resources that the Government has\n            confirmed will be allocated and represents the minimum level\n            of expenditures needed to prevent further deterioration of\n            the federal road network."}, "docdt": "1987-09-16T00:00:00Z"}
