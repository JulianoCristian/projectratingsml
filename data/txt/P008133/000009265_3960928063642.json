In\n            addition, the project would promote increased efficiency in\n            agricultural lending and in the provision of technical\n            assistance. The project includes 1) a general line of credit\n            to finance agricultural and agro industrial investments, as\n            well as complementary permanent working capital; and 2)\n            institutional support for farm extension, forestry, and\n            promotion of non traditional exports. Project benefits\n            include: 1) increased volume of agricultural exports, 2)\n            creation of closer links between the private & public\n            sectors in export promotion, 3) development of forestry\n            resources for the subsequent establishment of forest based\n            industry, 4) improved efficiency of farm extension and 5) a\n            more competitive and market oriented system for supplying\n            investment credit to agriculture."}, "docdt": "1989-09-26T00:00:00Z"}
