of the Borrower;".
     2. The term "Action Plan" set forth in paragraph "(aa)" is

19,1994 which describes the activities that remain to be carried out
under the Project in accordance with such timetable, as such plan
and timetable may be amended from time to time with the agreement
of the Bank.".
     3. Paragraph (d) of Section 3.02 is hereby amended by adding the
word "terminating" and a "comma" after the "comma" following the word
"amending".
     4. The table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 is hereby amended to
read as set forth in Annex 1 to this Amendment Letter.

     III. Effectiveness:
     This Amendment Letter shall be executed in two counterparts each
of which shall be an original, and shall not become effective until

(i) Comision has entered into a contractual arrangement as provided
in Section 3.01 (b) of the Loan Agreement; and (ii) Comision has
