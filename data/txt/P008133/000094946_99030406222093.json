However, its cost-effectiveness in achieving\n            project objectives was considered highly satisfactory. The\n            key lessons learned are: 1) Proper economic and sector work\n            should be carried out on a regular basis. 2) It is important\n            to have the closest possible participation of\n            representatives of the different sub-sectors in\n            identification and design. 3) Early discussions with, and\n            full involvement of, key parts of the executive branch of\n            the Government in project identification and preparation are\n            important. 4)The Bank must take a firm stand on key issues,\n            particularly at appraisal and negotiations, and the\n            Government should do the same. 5) A project start-up seminar\n            and the preparation of an Operational Manual would have\n            helped to minimize some of the issues encountered in the\n            early years of the project. 6) The project's design\n            should include a project coordinating unit. 7) The project\n            shows that good project design must be accompanied by a\n            stable macro-economic and sector policy environment, and\n            that policy intervention should be carefully tailored to\n            relatively simple objectives. 8) It is right to open up the\n            retailing of credit to the whole financial sector and to\n            make investment resources available. 9) Timely strengthening\n            of institutions and a good legal basis are important in\n            institutional development. 10) It is important to define\n            closely during appraisal the precise accounting system to\n            record project expenditures."}, "docdt": "1998-10-22T00:00:00Z"}
