conditions in Electricity\n            Corporation of Ghana's (ECG) and Volta River\n            Authority's (VRA) systems. It will consist mainly of\n            rehabilitation works on ECG's distribution network and\n            VRA's principal substations. In addition, the project\n            contains components for improvements in plant support\n            facilities, studies and technical assistance. Under the\n            technical assistance component, studies will be undertaken\n            which will provide the basis for reorganization of the\n            sector and rehabilitation of its institutions (168\n            man-months). The technical assistance program will also\n            include training, operational support, and assistance in the\n            implementation of the rehabilitation plan."}, "docdt": "1985-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
