I. THE ENERGY SECTOR
A.       Energy Resources and Uses
1.01.    Ghana has substantial energy resources.  Wood is plentiful in the
high forest zone which covers 34% of the total lantd area (8.2 million
hectares). Hydropower resources are also abundant, particularly in the
Central and Western regions of the country. The economically useable
potential is estimated at 2,000 MW, about twice the presently installed
capacity. Estimates of proven reserves of oil vary from 1 to 5 million
barrels but the potential is considered to be larger. Recent drillings in the
Tano basin confirm the existence of large quantities of oil and natural gas.
There are no known coal, lignite or peat deposits.
1.02.    Energy demand of 4.2 million toe per year, or 360 kg per capita is
relatively low in comparison with other African countries. Domestic output of
energy consisting primarily of wood and, to a lesser extent, hydropower and
petroleum, Is estimated at 3.6 million tons of oil equivalent (toe) and covers
nearly 86% of Ghana's energy requirements. Wood meets some 73% of primary
energy demand, petroleum 17X, and hydropower 10%. The sectoral breakdown of
final energy demand is estimated to be as follows: residential (urban and
rural), over 67Z; industry and commerce, 15%; transport, 12Z; and agriculture,
less than 6%. Despite the economic decline during most of the 1970's, energy
demand during 1971-79 increased by almost 5% p.a. Between 1980 and 1984,
however, the consumption of petroleum products decreased by about 20% because
the scarcity of foreign exchange limited the import of petroleum products.
During the same period, the severe drought, combined with breakdowns in
electrical distribution systems contributed to a reduction by 33% in
electricity consumption.
B.       Sector Institutions
1.03.   The principal responsibility for the energy sector lies with the
Ministry of Fuel and Power (MFP). Government entities in the petroleum sector
include the Geological Survey Department which monitors petroleum exploration,
the Ghana Italian Petroleum Company Limited which operates the refinery and
the Ghana Oil Company Limited which distributes petroleum products. In the
power sector, the Volta River Authority (VRA) owns and operates the hydro
plants and high voltage transmission facilities, sells and exports bulk
electricity. The Electricity Corporation of Ghana (ECG) purchases power from
VRA for distribution throughout the country, and owns and operates diesel
plants supplying isolated systems.
1.04.   The Government has recently taken several steps to strengthen
management of the energy sector. First, it established the National Energy
Board (NEB) as the advisory body to the MPP. NEB is responsible for gathering
statistical data on energy resources, production, transformation and
consumption, for developing energy policies, conducting energy studies, and
coordinating activities in the renewable energy field. Second, the Government
has streamlined the organization of the petroleum sub-sector by establishing
the Ghana National Petroleum Corporation (GNPC) which has responsibility for
exploration, development, production and disposal of petroleum. GNPC has also



taken on the responsibility for crude and petroleum product procurement, a
function previously performed by the Petroleum Department in the MFP. And
finally, in the power sub-sector, the Government has hired the Electricity
Supply Board of Ireland (ESB) to examine the organization of the sector and
provide technical assistance to ECG and VRA.
C.       The Renewable Energy Sector
1.05.     More than 95% of Ghanaian households depend on wood or charcoal for
cooking fuel. Forest-based products also meet a substantial proportion of
energy needs in activities such as food processing, post-harvest drying and
beverage making. Total wood demand by 1990 is expected to be around 17
million m3 of fuelwood and 7 million m3 of commercial foreetry cut.
Projections of the forest resource balance through 1990 show an annual
allowable cut of about 23 million =3. Although these aggregate figures
indicate that Ghana is not likely to face a forest depletion problem over the
next decade, there are serious prospects of regional fuelwood scarcity in some
areas, particularly in the extreme Northeast.
1.06.    Possibilities may exist in Ghana to develop small and mini hydropower
sites in rural areas but the schemes so far identified are not economically
attractive. There is potential for transformation of solar energy. A large
amount of research is being done in the renewable energy field by various
Ghanaian institutions with the assistance of public and private aid agencies.
To coordinate these research efforts and promote the use of renewable energy
so that it could reduce the use of petroleum, particularly in the rural areas,
the Government has decided to establish a renewable energy unit as part of NEB
'and has created an Energy Fund, replenished through a special levy on
petroleum products. The IDA financed Energy Project (Credit 1373-GB of June
1983), provides for experts, training, and equipment to assist NEE in the
coordination and preparation of programs for investment in renewable energy
and help attract foreign financing. At Government's request the Bank has also
agreed to provide a staff member on a temporary assignment in Ghana to provide
assistance in renewable energy matters.
D.       The Petroleum Sector
1.07.    Ghana is a minor petroleum producer, producing about 650 barrels per
day from the Saltpond field, some 15 km offshore and 100 km west of Accra.
This represented about 52 of 1984 domestic consumption of about 0.6 million
metric tons. The remainder is imported. Although not a petroleum intensive
economy by international standards (50 kg per capita in 1984), Ghana's heavy
dependence on imported petroleum for commercial energy has strained its
foreign exchange position. In 1976, US$ 48 million was spent on oil,
representing no more than 6% of export of goods and services. In 1984
imported oil cost about US$ 240 million, or over 40Z of Ghana's export
earnings.
1.08.     Oil and gas have been found in the offshore Tano area near the
border with Ivory Coast. Recoverable reserves are roughly estimated at about



- 3 -
50 million barrels of oil and one TCF 1/ of gas. On the basis of a gas market
study financed under Credit 1373-GH of June 1983 the most promising market for
the gas appears to be power generation. However, the economic merits and
financial costs of exploiting the gas reserves remain to be established. As a
first step, the Government has hired consultants to prepare reliable estimates
of the gas reserves of the Saltpond field where 10 million cubic feet of gas
per day are flared, as well as of the other discoveries. Should gas reserves
prove to be sufficient and economically exploitable, a gas thermal generating
plant may be justifiable.
1.09.     Under the Energy Project (Credit 1373-GH) the Government is actively
promoting petroleum exploration. Offshore areas have been made available to
the petroleum industry and several proposals for exploration/production have
already been received from international oil companies.
1.10.    Petroleum product consumption in Ghana diminished by 20% from 1980 to
1984 to about 600,000 tons. Diesel accounts for the largest consumption share
(35%), followed by gasoline (34%). The largest consuming sector is transport
(75% of total consumption). The remainder covers the residential sector, 16%,
and the combined industrial and agricultural sectors, 9%. Petroleum product
prices have been raised substantially following the exchange rate adjustments
in 1983 and 1984. The Energy Project includes the financing of a study to
devise a sound pricing policy and a mechanism for revising prices in the
petroleum field. A plan of action based on the study is expected to be
available by December 31, 1985.
E.       Investment Requirements
1.11.    Government and the Bank are carrying out a review of public
investments which will be completed by September 1985. Investments in energy
projects during the period 1985-1990 will be conceutrated in power and
petroleum. Government proposals for investments in power would be mainly for
rehabilitation of existing facilities, for extension of the high voltage grid
and for small additions in thermal generating capacity to complement operation
of the hydro plants, as follows:
1/   TCF - Trillion cubic feet.

June 1985 prices.
This program calls for a total investment of about US$ 134 million over a
period of six years. Further studies are required to confirm the economic
merits of projects other than system rehabilitation. There is flexibility,
.herefore, as to the timing of system expansion. thermal complementation, and
of extending the transmission grid to the northwest and north. As a result,
total investments over the period may be reduced to about US$ 84 million.
This does not include ongoing works in Akosombo township, water supply, and
other related facilities. Investment in power would be considerably lower
than for the previous five years, during which a major expansion of generating
capacity (Kpong hydropower plant) was completed, and no major increases in
generating capacity are needed for the next five years or so.
1.12.     Government's investment plans in the petroleum sector include the
rehabilitation of the Tema refinery and the petroleum product distribution
network at a cost which may reach US$ 100 million. Investments in petroleum
exploration and development are to be left largely to the private sector.
F.        Organization of the Power Sub-sector
1.13.    The Ministry of Fuel and Power is responsible for establishing and
supervising implementation of overall policy of the power sub-sector. It
performs that role by reviewing annual reports, tariff submissions,
development budgets and project proposals submitted to it by VRA (the bulk
supplier) and ECG (the distribution utility).



- 5 -
1.14.    Since its foundation in 1961 VRA has operated as a quasi enclave
within Ghana, has been well managed and has fully met its responsibilities
within the sector. VRA has therefore enjoyed the confidence of Government and
has its views and proposals accepted. ECG, on the other hand, with operations
which are much more complex than those of VRA, has suffered from ;neffective
management, has not met its sector responsibilities in recent years, and does
not have full confidence of Government or the consumers. The contrast between
the highly efficient, albeit simpler, management and operations of VRA and the
poor, although more complex, management and operations of ECG have prompted
Government and IDA to consider ways to achieve a more effective sector
organization. A study of the merits of a merger of VRA and ECG as well as
other institutional arrangements in the sector is being carried out by
Electricity Supply Board of Ireland (ESB) and financed by a PPF advance
approved by the Bank on August 15, 1983.
1.15.     The study is being carried out in three stages.  The first stage to
be cc-Ir?leted by August 1985 consists of a diagnosis of the sector with
recommendations on future sector organization, and in particular an analysis
of the merits of merging ECG and VRA. This stage also includes a work plan,
staffing plan and schedule for execution of the second step. Government and
IDA will review ESB's work and agree on a schedule to carry out the necessary
measures by December 1985. In the second stage, expected to require 6 months,
ESB will review existing legislation governing the sub-sector, and in
particular legislation govern-ing the management and operations of the
utilities. ESB will review the utilities' organizations, objectives,
functions, financial practices, maintenance programs, and training provisions.
The study will also define the roles of the responsible Ministry, the
board(s), the chief executives, the department heads and their deputies
including as appropriate job descriptions, delegation of responsibility and
reporting requirements. Government and IDA will review ESB's recommendations
before December 1986 and agree on a schedule to carry out the necessary
measures. For the third stage, ESB will prepare a detailed institutional
rehabilitation plan and assist in its implementation which should lead to
building strong, efficient and autonomous organization(s) capable of meeting
the country's electric power requirements economically. During negotiations
Government agreed to carry out necessary sector organization measures on a
schedule satisfactory to the Association and to initiate them no later than
December 31, 1985.
G.        Power Facilities
1.16.    The total installed generating capacity in Ghana is about 1,130 MW of
which 1,072 MW (95%) is hydroelectric. The remainder comprises diesel units
installed in 28 stations varying in size from 51 kW to 30 MW which are
generally in poor condition. Hydro capacity is installed in two stations
owned by VRA on the Volta River - the Akosombo plant (912 MW), commissioned in
the mid-1960's, and the Kpong plant (160 MW), commissioned in 1982. Both
hydro plants are in good condition and well maintained. Because of age, the
Akosombo plant efficiency has fallen, but it could be restored and probably
improved. VRA would study this further, under the proposed project. Ghana's
installed capacity is described in greater detail in Annex 1-1.



- 6 -
1.17.    The VRA 161 kV transmission system totals over 1,200 km.  Eight
circuits of 67 km connect the Akosombo and Kpong plants to the VALCO smelter
at Tema and other industrial loads. A 650 km transmission loop supplies ECG
areas and mines in Southern Ghana. A 161 kV interconnection with Communaute
Electrique du Benin (CEB) connects Akosombo to Lome (Togo). In 1983, the
Ivory Coast was also interconnected through a 225 kV transmission line (see
Map). Under the proposed project these substations will be repaired and
upgraded.
1.18.    ECG's distribution facilities comprise 33 kV and 11 kV lines and
underground cables with 33/11/0.4 kV substations feeding power from VRA's
transmission system or ECG's diesel plants. ECG distributes power in the main
cities - Accra, Tema, Kumasi, and Sekondi-Takoradi - and in other urban
centers located within the interconnected grid which covers the southern part
of Ghana. About 95% of ECG's electricity requirement is purchased from VRA.
ECG also operates a number of isolated stations on behalf of the Government
which subsidizes the operation of these facilities. The quality of service is
generally poor as the system has been inadequately maintained and consumers
have been allowed to install service connections of varying materials and
construction standards. Distribution losses average at least 15%. In view of
the configuration of the system and the voltages involved, losses could be
reduced to about 10%. In recent years service within the interconnected grid
has deteriorated due largely to poor maintenance and inadequate reinforcement
of the distribution system. The isolated diesel plant systems serving small
towns have even more serious problems. Many operate less than half the day
because of inadequate supply of diesel fuel, in part due to poor road
conditions and the poor state of the contractor's tanker fleet.
R.       Access to Service, Electricity Consumption and Exports
1.19.    Ghana, with a population of about 12.5 million had about 230,000
electricity consumers in 1983, indicating that no more than 10% of the
population 2/ had access to electricity. The cities of Accra, Tema, Takoradi,
Kumasi, and Cape Coast accounted for 162,000 (70%) of the total number of
consumers, with the remainder spread over other urban areas.  Excluding sales
to VALCO and CEB, per capita electricity consumption reached a high of 110 kWh
in 1981 (this compares with 217 kWh in Ivory Coast, 124 kWh in Senegal).
Sector sales grew steadily at an annual rate of 6.3Z between 1970 and 1977
(from 2,763 GWh to 4,226 GWh), but slowed down to an annual pace of 5.0% over
the period 1977-1981 (from 4,226 GWh to 5,181 GWh), as economic activity
declined. Between 1981 and 1983, however, sales dropped by 33.4Z because
hydro generation decreased from 5,650 GWh in 1981 to 2,650 GWh in 1983 as
consequence of the drought which started in 1981. In June 1983 VALCO was
forced to shut down its aluminum smelter which only resumed operations on a
reduced scale in April 1985. In 1984, VRA had to restrict supply to Ghana's
domestic market to 1,000 GWh and to CEB to about 300 GWh. During the second
half of 1984 it began exports to Ivory Coast at an annual rate of 300 GWh.

- 7 -
Details on Ghana's consumption pattern and rates of growth over 1970-1983 are
given in Annex 1-2.
I.        Power Development and Planning
1.20.     Ghana's power sector is at a crossroads.  The recent drought had
depleted the Volta lake (Akosombo reservoir), with the result that normal
operation of the reservoir is not certain before, say 1988. With domestic
electricity sales expected to grow between 2% to 5% p.a., new generating
capacity would be needed primarily as reserve and to increase flexibility in
reservoir management. According to an expansion plan prepared by Acres
International Ltd. (Canada) all new capacity to the year 2000 would be
thermal, as none of the hydro options is economic. The attractiveness of
thermal generation has been enhanced by recent offshore discoveries of gas.
In all expansion schemes prepared by the consultants, rehabilitation of the
Tema diesel plant (10 x 3 MW) defers by about two years investments in new
thermal capacity. The Tema plant would serve as standby and complement the
hydro capacity. Rehabilitation.of Tema would cost about US$ 2.5 million and
is included in the proposed project. f
1.21.     In July 1984, Government and VALCO renegotiated the 1962 contract.
The most significant change to the contract is the provision for reviews every
five years and an increase in the price for power paid by VALCO, which
originally had been set at 2.625 US mills per kWh. The new rate is at
approximately the world average price for power supplied to smelters (about
US 20 mills/kWh). Also under the amended contract, VRA's supplies to VALCO
are determined by a formula which guarantees that the domestic market gets
priority over VALCO. The maximum energy assigned to VALCO is now 2,760 GWh
(enough for only four out of five potlines). If VALCO requires more energy to
run its fifth potline, it has the right of first refusal over any additional
energy that may be available after VRA has met its other obligations but at a
price to be negotiated at that time. The new contract gives VRA considerable
flexibility to supply customers other than VALCO, particularly the export
markets to Energie Electrique de la C^ote d'Ivoire (EECI) and CEB, and to
increase significantly its revenues. Since VRA no longer needs to guarantee a
fixed amount of power to VALCO, it can manage its reservoir in such a way as
to maximize sales and reduce the likelihood of spilling water in wet years.
1.22.     Other important changes to the agreement between Ghana and VALCO
include an increase in the fee VALCO earns from its foreign shareholders on
processing alui-na into aluminium and an increase in the tax rate on VALCO's
income. Government now also has the right to nominate two directors to the
VALCO board and the option to buy 20% of VALCO's equity during the next five
years. The effect on Government's revenues from the change in contract is
significant.   For the maximum contracted amount (2,760 GWh/year) VRA's
revenues from sales to VALCO would be about US$ 39 million, at an aluminium
price of USJ55/pound, as against US$ 15.5 million under the previous
agreement. Similarly, tax revenues will increase significantly.
1.23.     VRA has pioneered electrical supply across national boundaries in
western Africa. It has supplied power to CEB starting in 1972 and to the
Ivory Coast since 1984. The interconnection has worked well and VRA, CEB, and
BECI support a West Africa Power System Interconnection (WAPSI) within the



- 8 -
Union des Producteurs, Transporteurs et Distributeurs d'Energie Electrique
d'Afrique (UPDEA). WAPSI, in a first stage, would aim at linking the power
systems of Benin, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Nigeria, and Togo. The presently
interconnected facilities would then be linked to the 330 kV Nigerian grid via
a 330 kV transmission line from the Ikeja West substation near Lagos to the
Volta substation in Ghana. A Danish/Swedish joint venture was retained to
prepare an interconnection feasibility study, which was financed with a
Scandinavian grant, and was completed in July 1984. The African Development
Bank (AfDB) was the executing agency and CEB supervised the study, with the
Bank providing advice. The feasibility study concluded that a West Africa
interconnection (including Nigeria) was economic. The study assumed that gas
would be available to supply the 1,320 MW Egbin thermal plant near Lagos.
However, the pipeline project to supply that plant is now stalled and this
situation casts doubts on the timing of interconnection with Nigeria.
1.24.     The nature of the power systems and resource base in the region
suggests that many benefits would be reaped from a Nigeria to Ivory Coast
interconnection. Ghana and Ivory Coast have largely hydro generation, while
Nigeria is planning for large scale development of gas-fired thermal
generation. Future interchanges might consist of firming up VRA hydro
capacity with NEPA thermal capacity and seasonal excess hydro energy transfers
to effect fuel savings at NEPA in exchange for NEPA thermal energy support to
VRA in dry periods. Another possibility is optimization of capacity use by
taking advantage of peak load diversity. Because utilities wish to retain
independence, and resolution of administration complexities takes time, any
interconnection benefits are likely to be realized only in successive stages
of cooperation. The CEB - VRA - EECI portion of the interconnection has
become more attractive with the discovery of gas in Ghana and Ivory Coast,
which could fuel gas-fired thermal plants to provide the required
complementation for hydro, and with the increased flexibility provided by the
new VALCO/VRA agreement. As a consequence, reinforcement of VRA's existing
grid and additional transmission circuit to Togo and increased capacity of
transmission to Ivory Coast will likely proceed within the next two to three
years. Given the uncertainty of future conditions on the Nigerian power
system and, therefore, the economic attractiveness of the Nigerian portion of
the West Africa interconnection, VRA has planned a back-up alternative to
thermal support from Nigeria. The Acres study determined that a small amount
of thermal capacity, 50 to 100 MT, would increase substantially the amount of
energy VRA could sell while reducing the probability of spilled water by
providing a standby source to meet energy deficits in dry years. VRA should
prepare such a thermal project for execution in case full interconnection does
not proceed. The project would therefore include site investigations,
engineering and bidding document preparation for a VRA thermal plant to
complement existing hydro. The type, oil versus gas versus coal and size
would be finalized in the continuing Acres study.
II. THE BORROWER AND EXECUTING AGENCIES
The borrower of the IDA and cofinanced funds would be the Government
of Ghana and the beneficiaries would be ECG and VRA.



- 9 -
A.        Electricity Corporation of Ghana (ECG)
2.01.     ECG was established in 1967 to succeed the Electricity Division of
the Ministry of Works and Housing and is responsible for the distribution of
electricity throughout Ghana and for the country's diesel power plants and the
operations of Government's rural electrification works. Over the last five
years, ECG could not discharge its responsibilities satisfactorily due to
ineffective management and lack of foreign exchange to purchase spare parts
and equipment. The quality of its service is poor with interrupted and
intermittent supply and ECG has been unable to provide either for new
connections or for system reinforcement to maintain voltage levels.
1. Organization and Management
2.02.    ECG is organized along typical utility lines.  Its organization cLiart
is shown in Annex 2-1. ECG has had organization and management problems for
several years, such as poor administrative links with provincial centers, lack
of effective administrative procedures, and a weak managerial team. In May
1982 EeG's Board was replaced by a committee comprising the Managing Director,
the Financial Controller or Chief accountant, the Chief Engineer of ECG, a
middle management representative, a trade -anion representative, and two
representatives of ECG's Workers Defense Committee. This committee proved
ineffective because it was concerned primarily with political matters and
interfered in the day to day operations of the utility. The committee was
dissolved in December 1984 and the old system reinstated. As part of its
second stage work (para. 1.15) ESB will examine the composition and
responsibilities of ECG and its new board. Any necessary action will be
included in ESB's third stage work.
2. Manpower
2.03.     At year-end 1979, ECG had close to 6,200 employees (or 37 customers
per employee, compared to 90 in Ivory Coast and 80 in Senegal) when it froze
hirings. By the end of 1984 the number of employees had declined to 4,800.
The pace of employee resignations has accelerated over the last year to about
45 per month, as an increasing number of people are cashing in on their
accrued benefits. Although an appropriate overall staff level will be reached
in the near future, ECG will still be overstaffed at the lower levels and will
not have qualified and trained personnel in sufficient numbers at all levels.
ECG has had problems in recruiting and retaining suitably qualified staff,
partly because of image problems and partly because employees are not
adequately compensated. As a result, ECG has vacancies in about 50% of the
management and professional cadres and many incumbents appear unsuitable for
the positions they hold. ESB will examine in detail ECG's manpower problems
lncluding compensation and make recommendations and would assist ECG in
finding suitable managerial staff from within ECG and Ghana and from overseas
if necessary (para. 1.14).   IDA and the Government will discuss their
recommendations and agree by December 1986, on a plan to implement the
measures that should be taken in this area. In the meantime, and given the
seriousness of the probleu, housi.ng would be financed under the project and
assigned to senior staff to complement their remuneration.



- 10 -
3. Training
2.04.     ECG  is building its own training center at Tema for its technical,
commercial and administrative training needs. Due to a shortage of imported
materials, however, the workshop building is not yet completed. The center
also lacks equipment, materials, and technical instructors. Staff training
abroad has been curtailed due to cuts in bilateral aid and foreign exchange
problems. Consequently, there is a backlog of training needs for managers,
engineers and accountants who need exposure to utility operations overseas.
In addition, ECG must develop the ability to continuousiv assess its manpower
needs and plan all its training activities. The technical assistance program
under the proposed project would review all matters relating to training.
Completion of the training center, including acquisition of remaining
equipment would be financed under the proposed credit. ESB would review the
utilities' training provisions and prepare a training program by December
1986.
4. Accounting and Audit
2.05.    Like other parts of ECG, its accounting department lacks qualified
staff. Financial management is almost non-existent and its accounting system
needs redesign. Information is both sparse and unreliable. ECG keeps
separate accounts for the operation of rural electrification networks on
Government's behalf. At end-1982, rural net fixed assets represented about 5X
of ECG's own assets. ECG's accounts are audited by Coopers and Lybrand. For
some years now the auditors have heavily qualified their certificates for ECG
due to the unreliability of its accounting. As part of its assignment, ESB
would assist ECG overcome its accounting and financial management problems.
5. Insurance
2.06.     ECG insures for protection against losses of goods-in-transit, fire,
third party claims on vehicles and other property and workmen's compensation
along accepted public utility practices.
B.       Volta River Authority (VRA)
2.07.    VRA is a modern, well operated public utility with a high degree of
autonomy, and is responsible for hydropower generation and power exports to
Togo-Benin and Ivory Coast, bulk power supplies to ECG, the Volta Aluminum
Company's (VALCO) smelter at Tema, to gold and diamond mines, and the Akosombo
textiles and township. VRA was established in 1961 to construct and operate
the Akosombo hydro-plant on the Volta River, which was the first hydroelectric
project in Ghana and was partly financed by the Bank (Loan 310-GH of February
1962). In addition to Akosombo, VRA owns the Kpong hydroplant downstream of
Akosombo and the 161 kV grid in Ghana with extensions to Togo and the Ivory
Coast.
1. Organization and Management
2.08.    VRA's charter, the 1961 Volta River Development Act, charges VRA not
only to operate its hydroelectric plants according to sound public utility
practices, but also to develop the Volta Lake which involves lake research and



- 11 -
transport. VRA is governed by a Board which is appointed by the Head of
State, who is Chairman ex-officio. The Board is composed of a Chairman and
seven other members, including VRA's Chief Executive and representatives of
ECG and VALCO. Its organization chart is shown in Annex 2-2.
2. Manpower and Training
2.09.    As of December 1984, VRA had about 2,500 employees of which about 95%
are engaged in electricity services and 5% in other activities. VRA has been
able to build up and retain good staff because of its financial and managerial
independence, relatively good working conditions and in spite of its
relatively low salaries. As a result, the morale of VRA's staff is much
higher than that of ECG's staff. VRA has recently installed its own training
center at Akuse (Kpong) which is functioning well. VRA is receiving financial
assistance (about US$ 3 million) on concessional terms from CIDA (Canada) to
finance equipment and expatriate instructors for its training center. The
Akuse center does not yet have all intended training specializations (notably,
mechanical maintenance training), but VRA plans to provide these opportunely.
3. Accounting and Audit
2.10.    VRA's accounting system is good.  Financial forecasting is done on a
micro-computer and production of accounting, budgeting and forecasting data is
timely. VRA maintains separate accounts for activities unrelated to
electricity services. The accounting and finance departments have qualified
staff but appear understaffed. VRA's accounts are also audited by Coopers and
Lybrand. The accounts of VRA have always been certified without qualification
by the auditors.
4. Insurance
2.11.     VRA insures against most common risks associated with hydro
generation and transmission, fire, third party claims on vehicles and other
property and workmen's compensation along accepted public utility practices.
C.        History of Bank Group Involvement with the Power Sector
2.12.     Three projects financed by three IDE credits and one IBRD Loan have
been made to assist the expansion of ECG's distribution system: a credit of
US$ 10 million in 1968, US$ 2 million in 1971 and US$ 9 million in 1977
together with a loan of US$ 9 million. The first two projects were completed
satisfactorily. The Third Power Project was completed in 1982 after a
three-year delay, due in part to Ghana's economic situation and in part to
ECG's poor project administration. Although the project was successful in
providing new facilities, it was not successful in improving the management or
the operations of ECG. A Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR) of June 6,
1985, presents in detail the effects of the project and the main lesson to be
learned from it which is that in economies where growth prospects are
uncertain, more emphasis should be placed on ensuring full utilization of

2.13.     Three loans have been made to VRA: the first for US$ 47 million to
assist in financing the Volta River Hydroelectric Project (Akosombo) in 1961;
the second for US$ 6 million for the Volta Expansion Project in 1968; and the
third for US$ 39 million to help finance the Kpong Hydro-Project in 1977. The
first two projects were completed satisfactorily. The Kpong project
experienced cost overruns of about 140% in local costs and 14% in foreign cost
and two years delay, and was completed 1982. The cost overruns were due to
Ghana's poor economic condition which caused shortages and delays in obtaining
locally purchased equipment and materials and by the very high inflation that
prevailed at that time. The PPAR of June 6, 1985, points out, among others,
that for hydro projects in the Sahel, extensive drought periods must be
considered in structuring the hydrological design and operation criteria.
D.        Bank Group Objectives, Strategy and Rationale for Involvement
2.14.     The principal objective of the Bank in the power sector in Ghana is
to improve the reliability, reduce the cost of electric power supplies and
support economic grid extensions within Ghana, while at the same time reducing
the demands imposed by the sector on Government resources and maintaining the
sector's export capability. The Bank's past lending has helped Ghana achieve
some of these objectives, and by assisting VRA, has helped build one of the
better managed utilities in West Africa. The Bank has not, however, succeeded
in introducing institutional and organizational reforms in ECG which would
have helped improve reliability and reduce costs. During the preparation of
this project, IDA and the Government have agreed on a two front approach to
tackle the sector's problems. First, ESB's work and follow-up actions will
provide the basis for the reorganization and institutional rehabilitation of
the sector. Second, the physical rehabilitation of the sector's facilities
will improve service and consolidate finances. These actions would prepare
the sector for future development and enhance its capacity to fulfill its
strategic role in the economic growth both in Ghana and in its neighbors.
III. THE PROJECT
3.01.     The project proposed for IDA financing is an important component of
the 1986-90 investment program and will concentrate on the rehabilitation of
ECG's and VRA's systems. It includes priority facilities that would permit
the sector to provide reliable service by 1990. Implementation of the project
is expected to begin by January 1, 1986, and be completed by December 31,
1990.

3.03.     The project's estimated cost is US$ 48.8 million; the estimated
foreign cost amounts to US$ 41.2 million (84.4%). The ECG component was
defined using as reference the report prepared by British Electricity
International (BEI) in July 1980, the Bank's draft appraisal report of March
1982 on a proposed project for ECG and the findings of a Bank mission of May
1983. The VRA component was defined by VRA's staff assisted by its
consultants and reviewed by a Bank mission in November 1984. Costs are based
on June 1985 prices. Allowances for price increases in foreign costs have
been Incorporated in the cost estimate using annual percentages (1985: 5.0%,
1986: 7.5%. 1987-90: 8.0%), and for local costs (1985: 202. 1986: 15Z,
1987-90: 10%). Physical contiugency allowance averaging 10% has been used.
This figure is considered appropriate in relation to the type of project
involved and degree of accuracy of the base cost estimate. Project
expenditures are exempt from taxes and duties which are not included in the
estimate.

B.        Project Financing
3.04.     The proposed IDA credit would finance the foreign cost of ECG's
rehabilitation equipment and materials, anticorrosive treatment of Akosombo,
the foreign cost of the technical assistance, and training overseas of ECG's
staff, and studies that will be needed both by ECG and VRA. The co-lender is
expected to finance most of the foreign exchange cost of VRA's rehabilitation
program.  The financing plan, as currently defined, would be as follows:
Project Financing and Assumed Terms to ECG and VRA
IDA Credit             28.0  15 years including up to 5 years grace at lnZ
Italian Government      10.0  Same
ECG                     4.9  Internally generated funds
VRA                      5.9  Same
48.8
The Government would relend the proceeds of the Credit to ECG and to VRA at
8.8% for 15 years, including a grace period of up to 5 years. ECG and VRA
would bear the foreign exchange risk. Cofinancing is expected from the
Italian Government (a memorandum of understanding between them and VRA is to
be signed soon). IDA has obtained assurances from Government to cover all
funding shortfalls, should they occur, to complete the project on schedule.
C.        Procurement
3.,05.    ECG's distribution equipment and materials, and motor vehicles,
would be procured through international competitive bidding (ICB) in
accordance with IDA guidelines. Office equipment would be procured through
international shopping and motor vehicle spare parts for ECG's existing fleet
through direct purchases from the original manufacturers. Housing for ECG
would be procured through LCB and under guidelines acceptable to the Bank.
Anticorrosive treatment of Akosombo will be contracted through international
shopping. The Tema plant rehabilitation and VRA's substation equipment and
materials would be purchased under the procurement requirements of the
cofinancing sources. A summary of the procurement methods expected to be used
is given below and a time schedule for the various steps of procurement is
shown in Annex 3-2.

D.        Status of ProJect
3.06.     ESB, who will provide technical assistance in the sector, began its
work in May 1985 through a PPF advance approved by the Bank in August 1983.
Preparation of bidding documents has begun.
E.        Project ImplementatioT
3.07.     The executing agencies would be ECG and VRA.  ESB, which has been
contracted by Government for the sector organization, will also assist ECG to

3.09.     The estimated schedule of disbursements is based on the Sectoral
Disbursements Profile in West Africa and is shown in Annex 3-4. Arrangements
to establish a-Special Account, to be maintained in foreign currency in a
commercial bank, were agreed during negotiations. Withdrawals will be made
against full documentation, with the exception of contracts of less than
US$ 10,000 equivalent and training overseas; reimbursement for expenditures
will be made on the basis of statements of expenditures (SOEs) for -which
supporting documentation will be retained by the implementing agencies
concerned. Amoxnis withdrawn on the basis of SOEs will be subject to special
auditing arrangements, including a separate opinion covering the use of these
funds.
G.        Environment
3.10.     The project is not expected to produce any adverse environmental
effects.
IV. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A.        Past Finances
1. Backround
4.01.     ECG's charter mandates it to operate commercially and to set
electricity charges at levels sufficient to cover annual operating costs, debt
servicing requirements, fund a reasonable proportion of its expansion program
and contribute to reserves. According to its charter, VRA has to operate
commercially and make profits.  The actual financial performance of Ghana's
power sector in recent years must be seen in context with the deterioration of
the economy, the drought that has affected Ghana since 1981 and the economic
measures (Economic Recovery Program) undertaken since April 1983.
4.02.     The deterioration of the economy has adversely affected the
financial position of the sector as high inflation produced cost increases
which were not offset by timely and adequate rate Increases; industrial demand
for electricity declined and the sector lacked needed foreign exchange.
Simultaneously, the drought has reduced hydroelectric generation, further
restricting sector revenues, particularly foreign exchange earniugs. As part
of the Economic Recovery Program, Government devalued the Cedi by 11 times in
October 1983, and by a further 60% in several stages in 1984.  The Cedi
devaluations resulted in additional cost increases and made critical the
sector's financial position. To remedy this situation Government increased
electricity rates by about 500% in 1984, and authorized further increases of
about 20% for 1985, and about 15% for 1986. These measures, which were taken
in the most adverse circumstances, are expected to put the sector on e sound
financial footing.
4.03.    The consequences of the economic measures are still rippling through
the economy and make the analysis of data and their projection difficult. In
addition, ECG's information is scant, inaccurate and tardy.

- 21 -
(1981 and 1982) of excellent earnings provided by substantial rate increases
(183Z for 1981-1982), ECG did not cover its costs in 1983. In 1983, the
Government granted ECG rate increases which yielded a 14% increase in its
revenue while the utility's total costs (including interest charges) increased
by about 92%, mostly as a result of the devaluatic-: of the currency.  The 500%
rate increase granted to ECG in 1984 is expected to have produced again a very
high return; more than 20%.
4.05.      Loan 1380-GH requires VRA to earn a rate of return equivalent to
7.3% of average owner's equity (net income over average equity). VRA's
earnings in 1981 were close to those required by Loan 1380-GH but deteriorated
steadily as a result of the drought until they bottomed out in 1983. In
1981-1982 the Government authorized VRA rate increases of about 68% to its
domestic consumers and VRA was able to increase the price on its exports to
CEB by about 48%, while the utility's operating costs increased by about 47%.
In 1983, the 15% rate increases granted VRA on its domestic sales and
increases in the Cedi equivalent of its exports - resulting from the Cedi
devaluation - were much lower than the 240% increase in its total costs. The
1984 hefty rate increases approved by the Government are expected to have
resulted still in a negative return figure on average capital but with a clear
improving trend.

b/ Translation gains on foreign exchange reserves after Cedi devaluation.
Over the period 1981-1984, ECG's financing performance appears goad as it
financed about 84Z of its capital expenditures with internally generated funds
and 16Z with debt. However, this performance reflects the constraints under
which ECG operated: as it was unable to obtain foreign exchange, it had to
limit its capital and maintenance expenditures, Government amortized part of
ECG's debt while ECG paid only the interest, and ECG delayed its payments to
VRA for purchased power (up to 14 months).
4.07.     VRA is allowed to operate a dollar account in New York.  This
account was originally established to receive payment for power exports and
service debt. VRA also used this account to finance part of its maintenance
and expansion program. In 1983, the Cedi devaluations produced an exchange
gain on VRA's dollar account of about ¢ 520 million. During 1981-1984 VRA
could not contribute with internally generated funds to its investment program
and in 1984 it had to obtain a US$ 6.0 million short-term credit to meet its
foreign exchange requirements, which has since been fully repaid.

Debt/equity ratio                               61/39                 43/57
The low proportion of ECG's debt financing (11%) in 1981-1984 resulted in a
high capitalization rate, its debt/equity ratio at end-1984 stood at 61/39 and
its liquidity was acceptable with a current ratio of 1.6. VRA's debt/equity
ratio of 43/57 at end-1984 is very good but its liquidity was low with a
current ratio of 0.5, as the utility resorted to bank overdrafts. While VRA
has revalued irs assets annually in accordance with Bank Group agreements, ECG
revalued its fixed assets only at en'-1976.  To develop historical and
projected figures, ECG's fixed assets were revalued using the indices employed
by VRA. 6/   During negotiations ECG agreed that if the tariff study
(para. 4.12) so recommends, it will, by December 31, 1986, update the
6/   This may result in a substantial understatement of ECG's assets which
include a larger share of local costs.

revaluation of its assets to 1985 and will continue to revalue them every year
thereafter. VRA will continue to revalue its assets every year.
B.        Billing and Collection
B.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~P
4.09.     ECG has serious billing and collection problems.  Receivables  have
risen from almost 6 months billing in 1978 to 11 months by 1983. ESB, under
project financing, is assisting in improving ECG's billing and collection to
reduce receivables to no more than 3 months billing by end-1987. On the other
hand, VRA's main collection problem has been ECG's overdues (para. 4.06). It
is expected that VRA would be able to reduce its receivables to 2 months
billing by end-1986 as ECG's finances improve and ECG pays its overdues. A
major reason for ECG's overdues to VRA (over C 450 million) is ECG's
receivableb from Government and parastatals (Government overdues stand at
about e 200 million and the Water and Sewerage Corporation's at about C 250
million). Government is now paying its overdues under a plan agreed with ECG.
To ensure that this plan is carried out in a timely manner, it was agreed
during negotiations that ECC will improve its collections so that by
December 31, 1986, it will have no more than 120 days of billing outstanding
and by December 31, 1987, and thereafter, no more than 90 days of billing.
During negotiations it was also agreed that interlocking overdues among
Government, ECG and VRA will be settled not later than December 31, 1986.
C.       Tariffs
1. Present Arrangements
4.10.     Both ECG and VRA request rate increases to the MFP.  After the
proposal has been reviewed by X4EB, MEP makes a final decision on behalf of
Government. ECG's tariffs comprise demand and energy charges 7/ for
commercial and industrial customers. Its average selling price by end-1984
was 9/kWh 2.235 or USi/kWh 4.47. 8/   Despite the recent rate increases
Ghana's average revenue per kWh at the retail level is low compared to most
other West African countries (in USI/kWh: Benin: 14; Togo: 12; Ivory Coast:
10; Senegal: 11; Burkina: 19), which reflects primarily Ghana's cheap hydro
generation. VRA's tariffs are also two-part, comprising demand and energy
charges. VRA's power sales to VALCO are now billed at over USJ 1 per kWh
(para. 1.21). The price of VRA sales to CEB is USJ 4 per kWh from April 1,
1985 to March 31, 1988, when it is scheduled to be renegotiated. The price
currently charged Ivory Coast is USi 4 per kWh but a long-term contract has
not yet been agreed. VRA's total estimated average revenue for 1984 was
7/   Energy charge is that portion of the billed charge for electric service
which is based upon the elec.ric energy (kilowatt-hours) supplied; demand
charge is the portion of the billed charge which is based on billing
demand (power, which is measured in kilowatts).
8/   Cedis 50.0 = US$ 1.00.

9 0.78/kWh or USi/kWh 1.56 and its average cost ¢ 0.54/kWh or USi 1.1. 9/
Annex 4-7 shows ECG's and VRA's domestic rate schedule.
4.11.     ECG used to bear all diesel generation costs of the provincial
stations, which it passed to consumers through a standard rate schedule. To
ensure equity in sharing generation costs among all consumers, ECG has
recently been authorized to charge all generation costs to VRA, who passes
them on to all domestic consumers at the bulk level, including ECG. However,
the procedure for computing these charges is not yet finalized. Furthermore,
to ensure that additional costs will be passed on to consumers on time, both
ECG and VRA should incorporate fuel and bulk power cost adjustment clauses in
their tariff schedules and power supply contracts.   During negotiations,
Government, ECG and VRA agreed to confirm a procedure for computing and
invoicing ECG's generation costs to VRA for recovery in the charges to all
bulk power consumers and agreed that ECG and VRA would incorporate fuel and
bulk power cost adjustment clauses in their tariff schedules and power supply
contracts under procedures to be agreed with IDA.
2.   Future Tariffs
4.12.     Now that the Acres generation planning has been completed, sector
tariffs should be examined. During negotiations, ECG and VRA agreed that they
will hire consultants, to be financed by the proposed credit, to carry out a
study of the sector tariffs and to discuss with IDA the findings of such a.
study. This study will, among others, recommend an appropriate financial goal
for the sector. On the basis of such study. Government and IDA will agree on
the criteria and schedule for adjusting electricity rates. The study will set
electricity prices after consideration of the long-run marginal cost (LRMC,
currently estimated at between USi 5 and 6 per kWh at the generation level),
and a level sufficient to cover costs, service debt and make an adequate
contribution to expansion program. The revised agreement between VALCO and
VRA provides flexibility to supply domestic markets for the foreseeable future
with low cost power from Akosombo. Tariffs based on LRMC may tlus provide
large surpluses. The study will also make recommendations on the allocation
of surpluses between retention at the utilities or payment of dividends. The
final results of the study should be available for discussion with IDA by
mid-1986.
D.        Financing Plan
4.13.     The financial projections take into account the rate increases
already allowed by Government (para. 4.02), and rates were assumed to remain
unchanged at their 1986 level until 1990. VRA prices on its exports of
electricity were kept constant throughout 1985-1990. VRA sales to VALCO were
conservatively valued at the minimum selling price of USJ 1 per kWh. ECG and
VRA tentative investment plans are shown in para. 1.11. ECG's and VRA's
91   This cost is an inflated estimate due to the reduced sales that resulted
from the drought.

4.14.     The electricity rates authorized for 1986 seem sufficient at this
time to ensure a healthy sector financial position, particularly considering
the sector's relatively modest construction program. These rates would be
sufficient to cover the utilities' operating costs, service their debt, make a
substantial contribution to their investments, and generate a surplus.
Although the investment programs have not yet been firmly defined, they are
expected to be smaller than the funds that the utilities would have available
for their financing. In the above table, these excess funds are shown as
"funds available for other projects or dividends." Given the uncertain future
of the sector (paras. 1.20, 4.02, 4.03) the assumed electricity rates may not
generate these surpluses. ECG lacks suitable valuation of assets to be used
for earnings requirement as under Credit 689-GH and Loan 1381-GH. We propose,
therefore, to change ECG's earnings requirement covenant when ECG has revalued
its assets and the results of the tariff study (para. 4.12) are available, at



- 27 -
which time the covenant would.be reviewed. Likewise, we propose to change
VRA's earnings requirement until the results of the tariff study are
available. Although VRA's earningF requirement (para. 4.05) has worked well
in the past, it may not-be effective over the'next years if rains do not
return to normal. Consequently, during negotiations, Government, ECG, and VRA
agreed that:
(a) pending the results of the tariff study, ECG's and VRA's
domestic rates would be reviewed annually and adjusted as
necessary to ensure that they would be the higher of either the
rates approved to be in effect by January 1, 1986 or sufficient
to produce revenues to cover operating expenses, debt service,
and working capital and produce a contribution to investment of
not less than 25Z; and
(b) after completion of the tariff study, but not later than
June 30, 1986, Government, the power entities, and IDA will
agree on a financial objective and review the provision on
earnings requirements.
4.15.    Under the above conditions, in 1985-1990 ECG and VRA would not need
borrowings other than the proposed Credit and cofinanced loan, and VRA would
drawdown the remaining funds on existing loans (mostly contractors' and
suppliers' credits) to finance its ongoing construction program.
E.        Future Finances
4.16.     Under the above assumptions, the finances of ECG and VIA are
improving, as highlighted in the following table:

4.17.      ECG's capitalization would further improve to a debt/equity
ratio of around 45/55.  In 1985-1987 some of ECG's financial indicators
are higm:: contribution to investment is high because ECG's investment
expenditures are kept to a minimum; the rate of return may be
overestimated because of possible undervaluation of ECG's assets. ECG's
financial indicators reach more normal levels in the later years; thus,
by the end of the period, its annual debt service coverage ratio would
be around the acceptable level of 2 times, its annual contribution to
construction would be higher than 50% and its liquidity would improve so
that its current ratio would be around 2, which is acceptable. VRA is
also expected to further improve its capitalization (debt/equity ratio
of 26/74 by 1988), its annual debt service coverage would be higher than
2 times and its liquidity would improve and reach acceptable levels in
1985 (current ratio of 1.4, which is acceptable).
4.18.      Although the financial projections show an improving trend for
the two utilities, it is prudent to maintain the utilities' expansion
programs under review. Therefore, during negotiations, it was agreed
with Government and the utilities that no major investments in the



- 29 -
sector (defined as those totalling US$ 25 million for the sector during
the project period) would be carried out unless they are technically,
economically and financially sound and satisfactory to IDA. Under low
rainfall conditions, VRA's foreign exchange deficit may continue and
reach US$ 8-9 million by end-1986. If this shortage materialized, VRA
expects to cover it with short-term loans. During negotiations, ECG and
VRA agreed that they would not incur long-term borrowings (and
short-term borrowings could not exceed 10% of cash operating expenses)
without IDA's concurrence if forecast net revenues covered their maximum
future debt service requirement (including the debt proposed to be
incurred) less than 1.5 times.
V. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
A.       Background
5.01.    Reliable public service electricity supply is vital to Ghana's
economic recovery because of the increased dependence of mining and
smelting and other export-oriented industries in the public system and
the needs of agriculture and wood processing for reliable and economic
electricity. While the project would not involve system expansion it
would provide reliability in the infrastructure necessary for such
service.
5.02.    The purpose of the project is to restore reliable electric
service by overcoming the most serious operating problems existing in
the coastal grid and various isolated systems owing to inadequate
maintenance since the late 70's. These operating problems encompass
system overloads with concomitant energy losses and voltage reductions,
curtailment of service because of frequent outages of old thermal
generating equipment (particularly in isolated systems) and frequent
breakdown of transportation equipment, which not only involve high
maintenance costs but also totally disrupts ECG's maintenance and
operation schedules. Since most of Ghana's industry relies on
public-service electricity supply, the value of reliable supply to the
nation's economy is very high. The justification of the project is to
provide the electrical facilities with the elements of reliability
necessary to render effective support to economic recovery of the
country.
B.       Least-Cost Solution
5.03.    For all of the rehabilitation equipment no reasonable
alternative exists. Some substation superstructures will be redesigned
to improve their performance and some electrical apparatus will be
replaced with modern and more reliable units.
C.       Return on Investment
5.04.    The return on investment was estimated as the discount rate



- 30 -
that equates the present values of the benefits and costs associated
with the 1985-1990 ECG and VRA rehabilitation project. Benefits were
measured by the forecast revenues from the sales of electricity at the
average retail level, using the tariff in effect in December 1983
(Annex 5). The return for the project is about 30X which compares
favorably with the opportunity cost of capital for Ghana, estimated to
be between 12X and 15%.
D.        Project Risks
5.05.     The execution of the project does not have major associated
risks. The financial health of the sector, however, depends heavily on
VRA's ability to supply VALCO and utilities of neighboring countries
and, this in turn, on a replenished Volta Lake. The recent drought has
severely curtailed VALCO's supplies and under normal rainfall the lake
could recover its normal operating level within the next four years or
so, but this event cannot be assured.
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMNENDATION
6.01.    During negotiations the following agreements were reached:
(a) Government agreed to carry out necessary sector
organization measures on a satisfactory schedule and
initiate them by December 31, 1985 (para 1.15);
(b) ECG will update the revaluation of its assets and
thereafter will revalue them annually, if the tariff
study so warrants it, and VRA will continue to revalue
its assets annually (para. 4.08);
(c) Government, ECG, and VRA will settle their arrears by
December 31, 1986, and will thereafter maintain payments
current, and ECG should put into effect measures to
improve its collections (para. 4.09);
(d) procedures for charging all sector generation costs to
VRA and which are included in the bulk rates should be
agreed upon and ECG and VRA should incorporate fuel and
bulk power cost adjustment surcharges (para. 4.11);
(e) ECG and VRA will carry out a tariff study and Government
agreed that it will, on the basis of such study,
implement new electricity rates and a schedule to adjust
them (para. 4.12);
(f) Government will allow ECG and VRA appropriate rate
increases (para. 4.14);



- 31 -
(g) Government wlll not carry out new investments exceeding
US$ 25 million on the aggregate until the completion of
the proposed project (para. 4.18); and
(h) ECG and VRA will not incur debt without IDA's agreement
if their net revenues covered their maximum debt
requirement less than 1.5 times, nor will they incur
short-term debt if it exceeds 10% of cash operating
expenses (para. 4.18).
6.02.     The proposed project is suitable for an IDA Credit of US$ 28
million equivalent.

Assumptions for Financial Projections
A.       General
1.        The financial projections were prepared in current Cedis.  The
inflation rates assumed were the following:
Projected
Local            International            exchange
Year          inflation (Z)         inflation (%)         rate (¢IUS$)
1985               20                    5                    63.3

1988               10                    8                    74.4
1989               10                    8                    75.8
1990               10                    8                    77.2
B.       Income Statements
2.       Estimates for 1983 and 1984 are based on ECG's Revised Budgets for
each year.
3.       ECG sales forecasts were prepared by the utility and consider the
latest hydrology studies carried out by Acres (Canada).
4.        Average rates include the increases over the period 1/1/84-1/1/86
approved by Government in April 1984. 1986 rates were maintained constant
thereafter.
5.       Other revenues (sales of materials and other miscellaneous items)
were forecast at ¢ 6.5 million in 1984 and at a 10% annual growth rate
thereafter.
6.       GWh purchases as estimated by VRA.  Cost of purchases from VRA
include the tariff increases approved in April 1984, as follows:

Purchases
Year                  (GWh)                 Cost
1984                   772                  440.5
1985                   975                  784.9
1986                 1,000                  996.0
1987                 1,000                  996.0
1988                 1,000                  996.0
1989                 1,000                  996.0
1990                 1,000                  996.0
7.       Diesel costs were estimated at current international prices plus
inflation. The GWhs generated by ECG were computed at 2% of purchases from
VRA (net of losses), which has been the long-term experience:
1984    1985    1986    1987    1988   1989   1990
(1)   GWh purchased from VRA         772      975   1,000   1,000   1,000  1,000  1,000

8.        Salaries.  Effective December 1, 1984, the minimum wage was
increased by 100%. This increase is expected to result in an overall salary
increase of about 77Z in 1985. In addition, salaries are expected to be
raised by some 30% in real terms in 1985, or a total factor of 2.3. Salaries
were assumed to keep pace with inflation thereafter. Salaries were also
adjusted to account for a decrease of 500 employees in each 1985 and 1986, as
follows:
(1)  1984 estimated salaries                        ¢  118.2
(2)  1985 estimated salaries:
(1) x 1.77 x 1.3 x 1.2                       0  326.4
(3)  Less: cost of 500 employees                        50.3
(4)  Plus: severance pay of (3) above                  103.5
(5)  Total 1985 salaries                            9  379.6
(6)  1986 estimated salaries:
(5) x 1.15                                   ¢  436.5
(7)  1987 estimated salaries:
((2) - 2 x (3)) x 1.15 x 1.1                  ¢  285.6
(8)  1988 estimated salaries:
(7) x 1.1                                      0  314.2
9.       Cost of repairs and maintenance were forecast at 2.5% of year-end
gross fixed assets in operation.

10.      Cost of transport was forecast to remain constant in 1984, 1985 and
1986 and then to grow by 200% in 1987, due to the impact of the project, and
to remain constant thereafter, all in real terms.
11.       Other expenses were projected to keep pace with inflation.
12.      Depreciation was computed at 4.5Z on year-end gross fixed assets in
operation, which is adequate for ECG.
13.      The generation costs chcrged to VRA are composed of diesel costs plus
labor costs (C 4.5 million in 1984), plus miscellaneous expenses
(¢ 1.1 million in 1984).
14.      Historical non-operating expenses represent the amortization of the
reserve in which ECG records the changes in the long-term debt produced by
fluctuations in exchange rates. As in this report this reserve is considered
as a capital reserve (Revaluation Reserve), no amortization is necessary for
projected years.
B.        o        and Applications of Funds and Balance Sheets
15.      The 1983 and 1984 statements are based on ECG's Revised Budgets for
each year.
16.      Construction expenditures represent the proposed project (Annex 3.1)
plus some minor expenditures assumed at t 20 million in 1984 and 1985.
Expenditures for future projects are estimates for projects not yet defined.
17.      ECG revalued its fixed assets at end-1976 only.  Revaluation
thereafter was estimated by using the same indices used by VRA. The foreign
content was assumed at 60% and the local at 402. Consumer contributions were
revalued with the same indices. Debt was revalued by the changes in the
exchange rate.  The indices used were the following:
Year         Index
1976         1.000
1977         1.203
1978         1.348
1979         1.340
1980         1.358
1981         1.345
1982         1.040
1983         6.710
The indices in para. 1 above were used for projected years.  The following
table summarizes the transactions related to fixed assets:

Projections for 1985 are based on VRk's budget.
3.        VRA sales forecasts were prepared by the utility and consider
the latest hydrology studies carried out by Acres (Canada). Average
rates include the increases over the period 1 1/84 - 1/1/86 approved by
Government in April 1984 and the latest reviqions to the supply contract

4.        The major component of other revenues is interest on
short-term foreign exchange investments.
5.        Salaries.  Effective December 1, 1984, the minimum wage was
increased by 100Z. This increase is expected to result in an overall
salary increase of about 60% in 1985. In addition, salaries are
expected to be raised by some 30% in real terms in 1985, or a total
factor of 2.1. Salaries were raised by 6% in 1986 and by 7.5% in 1987
and 1988 in real terms to allow for expansion and promotions.
6.        Materials were estimated at 0.15% of end-of-year gross fixed
assets in operation.
7.        Transportation costs are expected to remain constant in real
terms as VRA will not increase its vehicle fleet.
8.        General expenses are expected to remain constant in real
terms.
9.        Depreciation was computed at 2.2% of year-end gross fixed
assets in operation.
10.       For an explanation of ECG"s generation costs see Annex 4.8,
para. 13.
11.       For an explanation of historical non-operating expenses see
Annex 4.8, para. 14.
B.        Sources and Applications of Funds and Balance Sheets
12.       The 1984-statements are based on VRA's estimates at end-1984.
Projections for 1985 are based on VRA's budget.
13.       VRA's transactions related to fixed assets are as follows:
