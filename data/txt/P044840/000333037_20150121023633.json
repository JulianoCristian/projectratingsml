Until recently Valeriu hated to go\n            to school, especially during the winter, because classrooms\n            were so cold that he had to wear thick warm clothes while in\n            class. Although the heat was turned on full blast, he often\n            had to blow into his fists to keep his fingers warm because\n            he could not write with frozen hands. Due to a lack of\n            school space, classes were held in two shifts\u0097one in the\n            morning, the other in the afternoon. Classes in the\n            afternoon shift had to be shortened by 15-20 minutes so\n            students would not be walking home in frigid darkness. When\n            this village of 2,000 inhabitants decided to repair the\n            school and improve its heating system with the support of\n            the World Bank financed Moldova Social Investment Fund,\n            Valeriu contributed his modest savings to the village-wide\n            campaign to raise additional local funds. By dropping his\n            pennies into the communal collection box, traditionally used\n            for elections, Valeriu not only contributed to the campaign,\n            but also gave it its name. It became known as \u0091a penny for\n            my school.\u0092 Two years have passed since repairs were\n            completed, and the school is revitalized. Since additional\n            classrooms were built, all 310 students go to school in one\n            morning shift. Classrooms are bright and warm, yet heating\n            costs only $800 compared to $7,000 in previous winters, when\n            children were shivering in their coats. Funds were also used\n            to buy new school furniture and supplies, including new\n            textbooks. Moreover, the school has evolved into a true\n            community center whose different activities attract\n            inhabitants of all ages, including both Valeriu and his\n            grandmother, who is raising him."}, "docdt": "2003-11-04T00:00:00Z"}
