The operation\n            consists of a tried-and-proven type of project,\n            consequently, there are no radically new lessons that this\n            project experience can provide to practitioners,\n            researchers, and the international community. However, the\n            following elements would be noteworthy. 1) Coalition\n            building pays off - i.e., the Government's strong\n            commitment and donor support were uninterrupted, even\n            increased in spite of the political turmoil, and change of\n            government in 2001, delivering the highly satisfactory\n            outcome. 2) Good and well-balanced operations management was\n            key to effective implementation. While technically and\n            conceptually, the project featured no outstanding\n            innovation, what the project excelled in however, is that\n            all functions within its operation were very well\n            balanced-nothing was overdone, there were no noticeable weak\n            links in its organization and operation either, resulting in\n            high efficiency and effectiveness levels. 3) Strong focus on\n            building community-based organizations (CBOs) and their\n            networks is key to sustainable institutional development at\n            the community level. While this approach is already common\n            elsewhere among social investment funds (SIFs), it has\n            nonetheless been under-utilized in Europe and Central Asia\n            (ECA). But the project proved the validity of this approach,\n            through its active support to strengthening CBOs and their\n            networks, through the provision of information and resource centers."}, "docdt": "2005-05-23T00:00:00Z"}
