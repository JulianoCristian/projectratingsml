outcome\n            was moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: even with delays in adopting legal\n            frameworks, new agencies can be rendered functional and\n            accomplish much in support of sector results. Indeed, the\n            experience acquired during the initial years of their\n            functioning has served to enhance dialogue and consensus\n            among stakeholders and inform the fine-tuning of legislation\n            enabling these agencies\u2019 optimal performance. Strong\n            national ownership is critical to successful reform and its\n            impact on performance and outcomes. Ownership requires: (a)\n            national consensus on the reform purpose and components; (b)\n            respect and flexibility of the supporting development\n            partners; (c) a government-led change management process\n            supporting a process of learning and fine-tuning, continuous\n            dialogue and information dissemination across the range of\n            actors and stakeholders; and (d) a well-managed, patient and\n            deliberate briefing of new Administrators and high-level\n            managers. Synergistic action of a range of institutions\n            around the goal of school effectiveness and the quality of\n            teaching and learning can be achieved if factors are in\n            place: an evidence-based design; strong national consensus\n            and shared vision, precipitated by extensive stakeholder\n            involvement; clarity and complementarity of roles and\n            responsibilities for achieving a common goal; strong\n            capacity and effectiveness of each institution; public\n            recognition and reward of good performance; and strong\n            leadership and a change management approach that\n            accommodates learning-by-doing."}, "docdt": "2015-09-30T22:50:05Z"}
