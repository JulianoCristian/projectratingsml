Section 1: Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

Context at Appraisal

1.     Macro-economic factors. For over two decades prior to the 2008 global economic
slowdown, Jamaica’s small, open island economy had been stuck in a cycle of low growth and high
debt. Recurring natural disasters have exacerbated vulnerabilities of Jamaican households and the
economy as a whole. The poorest Jamaican households are disproportionately affected.

2.      Education Sector. Despite financial constraints caused by the debt, Jamaica had made
substantial progress in the education sector over the previous four decades. It enjoyed universal
enrolment of children at the early childhood and primary levels up to grade nine at the secondary
level. Remaining challenges included shortcomings in: teaching and learning quality; equitable
access; enrolment at the higher levels of the secondary system; and sector governance.

3.       In 2004 the GoJ commissioned a Task Force (TF) on Educational Reform to review and
address these challenges. Through a consultative process, the bi-partisan TF articulated a National
Shared Vision of enhanced quality, access, enrolment, participation, and sector accountability,
transparency and performance. To this end, it recommended a set of activities: upgrading school
infrastructure; upgrading the curriculum and improving teaching and learning; strengthening school
leadership and governance; strengthening community participation; and modernizing the Ministry
of Education, including the establishment of new specialized agencies. Endorsed by the Cabinet in
2008 as Jamaica’s National Education System Transformation Programme (ESTP), this package of
activities provided the basis for sector reform and development (Annex 8).

Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

4.       According to both the Legal Agreement (LA) (March 4, 2010) and the Project Appraisal
Document (PAD) (October 27, 2009), “The objective of the Project is to build the capacity of the
emerging key agencies (National Education Inspectorate/NEI, Jamaica Teaching Council/JTC, 1
Regional Education Authorities/REAs, and National Education Trust/NET) that are being
established to support the national Education System Transformation Programme (ESTP).” Success
was to be assessed using selected outcome indicators (Box 1-1).
 Box 1-1: Original Project Outcome Indicators
    School Improvement Act approved
    Legal identity conferred on new agencies
    Resources directly allocated to new agencies
    Percent of schools inspected have School Improvement Plans (SIPs) reflecting recommendations made in NEI
     school inspections and percent of schools inspected are implementing SIPs
    Percent of teachers meet professional standards for licensing
    NET is receiving financial and other resources from non-traditional sources
 Source: Project Appraisal Document, p. 5 (Main text) and Annex 3 (Results Framework); also listed: Annex 2 of ICR.

Revised PDO and Key Indicators and Reasons/Justifications

5.      The PDO was revised as a part of a Level 1 (Board-approved) restructuring in February
2012 to read as follows: “The objective of the Project is to build the capacity of the key agencies
																																																								
1	While	not	specified	in	the	PDO,	the	Project’s	support	to	the	building	of	JTC’s	capacity	includes	the	establishment	and	
strengthening	of	a	new	institution:	the	National	College	for	Education	Leadership	(NCEL),	responsible	for	delivering	
professional	development	programs	for	principals	and	other	school	leaders	under	the	umbrella	of	the	JTC.		This	intended	
outcome	is	captured	in	the	original	outcome	indicators,		DLTs,		and	intermediate	outcome	indicators	(Box	1‐1	&	Annex	2).		



                                                               1
established to support the national Education System Transformation Programme (ESTP).” The
restructuring (a) replaced the model of autonomous REAs with a new Department of School Services
(DSS), serving as the operational arm of the MoE in the regions; and (b) added the central MoE to
the list of institutions to be strengthened. This restructuring did not change key outcome targets or
indicators. The rationale for these changes was strong. The replacement of REAs with DSS at the
regional level was based on lessons of a pilot of REAs in two regions; 2 and the reform and
restructuring of central MoE were precipitated by the creation of the new DSS and supported ESTP’s
vision of a stronger policy function for MoE. Because the revised PDO involves an expansion of
the Project scope (specifically, the addition of central MoE), this ICR employs a split rating
methodology, evaluating performance against the original and revised PDOs. At the time of this
restructuring 31 percent of the funds had been disbursed.

6.       A Level 2 (Country Director-approved) March 2014 restructuring, undertaken when the
Project was 73 percent disbursed, retained the 2012 PDO, but revised the outcome indicators “… to
better measure the PDO” (Restructuring Paper, p. 2). Outcome indicators tracking the approval of
legislation and legal status of new agencies and resource allocation to these agencies were dropped,
the outcome indicator to track teachers meeting licensing requirements was replaced with a teacher
registration indicator, and an outcome indicator for central MoE was added. Two indicators (SIP
preparation and implementation) were consolidated and their targets were increased. This indicator
is particularly important because it reflects the strengthened capacity of several agencies supported
under the Project. Thus, a split rating is also undertaken for this restructuring. Revised PDO
indicators are presented in Box 1-2. Annex 2 details all changes to the PDO, scope and indicators
across the original and restructured Projects.

 Box 1-2: Revised Project Outcome Indicators under Level 2 Restructuring
    Percentage of schools inspected that prepare and implement SIPs reflecting recommendations made in NEI school
     inspections: 90 percent
    Percentage of Central Ministry positions filled based on functional profiles: 10 percent
    Percentage of teachers registered: 95 percent
    Percentage of school principals certified: 35 percent
    NET has provided project management services/oversight to at least 10 school construction projects

Main Beneficiaries

7.       School-age children were expected to benefit from improved teaching and learning quality
that these reforms were designed to effect. School principals, middle managers, teachers,
administrators and other school actors and stakeholders (parents, communities, board members,
others) were expected to benefit from the more efficient, well-coordinated and higher quality school
support services provided by new agencies: the NEI for assessing school performance; the JTC for
setting and enforcing teacher standards and professional development; NCEL for developing school
leadership of principals and other leaders; the DSS for supporting SIP design and implementation;
the MoE for evidence-based policy making and oversight; and NET for brokering private support
for schools and for managing construction and renovation works. Agency staff were to benefit from
capacity building enabling them to work more effectively.

restructuring, which replaced REAs with DSS and expanded Project scope to include central MoE.

 Box 1-3: Original and Revised Project Components
 Component 1. Enhanced Performance and Accountability
            1.1 National Education Inspectorate (NEI). The Project was to provide support to the NEI to establish a
 systematic inspection process and baseline data on school and student performance including: (a) establishment of an
 inspection management information system; (b) the training of inspectors; (c) the carrying out of baseline inspections
 (including the contracting of inspectors, inspection costs and publications); and (d) the organization of national
 consultation meetings on NEI mandates.
            1.2 Jamaica Teaching Council (JTC). Project support included: (a) the establishment and implementation
 of a licensing and registration system for teachers; (b) the training of teachers and JTC staff and their orientation in the
 licensing process and procedures; (c) review of the existing mentoring program; (c) professional development of JTC
 staff and college lecturers; (d) in-service teacher training in areas required for licensing; (e) publication of a journal
 describing best practices in teaching and school leadership; (e) development of a teacher management information
 system; and (f) establishment of programs for the National College for Education Leadership (NCEL).
            1.3 Regional Education Authorities (REAs). The Project aimed to support the setting up and
 operationalization of the REAs, including: (a) capacity building for School Improvement Officers and School Support
 Officers; (b) specialist training in areas to support children with special learning needs; (c) training of school boards to
 understand and carry out the mandates of the Education Act and other new legislation and MoE policies; and (d)
 equipment and software.
            This subcomponent was amended as follows under the 2012 restructuring: Support for the setting up and
 operationalization of the DSS and the CPM, including: (a) staff capacity building; (b) support to the CPM and the DSS
 for the transitioning of staff from the current structure to a modernized structure through welfare, change management
 and organizational development activities; (c) training and seminars for school boards to understand and carry out
 the mandates of the Education Act and other new legislation and MoE policies; (d) technical advisory services to assist
 the DSS and the CPM to perform their respective functions, including transitioning of the Media Services Unit into a
 new entity; and (e) equipment and software for the DSS and the CPM.
 Component 2. Mechanisms to Mobilize Resources for National Education Trust (NET)
            The Project was to support the establishment and operationalization of the NET, including: (a) training for
 NET and other relevant staff in the implementation of public-private partnerships (PPPs); and (b) a marketing campaign
 to mobilize resources for the NET.
 Component 3. Communications, Project Management and Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)
            The Project was to support a communications strategy to raise public awareness and seek support for the
 ESTP, including: (a) public meetings on the ESTP across the island for all interested citizens; (b) stakeholder
 consultations for the new education agencies; (c) internal meetings on the human resource policy for the MoE staff;
 and (d) media campaigns. Support to the CMU in its oversight of the ESTP was to include: (a) Project M&E (b) the
 hiring of staff and consultants; (c) audits; (d) training, equipment, materials; and (e) other operating costs.

Other Significant Changes (if applicable)

9.      Over and above the revision of the PDO in February 2012 and the revisions to the outcome
indicators in March 2014, the 2014 restructuring also: (a) dropped one Disbursement Linked Target
(DLT) (“Licensing system fully established by JTC”) and replaced it with another (“At least 20,000
teachers registered by the JTC.”); and (b) extended the original closing date by one year (from March
31, 2014 to March 31, 2015) to allow sufficient time for: installation of NEI’s software;
disbursement of the remaining funds; and the full achievement of objectives.

Section 2: Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

10.     Soundness of Background Analysis. The above-cited TF undertook a rigorous, evidence-
based review of sector performance and a detailed study of international good practice and
appropriately identified the main obstacles to education quality and outcomes, most notably issues
associated with: teaching quality; curriculum; access to quality places in school; and overly


                                                             3
centralized management. The analysis took into good consideration GoJ’s vision for public sector
modernization, which contributed to the focus, selectivity and strategic nature of the reform.

11.      The Bank’s involvement was intended to complement the solid analysis of issues and broad
ownership of the ESTP with the Bank’s international experience and strategic support. Over and
above its financial support, the Bank was asked to contribute its experience in: school inspection
and accreditation, teacher regulation and professional development, devolution of responsibilities
from central to middle- and frontline-levels of the system, and public sector reform. Its financial
management and public private partnership (PPP) expertise was also expected to support the
establishment of the NET.

12.     Assessment of Project Design. The Project was well designed with appropriate objectives
and a clear causal chain of inputs, outputs and intermediate outcomes, which could be plausibly
linked to the expected outcomes (Section 3). It focused on a specific subset of the ESTP agenda –
the strengthening of selected new institutions for which the Bank was considered to have a
comparative advantage. It was complementary to IDB’s support of the ESTP, which focused on:
school infrastructure; curriculum development; and support to two new institutions.3 The design
incorporated lessons that proved to be critical to the Project’s success: the potential of results-based
financing in Jamaica; the importance of selectivity and prioritization in light of limited fiscal space;
and the importance of stakeholder ownership. Project coordination/management was appropriately
placed with the Change Management Unit (CMU), responsible for management and oversight of the
ESTP and reporting to the Permanent Secretary of MoE. The CMU’s Project responsibilities
included: procurement, fiduciary reporting, annual work programming, M&E, and the coordination
of development partners supporting ESTP. A Programme Management Steering Committee was
to monitor and oversee ESTP at the policy level and meet quarterly to keep MoE apprised and to
ensure adherence to relevant policies, procedures, timelines and budgets.

13.      The bulk of Project funds (US$14.9 million of the US$16.0 million loan) were to be
disbursed twice annually and transferred by MoFP to a designated account to be administered by the
CMU. These funds would finance eligible expenditures critical for achieving Project objectives,
articulated in the annual work program by eligible budget lines.4 The remaining amount was to be
paid directly for large procurement packages (technical assistance, software for NEI). The
advantages of this design were unequivocally proven during implementation, but increasingly acute
fiscal constraints in the last year of the Project slowed disbursements.

14.     Adequacy of the Government’s Commitment. Commitment was high during preparation,
with strong, bi-partisan and stakeholder consensus on the issues identified and on the reform
program. Relevant policies and strategies were – and continue to be – in place. Government
commitment is also evident in the resources it made available to support ESTP implementation, even
within the overall fiscal constraints (Annex 1, Table d).

15.     Risk Assessment and Mitigation. The overall risk rating was moderate, reflecting a solid
assessment of Project risks: anxieties and resistance to change; delays in legislation and their effect
on new agencies’ autonomy and effectiveness; availability of quality staff for key positions; delayed
disbursements if DLTs are not met; and delays in procurement and their consequences. Mitigation

4	The May advances were to be disbursed against planned expenditures in the eligible budget lines; and the November advances were
to be disbursed against expenditures and the attainment of DLTs. Ranging between US$3-4 million per year, these advances were
expected to cover funding requirements for Project activities agreed during appraisal. Eligible expenditures included five budget sub-
objects for the NEI, JTC/NCEL, REAs/DSS, NET and the CMU.	



                                                                  4
measures were effective, including: proactive change management and a broad communications
strategy; hiring of a legal expert and reliance on current legislation to allow NEI to inspect and JTC
to start professional development and licensing preparation; technical assistance; realistic DLTs;
and proactive procurement and financial management support.

Major Factors Affecting Implementation

16.      One factor affecting implementation, which was outside of Government or the CMU’s
control, was the global economic crisis and its impact on Jamaica’s economy and financial situation.
In short, under an IMF program launched in 2013,5 GoJ committed to the reduction of its heavy
debt, including refraining from incurring any new debt. This impacted Project disbursements, which
were curtailed by strict budget ceilings established for each sector. The IMF program also limited
NET’s activities. While NET was slated to engage in PPP procurement to finance school
infrastructure, MoFP asserted that this was no longer possible because it would be considered as
new debt. Thus, until GoJ’s debt is under control, NET’s PPP activities are limited to the
mobilization of private support (grants or in-kind) to meet schools’ infrastructure and material needs.

17.     Two factors were subject to Government control. First, a delay in finalizing the JTC Bill
and its passage by Parliament did delay the authorization of the JTC to license teachers. GoJ’s
decision not to rush this Bill and, instead, to allow the continuation of discussions and negotiations
with the stakeholders was strategic. Negotiations culminated in amendments to the Bill, which
represent a reasonable compromise and are likely to have secured the trust and buy-in of key
stakeholders. Moreover, this delay did not impede the achievement of JTC outcome indicators
(paras. 43-44 and Table 3-2). The Education Minister has committed to tabling this Bill with
Parliament before end-June 2015; and the JTC is fully prepared to execute its licensing function as
soon as it is authorized. The Bank’s decision to drop the DLT on JTC licensing was supportive of
GoJ’s decision. Second, even after the 2011 change in Government, national support for the ESTP
was unwavering, thanks to the deliberately bi-partisan composition of the TF, which assessed sector
issues and articulated the reform agenda.

18.     Two factors were within the control of the CMU. First, capacity building of MoE and DSS
were delayed. Originally focused on REAs, Project support was expanded to support central MoE,
especially its policy function, and DSS as its operational arm. The lessons from a pilot of the REAs
pointed to the potential benefits of an operational arm of MoE in the regions rather than an
autonomous agency. The pilot was well worth the time, even though the redesign of MoE support
required time and additional organizational development assistance. MoE took the time to apply the
lessons and to do the work right, rather than to rush implementation. The redesign was consultative,
thorough and technically sound and bodes well for a well-functioning MoE and DSS. Second, in
the face of low morale, caused by delays and uncertainties in MoE restructuring, the CMU stepped
up its outreach and communication. This has culminated in a well-informed, well-prepared, and
well-supported staff, committed and ready to take on new responsibilities under the reform. Efforts
are ongoing to continue engaging and supporting them as the transition unfolds.

Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization


																																																								
5
  In May 2013, GoJ embarked on a comprehensive and ambitious program of fiscal adjustment and structural changes for which it has
garnered national and international support; and it is performing well under an IMF Extended Fund Facility (SDR 615.4 million
covering April 2013 – March 2017). In complement, the World Bank and the IDB are coordinating their assistance around a range of
key structural and institutional reforms to support and nurture growth and competitiveness, strengthening of social protection, public
sector management and resilience.



                                                                  5
19.      Design. The CMU was designated to oversee Project M&E, which was to be carried out in
part by MoE’s M&E unit and in part by external consultants. Design envisaged a combination of:
(a) process and technical evaluations to assess the effectiveness of new agencies as they took up
their responsibilities; and (b) mid-term and end-of-Project summative evaluations. This approach
was very appropriate for an institutional reform Project, ensuring the opportunity to learn and fine-
tune functions and effectiveness throughout implementation. The involvement of MoE’s M&E unit
created an important synergy in capacity building and capacity utilization and was highly supportive
of ESTP accountability and transparency goals.         Direct support to M&E capacity building
reinforced the Project’s design.

20.       Original outcome indicators tracking the passage of legislation and the direct allocation of
budgetary resources are responsive to UNDP Capacity Assessment Methodology (UNDP, 2007),
which notes legal frameworks and financial resources to be critical measures of strengthened
capacity. These indicators were dropped under the 2014 restructuring, because they were assessed
not to be good measures of the PDO (Restructuring Paper, March 25, 2014, p. 4). But public sector
management literature and experts in the Bank corroborate their legitimacy as viable measures of
strengthened capacity. In retrospect, the finalization/submission to Parliament of the legal
framework (instead of the passage of legislation) is a more appropriate benchmark, because it falls
within the purview of the project. An original outcome indicator tracking SIP preparation and
implementation, consolidated under the 2014 restructuring, is also responsive to UNDP Capacity
Assessment criteria measuring mutual accountability mechanisms and public engagement. Two
other original indicators, dropped and replaced during the 2014 restructuring, are found by this ICR
still to be viable indicators: teachers meeting professional standards for licensing; and NET receiving
financial and other resources from non-traditional sources. In fact, this ICR finds that all indicators
(dropped, added and retained) together provide good, complementary measures of capacity built
covering still other capacity measures advocated by UNDP: human resources and leadership. The
DLTs were well chosen and strategic, setting out benchmarks likely to ensure PDO achievement
important for a reform-based operation. The one exception is the DLT to fully establish JTC’s
licensing system, dropped in 2014, because of its dependence on the passage of JTC legislation.

21.      Implementation. Mid-term and end-of-Project summative evaluations were undertaken, as
planned. More process and technical evaluations of various aspects of reform implementation were
undertaken than planned, providing feedback and recommendations for improved operations of new
agencies. They include: several evaluations of NEI; an evaluation of QECs; evaluations of
curriculum reform and implementation; evaluations of NCEL principals’ training; an evaluation of
Proficiency Pathway (special education); evaluations of the National Literacy Programme and the
National Comprehensive Numeracy Programme. The CMU and the Bank were proactive in
regularly tracking outcome and intermediate outcome indicators and DLTs. Another strong feature
of M&E is the ongoing development of results frameworks for the various agencies. Results Matrix
Operational Manuals have been created for NCEL and NET and are planned for the other agencies,
as well. In addition, a School Improvement Planning Manual has been prepared, which provides for
an annual evaluation of plan implementation, including an annual evaluation matrix with MoE
objectives, school goals, targets and indicators. The new Performance Management and
Accountability System (PMAS), under implementation since April 2014, aligns national goals to
staff goals, strengthening the focus on results and accountability. While the PDO was amended in
February 2012 to add central MoE to the institutions to be strengthened, a relevant outcome indicator
was only added in 2014. This being said, the 2012 restructuring did include an intermediate outcome
indicator for central MoE (Annex 2, Table 2b). The	2014	restructuring	raised	a	critical	outcome	
target	 value	 (tracking	 SIP	 preparation	 and	 implementation)	 reflecting	 good	 progress	 and	
resetting	the	bar	for	higher	achievement.		There	were	some	shortcomings	in	the	restructuring	
of	outcome	indicators:	(a)	the	indicator	tracking	the	passage	of	a	sound	legal	framework	by	


                                                  6
Parliament	 might	 have	 been	 modified	 to	 track	 its	 finalization/submission	 to	 Parliament,	
rather	 than	 dropped;	 (b)	 the	 new	 outcome	 indicators	 for	 measuring	 JTC	 and	 NET	 capacity	
were	legitimate,	but	might	have	been	added	to,	rather	than	replaced	with,	the	original	ones,	as	
they	 were	 complementary	 measures.	 The	 lowering	 of	 some	 intermediate	 outcome	 targets	
under	the	2014	restructuring	was	precipitated	by	the	IMF	2013‐17	debt	reduction	program,	
which	constrained	project	disbursements	(para.	16)	and	ignited	the	concern	that	original	ones	
may	not	be	achieved.		

22.     Utilization. The ICR mission collected compelling evidence from agencies/initiatives
evaluated about the utility of the evaluations and their implementation of evaluation
recommendations for fine-tuning their performance. The close monitoring of DLTs and Project
indicators, combined with the use of M&E tools developed under the Project, have translated MoE’s
commitment to be more results-based into practice.

Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

23.          Safeguards. No safeguards were triggered by the Project.

24.    Procurement. Sound assessments of the country procurement system and the capacity of
the CMU to implement Project procurement were carried out by the Bank during preparation.
Appropriate recommendations for mitigating the procurement risks were identified and agreed.

25.     Performance was somewhat weak initially, but quickly improved. By 2012-13 procurement
complied with agreed arrangements, but with some delays. Procurement of NEI software was
delayed when, following a change in Government, it became necessary to await the establishment
of a new cabinet to secure its clearance of the awarded contract. By the time the new Government
was ready to sign its approval, the process had to be restarted and the successful bidder was no
longer interested. In the end, the second evaluation process culminated in the award of the contract
to another well-qualified bidder at a lower price. In 2014 additional staff were hired to ensure timely
completion of multiple procurements, emanating from the combined financing of Government and
other development partners, in addition to the Bank. By end-2014 all major procurement activities
had been completed.

26.      Financial Management. A capacity assessment concluded that MoE’s actions to ensure
sound financial management for the Project satisfied the Bank’s minimum requirements under
OP/BP 10.02. Arrangements were spelled out in the PAD, including: roles and responsibilities,
accounting system, management procedures, reporting and monitoring, flow of funds,
internal/external audits, disbursement arrangements, and retroactive financing.6

27.     Arrangements proved to be acceptable and performance was satisfactory, thanks to a good
system and experienced FM staff. None of the audit reports on the Project was qualified.

Post-Completion Operation/Next Phase

28.     While no follow-on World Bank project is envisaged, the sustainability of this Project – and
of the ESTP more broadly speaking – is well assured. The legal framework for the new agencies
and for the newly structured MoE has been prepared and is ready for submission to Cabinet and to

  The Bank agreed to GoJ’s request that US$0.5 million be retroactively financed, covering eligible Project expenditures incurred up
to 12 months before the expected date of effectiveness, based on expenditure reports of the eligible budget items.



                                                                 7
Parliament for approval.7 Despite budget constraints, all new agencies have a budget line and have
been receiving funds from Government for their operations.

29.       The strong, broad-based support for the NESP, which underpins the elements of the ESTP,
coupled with the availability and interest of other partners to support it, bodes well for the transition
arrangement to post-completion of the Project. The newly created agencies have already shown
their worth to the population at large and are likely to maintain, if not attract more, financial and
other support (Section 3). NCEL and NET have already proven their ability to generate additional
resources. Because the DSS was established late in the Project, it will be critical to nurture and
oversee its full operationalization and fine-tuning. Job descriptions, capacity building, transitioning
staff to the new structures and functions and a new performance management accountability system
should, together, make important headway in ensuring adequate staffing and the quality of staff.
With Bank technical support NCEL is (a) documenting the link between principals’ leadership and
school performance; and (b) undertaking a south-south knowledge exchange with a small grant
secured by the Bank.

Section 3: Assessment of Outcomes

Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

30.      Relevance of Objectives: High for the original and revised PDOs. The Project is highly
relevant to the country’s needs and development objectives (Annex 8) and to the Bank’s education
strategy and substantially relevant to the current Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). It is directly
supportive of MoE’s ESTP goals to: (1) improve the quality of teaching and learning, especially
through strengthening the qualifications of professional educators and the physical learning
environment; (2) improve sector governance through enhanced sector accountability, transparency
and performance and the creation of a modernized, more efficient organizational structure for MoE;
and (3) enhance stakeholder participation, especially at the school level. The Project supports
components of Jamaica’s National Development Plan/Vision 2030, issued in 2009, which aim to:
improve the learning environment; promote and use education system standards, focused on results;
and develop partnerships with private sector, parents and communities to create quality schools. It
is also consistent with the National Education Strategic Plan’s (NESP 2011-2020) emphasis on
quality, accountability, transparency and performance.

31.      The Project is also highly relevant to the Bank’s Education Strategy 2020: Learning for All
(World Bank, 2011), which supports education system reform at the country level, insisting on
accountability for results. The Project was fully relevant to the Country Assistance Strategy at the
time of design, particularly its sub-pillar to strengthen human capacity. Because of Jamaica’s critical
fiscal situation, the current CPS (2014-2017) rightly prioritizes conditions for sustained and
inclusive growth: (i) public sector modernization; (ii) private sector growth; and (iii) social and

																																																								
7	At the time of the ICR mission: (1) a Cabinet submission and supporting framework document establishing NEI as an executive agency
in transition was awaiting the Minister’s signature for presentation to Cabinet; (2) the Parliament approval of the Jamaica Teaching
Council Act, providing a permanent legal status for the JTC was expected by end-2015; and (3) the MoE was drafting a Cabinet
submission proposing amendments to the Education Act and Regulations following a review by the National Council on Education (NCE)
(an advisory body to the Minister with broad-based civil society representation). Amendments take into account the various reforms being
pursued under the ESTP ensuring their coherence and consistency and incorporating experience gained and refinements during Project
implementation. This work benefited from legal assistance financed by the Project. In addition, a School Improvement and Special
Measures paper, based on school consultations in all seven regions, is set to be tabled in Parliament to make provisions for: (a) prescribed
national standards and performance measures for primary and secondary education; (b) the School Improvement Planning Process and
the DSS role in supporting that process; and (c) “special measures” allowing direct intervention and support by DSS in the administration,
management and operation of public schools failing to meet prescribed performance criteria and deemed unable to turn around
performance on their own.



                                                                    8
climate resilience. The Project is substantially relevant to (i) and (iii). MoFP and the Planning
Institute of Jamaica have cited education sector reform as a model to follow in modernizing the rest
of GoJ’s public sector. The focus on schools, as a locus of community involvement and vehicle for
producing capable human capital, is a critical input to social resilience.

32.      Relevance of Design: Substantial for the original and the restructured Projects. The
original Project was well designed. Components were well placed to support achievement of
intermediate outcomes, which, in turn were essential for achieving the PDO. The training and
certification of inspectors, the development of inspection guidelines and protocols, and the
establishment of an inspection information system were critical for strengthening NEI and enabling
it to: carry out good quality inspections, discuss and disseminate them at the school level and
nationally, provide the evidence base for SIPs and for further strengthening overall school
performance and for reporting to Parliament school-level performance and results. This capacity,
in turn, contributes to ESTP objectives of improved sector performance, accountability, and
transparency. The development of more and higher-quality in-service training and mentorship
programs within the JTC and the establishment of professional standards, combined with the
establishment of a teacher registration system were important outputs for the registration and initial
licensing of teachers and for ensuring their ongoing professional development, necessary for
maintaining their licenses. The establishment and operation of Quality Education Circles, supported
jointly by JTC and regional-level education staff, are also pivotal for professional development of
teachers to meet licensing requirements. And the establishment and strengthening of regional-level
capacity is critical to the provision of support and oversight of SIP preparation, implementation and
M&E. The development of evidence-based leadership courses for principals and other education
leaders enabled NCEL to train and certify principals and other school leaders, who, in turn, are better
placed to develop and manage SIPs, contributing to ESTP objectives of school-based accountability
and quality of teaching and learning. The development of an agency (NET) tasked with the
mobilization of private sector contributions is critical for harnessing private sector potential to
improve schools’ learning environment and supportive of ESTP’s quality goal.

33.      Beyond the more obvious elements of an institutional reform project (training, systems
development, technical assistance), the Project also included support that many reform projects tend
to miss: an M&E plan that envisages process evaluations for early feedback and fine-tuning of new
agencies’ performance and effectiveness; legal assistance to monitor and support legal reform
underlying the new institutions and structures; pilot testing of REAs to accommodate learning before
scaling up; a broad-based communications effort to engage all stakeholders and sustain their interest
and support. The DLTs (Annex 2, Table 2.c) were a strong design feature because they: (a)
supported a results focus that the country was already evolving towards; and (b) were well-chosen
benchmarks that helped to keep the reform steps clear and on track. (In the Project’s later years
GoJ’s ceiling on the education budget, precipitated by fiscal constraints and the 2013-17 IMF
program to reduce debt, slowed disbursements. But this would have happened with or without the
DLT design.) The design is cognizant of capacity building definitions and results chains rooted in
institutional economics literature, emphasizing local buy-in, socio-political and organizational
factors and learning-by-doing as crucial to successful reform (WBI 2006).

34.       The 2012 restructuring made the design even stronger. Addition of central MoE, including
its operational arm (DSS), to the institutions being strengthened enhanced MoE’s potential to assume
its evolved role of policy and oversight. The revised component included support for transitioning
staff to the modernized structure, which was pivotal in the project’s success, including: staff outreach
and support, organizational development support to revise functions and job descriptions,
preparation of operational manuals to document new roles, responsibilities and procedures, and a
PMAS to underpin and clarify accountability for results. These additions were highly supportive of


                                                  9
  MoE’s vision to separate policy and operational functions and of ESTP’s objectives of transparency,
  accountability and performance.

  Achievement of Project Development Objectives

  35.      Efficacy: Substantial for the original and restructured Projects. Achievement of the
  PDO (capacity building of the targeted institutions) is summarized in Table 3-1 and assessed in
  this section. Subratings and underlying analysis are based on: (a) achievement of relevant Project
  outcome indicators; (b) agencies’ demonstrated capacity to fulfill their mandates; and (c) their
  contribution to relevant ESTP goals (outlined in para. 30 and detailed in Annex 8). Outputs
  supporting these outcomes are briefly summarized in the text below and detailed in Annex 3.

  36.     Overall Outcome. In fulfillment of the original PDO, the Project substantially built
  capacities of the newly established NEI, JTC/NCEL and NET, which are fulfilling their
  respective mandates and contributing to ESTP goals. It also built regional capacity, against an
  evolving organizational context, abandoning the original goal to strengthen REAs in favor of the
  creation and strengthening of DSS. In fulfillment of the restructured PDO, essentially adding
  central MoE to the institutions targeted for support, the Project substantially strengthened central
  MoE capacity as well as that of the DSS, enhancing contribution to ESTP goals.

  37.      Impact. These institutions are united and synergistic in their focus on school
  effectiveness. NEI’s school inspections effectively support accountability, transparency and
  performance, providing the evidence base and the framework for the development,
  implementation, M&E of SIPs by a range of stakeholders at the school level and the transparent
  dissemination of results. DSS support schools in the design and implementation of their SIPs;
  and facilitate QECs to foster continued learning and improvement of teachers, helping them meet
  new licensing standards (para. 43). Central MoE has evolved towards evidence-based policy-
  making and enforcement. JTC’s teacher professional development programs and NCEL’s training
  programs for school leaders address issues identified in NEI reports and MoE’s M&E studies and
  research. In its efforts to mobilize and allocate resources to schools most in need, NET support
  relies on NEI assessments of infrastructure and material needs and on MoE school information
  data systems to improve the quality of inputs critical for improved teaching and learning.

  Strengthened Capacity of NEI, DSS and NCEL

  38.     Outcome 1: In direct support of ESTP’s goal to improve sector accountability,
  transparency, and performance and to achieve greater school-level participation, NEI, DSS
  and NCEL have supported the establishment and functioning of the school improvement plan
  (SIP) process, prompting schools to identify and address their weaknesses and to monitor and
  evaluate their performance. Ninety percent of schools inspected have prepared and are
  implementing SIPs, which reflect recommendations made in NEI school inspections, fully
  achieving the (90 percent) target set in 2014, and exceeding the original targets of 75 percent of
  inspected schools having SIPs and 60 percent of all schools implementing SIPs. Instrumental in
  the achievement of this outcome was the Project’s success in building the capacity of NEI, which
  undertakes school inspections, of the DSS, which provides schools with technical support and
  advice in the preparation, monitoring and evaluation of SIPs and of NCEL, which trains
  principals in school leadership and improvement. Relevant NEI and DSS intermediate outcomes
  and outputs are itemized below. Those of NCEL are grouped under Outcome 3.

   39.     Contributing NEI Intermediate Outcomes. Established in 2008, NEI completed a
   baseline inspection of every public school (953 primary and secondary level schools) and, in


                                                                 11
addition, four juvenile detention centers, one adult correctional facility and one special education
school for a total of 959 inspections. These achievements were enabled by the achievement of
interim targets set under the DLTs (Annex 2, Table 2.c). MoE evaluations provide ample evidence
of the high quality and rigor of these inspections; 8 and document the sound execution of the
inspection process, noting schools’ appreciation of recommendations, which are taken seriously.
The most recent evaluation (MoE, 2014) documents schools’ responses to NEI recommendations
on a range of topics, including: leadership and governance; safety and security; teaching and
learning; and student performance. Corroborating these reports are hundreds of post-inspection
letters to NEI expressing schools’ appreciation for the process, which they consider to be supportive
and facilitating of learning and improvement. Inspections are proving to be an effective instrument
of accountability, providing the evidence base and framework for SIPs and for the prioritization of
activities. They promote transparency through a highly participatory inspection and feedback
process encompassing a range of stakeholders and a broad dissemination of results through the
media and the publication of reports: to date 91 percent of inspection reports have been published,
almost achieving the original target of 95 percent and exceeding the revised target of 90 percent.
In addition, six Chief Inspector’s Reports were tabled in Parliament. This enhanced accountability
and transparency are likely to be sustained with regular periodic inspections of schools and the
public dissemination of progress against the baseline.

40.      Contributing NEI Outputs. Some 357 inspectors were trained (achieving the original
target of 350, exceeding the revised target of 290), many working part-time on a contractual basis,
along with 80 inspection team leaders. Many are based in regions, lowering the costs. To date 100
inspectors have been certified, with more in line for certification. 9 Other outputs include:
inspection handbooks; an inspection management information system; and performance profiles
for all public schools, created from inspection baselines. NEI also forged school improvement
collaborations with other parts of MoE.10

41.     Contributing DSS? Intermediate Outcomes. The creation and capacity building of the
DSS has provided MoE with an operational arm in the regions devoted to the technical oversight
and support of schools, with a particular focus on the SIP process.11 12 Regular school supervision
centers on school improvement, providing quality, structured guidance for monitoring the SIP
process and using outcomes to fine-tune school performance.

42.     Contributing DDS Outputs. Relevant outputs include: a School Improvement Planning
Manual;13 training of school improvement officers in all seven regions on the SIP process, meeting
the objective of covering all seven regions; stakeholder outreach; and the training of 3,461 school
board members, far exceeding the target to train 1,500 board chairpersons.

43.      Outcome 2. Thanks to enhanced capacity of the JTC and DSS achieved under the
Project, Jamaica’s education sector now benefits from a more systematic regulation of the
quality of the teaching profession and an increase in the proportion of teachers meeting
professional standards for licensing. This contributes directly to ESTP’s goal to improve the
quality of teaching and learning. A critical tool of teacher regulation is the full registration of all
practicing teachers in Jamaica’s public school system. Ninety-five percent of teachers (28,585
teachers) in Jamaica are registered, up from a baseline of none at the Project’s outset. This
represents full achievement of the intermediate outcome target (95 percent) under the original
Project design, which was elevated to an outcome target under Level 2 restructuring.14 Interim
targets established under the DLTs (Annex 2, Table 2.c) facilitated this achievement. A campaign
for full registration before end-2015 is underway. Fifty-two percent of public school teachers
currently meet new professional standards for licensing, fully achieving the (original, dropped)
target of at least 50 percent, a result of JTC and DSS training activities.

44.      Contributing JTC and DSS Intermediate Outcomes. JTC’s regulatory function,
strengthened under the Project, relies on the registration database to monitor and ensure that: the
baseline qualifications of teachers meet established criteria and standards; standards and
professionalism are continually adhered to; and skills are periodically updated and improved. JTC
is technically prepared to take on its licensing function, but is not authorized to do so until its legal
framework (Jamaica Teaching Council Act) is approved by Parliament (expected by end of this
Legislative year –ending March 2016). This delay did not impede the full achievement of JTC
outcome targets. JTC’s professional development function, also strengthened under the Project,
supports teachers in meeting professional standards for licensing and provides continuing education
to ensure eligibility for relicensing. JTC regularly delivers in-service training on the basis of
training needs identified by NEI to enhance teaching capacity. Some of this training is delivered
through the 63 QECs (exceeding the original target of 60, achieving the revised target of 63), which
facilitate teacher learning and exchange, in collaboration with the DSS. Ninety percent of the
teaching cohort has been trained through these mechanisms almost achieving the original target of
95 percent and exceeding the revised target of 85 percent; and 18 master teachers have been
certified with 22 additional applications under review. A well-functioning JTC Advisory Body to
the Minister15 ensures the quality and evidence base of JTC activities.

45.     Contributing JTC and DSS Outputs. Outputs include: a teacher management
information system supporting registration, licensing and reporting; a licensing framework and
system; Operational Guidelines and Standard Operating Procedures; professional standards for
categories of educators; publication of a JTC Journal; evidence-based policy advice to MoE;
mentorship programs for new and re-entering teachers and those with professional development
needs;16 and in-service training of over 10,000 teachers, increasing annual coverage from a baseline
of 1000 to 3,000 at the Project’s end. An operational framework and equipment for 63 Teacher
Resource Centers for the 63 newly established QECs were provided through the DSS.

46.     Outcome 3. In direct support of ESTP goals of improved	 quality	 of	 teaching	 and	
learning	and	improved	sector	governance, NCEL has strengthened school leaders’ capacity,
culminating in improved school governance and leadership. NCEL has certified 49 percent of
primary and secondary school principals, exceeding the target of 35 percent, set in 2014. MoE’s
process evaluations document that certification of principals has had a direct impact on school
performance and governance. The original measure of NCEL’s capacity, shared with NEI and DSS
(SIP preparation and implementation), was also exceeded (Table 3-1 and para. 38).

47.      Contributing NCEL Intermediate Outcomes. Established in 2011 under the ESTP,
NCEL has effectively fulfilled its mandate, responding to the need for strengthened educational
leadership identified by the 2004 TF. Principal certification is based on NCEL’s classroom training,
followed by successful school-based projects designed by principals for their own schools,
rigorously monitored and validated by NCEL, and responding to NEI findings and
recommendations for SIPs. 17 NCEL has trained 613 principals (exceeding original and revised
targets of 15 and 500).18 Strong evidence of the high quality of NCEL’s courses points to NCEL’s
significant technical and operational capacity, acquired over a short timeframe.19

48.     Contributing NCEL Outputs. All NCEL-related DLTs were achieved.20 Five training
courses were designed and delivered: (1) Effective Principals’ Training Program (613 participants);
(2) Aspiring Principals’ Programme, with University of the West Indies (157 participants); (3)
System and School Leaders’ Coaching Programme (31 participants); (4) Leadership of Math
Programme for Heads of Math Departments (911 participants); (5) Mind Set Change for
Information and Communications Technology Leadership (70 participants); and (6) Leadership of
Place for Schools in Volatile Communities (30 principals). NCEL also awards school leaders for
excellence. An NCEL Results Matrix Operational Manual outlines outcomes and related indicators
to support results orientation, transparency and accountability.

Strengthened Capacity of NET

49.      Outcome 4. In support of ESTP goals to improve the quality of teaching and learning,
NET has contributed to improvements in the physical learning environment of schools through:
(a) the generation of substantial private sector support from non-traditional sources for school
infrastructure and learning materials; and (b) the successful oversight of school construction
projects. As of June 30, 2015, NET’s involvement in private partnerships and endowments has

                                                                14
generated an estimated value of US$0.76 million in private support to schools.21 No target amount
was ever set for the (original, dropped) resource mobilization outcome indicator. Among its
contributions to date, NET has brokered: a low-cost source of power (for one high school); 40 copy
machines; furniture (for 67 schools); books and education material (for four basic schools); 10
computers to (for one all-age school); school supplies and a water pump (for one school). To date
NET has provided project management and oversight services to 19 school construction projects,
far exceeding the target of 10 schools set in 2014.

50.      Contributing NET Intermediate Outcomes. NET implements its dual mandate: to
mobilize and coordinate private support to education; and to act as the executing agent for education
infrastructure projects. It serves as a broker of supply of private support to schools, on the one hand,
and of schools’ demand and need for such support, on the other. While it has mobilized substantial
funds from non-traditional sources, it was constrained in brokering private investments through
PPPs, as originally envisaged under the design.22 NET also manages and oversees the construction
and rehabilitation works of schools on behalf of MoE. Its operating structure, legal framework and
financial system, enabling it to receive gifts, are established.

51.      Contributing NET Outputs. All NET-related DLTs were achieved. 23 Other outputs
include: a business plan, functional profile and framework document; job descriptions; creation of
a website, domain name (NET.org.jm) and new staff e-mail (net.org.jm) for enhanced exposure and
identity; a Results Matrix Operational Manual; governance and financial tracking frameworks with
competencies; acquisition of a grant management software; a marketing and public relations
campaign to promote and position the NET identity and logo; and training of staff in PPP.

Strengthened Capacity of MoE

52.      Outcome 5. Over and above the successful delegation of selected MoE functions to
newly established and strengthened agencies (NEI, DSS, JTC, NCEL), the Project also achieved
the separation of the MoE’s policy function from its operations function, supporting ESTP’s
intermediate outcome of modernizing MoE and its goals of accountability, transparency and
performance. According to UNDP Capacity Assessment Methodology (UNDP, 2007), two critical
indicators of strengthened capacity are legal frameworks and financial resources. (These were
actually indicators under the original design, dropped during the 2014 restructuring.) The adoption
of legal identities for the new institutions and the passage of a School Improvement Act are well
advanced and expected to be approved by Parliament before end-2015. Both NEI and JTC operated
under the aegis of MoE/ESTP during implementation, under the existing Education Act. NET was
incorporated as a Government company in December 2010. While developed more slowly than
anticipated, the legal framework for reform is of high quality: its content is well grounded in the
actual functioning of these institutions over the past few years, reflective of stakeholders’ inputs,
and more comprehensive in scope; and it benefited from legal expertise financed under the project.
Other outcomes include the routine and specific reflection in Jamaica’s public budget of resources
for each of the new institutions and the filling of 20 percent of central MoE positions based on new
functional profiles, exceeding the 10 percent target.

53.      Central MoE Intermediate Outcomes. Under its new structure, and in complement to
the DSS operational role, MoE formulates and enforces sector policies, technical standards and
operational norms; monitors and evaluates associated agencies to hold them to account and ensure
that desired policy objectives and targets are achieved; and performs corporate management
functions that support policy-making and oversight. Already central MoE has evolved into an
evidence-based policy-making body. Project support has already culminated in strengthened
capacity in: communication and public relations and stakeholder involvement; 24 quality
assurance; 25 and evidence-based policy-making and performance management (para. 55).
Information pervades all aspects of the strategic management cycle. The full assumption of new
roles and responsibilities is ongoing, to be completed before end-2015. Some 463 central and DSS
staff were trained to this end, in complement to SIP training of DSS staff (para. 42). The sound
legal framework that pulls together all elements of the institutional and sector reform into one
cohesive package, now before Parliament, is an outcome of intensive project support (the financing
of local legal expertise and of activities to reach out to and involve relevant stakeholders in its
articulation and finalization).

54.     Outputs. Outputs include: Operational Manuals documenting procedures for central MoE
functions;26 fellowships for 180 staff in a range of relevant disciplines;27 updated data on all public
schools, used to improve facility use;28 an institutional analysis of schools and the development of
a school management system;29 and decisions/actions taken by MoFP to allocate resources to the
new agencies.

55.      A business process re-engineering study helped to finalize MoE structure and new job
descriptions. For central MoE: 366 job descriptions were prepared on the pre-reform structure to
provide an output-focused baseline; and 404 job descriptions were prepared for the new structure.
Thirty-six DDS job descriptions were prepared as of March 2015, with the remaining 160 to be
finalized on the basis of the study. Of 176 job descriptions for the newly established agencies, 151
have been prepared, the others to be finalized upon decisions about sharing core services.30 A human
resources policy ensures fairness of staff transfers to new jobs, outlining staff rights, an appeals
process, and resource persons for advice and support. Human resource management software was
acquired, modified and is now under implementation. A Performance Management and
Accountability System (PMAS) has been under implementation since April 2014. Its alignment of
performance criteria with national goals reflects a strong focus on results and accountability. A new
management information system standardizes, connects and automates various systems and
procedures within MoE. Also financed were wireless infrastructure and electronic networking
linking regional and central offices. M&E has also been strengthened and is heavily relied upon to
support both accountability and learning during reform implementation.

56.      This ICR updated the economic analysis carried out at the time of design to assess Project
efficiency at the time of its completion. Details are in Annex 4. In short, the ESTP achieved a net
present value (NPV) of 21.6 million real (1996) Jamaican Dollars and an internal rate of return (IRR)
of 9 percent. These results compare favorably to the PAD’s best case Scenario 5,31 under which
ESTP was projected to achieve a NPV of 7.7 million 1996 Jamaican Dollars and an IRR of 7 percent.
Calculation of the value added of the Project culminates in an IRR of 13 percent.

57.     The Project resources were used very efficiently and largely as planned,32 and generated
high returns. Not only is each agency functioning effectively, 33 together they are functioning
synergistically and efficiently, drawing on their comparative advantages and their good coordination
and collaboration, to achieve the ESTP goals of improved accountability, transparency,
performance, especially at the school level. CMU was also highly efficient in its Project
management functions, with regular meetings, guidance to all involved, effective teamwork and
stepped up efforts in communications and outreach to ensure the understanding and buy-in of all
stakeholders to the reform process and benefits. The procurement delay notwithstanding, software
ultimately bought for NEI was 70 percent of the original price quoted and was a better product than
what was initially considered, representing good value for money.

58.      Two delays in implementation were deliberate and made in the interest of significant
medium-term gains in efficiency. First, delays in the passage of JTC legislation (and consequent
delays in JTC’s uptake of teacher licensing) were warranted as they provided more time for dialogue
and negotiation with the teachers’ union. Consensus reached on the final draft legislation was
reasonable and earned the buy-in and trust of this important stakeholder group. Moreover, this delay
did not undermine achievement of the two JTC-relevant outcomes (Table 3-2). Second, delays in
the restructuring of MoE, including the creation and support of the DSS, were also warranted, as
they enabled the use of lessons emanating from the REA pilot to recalibrate the MoE central and
regional structures. The application of these lessons and the better use of Project funds to support
the conception and implementation of restructuring and transition activities provide a stronger basis
for ensuring MoE effectiveness and efficiency. Additionally, under the IMF arrangement, strict
ceilings were set for all GoJ budgets, including for education, constraining MoE was constrained in
absorbing disbursements especially during the Project’s last two years.

59.      The closing date was extended by a year to allow for full use of Project funds and to
accommodate the delay in procurement. The results of this extension were: full (100 percent)
utilization of the loan and the achievement of objectives with no cost overruns;34 a considerably less
costly NEI software contract, ultimately delivered with quality; and the surpassing of many targets.
The inefficiencies identified above are thus considered to be minor.

Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects and Social Development

61.     The ESTP places priority on achieving greater equity both in access and in the quality of
education. Indeed, this has been an important element in the implementation of the reform. First,
schools most in need are prioritized for support. This includes: devoting a good portion of the
technical support and backstopping, provided by the various agencies and MoE/DSS, to the weakest
performing schools, as identified through NEI inspections; and the channeling of private support



                                                                  18
mobilized by NET to strengthen school infrastructure and materials to fill the most significant gaps.
These high priority schools are largely those serving the poorest, most vulnerable communities.
Second, curriculum reform includes interventions to support and nurture boys’ improved school
attendance and academic and social performance to address disparities with girls.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

62.     This Project supported institutional capacity building. There is nothing to add here.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

63.     The very strong performance of NEI and NCEL has earned them good and growing
reputations. Both have been contacted by multiple agencies and countries to request their training
and technical assistance. This burgeoning interest holds great potential for the generation of
resources by these institutions.

Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

64.    A stakeholder workshop held in March 2015 facilitated exchange on the Project’s
implementation and outcome and reached strong consensus on the Project’s success (Annex 7)

Section 4: Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

65.      MoE reform was designed and implemented on the basis of solid technical preparation and
fine-tuning, drawing on qualified experts on legal matters, organizational development, competency-
based training, information systems, human resources management, communications, public sector
reform and other relevant expertise. On the financial front, notwithstanding GoJs fiscal constraint,
prospects for the reliable financing of the restructured MoE and its new agencies are good.
Education remains a top priority and GoJ has already demonstrated its strong commitment by
meeting its budget goals for ESTP financing (Annex 1). NEI and NCEL’s capacity and reputations
are attracting the interests of countries and agencies, who are willing to pay for their training and
technical assistance. On the political front, the strong bi-partisan support of the reform, rooted in
the bi-partisan membership of the 2004 TF, was clearly demonstrated when the 2011 change in
Government did not compromise the reform agenda.

66.      On the social front, there is also strong support for the reforms across a wide range of
stakeholders. MoE staff have been informed, motivated and supported throughout the reform
process and are highly motivated to transition into their new roles. This was evident in interviews,
field visits and the Project workshop, and grounded in the Project’s extensive support to meetings
and outreach activities. The Project wisely invested in an in-depth communication effort, supporting
over 55 meetings across all regions to consult and inform the public and key actors and stakeholders
in education. Moreover, the public has already witnessed – and appreciated – some of the tangible
results of the Project: candid assessments of schools around which improvement plans are developed
and all MoE agencies rally to support; public recognition of excellence in education. This has
solidified social support for the reforms and their sustainability and resulted in trust between the
schools (and the communities they serve) and MoE agencies.

67.      From an institutional perspective, considerable capacity has been built within the newly
structured MoE and its associated agencies. The challenge will be to nurture and further develop it
as the reform continues to unfold. NEI and NCEL have clearly demonstrated their capacity to fulfill


                                                19
their mandate. JTC is well poised to assume its licensing functions, but this process should be
evaluated and fine-tuned, as was done for NEI and NCEL in their initial implementation phases.
Likewise, MoE and DSS have been very well prepared to function under their new structures, but
will require proactive monitoring, support and nurturing. In short, the supportive activities which
made the reform a success so far – stakeholder and staff consultation/feedback, process evaluations
with constructive feedback for improvements and a learning-by-doing approach – will need to be
continued to ensure continued success and sustainability. CMU continues to have a critical role to
play to this end.

Section 5: Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank Performance: Satisfactory

68.     Quality at Entry: Satisfactory. The Project’s strategic relevance was strong. It was
grounded in a rigorous assessment of sector challenges and an institutional reform plan, both of high
technical quality and nationally undertaken and owned. A clear results chain and viable institutional
arrangements enhanced the Project’s prospects of achieving the PDO. Fiduciary aspects were well
prepared, based on thorough assessments of capacities; and capacity building arrangements and
interventions were put into place to ensure readiness for implementation. Capacity interventions
encompassed those elements typically included in institutional strengthening projects (training,
technical assistance, information systems), but also included elements that were ultimately critical
to the Project’s success: political support; DLTs; legal assistance; organizational development
expertise; strong communications and outreach.

69.      The M&E design, with its strong focus on process evaluations and learning-by-doing,
underlined the importance of its use for problem solving and decision-making and was a critical
factor in strengthening MoE. The institutionalization of M&E as a tool for strategic management
and fine-tuning is highly likely. The risk assessment was candid and thorough and the risk mitigation
plans were appropriate. Bank’s inputs and processes drew on a multi-disciplinary team and good
collaboration with MoE’s partners. The adding and dropping of indicators is reflective of difficulties
in measuring any capacity building/institutional development project. In the end, the indicators
provided good measures of project efficacy and were in line with UNDP Capacity Assessment
Methodology and other PSM literature and advice (para. 20). In retrospect, while a sound legal
framework is a critical measure of PDO achievement, the outcome indicator might have focused on
the preparation of the framework, instead of its approval by Parliament, which is beyond the project
to assure. This is a minor shortcoming in an otherwise strong M&E design.

70.     Quality of Supervision: Satisfactory. The Bank’s supervision was strongly focused on
development impact. Aide-memoires and reporting kept the development outcomes in the forefront,
and implementation issues were always addressed in light of their impact on development outcomes.
Supervisions were appropriately staffed, carried out regularly and reporting was candid and
thorough, drawing on the rich array of evaluation work undertaken with project support and direct
field observations and dialogue. The Bank appropriately exercised both rigor and flexibility in
addressing issues. Its decision to drop the DLT related to the passage of JTC legislation was
appropriate, reflecting an understanding of the need for dialogue with the teachers’ union and their
buy-in of this reform.

71.    Fiduciary supervision was also strong, with no shortcomings. Regular procurement support
missions and post-reviews identified and addressed issues and delays, which were gradually
reduced. Financial management was also regularly and correctly monitored and supported.



                                                 20
72.      A change in Task Team Leaders (TTL’s) – from one based in Kingston to one based in
Washington – was smooth, with good continuity of support. Close, pedagogical supervision, respect
of Government leadership and candid exchanges are noted by GoJ to have contributed to MoE
capacity building. The Bank’s role in ensuring adequate transition arrangements was strong with its
appropriate advice and assistance channeled beyond MoE to other involved GoJ agencies and its
identification of grant support for NCEL. The issues associated with the choice of indicators and the
relatively late timing of the 2014 restructuring, discussed in the M&E section, are assessed to be a
minor shortcoming, because the Bank’s supervision performance fully satisfies four of the five
evaluation criteria in the Harmonized Guidelines and partially satisfies the fifth.

Borrower Performance: Satisfactory

73.      Government Performance: Satisfactory. Government ownership and commitment were
strong: (a) education is recognized to be a priority sector which supports Jamaica’s overall
development objectives and (b) the ESTP received strong bi-partisan support as the means for
achieving sustainable education sector gains. MoFP and PIOJ were fully supportive of the Project
and involved in its oversight. While no Project counterpart funds were planned, GoJ funding of
ESTP was reliable, meeting budget targets, an accomplishment in light of severe fiscal constraints
(Annex 1, Table d). The reform fit well into GoJ’s vision for public sector reform and results-based
management. Starting with the 2004 TF and throughout implementation, wide consultation with
stakeholders has generated strong ownership of the reform. GoJ ensured that the Project was ready
for implementation. The assignment of Project management to the ESTP CMU ensured that the
Project was strategically placed within MoE hierarchy where there was good implementation
capacity, supplemented by the appointment of key staff. Fiduciary performance and compliance
with covenants were both solid, with only minor shortcomings associated with delays, some
precipitated by GoJ’s use – across sectors -- of parallel (Bank and Government) procurement
systems. A change in Government (and the consequent need to wait for a new cabinet to be put in
place) did exacerbate a delay in GoJ approval of the NEI software contract, which caused the
initiation of a new bidding process and a one-year extension of the closing date. Good partnerships
with donors and stakeholders facilitated Project efficiency and value added. Prospects for post-
Project transition are good and will require the continued proactive support of GoJ beyond MoE.
Strict budget ceilings under the IMF arrangement constrained the absorption of DLT-related
disbursements in 2013 and 2014. But a one-year extension culminated in the full use of funds,
making this a minor shortcoming.

74.     Implementing Agency Performance: Highly Satisfactory. The CMU was highly
committed to achieving the PDO. Its leadership understood the importance of change management
(versus project management) in supporting and nurturing reform. It embraced a participatory,
learning-by-doing approach, catalyzed by a strong vision and drive for results. The team was
appropriately supplemented with key staff, hired to undertake the fiduciary tasks required by the
Bank. M&E activities were strongly supported and the use of data for decision-making and
improvement – especially through the multiple process evaluations undertaken for the various new
agencies and initiatives – is a model for other projects. The CMU also understood the importance of
carrying out communications and outreach to involve and inform both MoE staff and the multiple
actors and stakeholders around the country. This understanding and good implementation brought
great returns in mitigating resistance and strengthening ownership. The CMU was effective in
communicating and coordinating with partners, ensuring seamless support to the ESTP. Its strong
leadership and management is acknowledged by many: MoFP, PIOJ, MoE managers and staff, the
IDB and the Bank’s team. This is corroborated by the ICR mission’s direct observations and
document reviews. There were no shortcomings in performance.



                                                21
Section 6: Lessons Learned

75.     Even with delays in adopting legal frameworks, new agencies can be rendered functional
and accomplish much in support of sector results. Indeed, the experience acquired during the initial
years of their functioning has served to enhance dialogue and consensus among stakeholders and
inform the fine-tuning of legislation enabling these agencies’ optimal performance.

76.      Strong national ownership is critical to successful reform and its impact on performance and
outcomes. Ownership requires: (a) national consensus on the reform purpose and components; (b)
respect and flexibility of the supporting development partners; (c) a government-led change
management process supporting a process of learning and fine-tuning, continuous dialogue and
information dissemination across the range of actors and stakeholders; and (d) a well-managed,
patient and deliberate briefing of new Administrators and high-level managers.

77.     Proactive, well-designed and implemented M&E can be pivotal in tracking and fine-tuning
a major reform of institutions and ensuring the success and effectiveness of new institutions.

78.      Synergistic action of a range of institutions around the goal of school effectiveness and the
quality of teaching and learning can be achieved if factors are in place: an evidence-based design;
strong national consensus and shared vision, precipitated by extensive stakeholder involvement;
clarity and complementarity of roles and responsibilities for achieving a common goal; strong
capacity and effectiveness of each institution; public recognition and reward of good performance;
strong leadership and a change management approach that accommodates learning-by-doing.

    The reduced cost of Component 1 reflects a reduction in the unit cost of inspection, which was originally
  budgeted at US$3,200, but in practice has been US$2,200. In addition, the unit cost of training undertaken
  by JTC through the QECs in the regions has been lower than budget estimates. Component 3 costs exceed
  original estimates reflecting the latest estimates of the administrative expenses of the key agencies for the
  ESTP.

                                Subcomponent 1.1: National Education Inspectorate (NEI)
NEI’s mandate is to inspect all primary and secondary schools in an effort to identify what each school needs to do to bring
about further improvement. It is responsible for making an assessment of the standards attained by the students at key points
during their education and to report on how well they perform or improve, as they progress through their school and learning
life. The NEI is also charged with the responsibility to make recommendations to support improvement in the quality of the
provision and outcomes for all learners. As a part of the inspection process, the NEI inspectors evaluate the following key
aspects of the school’s work:
1. How effectively the school is led and managed by the Board, the Principal and senior and middle management staff.
2. How effectively the teaching supports the students’ learning.
3. How well the students perform in national and/or regional tests and assessments.
4. How much progress the students make in relation to their starting points.
5. How well the students develop personally and socially.
6. How effectively the school uses the human and material resources at its disposal to help the students achieve as well as
     they can.
7. How well the curriculum and any enhancement programs meet the needs of the students.
8. How well the school ensures everyone’s security, health, safety and wellbeing.
Their evidence base draws on: classroom observation; meetings with the principal and senior staff; examination of school
documents; talking with the students; examination of a sample of students’ work; and interviews with staff, individually and
in groups.

The NEI was established in 2008 in response to the recommendations of the Education Task Force (2004), which called for
increased accountability w/in Jamaican schools. An agency of the Quality Assurance Authority, the NEI seeks to appraise
schools’ effectiveness and delivery

Pre-requisites to inspection visits: small group sensitization:
 Town halls with groups of school authorities/staff) to talk about process, how to hold NEI to account, discuss fears
 School self-assessment done
 Pre-inspection at school level.
NEI is held accountable for process. Immediate feedback to principals. Acknowledge good work, and cite an area for
improvement (“two stars and a wish”). Schools have 10 days to comment on (quality assured) draft.
Hundreds of letters from schools thanking NEI for process, finding it a true learning and supportive process. NEI has never
had to do a reinspection.

Summary of major M&E report findings:
 Schools inspection recommendations are being taken seriously and much has been done/continues to be done to ensure
     their implementation.
 School principals have taken the lead role in implementing recommendations.
 Resource constraints hamper implementation of some recommendations.
 Effective coordination and well-defined roles for follow-up support to schools have not yet been fully laid out and taken
     up in the context of a redefined regional entity – the DSS – which is currently in the advanced stages of establishment.
Inspection system: The software has been developed for this system and the user testing phase is underway. Testing has
already revealed the potential for this software to cut down substantially on costs and turnaround of reports and dissemination.
Specifically, the software system has demonstrated its facility for cutting down on quality assurance procedures, allowing for
online meetings and online signature of contracts. Testing reveals its potential for enhanced sustainability and efficiency.
Hardware and software for NEI Inspection System (expected to be delivered by March 31, 2015): US$0.9 million

The NEI website design phase has been completed and the ICR mission witnessed its demonstration while in the field. The
US$0.1 million contract includes a 6 month support for follow-up and troubleshooting. (NEI/MoE)
Training:



                                                          37
         357 inspectors have been trained (many of whom work part-time, on-demand, on a contractual basis).
         80 team leaders have been trained.
         Many inspectors used by NEI are based in regions, which cuts down on the cost of doing business (efficiency).
         To date 100 inspectors have been certified, with more qualified inspectors in line for certification. Certification
          requirements include the completion of three successful inspections with close supervision/verification. (NEI/MoE)
Inspection Handbooks prepared, ensuring the sustainability of NEI’s work:
     Handbook for Inspectors
     Handbook for Inspection Team Leaders
Study tour to Canada and short courses (Sigma) were supported.
About to release baseline report. Every single school in Jamaica was inspected, has a report. All have school improvement
plans; all do annual self assessments -- an honest review of strengths and weaknesses and how to improve.

Total of 959 inspections conducted, of which:
     953 public primary and secondary level schools (of which one burned down)
     4 juvenile detention centers (as a result of inspections receiving support for education: teachers, curriculum, text
         books…)
     1 adult correctional facility
     1 special education school (NEI/MoE)

93% of inspection reports returned to schools and stakeholders (the remaining few are in process of finalization). Reports are
published on MoE’s website. NEI is currently developing its own website to this end. (NEI/MoE).

School Performance Profiles have been created for 100% of public primary and secondary level schools inspected.

Six Chief Inspector’s Reports have been tabled in Parliament.
(NEI/MoE)
Multiple consultative meetings were carried out on NEI mandates. (NEI/MoE).
Extensive surveys/communications with: parents, students, teachers.
68% of staff complement in place, with selection of remaining staff underway (NEI/MoE)
The dissemination and use of data was pivotal in uniting all MoE agencies around the quality of teaching and learning and
serves to inform and coordinate their work, although MoE’s M&E report highlights some room for improvement.
     DSS follow through on themes emanating from NEI inspections to oversee/ensure continued support
     Teachers colleges using data for formative assessments
     JTC organizes its professional development activities accordingly
     School data sent to NCEL
     Reports to Parliament members on their respective constituencies incites their increased support for schools
     After publication: school reports covered extensively by the media
     Precipitates financing/action on some infrastructure needs
     ESTP monthly meetings data-driven
Internal collaborations:
 development of a framework and design and delivery of training for 16 senior education offices (SEOs) working in the
    regions on how to observe lessons and student engagement (with more training designs underway)
 development of a quality assurance framework for school-based assessments (SBAs) and design and delivery of training
    for assessors (including retired and current principals)
 development of a framework for quality assurance for middle managers of schools and design and delivery of training for
    11 middle managers to enable them to conduct internal quality assurance in their schools
External collaborations:
 NEI/Turks & Caicos Islands: negotiated with Turks & Caicos on the development of inspection protocols and design and
    delivery of training of assessors
 NEI/Belize: Chief Inspector from Belize to visit Jamaica in September 2015.
 Caribbean Island Council is asking to learn/benefit from NEI’s experience, expertise and effectiveness.
(NEI/MoE)
NEI has applied for international accreditation and the self-study documents are currently under preparation. (NEI/MoE)
Four research papers produced: time on task; influence of class size; students’ voice, performance of constituencies.

                                        Subcomponent 1.2.a: Jamaica Teaching Council
Source: Ministry Modernization: Questions & Answers:
The JTC was established in response to the Task Force on Educational Reform’s (2004) report outlining the vital role of
teachers in increasing the achievement levels of children. Its mandate is to resolve issues and develop an effective and
efficient teaching service responsive to the changing needs of society thereby raising the status of the profession. It will
establish in consultation with the profession, professional standards in the delivery of education and will promote greater
levels of competency, commitment and accountability among teachers. In addition, the JTC will improve the conditions of
service of teachers and enhance the status of the profession. It will also review and advise the Minister on critical policy
directions relevant to the profession. Its primary instrument for enforcing and maintaining desirable performance standards
will be vested in the authority to register and license teachers.
Establishment of the JTC:
Passage of the enabling legislation (Jamaica Teaching Council Act) was delayed due to extensive consultation of its contents
across a range of stakeholders and especially engaging/negotiation with the Jamaica Teachers’ Association (JTA) on various
elements. Consensus recently reached with the JTA appears to be reasonable – on both legal and technical fronts – and
critical for ensuring the buy-in from this major group of stakeholders. While delays in approval of the bill have prevented
JTC from assuming its licensing mandate, the JTC has prepared for this function and does execute its other functions. The
Minister of Education considers the passage of this Bill a priority and assures its tabling with Parliament before end of this
Legislative Year – March 2016. In the meantime, it is functioning under the auspices of the ESTP.

Establishment and functioning of the Advisory Body of the JTC to the Minister:
 comprised of: independent schools, religious bodies, Jamaica Tertiary Education Commission (JTEC), Teachers’
     Colleges of Jamaica, School Boards, Jamaica Independent Schools’ Association (JISA), Jamaica Teachers’ Association
     (JTA), Parent Teachers’ Association, private sector, opposition party
 Bi-monthly meetings held: 11 to date
 Organized into three sub-committees:
          o Governance (4 meetings to date)
          o Programme development and quality assurance (8 meetings to date)
          o Research and communication (8 meetings to date)
Teacher registration:
Registration is ongoing with 28,585 in the database of the Register and 2,300 unregistered teachers in the system (92%
compliance rate). A campaign was launched to achieve full teacher registration compliance before end-2015 and approval of
a request to include registration in the employment process (503 form) is pending.
Registration guidelines have been prepared.
Teacher licensing:
A teacher licensing framework has been completed with an online platform capable of processing teacher licensing. An in-
house processing system is being proposed. While functional, it requires improvement to improve efficiency.
Criteria for registration almost the same as criteria for initial licensing, but can only issue license after Bill passed. License
represents practice on basis of performance. Will be done between employer and employee. License issued by JTC but
process at school level. License according to standards. Professional credits.

Teaching standards:



                                                           39
    Professional standards for educators (including standards for school leadership) have been circulated.
    Various standards have been prepared in draft and review processes are underway or completed:
         o Mathematics and English teachers: review completed
         o Guidance and Counseling practitioners: review at advanced stage of completion
         o Technical and Vocational Education and Training: review is 50 percent completed
         o Science teachers: review started, completion expected before the beginning of the next academic year
Corporate Services:
 Operational Guidelines completed by a consultant
 Standard Operating Procedures being drafted for business processes to supplement Operational Guidelines and lead to
     greater effectiveness of the JTC.
 Absence of critical staff undermines the potential of corporate services.
Operational Guidelines for JTC were under preparation at the time of the ICR mission, with work expected to be completed
by end-March 2015.
Mentorship program activities undertaken included:
 beginning teachers induction (2009-2013) for 7,996 beginning teachers
 training for mentors (2010-2013) for 1,593 mentors
 orientation of principals (2011-13) for 576 principals
 ongoing feedback sessions for mentors and beginning teachers, with sessions held in all regions.
Mentoring of new teachers normally lasts for one academic year. Proposals in the draft bill specify that:
      Teachers entering the system from overseas are mentored for their first academic year, while those re-entering the
         profession are mentored for the first two terms.
      Those with professional development needs are mentored for one academic year.
Mentorship is also supported by the creation of a DVD containing information on what new teachers should know.
Staffing: JTC currently has 54 staff (of which 8-9 professional level). Still short of staff: 7 registration officers, in particular.
Training content is based on training needs identified by NEI.
Over 10,000 teachers received in-service training in the following areas:
      Literacy, mathematics, English, music, Spanish, business education, visual arts, agricultural science, theatre arts,
         home economics, special education, SBA, history, geography
      Syllabi revision in: biology, physics, chemistry, sociology
      Newly introduced syllabi in CAPE, e.g.: tourism, physical education, entrepreneurship, agricultural science,
         information technology and performing arts.
JTC organizes major training programs during school summer holidays: 2 weeks in July for primary and 2 weeks in August
for secondary.

Annual coverage of in-service training increased from an average of 1000 teachers (at the project’s outset) to an average of
3000 teachers by the project’s end.

Training improvements include: increased involvement of the teachers’ colleges in providing in-service training and a
stronger focus on special education. Plans are underway for short-term training to be accredited by University Council of
Jamaica (UCJ)

A research on teacher qualification was undertaken with project support.

Establishment of Master Teachers Program:
 Currently a total of 18 Active Master Teachers/new career track for teachers
 22 applications currently being processed
 Upgrading existing policies, guidelines and raising the general standards/eligibility criteria of the program
 Reviewing entry requirements of program
 Increased and improved evaluation process
 Process to institute the proposed standards for Master Teachers.
An impact study assessing career pathway for teachers was financed under the project.
Production and printing of the JTC Journal was initially slated for a national competitive bidding process, but a decision
was subsequently made to undertake this in-house.
Teacher Management Information System:



                                                             40
A JTC portal has been established. While there are some efficiency improvements to be made, basic functionality has been
achieved for teacher registration, licensing and reporting capacity. Scanning of teacher files is complete through 2013.
Online registration capability is established and operational, facilitating teacher registration.
Teacher Document Management System:
Web portal is slated to undertake the Teacher Document Management System function. To date 28,606 teachers’ files have
been scanned, with scanned information being uploaded to teachers’ individual profiles. This is making teachers’ files more
easily accessible. Teachers can update their files, but JTC needs to validate.
IT Support:
The project provided the JTC with servers (US$44,000), assistance to design a web portal ($116,000); and IT equipment
(US$15,000).

ESTP Change Management Unit prepared a Results Matrix Operational Manual for NCEL (June 24, 2014) outlining four
intermediate outcomes and related indicators to support results orientation, transparency and accountability and outlining out
roles and responsibilities for M&E. The four intermediate outcomes to be assessed with both qualitative and quantitative data
are:
 To improve the quality of leaders and principals in education and to bring greater accountability to the role of principal in
     schools;
 To develop the capacity of education officers to operate effectively in a modernized system;
 To broaden the target groups for training to include leadership teams to enable succession planning; and
 To be the premier education institution within CARICOM to offer educational leadership training to countries in the
     region.

                        Subcomponent 1.3: Central MoE and Departments of School Services (DSS)
A policy-focused Ministry is one which formulates sound sector policies, technical standards and operational norms;
effectively monitors and evaluates downstream agencies to ensure that desired policy objectives are achieved and efficiently
perform corporate management functions that support policy making processes.
Benefit of the Modernization of MoE: greater responsiveness to students’ and country’s needs as the point of service delivery
will be closer to the recipients.

The DSS is expected to be the operational arm of the MoE, focusing specifically on Early Childhood, Primary and Secondary
education. The goal is to develop a robust operational arm that will ensure that activities and are implemented and support is
provided for schools, which should ultimately improve the performance of students in the system.

Organization:
 DSS central office: central point of reference on SIPs/Manages School Improvement
 DSS regional offices: manages school improvement planning/operations procedures; staffed by: a senior education
   officer; education officers; a SIP clerical officer.

Source: Ministry Modernization: Questions & Answers, ESTP/MoE:
The MoE has decided that in principle, as much responsibility for operational management and decision-making will be
devolved to the DSS.

Overall: DDS are not yet fully operational, but rapidly approaching that outcome. Programs, systems, procedures, skills,
equipment have all been put into place. All that is left for its full functionality is on the human resources front: completion of
job descriptions (almost finished), mapping/reallocation of staff (imminent).

Source: Ministry Modernization, ESTP/MoE: Work on developing the DSS is advanced. The roles, functions and structure
of the DSS are defined. Transitional arrangements have been initiated for the start of its operation. Full implementation will
come into effect simultaneously with the Central Ministry over a period of 12 months from those transitional arrangements
being put into effect.
The Regional Offices will still exist as part of the DSS. Cabinet approved the establishment of a 7th Region, in tandem with
the reconfiguration of Regional boundaries to align with parish boundaries.

Ministry Modernization Q&A:
School supervision will be integrally centered on school improvement and will be supported through the Regional Offices
directly and through the respective Quality Education Circles (QECs). The relationship between the DSS and school boards
will be strengthened and be more enabling of the support required for school improvement through legislation and policy.
The DSS will have an active role in the appointment of principals and teachers in collaboration with the NCE, JTC, and the
TSC.
JTC interview points out that “Teacher quality needs to be integrated into DSS task, school assessment.”
Fellowships for 180 staff in: project management; program M&E; accounting; regional government; policy; quality
assurance; data management; performance management and accounting system.
100 percent of all fellowship recipients signed their bond agreements, which commits them to serve in their current positions
following the specialized training they received through the fellowships.
Regular tracking of staff (through quarterly status reports on the fellows) reveals their widely expressed gratitude for the
training and their regular attendance
Central Ministry:
Now evidence-based, focused on data for decision-making. It is GoJ policy to separate policy from operations. Information
pervades all aspects of the strategic management cycle. Integration of business systems is a means to this end. It is already
happening, but incrementally. Do not expect to be a true Central Ministry until next year. Redesigned functions creeping in.
This work involves changing a culture, which is ongoing. It’s a mix of old and new; transformation will take a long time.
Seminars and training sessions for DDS staff, many of these focused around the School Improvement Planning Manual and
related support to schools:




                                                           44
   Seminars held for regional directors and education officers in leading collaborative supervision, which has nurtured and
    encouraged a more structured and more collaborative supervision process;
 Training for education officers on how to use inspection reports for their supervisions, which has culminated in a more
    systematic process for interventions in school. MoE reports the impact of this training as a “major turnaround” for a
    more concerted school focus.
 Regional workshops on school improvement planning, which has enabled education officers to provide quality support
    and contributed to the 95 percent compliance by schools in submitting their School Improvement Plans.
 Regional workshops for principals and board chairs on new policies and procedures.
 Follow-up retreat for Regional Directors
 Lean Six Sigma Yellow Belt and Green Belt training for selected DDS staff, focusing on how to streamline processes and
    improve efficiency. Learning is reflected in Operational Manuals.
 Training for administrative staff in the regions on: data collection, administering exams, textbook management, among
    other administrative tasks. Further training will be necessary.
DSS Roll-Out activities:
DSS: started this work in 2010-11, when its functional profile was sorted out. Evolved from (autonomous) REA to an
operational arm of MoE, an outcome of pilots in two regions.

According to MoE’s Department of School Services (DSS) School Improvement (August 19, 2014), the DSS commenced its
operations in the 2014 school year. Roll-out activities included:
 Meetings with stakeholders groups (Association of Principals of public and private schools, Board Chairs, Principals,
    Education Officers and students), which have resulted in the sensitization of the entire education system.
 Workshops and meetings with selected DDS team to refine the Manual (School Improvement Planning Manual? Or DDS
    Manual). Manual is 97 percent complete. Staff are aware of procedures.
 Back-to-School conferences held with local stakeholders for full sensitization of Board members and principals.
 All Regions completed and submitted their reports.
School Support activities:
 Action research conducted, analyzed and used to finetune school support, an approach which is slated to be sustained.
 School-led planning meetings with intervention teams and regional staff to facilitate and coordinate action planning to
    respond to school improvement plans.
 Start-up meeting with principals of 60 high schools and 60 primary schools to launch school support activities.
 School Improvement Planning Manual (by DSS) completed and distributed, and a structured planning process is now in
    place. This establishes a standardized approach to the school planning process. To allow for closer monitoring of both
    the school improvement planning process and the use of outcomes of the process to monitor and evaluate school
    performance by:
         o Providing support for schools on: self evaluation; setting of targets that will lead to improved learning outcomes
         o Identifying poorly performing schools and initiating plans to support their improvement
         o Challenging, supporting and monitoring schools to ensure that their response to the NIE recommendations are
              properly planned and implemented
         o Strengthening the capacity of schools to manage their resources, especially those of finance, staff and facilities
              in order to provide better opportunities for students;
         o Articulating and ensuring the proper implementation of MoE policies, initiatives, programs or projects.
 Guidance covers the whole strategic management cycle: school self-evaluation; functions of the school improvement
    planning committee; preparation of the draft plan and budget; stakeholders consultation; preparation of the final plan; its
    submission to the regional branch office; plan implementation; monitoring and reporting; and annual evaluation
    (including an annual evaluation matrix with MoE objectives, school goals and targets, indicators).
 Guidance also includes two sets of criteria to be used by the DSS to review, respectively:
         o The school self evaluation;
         o The SIP
 According to National Education Strategic Plan (2012-2020), SIPs of all public schools must be aligned with nine
    strategic objectives of MoE:
         o Equitable access
         o Improved standards and quality through accountability
         o Universal literacy and at least 85 percent numeracy
         o Safety and security of physical environment
         o Partnerships with donors, private sector, communities, parents and others

        o Resource-rich support to all learners at all levels
        o Acquisition by all learners of high quality knowledge and marketable skills
        o Attraction/retention of well-qualified, certified and licensed teachers
 95 percent of schools have submitted their School Improvement Plans.
 85 percent compliance in submitting SIP Evaluation reports.
Teacher Resource Centres/Quality Education Circles Support:
 Operational framework for Teacher Resource Centres has been developed for 63 centers, each aligned with the 63 QECs,
    with accompanying support, culminating in improved performance of teachers and other educators
 63 Teacher Resource Centers established and equipped, now becoming operational.
Technical Assistance to DSS:
 Support to the refinement of the Manual to ensure that all aspects of work done by the Educational Services Division
    (DSS) has been included. Standardized procedures to guide staff have been established. Further refinement of the
    Manual will be undertaken to improve its user-friendliness and to revise and reflect reconfigured process maps.
Updated school capacity data for all primary and secondary level institutions, which was used for:
 Rationalization/reduction of shift schools
 Rationalization of primary, all age and primary and junior high schools;
 Rationalization of secondary schools
Available data will impact planning for school places, which may involve the following strategies:
 Using the extended day (more time in school w/out full second shift)
 Amalgamation of schools
 Redistribution of students and, consequently, redeployment of teachers;
 Proposals for alternative use of institutions.
(good use of data for decision-making/efficiency)

(US$41,000).
Preparation of Central Ministry job descriptions to facilitate the implementation of the transformation programme:
 366 job descriptions prepared for the present structure in an output-focused format to facilitate the mapping exercise for
    the transition phase of the transformation
 404 job descriptions prepared for the proposed structure. At the time of the ICR 216 (53 percent) of the 404 job
    descriptions had been prepared, with the remaining 188 slated for end-March in tandem with the business process re-
    engineering study.
Preparation of DSS job descriptions to facilitate the implementation of the transformation programme:
     36 job descriptions of approximately 196 proposed posts were prepared as of the ICR mission. The remaining ones
         will be prepared upon receipt of the business process review recommendations.
Preparation of job descriptions for the emerging agencies to facilitate the implementation of the transformation programme:
     151 (85 percent) of 178 job descriptions prepared as of the ICR mission. The remaining 15 percent of job
         descriptions are slated to be finalized pending the outcome of the “shared services” model, which proposes
         efficiencies for sharing core services (financial management, human resources management, among others).

Source: Ministry Modernization: Q&A:
How staff is to be treated as they transition to the modernized structure is set out in great detail in the HR Transition Policy,
which has been disseminated to staff. Some jobs may change quite a lot, while others may remain largely the same. A job
that retains at least 70 percent of its current functions will be deemed, for the purpose of transitioning, to be the same job and
staff will be transitioned to the mob in the modernized structure. Where change is more significant, the job will be competed
for. As the work progresses, staff will be kept abreast through regular staff meetings and through publications/newsletters.
Each staff will be personally informed of decisions on his/her particular job transition and given a chance to discuss with
HRMA and his/her manager, before any changes are made.
Over and above a broad range of communication activities and staff meetings, the change champions are responsible for
making sure that all staff remain informed and able to provide feedback both directly and through the change champions.
A human resource management software has been acquired. Its modification and production had been completed at the time
of the ICR mission. Collation of employee data was being finalized, with uploading of all personal information for each
employee slated for end-March 2015. Full implementation of the system was slated for June 2015.
Procurement of Orange HRM (US$31,000)
A Performance Management and Accountability System (PMAS) has been under implementation in MoE since April 1, 2014,
after the piloting of this system.
      The PMAS was piloted in Regions 2 and 5, and completed within the planned timeframe, and the pilot evaluation
          reported an 88 percent level of satisfaction.
      Very extensive communication and sensitization activities/workshops were undertaken, with 95 percent of targets set
          under the communication plan met.
      820 staff members were trained during the period 2013-15 (more than 90 percent of all MoE staff); and 90 percent of
          participants were satisfied with the training interventions. A change in mindset is taking hold.
      100 percent of Divisions within MoE are implementing PMAS.
      There are still small pockets of MoE struggling with the shift in culture/focus, but there is overall an incremental
          shift towards a more output-focused, performance-driven culture.
      Change champions continue their work of ensuring understanding, acceptance, and sustainability.
      PMAS reflects a transformed MoE, with focus on results and accountability. Alignment of national goals, direct
          goals, indirect goals. Will help to sustain high performance in MoE.

Source: Performance Management Process: What’s Different in the New Process?, MoE
The Performance Management and Appraisal System (PMAS) is a brand of performance management system implemented in
the Government system in 2006 to improve performance in the service with greater levels of accountability, staff motivation,
increased customer satisfaction and strategic focus. Employees job performance will be assessed against set targets
(strategically aligned) at the required standard. If practiced properly, the PMAS should benefit both employees and the MoE.
The new system helps organizations to achieve their objectives through a continuous process of goal-setting, performance
feedback/reviews, individual development and evaluation. It is being implemented in contrast to a system that was not
strategically aligned, goal-oriented and not measurable and will see significant improvements/refinements in the process of
planning, monitoring and appraising performance. Under the new PMAS:
 Individual targets are aligned to the strategic goals of the Ministry.
 Appraisals are based on actual performance against set targets.
 Structural adjustments to appraisal form ensure greater objectivity, transparency and employee development.
 Greater employee-supervisor collaboration is promoted through the built-in mechanism of continuous performance
     discussions.
 High performance is recognized and poor performance is addressed.
 The principles of accountability, transparency, objectivity and fairness are adhered to.
 Regional workshops for principals and Board Chairs on new policies and procedures. Staff members are not yet fully
     functioning in their new capacities; retraining will be necessary. Nevertheless, there is a full awareness of these
     stakeholders and selected staff members will serve as trainers for additional training.
 Training sessions for Boards in all six regions on governance arrangements extended to all Board members in the
     country, culminating in improved governance of school boards. Initially aimed to train 1,500 Board Chairmen. It was
     decided this was insufficient, so all Board members were trained (parent representatives, administration

     representatives…). 3,461 members in 33 workshops, covering all regions. Focusing on employment/termination
     functions of Board, training included a number of modules: positive ethos; critical factors affecting education, fiduciary
     management; human resource management/how to manage discipline of students and teachers.

         o Education Summit/Diaspora group visit to explore more in-depth support in education, at which NET was
              presented. A six-year strategic plan is emanating from this event.
         o Guidelines for Donating Educational Materials through NET were issued in June 2014.
   Capacity building: efforts continued, but there were challenges.
         o Consultants recruited for: organization design, financial systems, web portal development and marketing (all
              commenced during 2014).
   School Solar Project: NET leading process for PPP for implementation of solar photovoltaic systems in a number of
    secondary schools (supported by MoFP’s PPP unit, DBJ and Multilateral Investment Fund. Workshops held and
    preparation of feasibility study underway, with business case for the project to be developed. Country’s goal of
    leveraging renewable energy sources is expected to be significantly impacted. April 2014: project identified, assessed to

     be viable, fiscally responsible. Pilot in 30 secondary schools: panel installation generates savings in electricity w/
     potential to sell back excess electricity to Govt. If success with solar project, would be fulfilling original spirit of
     NET/PPP.
 PPP: last year significant progress in building capacity to undertake school infrastructure projects using PPP procurement
     methodology. But during year advised by MoFP that planned adoption of GoJ of new fiscal rules would impact NET’s
     ability to engage in PPP transactions. The accounting treatment for PPP resulted in the creation of obligations on GoJ,
     which effectively meant an increase in the country’s debt stock. Given limited fiscal space, MoFP indicated that this
     increase could not be supported. NET is tasked to explore other areas of funding infrastructure, which would not create
     any additional debt for GoJ. Brainstorming session with directors and business leaders in Jamaica was undertaken to this
     end. PPP capacity building has nevertheless continued to be prepared to launch these projects as soon as fiscal space is
     available.
Initially aiming at 10 PPPs/year, but nixed under IMF framework.
When NET set up, PPP envisaged as main vehicle. Government as guarantor. PPP great expectations, particularly for
secondary level. PPP seen as fast track way. MoE can only build secondary school from budget. IMF: seen as debt.
PPP for social infrastructure, which has no fee doesn’t generate revenue. Hard to push.
They have gotten land, cash to build infant school. When started out w/ PPPs got so much unsolicited support. Will be able
to tap into larger organizations overseas.

Overall: growing portfolio of what they’ve done:
      Construction management

                  Annex 4. Economic and Financial Analysis

        The ESTP supported a sector-wide reform of the education sector. Measuring the
economic net impact of the reform is complicated, as there are both benefits to
individuals (through higher wages) as well as economy-wide benefits, such as greater
productivity and innovation that are not captured by higher wages. While the cost of
these reforms are paid at the beginning of the reform the country will see net benefits in
the future. Standard estimates of the benefits from education only focus on individual
benefits and thus do not capture the true impact. The estimates in appraisal used the
government’s economic forecasting model (known as T2IJ). This model allows an
understanding of the impact of “shocks” in terms of future economic growth. For the
appraisal, these shocks were taken to be the changes in labor productivity and the
effectiveness of government spending in the education sector. Economic growth captures
the benefits both to individuals and to the broader economy.

        The original assumptions are explained in the PAD. The overall benefits
associated with the reform are calculated by comparing the government’s baseline
scenario with the different scenarios. These estimates were both conservative and
speculative as the benefits of an education reform are likely to be long term and broadly
shared. Given the long gestation of the education reform, the analysis estimated that the
reform would not have a positive economic impact until around 2025, leading gradually
to significant economic returns after that date.

        For the ICR, the economic revisits the assumptions made in the PAD about the
impact of ESTP on the economy and make adjustments. The ICR team did not have
access to the T2IJ model and builds on the assumptions in the original estimates. Table 1
presents the original estimates from Scenario 4 from the PAD, which was the best case
scenario. The current scenario also builds on Scenario 5, which seems the most
appropriate. The analysis uses the following assumptions:
     Jamaica’s economic growth was less than expected in the 2010 to 2015, due to its
        slow recovery from the global economic crisis and the reduction of support from
        Venezuela. Since economic growth is the output used to measure the education
        sector’s impact, this will have an impact on the benefits. Slower growth during
        the implementation periods reduced the benefits by 2.0 percent during the years
        2009 to 2015. After that, the benefits will reduced by lesser amount: ranging from
        1.5 percent (2016) to 0.1 percent (2023).
     At the same time, youth unemployment has declined with better employment
        conditions for youth, which leads to greater economic benefits. These are
        estimated to increase the benefits by 1.4 percent starting in 2009 throughout the
        life of the reform.
     Evidence suggest that the cost of the reform was less than originally expected
        suggesting that it is more efficient. On average this brings the upfront costs down
        by 30 percent.

       Overall, this leads to an estimated internal rate of return of around 9 percent
compared to an initial estimate of a 6 percent. The ex-post estimates are presented in
Table 1.

        The ICR also calculates the value added of the World Bank’s support to the
reform. This affects the benefits derived from the World Bank support as well as the total
cost of the reform. Based on the information presented in the ICR, the Bank provided
important support to reduce delays in the implementation of the ESTP. Using the costs to
implement the World Bank’s project, it is possible to estimate the rate of return of this
support.

       Table 2 presents the value added of the Bank’s support. This is done by
comparing cost of benefits shown in table 1, with and without a delay in the benefit flow.
The analysis uses the following assumptions:



                                                    56
                 Without support from the Bank, the impact from the reform is delayed by
                  18 months compared to a scenario where the Bank provides support.
                 Jamaica saves 50 percent of the cost of the World Bank project, implying
                  a total cost savings of US$7.9 million. The other 50 percent of the cost is
                  paid by the Jamaican government approximately 18 months later than it
                  would have been had the World Bank been involved.
        The estimate without the World Bank’s support removes the cost of the Bank’s
interventions. It shows that while the reform “was cheaper” early on without Bank
support, there were long term consequences to the delay in receiving benefits. Overall,
the internal rate of the World Bank’s project is estimated to be 13 percent.

                     Annex 7. Stakeholder Workshop Results

         A stakeholder workshop was held in Kingston on March 10, 2015. It benefited from very
high level participation (Minister of Education, Education Permanent Secretary, officials from
MoF and PIOJ) as well as very broad participation of actors and stakeholders from all parts of the
island, as well as development partners. The workshop allowed actors and stakeholders to hear
the preliminary results of the end-of-project summative evaluation, commissioned by GoJ, and to
contribute their inputs and perspectives, both to facilitate the finalization of the report and (more
importantly) to share and learn lessons with a view to fine-tuning reform implementation and
further improving outcomes.

         The summative evaluation was prepared and presented by MindBloom Consulting
Limited, whose team was composed of management, evaluation and education experts undertook
extensive travel in the country and accumulated a strong evidence base. Its findings (later
updated and incorporated into GoJ’s ICR submission, see Annex 9) culminated in favorable
ratings for the project: substantial relevance, substantial achievement of objectives and substantial
efficiency. Stakeholder discussion strongly corroborated and supported the findings of this
evaluation and exhibited a very strong commitment to continue reforms and to further strengthen
performance and outcomes. It was remarkable to witness the strong, united vision of the reform
and its purpose (greater school effectiveness, better learning outcomes) across the range of
participants.

         This strong vision and unity of purpose were also evident in the second part of this
workshop, which was organized like a fair, or trade show. Multiple actors set up booths to show
what good work they were doing and what results they were achieving, their complementarity
with other actors and their value added. The World Bank ICR team visited every single booth
and collected evidence – both written, and in discussions – that has been incorporated into this
ICR. There were booths representing each of the institutions strengthened under the project:
MoE (with multiple booths for, respectively: Human Resources/PMAS; DSS; M&E); NEI,
NCEL; JTC; and NET. Moreover, there were other MoE initiatives/units and specialized
agencies represented, which are participating in the broader education sector reform, but not
supported under the Bank’s project, covering: tertiary education, numeracy, literacy, curriculum
reform and parent/community associations. The “fair” format provided compelling evidence of
the strong, broad-based commitment to reform, the commitment and dynamism of the range of
actors, as well as the benefits of the CMU efforts to launch an intensive, continual
communications campaign to keep actors apprised of reform and reform progress as well as to
coordinate them effectively for optimal results.

               Annex 8. Jamaica’s Vision for the Education Sector



 Box 8.a: The Task Force on Education Reform, 2004, and the ESTP Mandate
 National Shared Vision:
  Each learner will maximize his/her potential in an enriching, learner-centered education environment
     with maximum use of learning technologies supported by committed, qualified, competent, effective
     and professional educators and staff.
  The education system will be equitable and accessible with full attendance to Grade 11.
     Accountability, transparency and performance are the hallmarks of a system that is excellent, self-
     sustaining and resourced and welcomes full stakeholder participation. The system produces full
     literacy and numeracy, a globally competitive, quality workforce and a disciplined, culturally aware
     and ethical Jamaican citizenry.

 Short- to Medium-Term Recommendations, which became the Mandate of the ESTP:
  Construction of new schools, the upgrading of all existing schools to world-class standards and the
    elimination of the shift system;
  Upgrading of curriculum teaching and learning support systems with particular focus on literacy and
    numeracy;
  Exposing school boards and principals to new concepts of governance with emphasis on leadership
    and administration;
  Building community participation and ownership of schools to influence positive behavioral changes
    and stimulate a higher level of involvement; and
  The Modernization of the Ministry of Education (MoE) to become a Policy Ministry, including the
    establishment of, among others:
          o A National Education Inspectorate;
          o A National Teaching Council;
          o A Curriculum and Assessment Agency;
          o Autonomous Regional Education Agencies;
          o A Central Policy Ministry to provide overall guidance and direction; and
          o A National Education Trust.

        The above-cited 2004 Task Force recommendations for reforming the sector and
the mandate of the ESTP (Box 8.a) provided the basis for education sector development
during the life of the project and have subsequently been underpinned by other formal
policy documents, most notably: the Vision 2030 Jamaica National Development Plan,
issued in 2009 (Box 8.b); and the National Education Strategic Plan (NESP) (2011-2020)
(Box 8.c). All of these official documents clearly articulate the principals underpinning
Jamaica’s quest to reform and improve the education sector, most notably: a strong focus
on school effectiveness and results (learning outcomes); quality of teaching and learning;
productive partnerships with all critical stakeholders; transparency and accountability for
results; and an organizational and governance structure that is efficient and effective in its
support and empowerment of schools to plan, manage, deliver and account for results.

Box 8.b: Vision 2030 Jamaica National Development Plan and Education Sector’s
Role
Of the four strategic goals, the first, “Jamaicans are empowered to achieve their fullest potential”
highlights the important role of the education sector in achieving national development objectives.
The education sector will contribute to the achievement of this goal by ensuring that the education and
training system produces well-rounded and qualified individuals, who are able to function as creative
and productive individuals in all spheres of the society and be competitive globally. The following are
some of the strategies to be employed:
 Ensure that every child has access to early childhood development;
 Improve the learning environment at the primary and secondary levels
 Ensure that graduates from the secondary level are ready to go on to higher education, training or
     work;
 Promote and use standards to measure performance of the education system based on results;
 Ensure that adequate high-quality tertiary education is available;
 Ensure access to education and training opportunities for disadvantaged groups including
     unattached youths and persons with disabilities;
 Develop partnerships with the private sector, parents and communities to create quality schools.

Box 8.c: The National Education Strategic Plan (NESP) 2011-2020
Macro strategic objectives:
 Provide equitable access and/or attachment to a high quality education system for all Jamaican
   children ages 3-19;
 Improve the standards and quality of Jamaica’s education system by establishing a robust
   accountability framework for all stakeholders by 2015;
 Improve learners’ performance across the formal education system and the wider society to achieve
   universal literacy and at least 85 percent numeracy by 2015;
 Provide a safe and secure physical environment, which is conducive to learning for all learners in
   public education institutions by 2020;
 Build partnerships with donors, private sector, the community, parents, employers and those
   committed to creating a strong education system;
 Provide a resource-rich environment supportive of all learners at all levels in the public education
   institutions by 2020;
 Enable all learners in the education system to manage challenges and achieve their developmental
   goals through integrated curriculum offerings and support services to become well-adjusted, healthy
   and secure individuals;
 Attract and retain well-qualified, certified and licensed teachers to fill the requirements of all
   educational institutions at all levels of the system by 2020.

Complementary objectives:
 Teaching and learning systems of international standard;
 Competent educators to match needs of the system by education level, number, geographical
   distribution and specialization are attracted and retained;
 School places in well-equipped schools available to meet demand for all students at ECE, primary,
   secondary levels, post-secondary and tertiary levels;
 System of research and data gathering to inform policymaking and drive school performance;
 Quality assurance and accountability systems implemented to support educational system;
 Inclusive education promoted and supported;
 Stakeholders kept informed of developments in the education system;
 Safe and secure learning environment (physical environment; psychosocial and emotional climate)
   available to support teaching and learning in schools.

Annex 9. Summary of Borrower’s ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR
1.0     Description of the Education Capacity Building Programme

1.1. Introduction & Background: In 2003, confronted with the proliferation of various kinds of
educational    opportunities, the disappointing results of regional and national examinations, the
high cost of education and the desire to strengthen the results of the school system in general, the
government of the day commissioned the Task Force on Educational Reform in 2004. Consistent
with international and regional imperatives, the Most Honourable P.J. Patterson, then Prime
Minister of Jamaica, appointed a 14 member Task Force on Educational Reform to prepare and
present an action plan to create a world-class education system which will generate the human
capital and produce the skills necessary for Jamaicans to compete in the global economy.

The Education Transformation and Capacity Building Programme is designed to provide support
to the Ministry of Education’s Education System Transformation Programme (ESTP) which is
the response to the assessment of the education sector’s performance as outlined in the Task Force
on Education’s (TFE) Report of 2004. The ESTP is an all-embracing set of actions designed to
result in the desired standard of performance of the sector and to put in place systems to ensure
greater accountability at all levels of the sector for the quality of delivery of education. The World
Bank financed project was originally designed to support the implementation of the ESTP by
focusing on capacity building within key sector agencies emerging out of the implementation of
the recommendations of the TFE report of 2004. The key sector agencies which emerged from the
mandate to transform Jamaica’s education system for which Bank financing was to be applied were
the NEI, JTC, NET and REAs. The Bank was to provide co-financing dedicated to specific
activities of these agencies. A link with specific eligible expenditures was seen as necessary due to
the tight budgetary position in Jamaica in 2009/2010 which saw competing priorities among various
programmes. It was deemed that unless Bank financing was explicitly linked to specific inputs,
there would be a high risk that funding would not be available to finance the programme even if it
was recognised as a high priority for Jamaica’s development objectives. Programme funding was
therefore established using a result based funding arrangement tied to set disbursement linked
targets.

1.2. Project Concept & Rationale: The GOJ in 2005 made a significant investment in the design
of its transformation and modernisation programme which had strong bi-partisan and national
support for the reform of the education sector. Funding originally provided by GOJ was used to
significantly increase access to school spaces and to develop plans and programmes which was
intended to transform the education landscape through the efforts of the ETT whose efforts was
organised through various work streams which addressed issues related to (i) increasing space
access (ii) improvements in governance & leadership (iii) curriculum teaching & learning (iv)
modernisation of the sector for improved accountability (v) behaviour management. In 2009 the
ETT was replaced by the ESTP with the function to implement the reform initiatives being vested
in a Change Management Unit of the ESTP. The significant change saw the initiatives being
brought within the Ministry to implement the change from within. A cornerstone of the ESTP is
the establishment of independent agencies which would be accountable and give dedicated focus
to important functions of the Ministry of Education. These entities, the NEI, JTC, NCEL, NET,
CAA and REAs (now the CM & DSS) would be vested with specific functional responsibilities
that would allow for increased accountability, performance and regulation and delivery of quality
education services. In addition to those entities which were to be funded by the Bank The GOJ also
funded the establishment of two other agencies that had responsibility for the regulation of the
tertiary sector in Jamaica (J-TEC) and the coordination of parenting initiatives and programmes in



                                                 64
line with policy and legislation enacted in 2012 (NPSC).

The rationale for the Bank’s involvement in the ESTP was informed by its extensive experience
working in the education sector in Jamaica and the solid relationships with key stakeholders.
Though the ESTP had strong local support, the reform needed both financial and technical support
to ensure implementation and the positive impact on education outcomes desired. Given the
Bank’s expertise and flexible lending instruments the Bank signed the loan for the Education
Capacity Building Program with the GOJ in March 2010.

1.3. Goals & Objectives: The Original Project development Objective was to build the capacity
of the emerging key agencies (National Education Inspectorate, Jamaica Teaching Council,
Regional Education Authorities [now the DSS], and National Education Trust) that are being
established to support the national Education System Transformation Programme (ESTP). The
Objective of the ESTP is to improve the efficiency, accountability and performance of the different
levels of the education system. The revised Project Development Objective is to build the capacity
of the key agencies which emerged to support the national Education System Transformation
Programme (ESTP).

The outcomes of the ESTP aims at more effective and efficient education service delivery by
expanding access, improving teaching and learning, and transforming the governance structure of
the education system. This is a sector-wide programme to be implemented over a ten-year period
and commenced in 2005. The transformation of the governance structure comprises a core element
of the programme. It seeks to bring greater levels of accountability and improved quality to the
system by: (a) decentralizing decision-making and service delivery (b) institutionalizing effective
systems of accountability at all levels (c) increasing the quality and capacity of teachers and
administrators; (d) strengthening monitoring and evaluation to provide more targeted support to
schools; and (e) creating mechanisms to mobilize more and consistent resources to meet
educational needs.

1.4. Project Description: The project was designed under three (3) components and though as the
programme evolved there were modifications to some element within the components the three
components remained as the basic elements of the Education Transformation Capacity Building
Programme. The programme is described below:

 Component 1 – Enhanced Performance & Accountability
National Education Inspectorate (NEI): The loan funds will provide support to the NEI to
establish a systematic inspection process and baseline data on school and student performance in
approximately 1,000 public primary and secondary schools, including (a) the establishment of an
inspection management information system (b) training of inspectors (c) baseline inspection
(including the contracting of inspectors, inspection costs and publications); and (d) national
consultation meetings on NEI mandates. The inspection management information system will store
the inspection reports and track progress on recommendations made during the inspections. The
inspection process is intended to bring greater accountability to and improve the quality of
education. Recommendations from the inspection reports will be shared with the JTC and REAs in
order to coordinate support to the schools in teacher development, education leadership training
and school improvements.

Jamaica Teaching Council (JTC): The project will provide support to operationalize the JTC
including; (a) establishment and implementation of a licensing and registration system for teachers;
(b) carrying out of training of teachers and JTC staff, as well as, orienting teachers in the licencing
process and procedures; (c) review of the existing mentoring programme; (d) professional


                                                  65
development of JTC staff and college lecturers; (e) in-service teacher training in areas required for
licensing; (f) publishing of journal describing best practices in teaching and school leadership; (g)
development of a teacher management information system; and (h) establishment of programmes
for the National College for Educational Leadership (NCEL). The licencing and registration system
will ensure that teachers meet minimum qualifications, while the teacher management information
system will track the teachers who have been registered and licenced and ensure regular re-
licencing every five years. An in-service teacher training programme will support the licencing
system and professional development of teachers. This will be done through some 60 Quality
Education Circles (QECs), which are established across the country.

The National College for Education Leadership (NCEL): This entity is being established to
provide leadership and management capacity for education administrators and leaders. The NCEL
will be that body that ensures school leaders are informed and equipped to execute the policies and
programmes of the Ministry of Education. It will work to improve the standards and qualifications
for school principals and education leaders, including training of current staff and preparation of
cohorts to move into positions of leadership. NCEL will provide training in collaboration with the
NCE for school boards and school inspectors as required by the NEI as well as, other key staff that
support school management such as Bursars.

Central Policy Ministry (CPM) & Department of School Services (DSS): Resources of the loan
will be used to provide, school management systems, technical assistance and training to build
capacities of the CPM and DSS staff in order to effectively carry out the functions identified for
the policy Ministry and to be able to give more direct support to schools (DSS) based on areas
identified in the School Improvement Plans (SIPs). Training of School Boards will also take place
to assist them in improving and providing better leadership to schools and carrying out the mandates
of the Education Act and Regulations, as well as new legislation enacted to support the
transformation of the sector. This will allow for Boards to participate more effectively in school
leadership. The training is to be provided through NCEL. The loan will also provide technical
assistance leading to the establishment of a Media Services related entity.

Component 2: Mechanisms to Mobilize Resources to the NET
The National Education Trust (NET): The NET will be the vehicle through which the MOE will
secure a consistent and reliable source of funds to support capital programs in education with a
particular focus on, but not limited to, infrastructure. Mechanisms will be established to attract
funding from the Diaspora, the private sector, and other sources. The work of the NET will
comprise: (a) management of an endowment fund; (b) employment of alternative methods for
school construction and maintenance, such as Public-Private Partnerships (PPP); (c) technical
services to establish guidelines for school design, school construction, environmental safeguards,
and supervision; and (d) support for capital programs in education. The Project will support: (a)
training for NET and other relevant GOJ staff in the implementation of public-private partnerships;
and (b) carrying out of a marketing campaign to mobilize resources for the NET.

 Component 3 – Communications, Project Management and Monitoring & Evaluation
This component covered the required management and administrative support for effective
implementation of the loan programme. The loan supported:

Communications: The ESTP entails fundamental structural changes of the education system and
it will have a substantial impact on all the stakeholders, including MOE staff, education officers,
school principals, teachers, parents, and students. Engaging all stakeholders and sustaining their
interest and support for the ESTP is fundamental to the success of the transformation process. The
project will support implementation of a communications strategy to raise public awareness and


                                                 66
seek support for the ESTP, including the carrying out of; (a) public meetings on the ESTP across
Jamaica for all interested citizens; (b) stakeholder consultations for the new agencies; (c) internal
consultations on the human resource policy for the MOE staff; and (d) media campaigns.

Project Management: The project was implemented by a Change management Unit (CMU),
which has been established within the MOE to oversee the entire ESTP, including those activities
financed by the Bank and other inter-national development partners (IDB). The project provided
support to the CMU in its oversight of the ESTP, including the hiring of staff, provision of training
and of necessary equipment and materials, and other operational costs.

Monitoring & Evaluation: The CMU gave oversight to the annual external audits of project
finances, and was supported by the MOE’s Programme Monitoring & Evaluation Unit (PM&EU)
in the M& E related activities which included both process and summative evaluations. The project
funded the conduct of the audits, consultants to conduct the evaluations and provision of necessary
equipment.

Though the three broad components did not change, with the reformulation of the loan in 2012,
there were expansion of activities under components 1 and 2 in particular; these included the change
from establishing REAs (please refer to note 4 on page 2 and note 6 on page 4), to re-engineering
the Ministry into a policy focused Central Ministry with an operational arm, the Department of
School services. This brought added activities and benefits as it lead to the establishment in
collaboration with JTC of 63 Quality Education Circles (QECs) to form community of practices
with the loan providing funding to equip Teacher Resource Centres (TRCs), one in each QEC. The
change also brought to the fore the need to take a critical look at how schools were structured to
assume the increasing demands being placed on them. This resulted in the commissioning of a
study to undertake an “Institutional Analysis of Schools”. The resulting expanded functions of the
CM & DSS also lead to an imperative to build staff capacity to responding to a strategic focus on
support for school improvement which demanded skills which were previously not specifically
required such as in the areas of Project Management, Lean Six Sigma (LSS), Data Analysis, and
Monitoring & Evaluation. The loan resources was applied to providing support for the
establishment of an Enterprise School Management System (ESMS) through funding technical
assistance of an EMIS Project Manager and providing support for Phase I of the design and
implementation of the ESMS, support for an expanded HR and document management systems
leading to improved institutional management capacity. The reformulated loan also provided
critical support for the resulting HR transitioning activities including the implementation of a
Performance Monitoring & Appraisal System (PMAS) and initiatives under a staff welfare
component which included mind set change activities informed by culture change required lines of
action made necessary from the modernisation and re-engineering activities. The loan resources
were applied to enable the organisational development activities demanded from the change from
existing institutional arrangements to the CM & DSS and the emergence of new agencies. Under
component 2, the reformulation of the loan resulted in the provision originally allocated for an
extensive marketing programme was reallocated to provide for the development of a
comprehensive marketing plan, a design of a financial an investment system to facilitate NET’s
involvement in managing an endowment fund. These changes lead to the need to rethink the
appropriateness of NET’s structure to meet its mandate, which lead to a review of the organisational
development actions inclusive of development of a functional profile and three (3) year business
plan.

The reformulation of the loan included provision of support in the CMU with the addition of a
Quality Assurance Officer to give support to the programme Director as the complex nature of the
modernisation and transformation demanded to ensure efficacy and faithfulness of implementation.


                                                 67
1.5. Physical Targets & Eligible Expenditures: Specific activities identified for financing include
operational activities related to the establishment and operations of the NEI, JTC, NCEL, CM &
DSS (REAs), NET and the CMU. The details related to the physical targets and eligible
expenditures are shown in Appendix 10.2.

2. Factors Affecting Implementation and Achievements

2.1 Project Achievements: At the end of the loan period (March 31, 2015) the project had met and
in some instances exceeded the targets set. Please refer to results matrix at Appendix 10.4 for
details. The modernization activities which the loan supported saw to the establishment and
capacity building by providing fellowships and systems to enable efficient operations in the
Ministry and the following agencies – the NET, NEI, JTC & NCEL, and the CM & DSS. The
project also, provided support for organisational development activities, a marketing campaign and
the establishment of a financial and investment system for NET. All agencies are operational.

2.2. NET obtained its legal status having been incorporated as a government company in December
2010. NET has provided oversight for construction activities in 19 school construction activities
exceeding the target of 10. Though it has not been able to implement any PPP activities it has
worked in close collaboration with the Development Bank of Jamaica and the Ministry of Finance
to try to overcome the obstacles posed by Jamaica’s current economic               circumstances. It
has, under the directive of its Board defined its purpose and developed its 3 year business plan. Its
financial system has been designed to support its ability to receive and manage an endowment fund.
NET has launched its marketing campaign and has engaged with donors who have provided support
through donations of various gifts and donations in-kind to support education. Its online portal has
capacity to provide for cloud funding, reaching out to Jamaicans in the diaspora, as well as others
wishing to donate funds to support education.

2.3. The NEI has developed a rigorous inspection system and inspection handbook and has
completed inspection of all public institutions in Jamaica at the primary and secondary levels (953
or 100%), thus providing for the first time in Jamaica’s history a baseline of school performance
from which to inform empirically, the Ministry of Education’s support and initiatives aimed at
improved performance and school improvement. At the end of the project, the school
improvement plans of 90% of the schools inspected were informed by their school inspection
reports. The NEI has provided policy recommendation and valuable information to support school
improvement. Over 90% of school inspection reports have been published as targeted and in excess
of 357 contract inspectors trained exceeding the target set of 290. At the end of the loan programme
the NEI had in place an inspection system enabled through the use of technology that is efficient
and cost effective. The NEI participated in island wide consultations on the “School
Improvement-Special Measures Policy” which will be implemented as a result of NEI inspection
and recommendations. The NEI is negotiating with the Ministry of Education in the Turks & Caicos
Islands (TCI) to develop an inspection system for that country, it will also be hosting the Permanent
Secretary of the Belize Ministry of Education in September to showcase its inspection system
and further its Regional outreach.

2.4. The JTC had registered 95% of the 25,000 teaches in the Jamaican education system as
targeted. The original target was also to have begun licencing of teachers, however this requires
legislative authority and though the requisite legislation was drafted and extensive consultation
done, persistent resistance from the body representing teachers (the Jamaica Teachers Association
[JTA]), the bill has not yet been approved. It is expected that the bill which has been sent by the
Chief parliamentary Council for final review will be tabled in Parliament by June 2015. The JTC


                                                 68
has however been providing support for the professional development of teachers through the 63
QECs with 85% of teachers trained in collaboration with the DSS done within their QEC. The JTC
has revised and implemented a “Beginning Teacher” mentorship programme. It has also been
promoting efforts to raise the standing of the profession and recognising excellence in the
profession through annual awards to teachers during international teachers’ week in October each
year since 2009. The JTC’s teacher management information system is in place to support
registration and licencing of teachers. The portal will be the host of the JTC’s journal of best
practices. The Council has collaborated with the MOE’s Core Curriculum Unit in training of
college lecturers in respect of the National Standard Curriculum (NSC). The JTC is a leading
member of the international association of teaching councils.

 2.5. The NCEL began training of sitting Principals in 2012 and to date has trained 613 Principals
and Education Officers under its Effective Principals Training Programme (EPTP). The College,
under contract with the UWI, has also certified 38 aspiring Principals under the Aspiring Principals
Training Programme at the level of a diploma. The College has also developed a peer coaching
programme and programmes to improve performance of school bursars, leadership of mathematics
instruction by Principals and is currently developing leadership programmes for other levels of
leadership in the education sector including at the tertiary level. NCEL has been awarded for its
innovative programmes by the Canadian Development Office in its “Bright Star” awards
programme in 2014. The College has extended its reach and has commenced training of Principals
in the British Virgin Island and has received requests from other Caribbean territories to extend its
Principals training programmes to these countries.

2.6. Approval for the establishment of a re-engineered MOE through a Central Ministry focused
on policy, setting of standards and quality assuring delivery of education services along with its
operational arm the Department of School Services (DSS) has been obtained from the Minister
of Education and the Permanent Secretary and a Cabinet Submission along with the functional
profile, modernised organisational structure and operations manuals has been prepared. Job
descriptions for the changed functions are 53% completed and a Performance Monitoring &
Accountability System (PMAS) was rolled out in April 2014 to ensure improved system
accountability. Transitioning to new jobs in the Ministry and emerging agencies has commenced
and is 20% completed. Capacity building through various training programmes has seen over 463
fellowships provided to build the capacity of staff to meet the demands of the CM & DSS (includes
competencies in school improvement planning in all the Regions). Under funding provided through
the DSS allocation 3,461 school board members in all Regions have been trained. A number of
operations manuals to guide the new work processes of the CM & DSS have been developed and
a school improvement planning manual designed to support schools and guide the work of the
education officers in the Regions of the DSS in how they provide support to schools.

 2.7. Though not funded by the World Bank, the Jamaica Tertiary Education Commission (J-
TEC) has received support from the Bank through consultation, reports on the tertiary sector and
significant connections being facilitated. The modernisation programme also saw to the legal
establishment of a National Parenting Support Commission (NPSC) funded by the GOJ that will
enhance the activities of the modernised Ministry by strengthening the home/school relationship.

2.8. The legislative agenda is significantly advanced with all the required legislation and
consequential amendments to the Education Act, a School Improvement – Special Measures Policy
to empower the Ministry’s intervention in chronically underperforming schools will be detailed
in the Education Regulations and the special education and security and safety policies prepared
and consultations as required undertaken for some policies and pending for others (Special
education & Safety and Security). The various pieces of legislation and policies are awaiting


                                                 69
approval. The JTC and J-TEC legislation are expected to be tabled in Parliament during the summer
sitting (June).

 2.9. Project Management, Operations Plan & Governance Arrangements: Project
management was part of the overall responsibility of the Director of the ESTP in guiding, managing
and coordinating project activities related to procurement, financial management project planning,
scheduling and monitoring of the implementation of the project activities. (Please see project
schedule at Appendix 10.1). These activities were coordinated with other activities of the ESTP
funded by the GOJ and IDB. The activities complemented each other in supporting and enabling
the activities of the transformation and modernisation programme managed through the Change
Management Unit (CMU) of the ESTP. Operations plans were set annually and monitored monthly
through a comprehensive review committee involving all areas of the programme. Weekly
performance monitoring meetings were conducted with CMU staff to ensure the programme
remained on target as well as, to resolve issues that arise. Critical process owners were identified
to lead in the development of programme activities, guiding the development and implementation
of activities. The governance arrangements for oversight included a Steering Committee Chaired
by the Permanent Secretary (PS) of the Ministry which initially met quarterly and eventually (from
2012) met every six months. For the oversight of the modernisation of the Ministry which saw to
the establishment of new entities as well as, the re-engineering of the core Ministry, a
Modernisation Management Team (MMT) was established with representation from a wide cross
section of Ministry staff, this working group Chaired by the Director, ESTP provided guidance, a
discussions forum and gave strategic input to the modernisation effort. The MMT reported to a
Modernisation Steering Committee (MSC) Chaired by the Minister of Education and Co-Chaired
by the PS. The MSC is comprised of union representatives and members from the Ministry Of
Finance, the Cabinet Office and the Planning Institute of Jamaica and was the body that approved
and or sanctioned change initiatives and plans, prior to seeking national approval from Jamaica’s
Cabinet.

 2.10. Stakeholder Communications: The project has exceeded targets set for stakeholder
communications. Thirty staff meetings to inform on the modernisation were conducted which
exceeded target of 27. Monthly newsletters (The Educator) were produced over the life of the loan
as well as, semi-annual publications of the Transformation News which had a wide circulation
across the sector to inform on the modernisation of the Ministry. In excess of 55 public
consultations, in keeping with the target, were conducted to garner public buy-in for legislative and
policy changes as well as, changes in teaching and learning consequent on the transformation of
the sector. In addition, outreach to engage the public with respect to promoting the brand for new
and emerging agencies were done using various media such as radio, television and the press. A
supplement was produced and circulated in one of the daily newspapers giving national exposure
to the transformation initiative and agenda.

2.11 Factors Affecting Implementation & Impact: There were no factors in the design of the
programme that had an impact on implementation, evidenced by the fact that over the life of the
loan programme the basic components remained unchanged. The reformulation of the loan allowed
for emerging lines of action that complemented the activities of the programme which were not
envisaged at the design phase to be included. Two factors had a significant impact on
implementation were (i) procurement and (ii) the changing economic environment in Jamaica.
Procurement experienced delays due to the very bureaucratic processes for large (in value) services;
specifically the procurement of the NEI inspection system experienced delays both due to the local
process as well as, delays at the level of the Bank. This in part affected the project’s time line which
influenced the extension of the loan programme. There were also difficulties experienced in
identifying the appropriate consultants to provide services necessitating undertaking the


                                                  70
procurement process more than once which adversely affected the programme schedule in more
than one instance. The significant devaluation of the Jamaican dollar vis-a-vie the US dollar also
affected implementation along with the restrictions place on government expenditure consequent
on the GOJ entering into agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This affected the
approved budgetary limits granted the project from 2012 to the current period. The net effect is that
the project will not drawdown the loan in its entirety, estimated balance to be written back is about
US$200K. Additionally, the project recorded significant foreign exchange fluctuations of
approximately US$27,581.

Of note however the method of project execution lead by MOE process owners proved to be
positive in gaining buy-in and acceptance as in the development process a number of key MOE
staff were engaged working with the support of consultants in framing the work often modernised
MOE and the new agencies.

2.12 Main Beneficiary’s Relationship with the Bank & Quality of Supervision and Support:
The quality of the supervision provided by the two (2) TTLs is rated as satisfactory over the life of
the loan programme. Support was provided as needed and opportunities for enhancement of
development objectives enabled. Missions led by the TTL were productive and provided
opportunity to clarify and resolve issues. The TTL over the latter period of the loan programme
was also very supportive and sensitive to the issues confronted by the programme and provided
guidance and advocacy in overcoming some of the issues faced by the programme. This was
particularly appreciated in relation to the procurement of the NEI inspection system which
experienced significant delays which threatened to result in a call of mis-procurement. The support
in articulating the issues allowed for the Bank to provide an extension to the execution period and
a redesign of the procurement to satisfy the loan modalities. The quality of the supervision was
very effective and consequently contributed positively to the programme achieving its objectives.

3.0     Monitoring & Evaluation, Design, Implementation & Utilization

3.1 Monitoring & Evaluation Plan: The M&E design consisted of process, formative and
summative evaluations. The M&E plan commenced with 3 scheduled process monitoring actions
which were designed to provide guidance and influence change in approach as identified from
objective review. Three such evaluations were conducted between 2011 and 2013. Formative
evaluations were used to gain insight into particular activities to validate or otherwise change
approaches, this included evaluation of the NEI inspection process and the evaluation of the impact
of NEI inspection reports. The summative evaluation was essentially an end of project evaluation
designed to assess the efficacy of the implementation, the degree to which development objectives
were met and to assess the status of implementation across all components of the project. The
original plan had a mid-term M&E planned, this however coincided with the Bank’s mid-term
assessment and it was agreed that the mid-term summative evaluation would not have added much
value as the purpose for the mid-term evaluation was achieved by the Bank’s mid-term evaluation
mission. Importantly, in 2012 a monitoring framework was developed which provided indicators
for the ex-post evaluation of the ESTP.

3.2 Implementation of the M&E Plan: The plan was implemented using consultant services for
the process monitoring evaluations and the summative evaluation. This was a key element of the
implementation as it allowed for objective review and assessment of the approach and methodology
employed under the programme. Formative evaluation was carried out by the Programme
Monitoring & Evaluation Unit of the Ministry, where information and recommendations were
provided to guide or inform change on specific areas of the programme’s focus as the needed. This
proved a cost effective and efficient way to obtain timely feedback on specific issues hence


                                                 71
reducing risk levels.

3.3 Utilization of M&E Information: The findings from the various M&E activities were used to
make adjustments to approaches to execution, changes in processes (NEI) and to modify
implementation of activities based on feedback. The process monitoring reports were used to
inform how the project activities were tracked; action items from the monthly review meetings
were aged by use of colour coding action items based on the period outstanding which allowed for
effective tracking of outstanding issues and the review meetings also proved useful where inter-
connections between components were useful and improved efficiency where activities were
linked. This tool also provided early information on which to assess the efficacy of the execution
of lines of action against the project objectives. The institution of an M&E plan early in
implementation proved invaluable in the management and coordination of the activities of the
programme. It should also be pointed out that the annual audits of the project were also useful in
ensuring that all compliance matters were addressed and that the due diligence process and
compliance of the financial process was being followed.

4. Fiduciary & Compliance Report

4.1 Financial Management:
The programme’s financial management came under the direction of the CMU and executed the
disbursement of loan funds in line with the broad components of the loan as defined in the PAD;
there were however movements between sub-components based on agreed changes defined in the
reformulation of the loan in 2012. There were four (4) financial audits of the programme done
annually from 2010/11 to 2013/14 undertake by the Auditor General. All audits were deemed
satisfactory, substantially satisfying all the required fiduciary and compliance conditions for good
financial management. The financial process was guided by a set of standards as documented in
the programme’s “Accounting Procedures Manual”. The project was compliant with all contractual
clauses as detailed in the loan contract in respect of financial audits, submission of reports
(including the IFURs) as required and met all the required DLTs for drawdown of loan funds as
scheduled. In respect of the procurement plan, the goods and services listed to be undertaken by
the project was able to complete over 97% of activities planned. This is significant given that
there was significant devaluation of the Jamaican dollar against the US dollar with the exchange
rate moving from US$1=US$85.5 in 2009/10 to US$1= J$115.7 at the end of the project. The
foreign exchange loss under this project is estimated at US$27,581 as at the end of February 2015.

5. Actions for Sustainability – Post Completion Operations

5.1 Transition Arrangements: Transition of project activities to emerging agencies and the core
Ministry are in place and was enabled due to the inclusive way activities were executed. The
activities were executed by identifying process owners from within the Ministry who lead in the
development of the various activities supported by the loan. The same is true for those who head
the agencies that have been established and are operational – they lead as the process owner.
Activities are therefore institutionalised as the agencies become operational creating very
favourable conditions for sustainability. It is of note that in the 2015/16 budget the agencies were
given their own budget with their own programme numbers, a very clear signal for sustainability.

5.2 Technical, Financial & Institutional Arrangements: The new and emerging agencies are
staffed with the technical expertise required for their sustainability and from inception staff cost
was being funded through the Ministry of Education’s recurrent budget allocation. The financial
arrangements for the sustainability of operations are reflected in the GOJ’s budget allocation for
the Ministry of Education for the financial year beginning April 2015. The institutional


                                                72
 arrangements for the sustainability of the new functional arrangements are substantially in place.
 NET is incorporated as a government company under the direction of a Board of Directors. The
 framework document for the NEI was completed and Cabinet submission prepared to commence
 the legal establishment for the NEI as an Executive Agency; the JTC will be established legally
 as a statutory body as soon as its support legislation is made into law. This is expected to be tabled
 in Parliament by June 2015; the NCEL’s functional profile was completed and Cabinet Submission
 drafted for approval to have that body legally established as a support agency of the MOE. Other
 agencies though not funded by the World Bank (J-TEC, NPSC) are also advanced with the NPSC
 already legally establish by law as a Commission; J-TEC’s legislation is drafted and is also
 expected to be tabled during the current legislative period in parliament. The Central Ministry and
 DSS functional profile are completed and approved and the modernised organisational structure
 completed; 20% of staff has transitioned into the new agencies and the Central Ministry. All
 agencies are operational.

 5.3 Staffing & Management: The agencies though not yet operating at full staff complement have
 between 40 – 70 per cent of their staff complement in place. For the Central Ministry and DSS, the
 full staff complement will be subject to the transitioning process and the approval of the MOF. Risk
 level is low.

 5.4 Policies & Legislative Arrangements: The review for the Special Education Policy was
 completed and consultations as required have been scheduled. The Cabinet Note for the operations
 of the CM & DSS structure has been prepared for submission once the organisational development
 work is finalised. The Cabinet Submission supported by the NEI’s framework has been submitted
 for Cabinet’s approval; the School Improvement /Special measures policy is completed, regional
 consultations on the policy are also completed and the policy document circulated for MDA
 consultations; the Safety & Security Policy is 95% completed; the review and recommendations
 for changes to the Education Act and Regulations is completed and drafting instructions are
 prepared, final review of the JTC Bill was completed and final drafting instructions are being
 prepared for submission to the CPC for preparation of draft Bill for tabling in Parliament by June
 2015. The same is expected for the bill for the J-TEC.

  5.5 Performance Indicators for Impact Evaluation: In 2012 a study was commission to develop
 performance indications to be used for impact evaluation. The study notes that “These current
 reform efforts acknowledge that while the main thrust behind the national urgency for education
 transformation is poor student performance, the operational efforts must also, of necessity, address
 institutional as well as instructional issues facing the system. The ESTP aims at ensuring more
 effective and efficient education service delivery by expanding access, improving teaching and
 learning, and transforming the governance structure of the education system.” The study along
 with the performance indications of the TFR and those detailed in the NESP (a deliverable of the
 ESTP) are comprehensive indicators for impact evaluation.

6.1. Relevance of    The objectives as outline in the result matrix proved relevant and the design of the
objectives, design   project was also effective and valid meeting the needs of the MOE’s
& implementation     transformation agenda. The design for implementation with a CMU integrated into the
                     operations of the MOE created an integrated matrix operation that proved effective for     Highly
                     sustainability and institutionalisation of the project goals and objectives which        satisfactory
                     remained relevant as they continue to be in line with       Jamaica’s national
                     development goals. The project design was therefore rated as highly satisfactory.




6.2. Quality         The QA monitoring reports & results matrix were effective for monitoring outputs
Assurance            which was useful to ensuring project performance and achievement remained on

6.3.                 Implementation of any change process can be difficult and particularly so for complex
Implementation &     organisations, the project therefore faced typical challenges of time, culture and
Utilization Report   competing demands but was able nonetheless to achieve substantially the targets,
                     (exceeding in some instances) and objectives set. The M&E strategy was important in        Highly
                     ensuring expectations were met.                                                          satisfactory



6.4. Achievement     The development objective was to build capacity of the emerging key agencies (NEI,
of development       JTC, NET, NCEL, and CM & DSS) to support the transformation of the education               Highly

     Assessment

 6.7.  Unintended     There were some unintended outcomes due to required added project activities which
 outcomes & impact    were not in the initial design. These were (i) the institutional analysis of schools which
                      provided far reaching recommendations for the restructuring of the management and              Satisfactory
                      leadership      structure of schools; these            recommendations will take the
                      transformation of the sector to the ultimate level of the reform (ii) activities related
                      to culture and mind-set change which treated with how staff embraced change and
                      consequently how accepting they are of the change; (iii) support for a PMAS for
                      improve accountability, which is one of the primary goals of             transformation
                      and (iv) the realignment of the MOE’s business and operational plan and budget in
                      keeping with the modernised structure and functions (V) the governance structure and
                      HR Transition policy employed ensured the participation of staff and guidelines for
                      how staff would be treated in transitioning. These added lines of action contributed to
                      improve system efficiency and performance and a change process not charged with
                      protest and resistance. The effects of these changes had a positive impact on the
                      overall change agenda.

                     The risk level was negligible to low as the project objectives were
                     seen as priorities.




7.2.                 The Jamaican economy saw declining fortunes over the 4 year period           Effective contract negotiations and
Economic/Financia    of      execution with the exchange rate moving from US$1=J$85.55            significant input from project and
l                    to US$1= J$116 which impacted the project and cost of activities and         Ministry staff in executing project
                     significant level of foreign exchange loss. The macro-economic               activities.
                     changes as a result of the agreement with the IMF impacted budgetary
                     allocations, particularly over the last two years, due to shrinking fiscal
                     space this affected the pace of execution and ability to achieve full
                     drawdown of the loan. The risk level is assessed as significant.




                                                                75

                      the gains from the project would be sustained and supported as a         substantially implemented and the
                      priority of the MOE. The economic condition and tight fiscal             effective stakeholder
                      monitoring imposed due to Jamaica’s relationship with the IMF is         communication facilitated
                      cause for caution, hence risk level is assessed as moderate              significant buy-in for the
                                                                                               objectives of the programme.

     8.1. Assessment of Bank Performance:
      The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry and supported effective
     implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate transition arrangements for regular     Satisfactory
     operation of supported activities after the loan/credit closing) towards the achievement of development outcomes.


     8.2. Assessment of Borrower Performance:
      The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing agency or agencies) ensured
     quality of preparation and implementation and complied with covenants and agreements, towards the achievement       Satisfactory
     of development outcomes.


           9.0. Lessons Learned

           9.1.     There were issues related to the nature of the project which impacted execution of the
           project within the timeframe originally design which possibly may not have been factored during
           project preparation. The project was design to support a change process which was complex as it
           would be implemented while the current obligations of the MOE would have to be met. This
           resulted in competing demands on the time of staff to work through the change process while
           attending to the current demands for delivery of education services. For projects of this nature
           greater flexibility needs to be factored in establishing timelines for execution. In the future for
           projects that involve complex change processes which are not clear-cut actions a three year period
           of execution should not be considered. Projects of this nature should be phased.

           9.2.     Another significant factor that had an impact was the changing economic circumstances,
           particularly the fact of the agreement entered into by Jamaica with the IMF. This had the effect of
           changing the GOJ’s legislative priorities; most noticeably was the priority that had to be given to
           legislative reforms to support the agreement with the IMF. Given that only the Chief Parliamentary
           Council can draft legislation, those areas of the MOE legislative reforms were not given the
           immediate attention that may have been factored or expected at loan signing. The sensitivity and
           awareness of the Bank to the impact of this was not immediately recognised. So too was the impact
           on the targets and conditions which affected fiscal space and hence budgetary allocation and the



                                                               76
pace of execution. The support provided by the Bank’s supervisory office and the understanding of
the changed circumstances enabled the project to respond creditably to these significant macro-
economic changes. For future consideration, where significant macro-economic change occurs
during execution of a project which significantly departs from the economic assessment done in
the project appraisal document (PAD), it is recommended that a review of targets and timelines
which assesses the likely impact on the project should be a standard procedure facilitated by a
special loan appraisal mission.

9.3. On the part of the executing agency, the changes in administrative and political leadership
meant that for such a significant change process, time had to be spent to brief and convince new
leadership on the path and or approach taken in the change process. This unplanned delay affected
time and which was not given due consideration on how this impacted on the project’s timeframe.
Change in political leadership as well as, administrative leadership will always slow the pace of
action as time is required to brief and obtain buy-in from new leadership. In this instance the
significance of the change and the possibility that the new leadership would be accountable for the
change is an important factor to be given due consideration. In the future where change in
administrations is likely to occur during project execution, the planned life of the project should
establish a reasonable time for any likely adjustment or re-prioritisation to be factored.

9.4.    Harmonisation of certain administrative functions would have had a positive impact on
project execution, perhaps reducing some of the bureaucracy surrounding procurement and
financial audits which were done separately for the World Bank and the IDB.

9. 5.    On a positive note, the mode of execution where a CMU was established to support the
executing agency (MOE) and the emergence of process owners for the various change process was
a significant enabling factor. This model can serve for other projects of a similar nature in the
future.

9.6.    Also of importance were the mechanisms created to allow for cross agency discussion (the
monthly Project Review Meeting), the MMT and the frequency of staff meetings designed to
provide updates as the modernisation was progressed. The early use of M&E also had a positive
impact on outcomes, as well as, support provided by consultants who shared their expertise that got
the change process off to a good start.
