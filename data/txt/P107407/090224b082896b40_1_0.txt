                         The Project continues to make good progress in building the capacity of the key institutions established to support the ESTP. The capacity of the National Education Inspectorate
                         (NEI) and Department of School Services (DSS) continue to increase, as evidenced by 89 percent of schools that have been inspected implementing school improvement plans
                         reflecting recommendations made in the NEI school inspections, with the assistance of the DSS (compared to end-of-Project target of 90 percent). Capacity of the Jamaica Teaching

                         and 24 percent of school principals being certified (compared to end-of-Project target of 35 percent). The National Education Trust (NET) is providing project management services/
