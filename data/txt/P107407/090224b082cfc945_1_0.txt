Project Development Objectives

 Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
 The objective of the Project is to build the capacity of the emerging key agencies (National Education Inspectorate, JamaicaTeaching Council,
 Regional Education Authorities, and National Education Trust) that are being established to support the national Education System Transformation
 Programme (ESTP). The Objective of the ESTP is to improve the efficiency, accountability and performance of the different levels of the education
 system.


 Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project Objective?
 Yes

Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The Project has achieved its objective of building the capacity of the key institutions established to support the ESTP. The capacity of the National
 Education Inspectorate (NEI) and Department of School Services (DSS) continue to increase, as evidenced by 90 percent of schools that have been
 inspected implementing school improvement plans reflecting recommendations made in the NEI school inspections, with the assistance of the DSS
 (compared to end-of-Project target of 90 percent). Capacity of the Jamaica Teaching Council (JTC) and National Council of Education Leadership
 (NCEL) is demonstrated by 95 percent of teachers being registered (compared to end-of-Project target of 95 percent) and 60 percent of school
 principals being certified (compared to end-of-Project target of 35 percent). The National Education Trust (NET) is providing project management
 services/oversight to 19 school construction projects (compared to end-of-Project target of 10 projects). A systematic and structured transitioning to the
 Central Ministry and DSS has been set in motion, with 435 staff trained and 20 percent of new positions filled (compared to end-of-Project target of 10
 percent of new positions filled).

 Overall Comments
 The reform of MoE is underpinned with a strong legal framework, some of which is already in place. A review of the Education Act was
 undertaken and drafting instructions for amendments have been prepared for the Act and Regulations to take into account the various reforms
 being pursued under the ESTP. National Commission for Education has reviewed these revisions and subsidiary legislation is slotted for
 Parliament in June, 2015. A School Improvement and Special Measures Policy provides for prescribed standards and performance measures,
 which are reflected in the revised Education Regulations.
