Dear Minister:
Re: Loan 7815-JM (Education Transformation Capacity Building Project)
Amendment to the Loan Agreement
We refer to your letter dated January 9, 2014, and subsequent discussions to amend one of the
Disbursement Linked Targets (DLT).
I am pleased to inform you that Schedule 4 (Disbursement-Linked Targets) is amended by
deleting the following target, namely "licensing system fully established by JTC" and substituting
it with "at least 20,000 teachers registered by the JTC."
All other provisions of the Agreement, as amended hereby, shall remain in full force and effect.
Please confirm your agreement to the amendment by signing and dating it. Upon receipt by the
Bank of a fully signed original of this Amendment letter, this Amendment will become effective
as of the date of countersignature.
Sincerely yours,
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR
RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
