based on the successful\n            completion of the reform program; the government's\n            Budget Law 2000 which incorporates the results of many of\n            the agreed policy measures, particularly in the area of tax\n            and tariff reform; and continued Bank support for\n            Mauritania's reform program under the Fiscal Support\n            Operation, a new project approved in May 2000. World Bank\n            performance is adjudged fully satisfactory while the\n            Borrower's performance is satisfactory. The main lesson\n            emerging from this project is the importance of building\n            true partnerships with the Borrower. Mauritania's\n            relationship with the Bank is characterized by a frank,\n            wide-ranging and constructive dialogue on the development\n            agenda that included joint analytical work on fiscal reform\n            and public expenditure management; solid work in key\n            economic sectors; consultative group meetings; full\n            participation of beneficiaries in preparing, designing, and\n            implementing projects; and effective outreach to the private\n            sector and to nongovernmental organizations. However, the\n            Bank needs to devote sufficient time to building commitment\n            to the program at the political and administrative levels;\n            carefully assessing the sequencing and the timing of the\n            reforms; working closely with local counterparts; ensuring\n            donor coordination; conducting close and constructive\n            supervision in partnership with local authorities."}, "docdt": "2000-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
