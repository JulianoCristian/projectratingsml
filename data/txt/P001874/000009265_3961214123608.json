         Resource Management Credit Project is to improve economic\n            management capacity, strengthen and deepen recent fiscal\n            gains, improve the efficiency of the allocation and\n            management of public expenditure and increase domestic\n            savings.  The project consists of the following two\n            components: 1) a policy reform program, which aims at: (a)\n            improving domestic resource mobilization by broadening and\n            diversifying the tax base;  and (b) improving public\n            expenditure allocation and management by preparing a\n            three-year rolling public expenditure program that is\n            consistent with the macroeconomic framework and oriented\n            toward poverty reduction; and 2) a capacity building\n            program, which will focus on: (a) improving the\n            organizational structures and administrative procedures of\n            five key ministries (Planning including the Office Nationale\n            Statistique, Finance, Fisheries, Commerce and Industry); and\n            (b) improving economic policy-making capacity by\n            strengthening the Technical Secretariat of the\n            Interministerial Committee for Economic Policy."}, "docdt": "1996-05-21T00:00:00Z"}
