The\n            purpose of this environmental analysis is to: improve\n            decision-making and to ensure that the project options under\n            consideration are environmentally sound and sustainable; to\n            recognize environmental consequences early in the project\n            cycle and take these consequences into account in project\n            selection, siting, planning design and execution; and to\n            identify ways to improve projects environmentally, by\n            preventing, minimizing, mitigating or compensating for\n            adverse impacts and avoiding the need for costly remedial\n            measures after the fact. Environmental investigations can\n            also provide formal mechanisms for interagency coordination\n            on environmental issues; for addressing concerns of affected\n            groups and local nongovernmental organizations (NGOs); and\n            for building environmental management capabilities within\n            borrower countries."}, "docdt": "1994-05-26T00:00:00Z"}
