MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF TX  PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXRCUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSEIV CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BANGLADESH
FOR A SECOND ROAD REHABILITATION AND MA.INTENANCE P!.OJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
recommendation on a proposed development credit to the People's Republic of
Bangladesh for SDR 103.9 million (US$ 146.8 million equivalent) to help
finance a Second Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project. The proposed
credit would be on standard IDA terms, with a maturity of 40 years. The
project would be cofinanced on grant terms by the Overseas Development
Administration (ODA-UK, £6.4 million).
SECTOR BACKGROUND
2.        Transport Sector and the Economv.  Bangladesh's surface transport
system is severely constrained by geography and climate, and air transport has
so far had limited impact. Consisting mainly of a flat alluvial plain, the
country is criss-crossed by rivers including some of the world's largest. The
current transport system consists of a road network of over 13,000 kilometers
(km) of paved roads and 150,000 km of unpaved roads, served by a predominantly
private road transport industry; a government-owned and heavily subsidized
railway comprising 2,800 km of track; and a resilient and relatively efficient
inland water transport system, dominated by private carriers, covering 5,200
km to 8,300 km of waterways depending upon the season. The country's seaborne
commerce is handled by two deep water ports (Mongla and Chittagong), and there
is a small but growing civil aviation subsector. Traditional forms of
transport--wind, animal and human power--continue to play an important role in
road and water transport. The relative roles of the transport modes are
evolving, with road traisport expanding at the expense mainly of the railway,
particularly for freight.
3.        Bangladesh has witnessed rapid growth in t-ansport demand since the
mid-1970s, more than 8 per annum (p.a.) for passenger and 6% p.a. for freight
traffic; demand for road transport has increased at an even faster pace of
about 10% p.a.  This compares with a GDP growth of some 4% p.a. over the same
period. Nevertheless, transport intensities in Bangladesh are lower than in
many neighboring countries, and the personal mobility level is still less than
half that of India and only one sixth that of '.nailand. Transport
requirements are expected to intensify further as the country moves from a
subsistence to a more market-based economy. Poverty alleviation is the
overriding objective of the Government's (GOB's) development strategy. Having
achieved macroeconomic stability, GOB must now direct its efforts toward
accelerating the economy's growth and employment g3neration. While most of
the growth is expected to come from the private sector, public investment in
physical infrastructure, including transport, and human resource development
are essential enabling conditions for private investment. Transport accounts
for about 12% of investments under GOB's three-year rolling investment program
(FY93-95), of which roads account for about 64*. The transport sector as a
whole generates about as much revenue for GOB as it requires in recurrent
expenditures, although on a subsectural basis only ports and roads cover their
costs.



-2-
4.        Bangladesh: Transport Sector Review (Report No. 9414-BD, June 25,
1991), prepared by Bank staff with substantive participation by government
ministries and other sector agencies involved in the transport sector and
concerned donors, gives a comnprehensive overview of the country's transport
sector, identifies the main constraints and opportunities, and proposes a
strategy for its future development, including policy and institutional
reforms and investment priorities. GOB has initiated action on many of the
report's recommendations and, with the assistance of further technical
assistance (United Nations Development Program/UNDP-funded, IDA-executed), is
developing a long-term integrated strategy for the transport sector, which
will form, the basis of future sector investment plans.
5.        Road Subsector.  The road subsector has been the most dynamic area
of transport development in Bangladesh since Independence, and now handles
nearly 70% of passenger and 60% of freight traffic. IDA's recently completed
Transport Sector Review concluces that the road subsector is functioning
reasonably well and identifies c!e major issues affecting its development as a
proliferation of road projects with poor budgetary controls, planning and pri-
oritization, inadequate maintenance and a poor safety record. GOB's subsector
strategy outlined in the Fourth Five Year Plan (FY91-95) broadly addresses
these concerns, and good progress has been already been made in each area.
First, after a delayed start-up, the Road Mast^: Plan (RMP) study (UNDP-
funded, Asian Development Bank/ADB-executed), based on the Bank' s Highway
Design and Maintenance Standards Model/Version III (HDM), was completed in
1992, providing GOB with an objective and efficient basis for planning future
investment and maintenance activities for its main road network (about 13,700
km of national, regional and type A feeder roads) under the responsibility of
the Roads and Highways Department (RHD). GOB has undertaken that future road
investments and maintenance works will substantially follow the RMP, which
will also provide the basis for annual updating of RHD's three-year rolling
investment program. One of the RMP study's fundamental recommendations is the
need for an intensive program of periodic maintenance, particularly asphalt
concrete overlays, on RHD's paved road network in order to defer more costly
rehabilitation and reconstruction of the more heavily trafficked roads in fair
to poor condition. Second, good progress has been made in implementing the
Road Maintenance Action Plan for RHD agreed under the ongoing Road Rehabilita-
tion and Maintenance Project (RRMP-I: Cr.1827-BD). RHD's maintenance budget
has increased in line with requirements, tripling since FY87; periodic
maintenance is now mostly contracted out (leaving only routine maintenance to
RHD force account); planning, monitoring and evaluation units have been set up
in RHD zonal offices; and the Road Materials and Standards Study (RMSS: 1992)
(European Union-funded) was completed. Third, UNDP and ADB have provided
assistance to the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA) in the area of
road safety, mostly in clarifying its legislative, regulatory and enforcement
functions; action to date has been mainly in the area of registration,
licensing and vehicle inspection.
6.        While actions have been taken on several fronts as noted above,
full implementation has yet to be effected in many cases (e.g., systematic
data collection/monitoring of road conditions has not commenced; RHD manage-
ment is not conversant with HDM and insufficient staff are trained in its use,
hence, it is not being used; RMSS findings have yet to be endorsed by RHD/GOB
and put into a practicable format for field application), and improvements are
needed in related areas of RHD's operations (e.g., supervision and quality
control of contractor's work is poor). Moreover, a road safety study is



urgently needed to design an action plan for targeted improvements. Follow-up
technical assistance to RHD, BRTA and the Communication Ministry's Roads and
Road Transport Division (RRTD) addressing these issues, among others, will be
provided under the proposed project. In addition, in line with the RMP
findings, the project will finance a 4-year time slice of the urgently needed
periodic maintenance works in western Bangladesh, as well as continuing the
rehabilitation work begun under RRMP-1; ADB's Road Overlay and Improvement
Project (approved in December 1993) provides similar assistance in areas east
of the Jamuna. To enable RHD to assume responsibility for periodic mainte-
nance over the longer term, GOB will need to continue annual increases ir.
RHD's maintenance budget. The main issues concerning local access roads under
the Local Government Engineering Department--road rehabilitation and
maintenance and construction of missing structures on otherwise completed
priority roads--are being addressed under ongoing/proposed rural road projects
funded by IDA, ADB and other donors.,
7.        Lessons Learned from Previous IDA Operations.  IDA's involvement in
the transport sector to date has included five lending operations for roads,
three for inland water, one for ports and several multi-sectoral operations
(e.g., rural development, fertilizer transport, and cyclone and flood
rehabilitation); of these, three road projects and one inland water project
are ongoing. Performance of the recent transport projects has been uneven,
but overall satisfactory. IDA has also been executing agency for selected
UNDP-funded projects (e.g., preparation of Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge Project
and implementation of Bangladesh Transport Sector Study).
S.        Of the five road projects, two have been completed, both of which
involved RRD, the implementing agency for the proposed project, and three are
ongoing, one of which involves RHD (RRMP-I: Cr.1827-BD). Because of GOB's
lack of commitment to improve its low construction standards and maintain the
existing network, IDA suspended lending for new road projects for several
years after the first two highway projects. Drawing on lessons learned under
these projects, the physical works under RRMP-I are being implemented in two
phases and the project includes extensive technical assistance. Physical
implementation of RRMP-I has generally been good and quality high; project
completion is expected on time in 1995. Because of a lack of transparency in
the process of prequalifying contractors under RRMP-I, more stringent criteria
are being used and contractors informed of their capacity limits at the time
of bid invitation under the proposed project. While implementation of the
institutional support components under RRMP-I has been slow, good progress has
been made in implementing the agreed Road Maintenance Action Plan and the
basic studies have been completed. These efforts now need to be consolidated
and made a part of RHD's everyday activities; this will be done through the
institutional development program under the proposed project. To ensure
timely start-up of project activities, selected contracts are being awarded
before Board presentation/credit effectiveness.
9.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  With poverty alleviation the
primary objective of development in Bangladesh, GOB's development strategy and
IDA's country assistance strategy (discussed by the Board on February 17,
1994) reflect the two-pronged approach to poverty alleviation outlined in the
1990 World Development Report--broadly based labor-intensive economic growth,
mainly from the private sector, but complemented by public investment in
physical infrastructure and human resource development to create the necessary
enabling environment. IDA's assistance strategy calls for continued efforts



-4-
to reduce infrastructure bottlenecks through physical investments in, and
maintenance of, transport infrastructure and institutional improvements in the
sector. The proposed project is consistent with this strategy and complements
IDA's three ongoing road projects. It follows up much of the work initiated
under RRMP-I and will, in particular, assist RMD to initiate implementation of
the Road Master Plan. The project supports physical implementation of a 4-
year time slice of the RMP's periodic maintenance program in the west and
helps develop RHD's institutional capacity to plan and implement such a
program. At the same time, it continues a limited program of rehabilitation
on the highest priority roads begun under RRMP-I and complements ADE's paral-
lel project for the east. Through a comprehensive institutional development
program, the project will assist RHD/GOB to bring together the key findings of
the recent studies and technical assistance provided under RRMP-I and other
donors' projects, -ad to operationalize them, so they can be used. ODA, which
has traditionally been involved with bridges in Bangladesh, is grant-financing
this component which it sees as critical to sustaining the subsector's-pro-
gress and contributing to the country's overall development. The project is
an important test case for new approaches to effecting land acquisition and
resettlement in Bangladesh, in line with the Bank's guidelines, on a smaller
scale than in the recently approved Jamuna Bridge Project (Cr.2569-BD).
THE PROJECT
10.       Proiect Obiectives.  The proposed project's overall objective is to
reduce the total cost of road transport on Bangladesn's most travelled roads
by improving the RHD road network through more effective planning, design and
construction (including reconstruction) of road investments and more effective
programming and implementation of road maintenance. More specifically, the
project assists RHD/GOB: (a) to initiate physical implementation of the RMP in
areas west of the Jamuna, thus preserving the country's capital base of road
infrastructure and improving high priority sections in a systematic manner;
and (b) to strengthen its institutional and technical capacity to plan and
program works, administer and supervise works contracts, and operate and
maintain the country's main road system.
11.       Proiect Description.  The project comprises three main components:
(a) road works--a 4-year time slice of RHD's Road Master Plan for national,
regional and type A feeder roads in western Bangladesh, including about 168 km
of rehabilitation, l00 km of widening to 2-lane standard and 1,800 km of
periodic maintenance (mainly asphalt concrete overlays and some resealing);
(b) project preparation and implementation support--consultancy services to
program and supervise implementation of the project road works, carry out
feasibility studies, detailed engineering and other preparatory work for
future priority road construction and improvement works, and assist in
planning, implementing and monitoring land acquisition and resettlement under
the project; and (c) institutional development--a 4-year program of integrated
support, including consultancy services, twinning arrangements, officer and
staff training, research and associated equipment, to RHD to improve its
planning, management and implementation of road works, RRTD to strengthen its
planning and economics capabilities, and BRTA to enhance its road traffic
safety efforts.
12.       The project cost is estimated at US$ 252.2 million equivalent, with
a foreign exchange component of US$ 119.5 million equivalent (47t) and taxes
and duties estimated at abott US$ 27.6 million equivalent.  IDA will finance



-5-
US$ 146.8 million equivalent (93% of the foreign exchange and 27% of local
costs); ODA will finance the remaining foreign exchange and a small amount of
local costs (US$ 8.8 million equivalent). Retroactive financ4ng of up to
US$ 8.0 million equivalent (5S of the proposed credit), for expenditures
incurred after November 1, 1993, is provided for the supervisory conisultant,
periodic maintenance works and non-governmental organization (NGO)/consultants
assisting in resettlement to enable the start of road works irt the 1994-95 dry
season and completion of land acquisition and resettlement by mid-1995. A
breakdown of project costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in Bangladesh are presented in
Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal
Report, No. 12211, dated June 3, 1994, is being distributed separately.
13.       Project Implementation.  The proposed project will support PHD's
rehabilitation and maintenance program in the west over the period FY95-98 and
will be completed by about June 1999. RHD will implement the project, with
assistance from the supervisory and institutional development consultants;
foreign and local contractors will execute the physical works. The implementa-
tion arrangements are generally similar to those under RPMP-I which have been
satisfactory. The Project Civil Works Director in RHD, appointed for purposes
of the project, will be responsible for the rehabilitation works, while the
Additional Chief Engineers, in charge of existing zonal offices, will be
responsible for the periodic maintenance works in their areas. The supervi-
sory consultant will have two teams: one for rehabilitation and one for
maintenance. For the latter, the consultant will draw heavily on RHD staff of
the concerned zonal offices, to be trained on the job, as an integral part of
his team, and supervision will include assistance in preparing RHD's annual
maintenance work program for the west.
14.       The institutional development program will integrate and build upon
past technical assistance to the road subsector. An 8-10 year program is
envisaged, of which the first four years will be financed under the proposed
project. Considerable flexibility will be required in implementing the
program to enable its adaptation to GOB's evolving needs. The proposed
assistance arrangement, comprising a partnership among consultants, other
government road agencies and research laboratories, and universities and
technical training institutes, should provide this flexibility and enable the
development of a more comprehensive and longer term relationship between the
concerned agencies in Bangladesh and the supplying agencies. A preliminary
program of specialist assistance and training has been designed, leaving scope
for additional assistance as needs are identified. Formation of an HDM unit
in RHD and planning cell in RRTD, and assignment of sufficient qualified
counterpart staff to the institutional specialists will be prerequisites for
the program's success. An Institutional Review Committee has been established
in the Communications Ministry to oversee the program.
15.       Project preparation is at an advanced stage.  Contracts for the
supervisory consultant, first year maintenance works and NGO assisting in
resettlement have been signed, and contractors prequalified/bids invited for
the rehabilitation works; physical works will start in the 1994-95 dry season.
Negotiations are ongoing with the selected twinning/consultancy team for
institutional development, with a view to appointing and mobilizing the team
by August 1994.



-6-
16.       Project Sustainability.  The proposed project, together with ADB's
parallel project, will assist RHD to initiate implementation of the RMP which
provides the framework for future road investments and maintenance works.
While the rehabilitation works will continue efforts under RRMP-I to bring
important national and regional roads in the northwest to maintainable
condition, the maintenance works will assist RHD to nearly eliminate its
backlog of periodic maintenance in the west before the concerned roads also
require rehabilitation and reconstruction. Technical assistance under the
project will develop RHD's capability to update the RMP using the Highway
Design and Maintenance Standards Model, use this as a basis for preparing
annual work programs, and implement these programs in a timely manner and with
good quality control.  In an effort-to ensure that this leads to sustainable
improvements in the main road network's management and operation, increasing
responsibility for works supervision will be transferred to RHD as the project
progresses, and various safeguards have been incorporated in the institutio..al
development program and milestone achievements and target handover dates
identified for key tasks.
17.       Agreed Actions.  Agreements were reached with RHD/GOS during
negotiations as follows:
(a) On sectoral matters, (i) RHD will submit to IDA anmually a report
on its previous year's work program, and will prepare for review
with IDA, by April 15 of each year, the proposed work program for
the next year and updated RMP for the coming three years; budgetary
allocations will be in accordance with RMP requirements; (ii) RHD/
GOB will, not later than December 31, 1996, prepare en updated
analysis of the structure and level of road user charges for review
with IDA; and (iii) key action areas for assisting the local road
construction industry's development over the near term will include
common classification of colutractors, streamlining of contracting
procedures including introduction of new standard contract forms by
June 30, 1996, and training/other assistance to contractors to be
provided under the institutional development program;
(b) Orn project specific issues, (i) the services of key RHD project
personnel and the Institutional Review Committee will be retained
throughout the project; (ii) the HDM unit in RHD) and planning cell
in RRTD will be set up with adequate staff and facilities by
October 31, 1994, and the environmental unit established in RHD by
June 30, 1995; (iii) the widening and periodic maintenance programs
for the west under the project will be prepared for review by IDA
by December 31 of the year before the work is to commence; (iv) all
necessary measures to mitigate any adverse impact of the project on
the environment will be implemented; (v) land acauisition and
resettlement will be carried out in accordance w-.th the final
agreed resettlement action plan (dated May 26, 1994i, a¢d (vi) a
comprehensive mid-term review will be carried out not later than
December 31, 1996; and
(c) On actions to be completed before credit effectiveness, vi) GOB/ODA
will sign the ODA grant agreement and appoint the twinning/consul-
tancy team for the institutional development program; (ii) RHD/GOB
will complete joint verification of land/other property to be
acquired under the project, and the Deputy Commissioners will



-7-
provide to RHD the estimat-3 budgetary requirements for acquisition
of the same; and (iii) GOL gill issue a separate legal opinion
confirming that all necessary governmental action required for
implementing the agreed resettle-ent plan has been taken.
I8.       Environmental and Resettlement Aspgcts.  The project is not
expected to have a major impact on the environment. The road works are
rehabilitation, widening and maintenance along existing alignments, except for
27 km of new construction in five sections unde: the rehabilitation component
which will involve acquisition of about 19 km of new right-of-way. The
consultants assisting RHD in preparing the project carried out an environmen-
tal analysis for the overall project, and prepared a plan for mitigating
potential impacts and monitoring critical parameters. The analysis concludes
that environmental considerations have generally been incorporated in each
stage of the project, including appropriate attention to the project's
potential impact on the area's hydrology, and project designs and construction
specifications modified to take intd account environmental safeguards. As
there is no focal point for addressing environmental issues and monitoring
follow-up actions in RHD's present organization, the analysis recommends an
environmental unit, reporting to the Ciiief Engineer and with subunits
responsible for environment, land acquisition/resettlement and arboriculture,
be established. Necessary assistance will be provided under the institutional
development program.
19.       The 19 km of new right-of-way, about 115 hectares (ha), will have
to be acquired by HUM/GOB; this is distributed over five sections ranging from
3 ha to 60 ha. An estimated 1,365 households, about 8,000 people, are living,
cultivating or working in the affectcd area; about 70% of the land to be
acquired is agricultural. In November 1993, RHD contracted the Christian
Commission for Development in Bangladesh (CCDB), one of Bangladesh's larger
NGos which has been active in the project area, to assist in preparing and
implementing a plan for land acquisition and resettlement under the project.
While a preliminary socio-economic survey had been carried out in late 1992,
CCDB conducted a new survey and prepared a resettlement action plan (RAP)
detailing key characteristics of the affected population, nature of losses
sustained, compensation policies, implementation schedule, organizational
framework and estimated budget. Bank staff have reviewed the RAP and found it
satisfactory. The compensation policies developed under the RAP are primarily
cash-based, except for support for relocation to poor households (mainly
squatters). This is judged appropriate for acquisitior. of strips of land
(right-of-way) as under the proposed project. The basic policy package
includes compensation for land and other property based on replacement value,
compensation and assistance to affected non-property owners, compensation for
relocation costs and compensation for temporary loss of income. Important
features of the policy are the introduction of area-specific land valuation
teams to advise in valuation of lost properties and grievance redressal
committees to assist affected persons with complaints.
20.       The Acquisition and Requisition of Immovable Property Ordinance,
1982 provides the legal basis for acquisition of land and other property under
the project. RHD has primary responsibility for land acquisition and
implementation of the resettlement plan, and has appointed a Chief Resettle-
ment Officer and three area Resettlement Officers with appropriate field staff
for this purpose. The Deputy Commissioner's Office is the acquiring body
acting on behalf of RHD. CCDB, with the assistance of tecbnical experts as



-8
necessary, is assisting RHD in preparing and implementing the plan and
monitoring its effectiveness, and will effect payment of compensation to
entitled persons except that covered by the Deputy Commissioner. The
estimated base cost of land acquisition and resettlement included in the
project is about US$ 5.1 million equivalent, with an additional US$ 221
million equivalent for contingencies due to uncertainty in the valuation of
land and other property. The organizational arrangements and budget are
considered adequate. The land acquisition process is still in its early
stages; completion of eviction and handing over of sites to the contractors is
scheduled for mid-1995. Joint verification of land and other property to be
acquired and the Deputy Commissioner's provision to RHD of the estimated
budgetary requirements for their acquisi_ion will be completed by September
1994.  An information brochure outlining, inter alia, the project, entitle-
ments and agencies involved will be distributed during joint verification.
21.       Proiect Benefits.  The economic justification of the Road Master
Plan and the proposed project has been analyzed using the Bank's Highway
Design and Maintenance Standards Model, modified slightly to tal into
consideration congestion conditions in Bangladesh. The RMP work provided the
main basis for the economic evaluation of the proposed project, using updated
(actual) road conditions, traffic and prices wherever possible. The weighted
average economic rate of return (EIRR) for the project as a whole is estimated
to be 27%. The EIRRs of the individual components are about 22% for the
rehabilitation component, 25% for the widening works, and 34% for the 4-year
periodic maintenance program. The technical assistance and training provided
during project implementation and through the institutional development
program is expected to lead to sustainable improvements in the country's
management of its main road network. While the potential benefits of this are
high, only the cost of the technical assistance (about 9% of total project
ccsts) has been included in the overall evaluation.  Based on updated field
data and HDM analyses, RHD with the supervisory consultant's assistance will
prepare annual maintenance work programs for years two, three and four of the
project and a widening program to commence in year three; these programs will
be agreed with IDA before bids for the works are invited. Upon completion of
the proposed project and ADB's parallel project, about 40% of RHD's 8,200 km
paved road network will have been included in a program of overlays, widening,
rehabilitation and reconstruction since the start of RRMP-I (1988). In
addition, systematic procedures will have been established in RHD for planning
and executing regular network maintenanc-., thereby deferring more costly
rehabilitation and reconstruction.
22.       Risks.  The main risks for the physical works include delays in
project implementation and failure to impl  ent the optimal maintenance
program. The first has been mitigated by signature of the supervisory
consultant and first year maintenance contracts and invitation of bids for the
rehabilitation works before Board presentation, and completion of joint
verification of land and other property to be acquired under the project
before credit effectiveness. As for the second, the supervisory consultant
will work closely with RHD staff in preparing the annual work program using
the HDM and in implementing it; relevant specialists under the institutional
development program will also be available to provide assistance. On the
institutional side, the main risks are over-dependence on consultants,
ineffective and slow implementation of the institutional development program,
and lack of motivation on the part of RHD staff. RHD staff will be integral
members of the supervisory consultant's team and will be given increasing



_9
responsibility as the project progresses. The institutional development
program will begin with a skills gap assessment; a Review Committee has been
established in the Ministry to oversee program implementatiorn. In an effort
to maximize the programla effectiveness, various safeguards have been
incorporated, such as minimum criteria for staff as specialist's couinterparts,
initiatives to motivate staff, and milestone achievement and target handover
dates for key tasks. Involvement of local institutions outside the Ministry
will enhance its sustainability. Close supervision by IDA/ODA and a joint
mid-term review will also help to keep the overall project on track.
23.       Recommendation.  I ani satisfied that the proposed development
credit would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the AssociatioL and
recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
