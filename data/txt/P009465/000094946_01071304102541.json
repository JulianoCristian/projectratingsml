Lessons reinforce that the\n            successful implementation of the project is largely due to\n            the effective partnership between the client counterparts,\n            and the Bank, and to the commitment, and dynamic direction\n            of the implementing agency, contributing factors to the\n            excellent disbursement, and timely completion of civil\n            works. This contributed to the development of an efficient\n            construction industry; however, the performance of\n            contractors in the smallest category, continues to be poor.\n            It is thus recommended that future projects consider larger\n            works for small works contracts, based on performance. An\n            area for attention in the roads sector, is that of\n            sustainable maintenance funding, through the establishment\n            of a Roads Fund, linked to user charges, to ultimately set\n            up an independent National Roads Board. Given the recurring\n            annual flooding in Bangladesh, it is recommended that the\n            Government be prepared for such emergencies by ensuring\n            access to critical commodities, and services for immediate\n            rehabilitation works, and a system for periodic maintenance\n            of the road infrastructure would minimize flood damages.\n            Regarding road safety, it is imperative that the Government\n            conduct road safety audits, and implement an action plan\n            involving stakeholders, public-private partnerships,\n            communities, and nongovernmental organizations to commence\n            implementing remedial measures."}, "docdt": "2001-04-18T00:00:00Z"}
