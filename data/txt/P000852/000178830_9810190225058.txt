REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
AND A CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF GHANA FOR
A SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan of US$18 million and a credit of US$10 million on standard terms to
the Government of Ghana to help finance a second highway project. The loan
would be for a period of 25 years, including 5 years of grace, with interest
at the rate of 8-1/2 percent per annum. About US$7.5 million of the proceeds
of the loan would be relent to the Bank for Housing and Construction to
promote the domestic construction industry at the rate of 10 percent per
annum for 15 years, including 3 years of grace (for details of onlending terms
please see paragraphs 43 and 44). The United Nations Development Programme.
UK and Canada are contributing, as technical assistance grants, about US$0.7
million for the project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report entitled "Fiscal and Balance of Payments Aspects
of Ghana's Development" (638a-GH) dated May 19, 1975, was distributed to the
Executive Directors in June 1975. A report on Ghana's industrial sector
(465a-GH) dated October 25, 1974, has also been distributed to the Executive
Directors. A summary of basic data on the economy is presented in Annex T.
General Background
3.        Ghana enjoys a high standard of living compared with most other
West African nations, as its annual per capita GNP was about US$300 in
1973. Government policy is aimed at attaining the growth potential of the
country's major resources, including cocoa -- it is the world's largest
producer -- timber, manganese, gold, and electric power. However, over the
past decade and a half GDP growth averaged about 2.5 percent per annum and
failed to keep pace with the growth of population.   Export growth was slow
(2.3 percent per annum) and depended almost entirely on a few traditional
export commodities -- cocoa, gold and timber. In addition to contributing
60 percent of the country's export earnings, cocoa provided around 30 percent
of government revenue and employed upwards of 20 percent of the labor force.
The 1960s witnessed a declining trend for cocoa production and rapidly growing
imports of food and raw materials for industry. Although the industrial
development strategy of the early 1960s broadened the industrial base, industry
depended heavily on imported inputs and generally had low domestic value added
content. This strategy of the sixties resulted in recurrent balance of pay-
ments crises and an accumulation of external debt.



4.        The economic and social policy of the early 1960s rested on
extensive involvement of l-he Government in the provision of a wide range
of social services, in the setting up of a large number of state enter-
prises and in allocating resources through an extensive system of physical
and financial controls. Since the mid-1960s, there has been a growing
imbalance in public finances due to rapid growth of budget current expendi-
ture, slow growth in budget revenue and uneconomic operations of several
government enterprises. The imbalance depressed government development
expenditure to an inadequate level and was also a persistent source of
inflationary pressure.
5.        After cocoa and timber, Ghana's principal traditional exports are
gold, manganese, diamonds and bauxite. Production of most of these minerals
is stagnating or declining, mainly because of depletion of the ore reserves.
With regard to bauxite, however, a proposal for the opening of a new mine
to produce bauxite for local reduction to alumina to supply the existing
aluminum smelter is under study. Ghana imports its entire oil requirements,
most of it in the form of crude oil which is refined dor.mestically. Oil is
used chiefly as a source of fuel for the transport sector. Oil exploration
is being carried out offshore and in the Volta Basin, but commercially
exploitable reserves have not yet been discovered.   Hydroelectric power meets
most of Ghana's energy requirements.
6.        Despite poor performance of the economy during most of the 1960s,
Ghana's development is well advanced in some respects. The education system
is well established; elementary education has been free and universal since
1962; and public health facilities are fairly widespread and further expan-
sion favors rural areas. It is the declared policy of the Government to
achieve a more equitable income distribution by increasing productive invest-
ments in the rural areas; by expanding low cost rural housing and water
supply; and by improving feeder roads.
Recent Developments
7.        Overall GDP growth in 1974 was 6.5 percent, up from 0.5 percent in
1972 and 2.6 percent in 1973. General guidelines have been issued for a
five-year Development Plan covering the period 1975-1980 while a more detailed
plan for that period is being prepared. The Plan's target GDP growth rate
is an average of 5.5 percent per annum. Since 1972 a reorientation of economic
policy has taken place. A three-plhase "Operation Feed Yourself" program was
started by the new Government in 1972; Phase I aims to achieve self-sufficiency
in basic foods such as rice, maize, cassava and plantain; Phase II is to bring
about self-sufficiency in agricultural raw materials for industry; and
Phase III will focus on expanding agricultural exports. Production by small
holders is being encouraged alongside large scale mechanized farming. In
food production considerable progress had been made by 1974, particularly in
rice and maize, but the crucial cocoa sector has failed to show similar progress.
In industry, the Government's policy is to discourage the excessive use of
capital through the levying of duties on imported capital goods and the
granting of an employment tax credit.



-3-
Public Finance
8.        Although in recent budgets the Government has successfully expanded
non-cocoa revenues, thus gradually reducing its reliance on fluctuating
income from cocoa, current expenditure has risen more rapidly than total
revenue. With a limited inflow of external capital, the Government has had
to borrow extensively from the Bank of Ghana to finance development expendi-
ture, and this, along with general world inflation, has been a major factor
contributing to the high rate of domestic inflation. The national cost of
living index rose by 18 percent in 1973 and 1974, a rate of increase almost
double that of 1971 and 1972, and comparing unfavorably with the rate of 2.4
percent a year in the late 1960s. In its 1975/76 budget the Government
introduced a number of bold and far-reaching measures to expand revenues and
to limit reliance on inflationary borrowings. The revenue measures include
increases in import and excise duties on a wide range of commodities, and of
personal income tax; charges of public utilities (water rates and telecom-
munications tariffs) have also been increased. Also, the Government announced
stringent measures to restrict the growth of current expenditure to 10 per-
cent in nominal terms. In July 1975 minimum bank deposit rates were increased
from 5 to 7.5 percent and maximum lending rates increased by 2.5 percentage
points (to 8.5 percent for agriculture with flexibility for higher rates when
financial cost of funds dictates, and 12.5 percent for other sectors);
however, interest rates for hire-purchase operations are permitted to be up
to 15 percent. The budget also reflects the Government's determination to
maintain a high level of development expenditure, but a substantial part of
this public investment program will still have to be financed by credit creation.
Balance of Payments
9.        Strict control of imports, coupled with favorable price developments
for cocoa, gold and timber, led to a strong improvement in the balance of
payments and the reserve position during 1972 and 1973. This recovery ended
abruptly in 1974 when a serious breakdown in the import licensing system,
together with the impact of higher oil prices, sharply pushed up imports and
caused an acute balance of payments crisis, reducing Ghana's net external
reserves to only a few weeks import cover by the end of the year. Since
September 1974, the Government has introduced a series of measures to restrict
imports which are producing considerable improvement. Reserves increased
considerably, to a gross amount of US$192 million by the end of September 1975,
partly as a result of a drawing on the IMF oil facility, but given the trend
in world cocoa prices it appears unlikely that the current account of the
balance of payments will show a surplus in 1975. Whilst import restrictions
are primarily aimed at reducing consumer goods imports, they have in some
cases adversely affected the country's ability to maintain a satisfactory
level of spare parts and thereby its capacity to fully utilize existing capital
stocks.



External Debt
10.       An agreement on a long-term rescheduling of Ghana's medium-term
external debt was concluded in March 1974. Under this agreement, all pay-
ments due after February 1, 1972, in respect of pre-1966 debt obligations
will be paid over a period of 28 years, including a grace period of 10 years,
with an interest rate of 2-1/2 percent per annum. This agreement was the
result of more than two years of negotiations between Ghana and the creditor
countries in which the good offices of the Bank were provided. Following
Ghana's review of the validity of the contracts underlying the debts in
question, a final settlement has now been reached with all the creditor
countries that signed the March 1974 agreement.
11.       To achieve the goal of eliminating all pre-1972 trade credit arrears
by 1977, Ghana paid 062.3 million in 1973 and a further 024.6 million in 1974,
mainly in the first half of the year. With the sharp fall in reserves, pay-
ments slowed down and new arrears totalling 030.3 million were accumulated,
but were eliminated by mid-April 1975. By the end of September 1975, total
outstanding trade credit arrears amounted to 0104.9 million. The authorities
intend to resume payments as soon as external reserves permit and to adhere
as much as possible to the 1977 target. Other potential obligations include
outstanding applications for remittance of profits and dividends estimated
at US$111 million. In addition, the Government has undertaken to pay com-
pensation for the increased equity it has acquired in several foreign private
investments. The amounts are still under negotiation.
Prospects
12.       The recent measures on the balance of payments and the budget reflect
improved economic management and illustrate a willingness on the part of the
Government to adopt unpopular measures. Medium-term projections indicate
that the external resource constraint, which hampered Ghana's development in
the past, will remain severe. Reliance on cocoa will continue for a consider-
able time as diversification can proceed only gradually, but with cocoa produc-
tion expanding slowly at best, there is a need for a substantial net inflow
of external aid, roughly in the order of US$160 million annually over the next
several years, if the overall growth target of 5 to 6 percent is to be met.
The current external debt service ratio is under 5 percent and is expected to
rise to around 8 percent towards the end of the decade. The Bank Group's
share of Ghana's total external debt is currently about 13 percent and is
expected to rise to about 15 percent over the next several years. The Bank
Group's proportion of Ghana's external debt service payments in 1974 was
abnormally high at 25 percent because of the suspension of payments on most
suppliers' credits pending the negotiation of bilateral agreements. By the
end of the decade it is expected to be around 10 percent. Ghana should be
considered creditworthy for additional Bank lending in these circumstances.
Where appropriate from the point of view of the project, and particularly in
the agricultural sector where direct foreign exchange costs tend to be low,
financing of some local costs is considered reasonable in view of the country's
difficult financial position and the measures recently taken by the Government
to improve the fiscal situation (see paragraph 8).

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN GHANA
13.       Since 1962, when the Bank Group financed its first operation in
Ghana, the Bank has made three loans amounting to US$76 million for the
Volta dam and associated infrastucture works for electricity generation and
for a telecommunications project; IDA has extended 11 credits totalling
US$86 million -- 5 for agriculture (including livestock and fisheries), 2 for
water supply and sewerage, 2 for power distribution and 2 for highways. Annex
II contains a summary statement of loans and credits as of October 31, 1975
with notes on the execution of ongoing projects. There are no IFC investments.
14.       Ghana is currently engaged in restructuring its economy, with the
principal objective of reducing dependence on imports generally, achieving
greater self-sufficiency in agricultural products, particularly food, expanding
cocoa production for export and improving its infrastructure support for an
expanding economy. The main thrust of the Bank Group's operations in Ghana is
to assist the Government in achieving these objectives, with emphasis on
institution-building and training of Ghanaian nationals for project preparation
and improved implementation. Thus, in addition to the proposed Second Highway
project which would improve the road maintenance capacity in Ghana and promote
the domestic construction industry, a development finance company project and
a second cocoa project have been negotiated; all the three projects are scheduled
to be considered by the Executive Directors in December.
15.       The Bank Group is also assisting the Government to strengthen the
power sector which is based on the development of Ghana's hydroelectric potential.
A power distribution project is under appraisal and this may be followed by
further investments in the Volta River generation system for which Canadian
consultants recently completed a feasibility study. The Government has expres-
sed a strong commitment to attain self-sufficiency in food and to assist the
small farmers increase productivity, and a rural development project directly
affecting about 500,000 people in the Upper Region is under appraisal. Follow-
ing the recent Annual Meeting of Governors of the Bank, the Government has
requested assistance in designing and implementing projects to help the urban
poor. With UNDP assistance a small-industries project is being prepared for
possible Bank Group assistance, and a Bank mission will review with Government
in early December its urban development program.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR AND CONSTRUCTION
INDUSTRY IN GHANA
Transport Sector
16.       The transport system in Ghana is dominated by an extensive 20,000-
mile road network which carries about three-quarters of all domestic freight
traffic. Road transport is supplemented by an 800-mile rail system which
essentially serves the "Golden Triangle" area (connecting the cities of Accra
and Kumasi with the port of Takoradi), and which specializes in the movement
of timber, cocoa, and minerals for export. Domestic air transport of passengers
and freight, and water transport along the coast or on Lake Volta, are not
yet significant.



- 6 -
17.       In the years following independence, major investments were made
in the transport infrastructure (mainly primary roads), and the extent of the
system. is now generally ade(quate to serve anticipated demand. Investments
in the sector over 1969-73 i-otalled about 084 million (about US$62 million),
equivalent to almost 20 percent of total Government capital expenditures in
that period; about 80 percent of these investments were for highway development.
The road system, hotwever, suffered progressive deterioration by the early
seventies. The poor state of the roads is primarily due to unexpectedly high
traffic increases, particulairly of heavy vehicles, and inadequate maintenance
by a poorly equipped and inadequately staffed maintenance organization. In an
effort to correct the situat:ion, in 1972 the Government engaged consultants
financed under British aid, who made recommendations for improving the organiza-
tion, staffing and methods of maintenance operations; the consultants also
drew up a four-year maintenance program. A government task force assisted by
CIDA-financed consultants has prepared an implementation program.
18.       Government policy in the current Plan period (1975-80) is appro-
priately directed to preservation and improvement of existing infrastructure,
and especially to the development of the rural road network. It is planned
to implement programs which would lead to optimum utilization of all available
facilities in the various modes, and particularly to ensure that the country's
economic growth is not hampered by lack of an efficient transport system.
19.       Several agencies are involved in the organization-and planning of
transport investments. The Government is presently focussing its efforts
first on improving the capacity of individual agencies before undertaking com-
prehensive coordination programs. However, one of the principal issues
deserving urgent attention is coordination in the Kumasi-Takoradi corridor
which now carries some 80 percent of total railway freight traffic, and where
road transport has been capturing an increasing share of export traffic in
cocoa and timber, resulting, among other things, in the need for intensified
road maintenance and early comprehensive rehabilitation of certain road
sections. Government has in the past deliberately avoided construction of a
primary through-road in order to give the railway a competitive advantage;
currently, however, major investments are being contemplated in both modes,
and in recognition of this potential duplication, the Government is planning
to study the road/rail competition in the corridor.
20.       An important development in highway administration has been the
creation of the Ghana Highway Authority (GHA) in December 1974 to replace the
roads section of the Public Works Department (PWD) of the Ministry of Works
and Housing. GHA has been given responsibility for practically all aspects of
the planning, design, construction, maintenance, and administration of public
roads (including connecting ferry services), and will also take over the
administration of feeder roads. The new organizational structure is a key
element in bringing about a much needed improvement in highway administration,
and the proposed project would provide financial and technical assistance to
GHA in the formative years of this institution.



21.       Under PWD, highway planning was not very satisfactory.    Some
assistance was provided by consultants who in 1971 prepared a road rehabili-
tation program with assistance from UK. Later, when PTD's Planning Division
(formerly the Highway Planning Unit) was strengthened under the First Highway
Project (Credit 438-GH of November 21, 1973) these consultants formed the
nucleus of a planning staff. Government then agreed that the Division would
become fully functional, and would effectively plan future highway development.
GHA is now recruiting additional local staff for its Planning Division, and
UK has agreed to finance the services of a highway planner/transport economist
for two years.
22.       The Planning Division has already prepared the basic framework for
highway planning, including a road classification system and the related
network analysis, traffic counts, and economic evaluation of sections total-
ling about 200 miles under the ongoing First Highway Project. Consultants
have also helped the Division prepare special studies, including a manual of
vehicle operating costs, and a survey of the domestic contracting and quarry
industries; the results of these studies have provided much of the informa-
tion required in preparing the project under consideration.
23.       The Building and Road Research Institute at Kumasi has assisted in
road planning in the past, and GHA intends to engage the Institute for two
studies included in the proposed project.
24.       The road transport industry is dominated by two large Government-
owned corporations -- the State Transport Corporation, which provides long-
distance freight and passenger services, car hire and other transport services,
and the Omnibus Services Authority, which provides intra-city bus services.
The two enterprises operate in competition with private transporters. The
rest of the transport industry consists of several medium-size companies and
a large number of individual owner-operators. There are no tariff, entry,
or route regulations affecting the industry.
25.       The Government's policy on highways has been enunciated in the
Planning Guidelines issued in January 1975 as a basis for a five-year (1975-
1980) Development Plan. It focusses on four priority areas, viz; (a) main-
tenance and rehabilitation of existing roads; (b) coordination of road
development through Ghana Highway Authority; (c) increasing the capacity of
the road contracting industry; and (d) enforcement of axle-load limitations.
Canada (CIDA) has recently approved two lending operations totalling Cn$7
million for equipment purchase and associated services; Germany (KfW) is
considering assistance for increasing output of quarries and the Bank Group
has been requested to provide assistance to complement these activities
through the proposed project which has as one of its principal objectives
the strengthening of GHA and the Bank for Housing and Construction (BBC) on
a long-term basis. Accordingly the proposed operation includes technical
assistance in key areas, besides assistance for equipment purchase.
26.       In Ghana, as in several other developing countries, the construction
industry comprises one of the large sectors of the economy; in the period
1965-1972 amounts spent annually on buildings and other construction averaged



- 8 -
US$125 million, representing over 60 percent of gross domestic fixed invest-
ment; the value added by the industry aecounts for 40 to 45 percent of gross
output, compared with a range of 35-50 percent in other developing countries.
27.       Despite significant expansion in the domestic private construction
industry in recent years, its capacity has not kept pace with demand. The
widening gap between demand for road works and the limited ability or the
contracting industry to supply these services has created a seller's market.
This has led to cost escalations, negotiated contracts rather than competi-
tive bidding and frequent delays in execution of works. The Government
permits foreign contractors to operate in the country but since 1969 only one
international contractor has executed road contracts. Rehabilitation works
under the ongoing First Highway Project (Credit 438-GH of November 1973) are
subject to international comipetitive bidding, but foreign contractors submitted
bids for at least 50 percent more than the amount quoted by domestic com-
petitors, suggesting that there is no convincing evidence that international
contractors could in the lorLg run provide additional capacity for small-
and medium-sized contracts on economically acceptable terms.
28.       The Government and its Planning Commission have identified inadequate
construction capacity as one of the factors limiting efficient new investment
in the economy. Their studies reveal that with appropriate institutional and
financial support, especially in the acquisition of construction equipment,
Ghanaian entrepreneurs and contractors can be helped to remove this bottle-
neck. Accordingly, in November 1972 the Government established the Bank for
Housing and Construction essentially to encourage and facilitate the partici-
pation of domestic and foreign capital in promoting the housing and construc-
tion sectors. BHC is authorized to provide financing in the form of term-loans,
issue guarantees, make equity investments and borrow funds locally and abroad;
it is also authorized to accept deposits, and provides its clients with
working capital.   The Government has approached Germany, the Bank and UNDP to
assist this young institution in discharging its responsibilities.
29.       A review of BHC's performance to date indicates that it has been
well managed and is staffed with qualified personnel. Although it is a govern-
ment agency, it has been operating with minimal apparent government influence,
and with the representation of the private sector in policy-making. BIIC's
short-term financial position is good due to increased deposits, and long-term
finance has been obtained through a recent local bond issue; however, BHC has no
foreign currency funds at its disposal. Overall prospects for BHC's capital
structure, its profitability, liquidity position, and debt service ability,
are expected to remain satisfactory over the next few years.
30.       The Government has designated BHC to act as the intermediary for
providing assistance to the construction industry. Consequently, it is pro--
posed under the present project that funds from the Loan be provided to BHC
for on-lending to selected doT stic road contractors and quarry operators to
improve their capacity in road maintenance and related activities.    This
arrangement is expected to help strengthen the institution in the s.iort-term
and also in its long-term efforts in stimulating the domestic construction
industry.



- 9 -
31.       Annex IIIof the Appraisal Report (No. 903a-GH of December 2, 1975)
presents relevant information on the construction industry in Ghana. The
problems of the industry are summarized below:
(a)   Much of the existing equipment is overaged and due for
replacement. Consultants' studies have revealed that
for the public construction corporation,one-third of the
fleet is inoperative, about 70 percent of the equipment
at least 8 years old and about 50 percent at least 12
years old. The consultants have estimated the replacement
value of all road contractors' equipment at about 040
million.  Contractors need domestic as well as foreign
credits to finance equipment purchase.
(b)   Difficulties in importing spare parts further reduce the
utilization of the existing equipment fleeL.
(c)   Technical assistance to improve job programing   - ensuring
continuous utilization of equipment, improving equipment
mix of contractors, training personnel for operating the
machines - would help.
(d)   Output of crushed stones  should be at least doubled to
catch up with the projected demand. The Bank for Housing
and Construction has a program of promoting new quarries
and assisting the existing ones to improve output.
The project under consideration would assist in solving some of these problems.
The project would provide a modest beginning, as the overall problems of the
industry require a much larger program.
Bank Group Assistance to the Transport Sector
32.       Bank Group involvement in the transport sector has to date been for
highway development only. An engineering Credit (S7-GH of 1969, US$1.5
million) helped finance detailed engineering for new highways from Kumasi to
Accra and to Takoradi. The design work was satisfactorily completed in 1971,
but the Government, with the concurrence of the Association, decided to defer
construction in favor of rehabilitating and maintaining existing roads. In
support of this policy, a First Highway Project (Credit 438-GH of November
1973, US$13 million) was prepared which consisted mainly of rehabilitation
of trunk roads, studies for similar work on other road sections, and prepara-
tion of a comprehensive program to improve road maintenance. Project execu-
tion has been satisfactory. However, because of cost overruns and changes
in the technical specification of the roads for rehabilitation, the Government
has requested that the scope of the project be reduced. A separate memorandum
explaining the proposed changes has been submitted to the Executive Directors
(IDA/R 75-104 of December 10, 1975). Preinvestment studies for further rehabili-
tation works have been carried out by consultants. A comprehensive eight-year
program of road maintenance has been prepared by GHA, with technical assistance
provided by consultants financed by the Canadian International Development
Agency (CIDA).

PART IV - THE PROJECT
33.       The proposed project was appraised by a Bank mission in January/
February 1975. Loan/Credit negotiations were held in Washington on November
10 and 11, 1975, with a Ghanaian delegation led by Dr. Appiah,Senior Principal
Secretary, Ministry of Finance. The primary objective of the project is to
improve existing roads through the implementation of the first four-year
phase of a planned eight-year road maintenance program, the development within
the Ghana Highway Authority of an efficient maintenance organization, and
assistance for the domestic contracting industry through the Bank for Housing
and Construction.
34.       The proposed project consists of:   (i) a four-year road maintenance
program, including equipment procurement, technical assistance, and training
of GHA staff at all levels; (ii) reconstruction of Achimota-Nsawam road (16
miles); (iii) financial and technical assistance thrcugh BHC for equipment
procurement and for development of private domestic road contractors and
quarry owners; and (iv) studies on road-building materials, optimum level of
feeder road investment in the country, and the appropriate labor/equipment
mix for road maintenance.
Cost and Financing
35.       The total capital cost of the project is estimated at US$35.8 million
equivalent, or US$31.7 million equivalent net of taxes, of which about US$28.7
million (90 percent) is in foreign costs (details in Annex III). It is pro-
posed that the foreign capital costs would be met primarily by a Loan of
US$18 million and a Credit of US$10 million; the remaining foreign costs of
about US$700,000 equivalent for technical assistance services to GHA and BHC
would be financed by CIDA, the Overseas Development Ministry (ODM) of UK, and
the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The Government is expected
to finance the local component of capital costs of the project, and the entire
recurrent cost of road maintenance, estimated at about US$25 million in FY 1976.
Project Execution
A.   Ghana Highway Authority
36.       The Ghana Highway Aut:hority would have principal responsibility for
the execution of the project while the Bank for Housing and Construction would
assume responsibility for the project component relating to the provision of
assistance to the contracting industry. GHA would be assisted by consultants
in executing the maintenance program as well as in the supervision of road
construction. Under the proposed maintenance program routine maintenance
would be applied to about 7,500 miles of main roads and 6,000 miles of feeder
roads; periodic maintenance would be carried out on about 5,000 miles of main
roads and a selected number of feeder roads. The Chief Executive of GHA is
well qualified for the post and most of the other key positions also have been
filled with qualified personnel.



Maintenance
37.       GHA's Road Maintenance Task Force has prepared the outline of an
eight-year program (1975-1983) under which the full range of maintenance
operations would be applied regularly to all primary and secondary roads,
and to about half of the feeder road network. The remaining feeder roads,
consisting mainly of earth tracks, would receive only the routine maintenance
required to provide access during the dry season.
38.       Efficient implementation of the first four-year phase of the program
will be possible only if GHA can accomplish the following: (a) establish an
appropriate organizational and administrative framework; (b) establish an
effective management system; (c) train its own and contractors' staff;
(c) acquire adequate maintenance and workshop equipment; (e) secure adequate
Government funding; and (f) coordinate its feeder road operations with rural
development programs. The proposed project would help meet all these needs.
Training
39.       GHA attaches high priority to staff training and has determined
that about 60 percent of its supervisory staff needs refresher courses.
Training will also have to be provided for new personnel and road contractors'
staff, as well as for existing store and management personnel, equipment
operators and mechanics. Altogether, about 2,000 people will have to be
trained over the project period. Although Ghana has a training center at
Shai Hills (30 miles from Accra) it lacks equipment for fully utilizing its
capacity and the proposed project provides advisory services, and US$200,000
for procurement of equipment for the training center. With Canadian assistance,
GHA is drawing up a comprehensive training program covering the period up to
1979; GHA is expected to be able to begin to implement an adequate training
program by March 1976.
Equipment
40.       PWD's equipment maintenance operations were severely handicapped
by a chronic shortage of equipment and spare parts and at any given time at
least one-third of the fleet was inoperative. The total equipment fleet
required to maintain the former PWD road network has been estimated on the
basis of a detailed assessment of wok requirements. The inventory of
existing PWD equipment showed that only about 35 percent of the items would
be serviceable beyond FY 1978. The remaining needs would have to be met from:
(i) CIDA-financed equipment (US$6 million) scheduled for delivery in late
1975; (ii) GHA-financed purchases of some additional items, such as locally
manufactured trailers; and (iii) financing from the proposed Loan/Credit in
an amount of US$5.5 million for the remaining equipment required for use on
main roads. The proposed Loan/Credit would also finance an additional US$3.2
million worth of equipment for maintenance of feeder roads under the four-
year program.

Gp ~', -s Labor/Equipment Mix
41.       The purchase of some items of equipment for main roads would depend
on the results of a study of the optimum labor/equipment mix for maintenance
operations. Analysis of the appropriate mix will become a continuing respon-
sibility for GHA management, ancd the proposed project provides for execution
of studies on this issue, specifically concerning feeder road maintenance, as
input to the second phase of the maintenance program.
The Reconstruction of Achimota-NIsawam Road
42.       The reconstruction of the Achimota-Nsawam road, which forms the
southern end of the Kumasi-Accra road, wasoriginally included in the First
Highway Project (Credit 438-GH of November 1973), but a reduction of the scope
of the project has become necessary as a result of cost overruns (see para-
graph 32). While deletion of this road segment from the first project is
recommended, its reconstruction remains a high priority element in Ghana's
highway program and would be included in the proposed project. Detailed
engineering studies have been substantially completed. Of the 16 miles to be
reconstructed, about 7 miles would be built on a new aliRnment to improve a
railway crossing.
B.   Bank for Housing and Construction
43.       As explained earlier (paragraph 30) the Bank for Housing and Construc-
tion would be the agency assisting domestic entrepreneurs and contractors to
take an increasing role in road maintenance and construction. The Government
would on-lend US$7.5 million of the proceeds of the proposed Bank loan to BHC
for 25 years, including 5 years of grace, at an interest rate of 10 percent
per annum; the Government would assume the foreign exchange risk for these
amounts.
44.       The Bank for Housing and Construction would lend these funds to the
private domestic construction enterprises and quarry operators at an interest
rate of about 15 percent per anrnum for the purchase of construction equipment
and at not less than 13.5 percent for quarry equipment. BHC's margin within
the 15 percent includes 3 percent to cover administrative expenses, earnings
and normal risk, and 2 percent to cover the special risks involved in dealing
with movable equipment which is used on roads throughout the country. Since
it is difficult at this time to assess the adequacy of the 2 percent special
risk spread, BHC would keep the income earned in a separate account until the
experience gained has been reviewed.
45.       About US$300,000 of the funds earmarked for road contractors would
be used for purchase of spare parts for existing equipment. The US$1 million
allocated for existing quarries would most probably benefit about five operators.
46.       The amortization period of medium-term sub-loans made by BHC for
new equipment would be based on contractors' ability to repay, but would not
exceed the estimated 5-10 year economic life of the equipment, including a
grace period of 1-2 years; the amortization period of sub-loans for spare
parts and replacement items would be about 2-3 years, including a grace period



- 13 -
of about one year. For loans to quarry operators, the amortization period
is expected to be 2-6 years, including a grace period of 1-2 years. BHC
would rollover the proceeds of the project loan repaid by sub-borrowers
for the purpose of fostering the promotion of the domestic construction
industry.
C.   Procurement
47.       Bidding documents for reconstruction of the Achimota-Nsawam road
are being prepared by consultants on the basis of completed detailed engine-
ering. Contractors would be prequalified and the construction contract awarded
on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank
Group guidelines. Maintenance and workshop equipment, including spare parts,
would be procured on the basis of international competitive bidding with due
regard to the requirements of standardization. Spare parts for existing
equipment up to an aggregate amount of about US$300,000 and specialized equip-
ment for the training center and workshops costing less than US$20,000 each
and US$500,000 equivalent in aggregate would be purchased by GRA on the basis
of direct quotations from agents. Suppliers would be required to provide
adequate after-sales services in the Accra area.
48.       For procurement of equipment and spare parts under the BHC part of
the project, sub-borrowers would be required, to the extent practicable, to
obtain quotations from at least three suppliers for equipment and from the
relevant local suppliers for spare parts; all quotations would be checked
and approved by BHC. The Bank would approve procurement of these items when
authorizing sub-projects.
D.   Disbursement
49.       Loan/Credit proceeds would be disbursed on the following basis:
(i) 100 percent of the c.i.f. costs of equipment, spare parts and tools;
(ii) 65 percent of total expenditures for the reconstruction work, represent-
ing the estimated foreign exchange cost of this item; (iii) 100 percent of
foreign expenditures for consulting and expert services; and (iv) 100 percent
of foreign expenditures of disbursements under sub-loans made by BHC.
E.   Economic Return
50.       The economic return from investments in road maintenance and
rehabilitation has been conservatively quantified on the basis of vehicle
operating costs only. The first four-year phase of the planned eight-year
maintenance program, including work carried out by contractors is estimated
to have a benefit/cost ratio of 2.5:1 corresponding to an economic return
of more than 50 percent. Reconstruction of the Achimota-Nsawam road has an
economic return of about 13 percnet. Additional institution-building benefits
are an important project objective, but they have not been quantified. These
benefits include strengthening GHA, promoting the development of BHC, and
assisting the development of the domestic construction industry.

B.     PROJECTS IN EXECUTIOI'l/
Cr. No. 163 - Fisheries Project; US$1.3 million
Credit of September 25, 1969
Effective Date: January 21, 1970
Closing Date: December 31, 1975
1.        This project originally provided for:   (a) the construction of
forty purse seiners; (b) credits to fishermen for purchasing such vessels;
(c) fishing harbor improvement and expansion studies and (d) the improvement
of the Ghana Industrial Holding Corporation's Boatyard Division. Following
protracted problems over design and price, the number of boats was reduced
from the original 40 to 10; the procurement of equipment is now concluded,
and delivery of the boars has been completed. Delays have also been encount-
ered in the execution of the harbor studies. The original Closing Date of
December 31, 1972, which was extended first to December 31, 1973 and then to
June, 1975 has been further extended to December 31, 1975 to allow for the
procurement of spare parts.
Cr. No. 205 - Cocoa Rehabilitation Project; US$8.5 million
Credit of June 26, 1970; Effective Date: March 12, 1971
Closing Date: December 31, 1975
2.        The project, principally involving the rehabilitation of 51,000
acres and replanting of 36,000 acres of cocoa is behind schedule mainly
because of drought damage in 1973, poor farmer response, limited availability
of labor, and past indecision on the part of the Government concerning spray-
ing cocoa against pests, in particular capsids. The drought caused a high
mortality rate amongst yound planted seelings, creating a large demand for
replacement seed which coulcl not be satisfied since production of seedlings
was hampered at the same time. The relatively low producer price for cocoa
has not encouraged farmers to participate in the project nor to pay attractive
wages to hired labor. Consequently little hired labor has been forthcoming.
The government spraying program caused a delay of two years in the project's
rehabilitation program. Increased costs, due to higher salaries and wages
and higher than expected prices for construction material, equipment and
vehicles, might necessitate additional funding unless the replanting and
rehabilitation programs are reduced.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them.
They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they
do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses
in project execution.

Cr. No. 354  -   Sugar Rehabilitation Project: US$15.6 million;
Credit of January 29, 1973;
Effective Date: May 31, 1973;
Closing Date: March 31, 1979
3.        The prcject expFrienced difficulties in the 1973-1974 milling
season and only 8,200 tovs of sugar were produced compared with 10,800
tons estinmated in the appraisal report. The main problems were factory
breakdowns, irregular cane supplies from outgrowers and a lower than
expected sugar recovery rate. Management is good and excellent progress
has been made with the rehabilitation of estates and factories. An
increase in producer and domestic sugar prices was recently approved which
will strengthen the project's financial viability.
Cr. No. 438  -   First Highway Project:  US$13 million;
Credit of November 21, 1973;
Effective Date: January 22, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977
4.        In spite of initial delays, project execution is progressing
satisfactorily. Consultants have been appointed. Contracts for the first
road section to be rehabilitated have been awarded to a domestic construc-
tion firm following international competitive bidding; and bids for the
second road section have been prepared. Because of cost overruns, considera-
tion is being given to a reduction in the amount of road rehabilitation to
be carried out under the project. The maintenance Task Force has prepared
a comprehensive road maintenance program; and the Government has taken steps
to strengthen the highways administration by creating the Ghana Highway
Authority to be responsible for all public roads.
Cr. No. 499  -   Second Water Supply Project; US$10.4 million;
Credit of July 26, 1974;
Effective Date: January 7, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980
5.        This project is a follow-up on the first Water Supply project
financed under Credit 160-GH and consists of the construction of an earth
dam at Weija; extension of the distribution system in the Accra/Tema area;
extension of rural water supplies near Accra; and teclhnical assistance and
training. The delay in Credit Effectiveness was due mainly to the delayed
conclusion of a loan agreement between the Government and CIDA which is co-
financing the project. (The other co-financier is the African Development
Bank). However, construction of the Weija dam is well under way.

Cr. No. 500 - Livestock Development Project:
US$2.0 million Credit of July 26, 1974;
Effective Date: May 14, 1975
Closing Date: June 30, 1981
6.        The project consists of: (a)development of three breeding/fattening
ranches; (b) improvement of about 50 privately owned herds in the vicinity
of the breeding/fattening ranches; (c) training of Chanaian ranch managers,
and (d) feasibility studies of the identification of a second phase project.
Delay in Credit effectiveness was due mainly to difficulties encountered by
the Ghana Livestock Company in recruiting the company's Managing Director.
Cr. No. 531 - Oil Palm Project; US$13.6 million
Credit of March 5, 1975;
Effective Date: Not yet effective
Closing Date: December 31, 1983
7.        The project consists of the followng main components:   establishment
of a 10,000-acre nucleus plantation; provision of technical services and
credit facilities for the development of 3,000 of outgrowers plantings;
construction of a 10-ton/hr palm oil mill; training of personnel; construction
of 10 miles of road and provision of technical assistance to the Agricultural
Development Bank. Delay in credit effectiveness is due mainly to delays in
concluding a contract with a firm of management consultants which will provide
key management personnel for the project unit.
Ln. No. 1122 - Telecommunications Project: US$23 million
Loan of June 1.0, 1975; Effective Date: Not
yet effective; Closing Date: December 31, 1989
8.        Project components include the rehabilitation and expansion of
telephone exchange equipment, improvement and expansion of long distance
telephone facilities and expansion of telex services. Engineering consultants
have been appointed. Loan effectiveness is expected before the end of
December 1975.
