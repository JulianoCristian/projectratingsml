CHILE
AGRICULTURAL SERVICES AND CREDIT PROJECT
I. LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:            The Republic of Chile.
Beneficiaries:       Agricultural Development Institute (INDAP) and participa-
ting commercial banks.
Amount:              US$56 million equivalent, including a capitalized front-
end fee.
Terms:               Repayment in 15 years, including 3 years of grace, at the
standard variable interest rate.
Relending Terms:    The Central Bank would on-lend project funds in pesos to
INDAP at an annual interest rate of 5.5% and to com-
mercial banks at an annual interest rate of 7.5%. INDAP
would on-lend the funds at annual interest rates of 9%
and commercial banks at an annual interest rate of 10%.
Interest payments by participating financial institutions
and beneficiaries would be over outstanding loan balances
adjusted by the Chilean Consumer Price Index (CPI). The
repayment terms for subloans would be up to 18 months for
short-term credit, and up to 12 years, including a grace
period of up to 4 years, for on-farm and agroindustry
investment credit.
Project
Objectives:         The project's main objective would be to (a) increase
agricultural output, especially of comoodities for which
Chile enjoys a comparative advantage; and (b) help small-
scale farmers to increase their earnings, improve their
living conditions and develop their farms into com-
mercially viable production units. In addition, INDAP's
financial position and operational capacity would be
strengthened.
Project
Description:         The project would provide investment credit for on-farm
development and agroindustry, and short-term credit to
small farmers. The project also includes a comprehensive
technical assistance program associated with credit to
small-scale farmers, and assistance to INDAP for the



-2-
completion of an electronic data processing system for
portfolio management. INDAP would also be strengthened
by carrying out a plan for the recovery of its portfolio
in arrears.
Project
Benefits:           The project is expected to have a significant impact on
increasing agricultural production, for import substitu-
tion and exports, with consequent foreign exchange bene-
fits. The small-scale farm group, which accounts for
about 40% of the best agricultural land, but has limited
access to modern technology and institutional credit,
would particularly benefit. The project would also have
a positive impact on agricultural family labor currently
underemployed.
Project Risks:      Credit demand under the project would be dependent on
agricultural prices and profitability. During the
1981-83 period, both international market conditions and
the local economic environment made agricultural invest-
ment less attractive, and investment credit demand
decreased substantially. However, the Government has
recently adopted a number of measures to ensure an ade-
quate producer price for selected commodities. These,
combined with good prospects for profitable production of
export crops, create sectoral conditions in which project
risks are not excessive.

II. THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
A. Agriculture in the Economy
2.01      About 34% of Chile's land area is suitable for agriculture, for-
estry and pasture. Out of a potential 1.9 million ha, about 1.3 million ha
are in crop production; and about 1.0 million are under irrigation. Agricul-
ture directly contributed an average of 6.7% of GDP during 1973-82, and agri-
cultural value-added grew by an average rate of 6% a year from 1974 to 1979.
After 1979, partly as a consequence of an overvalued exchange rate, annual
rates of growth slowed. The agricultural sector value-added declined in 1982
by 3.3%, and in 1983 by 1.1%, but agriculture declined less than GDP as a
whole in these years.
2.02      From 1974 to 1979, a favorable exchange rate system and buoyant
world economy helped agricultural exports to increase at an average annual
rate of 40Z-from US$130 million to US$981 million. The most dynamic were
fruit and forestry products. By contrast, production of some traditional
crops, especially cereals, decreased significantly. After 1979, the value of
exports declined, and in 1983 agricultural exports fell to US$630 million.
Even so, it is estimated that the sector's trade balance registered a surplus
of around US$146 million in the same year.
2.03      Employment in the agricultural sector has declined slightly from
16Z of the labor force in 1970 to 14% in 1982. Rural unemployment has been
estimated at 14.4% in 1983, which compares with a national unemployment esti-
mate of 26Z for the same year.
B. Size of Holdings
2.04      Farm sizes in Chile are expressed in "Irrigated Hectare Equivalent'
(IRE). This is a standard unit of measurement representing the productive
potential of a given hectare. The Ministry of Agriculture (MINAG), has
grouped the country's 353,000 farms into three categories, based on this
system, for the purpose of providing services and credit:
(a) Commercial Farms (more than 12 IHE). As a result of the agrar-
ian reform which ended In 1974, most of these farms do not
exceed 80 IHE. There are some 20,000 such farms (6% of the
total) occupying 52% of the agricultural land and generating
about 70% of total agricultural production;
(b) Small-scale Farms (0.8 to 12.0 IHE). There are some 145,000
farms within this size range (41% of the total), accounting for
about 45% of the agricultural land and about 30% of the total



po--
-5-
agricultural production. They are the main target group of the
credit and technical assistance programs through INDAP; and
(c) "Minifundio" Farms (less than 0.8 IRE). Nearly 188,000 hold-
ings (53% of the total) are included in this category. In most
cases the size and/or ecological quality of these holdings are
unable to provide sufficient production or income for family
subsistence. They occupy 1.52 of the agricultural land and
their contribution to the gross national product is very
small.
C. Organization of the Sector
2.05      The role of Government institutions in the agricultural sector is
smaller in Chile than in most developing countries. The primary responsibil-
ities of MINAG are to: (a) carry out sectoral analyses and policy formula-
tion; (b) allocate budgetary resources to sector entities; (c) supervise the
management of renewable natural resources, of plant and animal sanitation,
and of regularization of rural land tenure; and (d) promote the development
of agricultural technology and provide technical and financial services to
the small farm commurity. MINAG's responsibilities are implemented mainly
through a Sub-Secretariat of Agriculture and the Agricultural Planning Office
CODEPA). Both the Sub-Secretariat of Agriculture and ODEPA are represented
in all provinces and have the function of ensuring integrated development in
the sector. ODEPA also provides support to the Central Bank with the techni-
cal assessment of agriculture projects.
2.06      In addition to the above agencies, other autonomous institutions,
such as the Agriculture and Livestock Service (SAG), the Agricultural
Research Institute (INIA), INDAP, the National Forestry Institute (CONAF),
and private entities under the supervision of MINAG have specific responsi-
bilities in the execution of agricultural policy.
2.07      The Central Bank has a key role in agricultural credit.  As fiscal
agent for the Government, it executes externally-financed agricultural credit
projects. Since 1976, it has had major responsibility for implementing the
financial aspects of three previous Bank-financed agricultural credit proj-
ects, and would be responsible for implementing the financial aspects of the
proposed project, as well as other projects financed by the Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) and the US Agency for International Development
(USAID). It channels loan proceeds and the Government's resources under sub-
sidiary loan agreements with the banks and specialized institutions involved,
and controls and supervises operations.
2.08      INDAP is the Government agency with responsibility for financial
and technical assistance to farmers who have less than 12 IRE. Its objective
is to develop the entrepreneurial and technical ability of these farmers so



-6-
that they become more commercially oriented; this includes the provision of
short-term credit for annual crops and working capital, and medium- and
long-term credit for the establishment of perennial crops, livestock invest-
ments, agricultural equipment and farm development. Although the Government
relinquished direct responsibility for extension services in 1979, INDAP
maintained responsibility for providing or organizing technical assistance to
its borrowers. In 1982, it introduced a pilot program under which farmers
could contract subsidized private consulting services to prepare farm
operating plans supported by individual and group services. In 1983 and
1984, this program was expanded and it is now expected to provide nationwide
coverage. INDAP also provides recommendations on the appropriate use of the
production inputs to farmers who receive minor production credit and are not
able to contract the above services. Although operationally independent,
INDAP's budget, programs, and policies are approved by MINAG.
D. Policy Issues
2.09      Since the end of 1973, the economic policies of the Government
have been based to a substantial extent on a free market system. Under this
policy, markets, prices and interest rates were progressively freed and
subsidies mostly eliminated. The result was that agricultural resources were
reoriented towards commodities for which Chile had a comparative advantage
within a relatively unrestricted import-export market situation. Land
allocated to the production of fruits and pulses for export increased. The
area under forest plantations was substantially expanded through the
Government's program of incentives to the private sector for investments with
export potential.
2.10      Agricultural production, especially of annual crops, declined sig-
nificantly, however, in 1982 and 1983 as agricultural producers faced low
market prices associated with substantially reduced values for many
internationally traded commodities. The low prices, combined with a highly
positive interest rate on borrowed funds and an inappropriate foreign
exchange policy, led to heavy indebtedness amongst some farmer groups.
2.11      In 1983, under increasing domestic pressure, the Government
introduced a number of programs to stimulate agricultural production. First,
domestic reference prices for wheat and oilseeds were introduced and milk
received particular protection through specific tariffs; second, sugarbeet
prices and purchase of total production were guaranteed by a public
corporation; and third, as part of a program designed to alleviate the liqui-
dity crisis of the financial system, agricultural debt, as well as debt in
other sectors, was renegotiated.
2.12      Domestic reference prices for wheat and oilseeds are established
before planting and are based on a five-year average of monthly international
prices with high and low levels eliminated. The Government provides credit
support to the major cooperative union as a purchaser. With the recent
devaluation of the peso, the increase in the general import tariff from



20 to 35 percent, and high international prices, particularly for oils, the
reference prices for 1984 are no longer applicable. Nevertheless, the
Government has agreed to (i) review the effective levels of protection for
wheat, oils, and sugar, and at the request of the Bank, of other agricultural
commodities produced domestically, beginning in April, 1985, and every year
thereafter; (ii) exchange views with the Bank on the result of these reviews;
and (iii) if considered necessary as a result of these exchange of views,
take measures to progressively reduce the levels of protection. Milk
receives specific tariff protection to enable local producers to compete with
imports which are heavily subsidized in their country of origin.
2.13      Sugarbeet prices and purchase of total production have been guaran-
teed by the Government sugar monopoly, IANSA, since May 1983. The support
price is based on estimates of domestic production costs, and aims at
increasing domestic production to substitute for imports of sugar products.
However, the authorities did not limit sugar imports, and the present tariff
was insufficient to raise import costs to present domestic costs. As a
result, IANSA incurred financial losses and accumulated large stocks of sugar
since the inception of the scheme. The Government consequently introduced a
US$150/ton surcharge on sugar imports, but recently reduced the surcharge to
US$120/ton. The recent devaluation of the Peso effectively reduced the
Dollar equivalent support price by over 20%, thus bringing it closer to
international prices, and lowered the effective level of protection by about
50%. While further reduction of protection is important, and will be
reviewed annually, the Government has agreed to carry out a study on
alternative strategies for the long term viability of the sugar subsector not
later than June 1986, under terms of reference acceptable to the Bank. The
Bank would be afforded the opportunity to comment on the recommendations of
the study.
2.14      The short-term liquidity crisis of the financial system in the
early 1980s also affected the agricultural sector. By the end of 1983, about
15,000 farmers owed approximately US$1.5 billion equivalent to the financial
system, accounting for about 13% of the financial system's portfolio.
One-third of the debt was in foreign currency. The bulk of the agricultural
debt was concentrated, however, in 9% of essentially large-scale farmers who
owed 65% of the sector's debt. In March 1983, the Central Bank began a
US$3.5 billion program to purchase overdue loans from commercial banks to
support private debt renegotiation and to provide affected enterprises with
working capital. This program permitted the renegotiation of debt to almost
half of all agricultural borrowers, and farmers were granted special lines of
credit by the Central Bank providing them with working capital without any
collateral other than future crops.
2.15      Farmers demonstrated their responsiveness to the above programs in
the 1983/84 season by increasing wheat planting by 31% and sugarbeets by 34%
compared to the the previous year. The total area under the 14 major annual
crops increased by 21%. Strong interest is also being shown in investment in
milk production as local prices have increased in response to the new tariff
established on imports. Although there was some decline in export fruit



- 8 -
prices in 1983, fruit prr+iction remains profitable and was not subject to
any direct Government intLrvention. Investment is likely to continue in this
area.
E. INDAP-Institutional Issues
2.16      At the end of 1983, INDAP had 30% of its loan portfolio of
US$104 million equivalent in arrears, in part because the repayment capacity
of sub-borrowers has been reduced due to unfavorable sectoral conditions
since 1981 (para. 2.10). This high ratio of arrears includes interest which
is capitalized, and overdue repayments which are indexed. Moreover, although
I!JAP made provisions for bad debts of about 70% of its loan portfolio in
arrears, the Government has not permitted INDAP to write off bad debts.
2.17      INDAP incurred a net loss in 1981 and, despite operating profits in
1982 and 1983, it also experienced net losses in these two years. Provisions
for bad debts and monetary corrections were equivalent to about 90% of net
losses in 1981, and 100% of net losses in 1982 and 1983. As a result, INDAP
has not been able to internally generate the funds needed to maintain its
lending program. The Government therefore provides equity contributions to
cover payroll costs and part of the technical assistance services to farmers,
as well as financing part of the lending program. The relatively intensive
service in loan promotion, preparation, supervision, and technical assistance
inherently involves a high cost per unit value of the loan portfolio with
small-scale farmers; (the average INDAP subloan was less than US$750 equiva-
lent in 1983). Substantial borrowing from the Central Bank and from the
State Bank during the 1981-83 period was necessary to allow INDAP to cope
with credit demand. Borrowings were equivalent to 41% of INDAP's total
assets and provided a 42% debt to capitalization ratio. To help INDAP
improve its financial position, the Government has agreed to take on neces-
sary measures to prevent INDAP from incurring any debt whenever the ratio of
debt to equity is greater than 3 to 1.
2.18      Progress is being made by INDAP in improving its collection capac-
ity. Partial loan recovery information for 1984 showing a high recovery rate
on short-term credit, indicate that overall recovery is likely to surpass the
1983 rate of about 60%. A special committee has prepared a plan for the
recovery of arrears. The plan has been reviewed by Bank staff and has been
found satisfactory. During negotiations, INDAP also agreed to maintain sepa-
rate accounts for the portion of its loan portfolio in arrears that is
recorded in INDAP's accounts as provision for bad debts", as of December 31,
1983, and provide for its collection or write-off by December 31, 1986.
INDAP is also expected to reduce the percentage of its portfolio in arrears
to 13% by December 31, 1985, and to 10% by December 31, 1987.
2.19      The inherent high cost per unit value of INDAP's portfolio will
continue to have a negative effect on its future financial performance.
Nevertheless, after its financial operations are isolated from its technical



-9-
services, INDAP's net losses are substantially reduced and in 1991 it is
expected to achieve a positive net income, as a result of improved collection
performance and managerial efficiency.
F. Bank Assistance
2.20      The Bank has made seven loans to Cnile's agricultural sector since
1948, tota'ling US$106 million. The earliest operations, in 1948 and 1951,
financed agricultural machinery and irrigation improvements in the Elqui
River basin. These were followed in 1963 by a livestock credit project and a
dairy processing project.
2.21      The Bank financed an Agricultural Rehabilitation Project (Loan
1119-CE, approved in May 1975), which provided medium- and short-term credit
to farmers, as weil as technical assistance for the reorganization of MINAG
and other sectoral entities. This loan was disbursed in slightly over a
year, and more than 70% of the credit provided under the project went to
small-scale farmers. The Project Performance Audit Report of June 29, 1979,
found that the project contributed to the recovery of the agricultural sector
through direct support to production. The dialogue with the Government in
the context of this project also helped accelerate the titling of properties
assigned under the land reform and the liberalization of agricultural
prices.
2.22      In December 1976, the Bank approved the Livestock, Fruits, Vine-
yards and Agroindustry Credit Project (Loan 1350-CH for US$50 million) to
finance medium- and long-term investment credit for on-farm development and
related agroindustries. The project was implemented by the Central Bank
through 17 participating banks and IWDAP. The bulk of the credit line was
exhausted during the first 18 months of project execution, as credit demand
by commercial farmers was greater than expected. A Project Completion Report
dated April 25, 1983, indicated that the main objectives of the project were
generally met, although the amount of on-lending to agrarian reform benefic.-
aries and other small-scale farmers possessing farms ranging from 5 to 12 IRE
reached only 17Z of disbursements, as compared to the 30% expected at
appraisal. This was largely because the Government, until 1979 did not
permit INDAP to provide credit to agrarian reform beneficiaries, in the
expectation that the private banking system would finance small-scale
farmers. This attempt was not successful. Subsequently, the Bank and the
Government agreed on institutional arrangements to assist small-scale
farmers, and INDAP was able to lend to agrarian reform farmers after 1979.
2.23      The Bank's most recent agricultural operation in Chile is the ongo-
ing Agricultural Credit Project (Loar 1902-CH for US$36 millioe%, approved in
September 1980). The project provides credit and technical assistance for



- 10 -
on-farm development and related marketing and processing facilities. The
Central Bank, as fiscal agent of the borrower, executed the project through
private commercial banks and INDAP. Disbursements during the three-year
period (1981-83) were only about half that anticipated at appraisal. The
slow disbursements have been associated with the general downturn in the
Chilean economy since 1981. Credit demand by small-scale farmers has been
higher than anticipated (currently 85X of disbursements), and demand by com-
mercial farmers has been low. In the case of small-scale farmers (INDAP
beneficiaries), the negative effects of the economic downturn were generally
not as severe as these farmers did not have a high debt burden, and INDAP has
traditionally assisted clients in rescheduling loan repayments where delin-
quency was attributed to adverse market or climatic conditions.
2.24      In view of the problems affecting the farming sector, amendments
designed to meet the needs o' farmers and to expedite disbursements were
introduced to the Loan Agreement in April 1983 and April 1984. Under a first
amendment the disbursement rate was increased from 50% to 60%, a technology
transfer program for small farmers was funded on the basis of a successful
pilot program, and short-term subloans were financed when linked to
investment subloans. Under a second amendment, short-term lending was
financed without being attached to investment subloans; in addition, funds
were realloc.ted for the purchase of electronic data processing equipment
under a progrim to enhance the effectiveness of INDAP's administration and
portfolio management. As a result of the amendments, INDAP has recently
committed about US$10 million in subloans under the project. Loan
disbursements are expected to accelerate substantially. Project completion
is expected by the extended Closing Date of June 30, 1985.
III. THE PROJECT
A. General
3.01      The proposed project was prepared by ODEPA with assistance from the
FAO/Bank Cooperative Program and Bank staff missions that visited Chile
between November 1982 and May 1983.  Ic was appraised in February/March,
1984, and negotiations took place in Washington, D.C., from October 29 to
November 1, 1984. The Chilean delegation was headed by Mr. Alejandro Espejo,
Executive Director, ODEPA, MINAG.
B. Project Objectives and Description
3.02      The main project objectives would be to increase agricultural pro-
duction, especially of commodities for which Chile enjoys some comparative
advantage, and to assist small-scale farmers to increase productivity on



- 11 -
their farms, thereby improving the economy and welfare of this important
farming subsector. The project would also assist INDAP improve its financial
and operational capacity. The proposed project would include the following
components:
(a) On-farm works and agroindustrial investment credit by commercial
banks and INDAP mainly for perennial fruit crops, on-farm irrigation
and pasture improvement, paddock subdivision, breeding animal pur-
chase, and productive infrastructure for livestock development. The
agroindustrial investment would finance processing of agricultural
and livestock products, including fruit packing. Some 4,000 sub-
loans are expected to be made under this component, of which about
90% would be to small-scale farmers.
(b) Short-term credit by INDAP for annual crops and livestock enter-
prises, and to a lesser degree, fruit crop operations. Over 35,000
subloans would be made annually over the project implementation
period of four years. All credit under this component would be for
small-scale farmers. Only the short-term lending by INDAP which is
incremental to the previous year's level of lending would be
financed. The period of May 1, 1984 to April 30, 1985 would be the
base for measuring incrementality during the first year of project
implementation.
(c) Technical assistance by private consultants for small-scale farmers
and for INDAP. Over 30,000 farmers would participate in a technical
assistance program that is a follow-up on pilot operations that
INDAP has successfully completed in 1982 and 1983. All farmers
undertaking on-farm investment credit or a comprehensive package of
short-term production credit would contract technical assistance
over a period of three years. This assistance would include prepa-
ration of long-term and annual farm operational plans, 10 individual
farm visits and group services. Technical assistance to INDAP would
include short-term consultancies and other costs associated with the
completion of the electronic data processing program started by
INDAP under the Second Agricultural Credit Project (Loar. 1902-CH).
C. Project Execution
3.03      The Central Bank, as fiscal agent of the Borrower, would be
responsible for administering the project funds through its External Finance
Department. ODEPA would assist the Central Bank, participating banks and
INDAP, at their request, in analyzing subloans. In addition, ODEPA would
have responsibility for supervising the implementation of investments,



- 12 -
for monitoring the progress of the project and for evaluating its impact.
The investments to be financed under the project would be carried out over a
four-year period beginning in 1985. Technical assistance to farmers would be
carried out by specialized private consultants selected and hired by the
farmers under contracts satisfactory to INDAP. INDAP would be responsible
for planning, supervising, evaluating and administering the technical assis-
tance component. During negotiations, the Borrower provided assurances that
the qualifications, experience, and terms of employment of consultants
directly hired by INDAP will be satisfactory to the Bank. Procedures for
recruiting consultants to be hired by farmers are satisfactory.
D. Lending Terms and Conditions
3.04      Proceeds of the Bank loan and the corresponding Government counter-
part contributions would be on-lent by the Central Bank to INDAP and partici-
pating commercial banks under subsidiary loan agreements. During negotia-
tions, the Borrower provided assurances that these arrangements for on-
lending will be met. A condition of loan effectiveness would be that the
Central Bank has entered into subsidiary loan agreements with INDAP and at
least one participating commercial bank.
3.05      The Central Bank would on-lend the loan proceeds on behalf of the
Government and the corresponding Government contributions in local currency
to INDAP, at an interest rate of 5.5% per annum and not greater than 7.5% per
annum to commercial banks. The outstanding amounts of these loans would be
-adjusted in accordance with the Chilean CPI. The Central Bank would discount
100% of the amounts of subloans made to project beneficiaries. Reimburse-
ments to INDAP by the Central Bank for technical assistance costs would be
supported by contractual arrangements for the provision of services, satis-
factory to the Bank. The Borrower would provide INDAP with the grant funds
required to repay the principal and interest on the loan from the Central
Bank to finance the Government's share of the technical assistance program.
3.06      Subloans made by participating institutions would finance up to
100% of the costs of the approved investment/production plans of small-scale
farmers, exclusive of family labor, and up to 80% of other project benefi-
ciaries. On-farm and agroindustrial investment subloans would be for up to
12 years, including grace periods of up to 4 years; short-term subloans would
be for up to 18 months. The interest rate on subloans by INDAP would be 9%
per annum, and by commercial banks 10% per annum. Outstanding loan amounts
would be adjusted in accordance with the Chilean CPI. The interest rates
above would allow INDAP a spread of up to 3.5 percentage points; together
with the Government's contributions, this would cover INDAP's full adminis-
trative costs. In the case of commercial banks, a spread of 2.5 percentage
points is considered sufficient to cover administrative costs. Any subloan



- 13 -
or subloans made to any beneficiary exceeding the aggregate US$200,000 equiv-
alent for on-farm development and US$1 million equivalent for agroindustry
would require prior Bank approval. Short-term production subloans by INDAP
would not exceed an aggregate of US$25,000 equivalent per beneficiary per
year. The Borrower would not use the loan proceeds to refinance existing
debt. During negotiations, the Borrower provided assurances that the terms
and conditions of loans between the Central Bank and participating institu-
tions and of subloans will be in accordance with those indicated in paras.
3.05 and 3.06.
3.07      The above interest rates, which continue to be positive in real
terms, are consistent with the Central Bank's policies and would not cause
distortions in relation to other sectors. The interest rate structure would
be reviewed each year by the Borrower and the Bank, starting January 1, 1986,
to ascertain that interest rates (a) remain positive in real terms; and
(b) correspond to market conditions. During negotiations, the Borrower pro-
vided assurances that the interest rate structure will be modified, as
necessary.
E. Project Costs and Financing
3.08      The total project cost is estimated at US$157.2 million, including
about US$23.4 million in taxes and duties, US$5.2 million in price contin-
gencies on the technical assistance component, and the front-end fee. The
estimated price contingencies for foreign exchange costs are 82 in 1985, and
9% annually in 1986-1988; price contingencies for local costs have been
estimated at 30% annually. Foreign exchange costs have been estimated at
US$56 million, or about 42% of total costs net of taxes and duties. The
proposed Bank loan of US$56 million would finance the full foreign exchange
component. The Government would provide US$56 million, and project benefi-
ciaries would contribute about US$45 million.
F. Special Account
3.09      To expedite project implementation, a Special Account would be
established at the Central Bank. Up to US$4.0 million from loan proceeds
could be deposited in the special account, which is equivalent to three to
four months of peak loan requirements. The Special Account would be replen-
ished through the normal reimbursement of project expenditures. During nego-
tiations, satisfactory procedures for the operation of the Special Account
were agreed with the Borrower.



- 14 -
G. Procurement and Disbursements
3.10      The range of goods financed under the project is varied and would
be procured by more than 35,000 project sub-borrowers over a four-year
period. Bulk procurement through international competitive bidding, there-
fore, would not be appropriate. Sub-borrowers would purchase items of their
choice frsm local commercial agents, who represent a broad spectrum of inter-
national and domestic suppliers. Major suppliers of agricultural equipment
and production inputs from Bank member countries are represented in Chile,
and service is satisfactory throughout the project area. Animals for breed-
ing are available from local sources and are of good quality. During negoti-
ations, the Borrower provided assurances that any equipment procured by INDAP
to complete its electronic data processing system will be procured through
international shopping, involving a minimum of three price quotations. The
need for compatibility with equipment already procured would be taken into
account.
3.11      The proceeds of the Bank loan are expected to be disbursed over a
five-year period and would be fully disbursed by March 31, 1990. This esti-
mate takes into account the experience with the past three agricultural
credit projects in the country. Disbursements of loan proceeds would be made
for 50% of amounts disbursed by the Central Bank under subloans for on-farm
and agroindustry investment and short-term credit; and 100% of foreign expen-
ditures and 50% of local expenditures for equipment and services contracted
under the technical assistance component. Disbursement for subloans and for
l ocal services under the technical assistance program would be supported by
statements of expenditures certified by the executing agency. Documentation
for these expenditures would not be submitted to the Bank, but would be
retained by the Central Bank for periodic inspection by Bank staff.
H. Accounting and Audits
3.12      The Central Bank and participating institutions would maintain
separate accounts and records adequate to reflect in accordance with
consistently maintained sound accounting practices, operations, resources and
expenditures under the project, including the Special Account. These
accounts, and the financial statements of INDAP, will be audited in
accordance with appropriate auditing principles consistently applied by
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. Not later than six months after
the end of each fiscal year, a certified copy of the audit report will be
submitted to the Bank in such detail and scope as the Bank would request.
During negotiations, the Borrower provided assurances that these accounting
and auditing requirements will be met.



p-

I. Financial and Economic Justification
3.13      The project would expand the INDAP credit services and develop an
effective technical assistance program in the small-scale farm subsector, in
which only about 20X of farmers currently use institutional credit. The pro-
gram would both increase the small-scale farmer coverage by, 30%, and the
extent of the use of short-term production credit and investment credit by
individual farmers under the guidance provided through the technical assis-
tance program. The investment credit line for large-scale farmers and agro-
industrialists would contribute to the financing of viable agricultural pro-
duction and processing expenditures. Overall, the project would have a sig-
nificant impact on increasing agricultural production. Import substitution
commodities and exports (fresh fruits) would be especially affected, with
consequent foreign exchar.ge benefits. Although the nature of the project
does not enable quantification of employment effects, it is expected to
reduce underemployment in agricultural family labor.
3.14      To examine the incentives which might exist to encourage small-
scale farmers who are currently not borrowing to adopt improved production
techniques and use institutional credit, five farm models representing
typical, traditional production systems in this category of farmers have been
analyzed. The models assume that a low-input annual crop system is changed
to a high-input annual crop system, combined in some cases with the estab-
lishment of table grape vineyards and fruit orchards. The livestock models
involve increased utilization of existing grazing resources, increased milk
prices and greater feed production. Relatively high financial rates of
return ranging from 25X to 75%, reflect the substantial benefits which can be
obtained by using technology, inputs and credit to capitalize on underuti-
lized resources in favorable production environments. The returns on
increased inputs in the annual crops model are in excess of 100%. Annual
family benefits derived from the farm increase from the equivalent of about
US$2,000 to between US$4,000 and US$8,000 for the less capital-intensive farm
models, and to over US$18,000 for fruit crops involving higher capital
investment. The economic rates of return for the five models range from 20%
for beef productipn to 62% for annual crops.
J. Project Risks and Environmental Impact
3.15      The project is a follow-up to several Bank-supported agricultural
credit projects that have used the same implementing institutions. These
institutions have demonstrated their ability to be effective in the field
of agricultural credit. The experience and lessons learned from the recently
developed system of technical assistance through private extension services
indicate that the risk of this component not functioning effectively is
minute. The main risk would be that the economic policy measures adopted by
the Government in 1983 and 1984 would not have their intended impact in



- 16 -
expanding the agricultural economy which may have a detrimental effect on the
demand for credit. These risks are not excessive, and the support for
small-scale farmers within the Chilean economy, as proposed in this project,
would be warranted even if adverse circumstances were to occur.
3.16      No adverse environmental effects are expected as a consequence of
the project. The Government has an effective system of licencing the use of
chemicals and fertilizers.

IV. IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
A. Cost Tables
4.01       The US dollar-Chilean peso exchange rate is adjusted daily by the
Central Bank after taking into account domestic inflation and international
inflation effects. As a result, a real value of the Chilean peso v's-a-vis
the US dollar is maintained. The foreign exchange percentage is based on the
foreign component of expenditures recorded under similar components in
previous projects, and is verified by analysis of the illustrative investment
models. The project costs can be summarized as follows:

4.03       The proposed project lending program is based on: (a) an analysis
of past performance by the participating institutions; (b) the current and
projected economic and sectoral investment environment; and (c) the enhanced
capacity of the major implementing institution, INDAP, through improved loan
processing efficiency and expansion of the technical assistance program.
Historical and projected lending by INDAP, and subloan disbursements by
commercial banks under Loan 1902-CH and the proposed loan, are as follows:

4.04      In the INDAP lending program, the large increase in the amount of
short-term lending in 1987 is due to the completion of three years of the
technical assistance/credit program for 13,000 farmers begun in 1984 by
INDAP. Farmers who have completed the program are replaced by other farmers,
thus enabling more clientele to receive a comprehensive production credit
package with larger individual loans. The INDAP long-term loan portfolio
after 1983 is a conservative estimate of the demand for investment lending by
small-scale farmers following its decline in 1982 and 1983. In lending
through the commercial banks, the increased lending in 1983 was due to a
higher rediscounting proportion by the Central Bank and lower on-lending
interest rates. In 1984, the inclusion of short-term financing in the final
year of Loan 1902-CH, as a temporary measure to assist in the reestablishment
of liquidity in the banking system servicing the agricultural sector, is
expected to increase disbursements significantly. After 1984, conservative
estimates are assumed for investment lending.
B. Subloan Procedures
4.05      Investment subloans to project beneficiaries would be appraised on
the basis of their individual technical and financial viability, and produc-
tion (short-term) subloans on the basis of crop/area models and cash flow
viability. The fees paid by the beneficiaries for private technical assis-
tance in preparing farm development plans for subloan applications and advi-
sory services during implementation of such plans would be included as an
investment item to be financed under the subloans. During negotiations., the
Borrower provided assurances that the repayments to the Central Bank of
borrowings by participating institutions would be in accordance with subloan
repayment schedules.
4.06      Recurrent, non incremental, short-term credit needs of INDAP during
the project implementation period would be financed by loan recoveries and by
the Central Bank with short-term credit roll-over funds.
C. Disbursements
4.07      The amounts and the categories under which the Bank loan would be
disbursed would be: US$19.6 million under Category I (investment subloans);
US$18.4 million under Category 2 (short-term subloans); US$13.06 million
under Category 3 (consultants' fees and training); US$0.8 million under
Category 4 (electronic data processing equipment for INDAP); US$139,651 under
Category 5 (front-end fee); and US$4.0 million under Category 6 (deposit in
the Special Account). Proceeds of the Bank loan would be disbursed over a
period of five years as follows:

p- 
- 21 -
credit loans to Chile (paras. 2.21-2.24): Loan 1119-CH was disbursed in
16 months, Loan 1350-CH in 4.5 years, and Loan 1902-CH is expected to be
fully disbursed after 5.75 years. The latter project has been implemented
under difficult sectoral conditions, and, even then, the original loan allo-
cation to the small-scale farm subsector was disbursed in two years.
D. Performance Indicators
4.09      The Central Bank has satisfactorily monitored the performance of
commercial banks participating in previous credit projects supported by the
Bank, and would continue to have this responsibility under the project.
Financial indicators reflecting the operational projections for INDAP, as the
main implementing institution, are presented in Annex 3, Table 1. The per-
formance levels which INDAP would be required to attain during the project
period, and the measures which have to be taken to address the problem of
irrecoverable arrears, are indicated in para. 2.18. In addition, during
negotiations the Borrower provided assurances that the ratio of debt to
equity will not exceed 3:1 in any year after 1985 (para. 2.17).
E. Accounting Improvements
4.10      INDAP would be required to disclose in its financial statements the
composition of its lending and borrowing portfolios, the accrued interest
receivable and payable, and the disbursements and repayments of funds lent
and borrowed in each fiscal year; data would be presented in both UF1/ and
in Chilean peso equivalents. During negotiations, INDAP agreed to present
financial statements including this information. The agreement is recorded
in a side letter to the Loan Agreement.
F. Reporting. Monitoring and Evaluation
4.11      Participating institutions would prepare and submit semi-annually
to the Central Bank a comprehensive report on the use of the project funds.
The report would include, but not be limited to, periodic and cumulative data
on (a) amounts committed; (b) number and type (as defined by loan terms and
major commodity or investments involved) of loans granted; (c) disbursements
made; and (d) subloan repayments made to participating institutions and
repayments by them to the Central Bank. The Central Bank would in turn
prepare and submit to the Bank semi-annually (by July 31 and January 31), a
consolidated report on the basis of the reports it received from
participating institutions.
1/ UF ('Unidad de Fomento") is a monetary reference unit for which the
Chilen peso equivalent is adjusted daily by the Central Bank in
accordance with changes in the Chilean CPI.



- 22 -
4.12      ODEPA would be responsible for overall monitoring of the project
implementation and for impact evaluation. INDAP is instituting a farm rec-
ording system on a 1OZ sample of small-scale farmers receiving credit with
the technical assistance program. This would facilitate measurement of the
impact of the credit program on agricultural production and small-scale farm
benefits. In the case of non-INDAP clients, the Central Bank would provide
ODEPA with information regarding the individual project beneficiaries, fromt
which ODEPA would collect productivity and financial data by surveying a rep-
resentative sample. ODEPA would report annually (on July 31) on progress in
the monitoring and evaluation program, and would be responsible for the prep-
aration of a draft Project Completion Report to be submitted to the Bank not
later than six months after the Closing Date of the proposed loan. During
negotiations, the Borrower agreed on the content and format of the semi-
annual reports and provided assurances that the above reporting, monitoring
and evaluation requirements will be met.
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01      During negotiations, the Bcrrower provided assurances that:
(a) the issues of agricultural protection and the future of the
sugar subsector will be addressed in accordance with that stip-
ulated in paras. 2.12 and 2.13 (Section 4.06 of the draft Loan
Agreement);
(b) financial performance requirements will be met and measures to
address the problem of irrecoverable arrears will be undertaken
by 1NDAP in accordance with those stipulated in paras. 2.17,
2.18 and 4.09 (Sections 4.04 and 4.05 of the draft Loan
Agreement);
(c) qualifications, experience and terms of employment of
consultants hired by INDAP will be satiz:factory to the Bank
(para. 3.03, and Section 3.02(a) of the draft Loan Agreement);
(d) on-lending arrangements between the Central Bank and each par-
ticipating institution will be covered by subsidiary loan
agreements containing terms and conditions satisfactory to the
Bank (para. 3.04, and Section 3.02(a) of the draft Loan
Agreement);
(e) the Central Bank will on-lend the loan proceeds and the Govern-
ment contributions to INDAP at a 5.5% interest rate per annum
and to other participating institutions at a maximum of 7.5%
per annum on indexed principal (para. 3.05, and Schedule 4
para. A.2 of the draft Loan Agreement);



- 23 -
(f) the Central Bank will discount 100% of the amounts of subloans
made by participating institutions to project beneficiaries
(para. 3.05, and Section 3.02(a) of the draft Loan Agreement);
(g) the Government will supply INDAP with the funds needed to repay
the Central Bank for the loan received to finance the technical
assistance program (para 3.05, and Section 3.02(c) of the draft
Loan Agreement);
(h) investment subloans will be for a maximum of 12 years, includ-
ing 4 years of grace, at a maximum of 9Z interest per an-um on
indexed principal for subloans by INDAP, and a maximum of 10%
for subloans by commercial banks; production subloans by INDAP
will be for a maximzm of 18 months at 9% interest per annum
(para. 3.06, and Schedule 4 of the draft Loan Agreement);
(i) it will comply with the prior approval requirements for sub-
loans and the short-term subloan limit, and that it will not
use the loan proceeds to refinance existing indebtedness (para.
3.06, and Section 1.02(g) to (j) and Schedule 1, para. 5 and
Schedule 4, para. D.1 of the draft Loan Agreement);
(j) the interest rate structure will be reviewed annually and modi-
fied, as necessary, to ensure it remains positive in real terms
and corresponds to market conditions (para. 3.07, and Section
3.04 of the draft Loan Agreement);
(k) the agzeed, satisfactory procedures for the operation of the
Special Account will be followed (para. 3.09, and Section
2.02(b) and Schedule 5 of the draft Loan Agreement);
(1) any equipment to complete INDAP's data processing program will
be procured through prudent international shopping (para. 3.10,
and Section 2.04 of the draft Loan Agreement);
(m) project accounting and auditing requirements will be met as
described in paras. 3.12; and 4.10 (Sections 4.02 and 4.03 of
the draft Loan Agreement); and
(n) repayments to the Central Bank will be in accordance with
subloan repayment schedules (para. 4.05, and Schedule 4,
para. A.1 of the draft Loan Agreement);
(o) reporting, monitoring and evaluation obligations described in
paras. 4.11 and 4.12 will be met (Sections 3.03(b) and (d) of
the draft Loan Agreement).
5.02      A condition of effectiveness would be that subsidiary loan agree-
ments which are satisfactory to the Bank would be completed between the
Central Bank and INDAP and between the Central Bank and at least one other
participating commercial bank (para. 3.05, and Section 6.01 of the draft Loan
Agreement).

CHILE
AGRICULTURAL SERVICES AND CREDIT PROJECT
Agriculture in the Economy
1.        The direct contribution of the agricultural and forestry sector to
GDP during the 1973-1982 decade has been approximately 6.7Z. Services, in-
dustry and commerce are the principal components of GDP, followed by minin8
and agriculture (Table 1). The direct plus indirect contribution of the sec-
tor through such products as foods, beverages, wood, paper, cellulose and
cartons would be much higher. Following a decline in the value of agricul-
tural production in the period 1971-73 (-8.9% annually), the sector responded
to the open market policies of the new administration in 1974 and registered
a 26.7% growth rate in that year. With only two negative growth rates in
1976 and 1978, the agricultural sector achieved an annual growth of 3.0% from
1975 to 1981 (Table 2). Growth rates for the sector were negative in 1982
and 1983, but not to the extent of GDP as a whole when the economy experi-
enced a downturn in these years (Table 2).
2.        With the advent of a relatively free market economy after 1973,
there was a trend away from the production of more traditional crops and a
corresponding increase in non-traditional export crops for which Chile had
some comparative advantage (especially fresh fruits) (Table 3). The agricul-
tural trade balance (including fisheries) changed from a negative US$362
million in 1974 to a positive US$529 million in 1982 (Table 4). Direct
exports from the sector increased from about 2% of total export value in 1974
to 8% in 1982. Fresh fruit became the dominant agriculture export
(Table 5). As the expansion in fruit production was made largely at the
expense of cereals, grain became the most important food import item
(Table 6). Wheat imports rose from 648,000 m ton in 1977 to 1,160 m ton in
1983 (Table 7).
3.        By the end of 1982, although the advantages of the Government's
policies in developing a positive agricultural trade balance were obvious,
some negative consequences also became evident. These were: (a) strongly re-
duced domestic production of commodities which are traded internationally at
prices heavily subsidized by exporting countries (e.g., sugar and milk); and
(b) depressed confidence of farmers to produce commodities for which large
savings in international prices occurred (e.g., wheat). Consequently, the
Government introduced a number of tariff and marketing measures to overcome
these problems. The response by farmers to market forces and recent Govern-
ment interventions with respect to particular agricultural commodities are
described in the following paragraphs.
Traditional Annual Crops
4.        There are 14 major crops in this group, including cereals, pulses,
oilseeds, sugarbeets and potatoes. The harvested area of these crops was



- 26 -                           Annex 1
Page 2 of 16
relatively stable at around 1,200,000 ha from 1965 until 1980. This area de-
creased in 1981, 1982 and 1983, largely due to a substantial decline in the
area planted to wheat (34%) and to pulses (36x), which was not sufficiently
compensated by expansion in other crops (Table 9). In contrast, in the
period between 1976 and 1980, a decline of 22% in the wheat area1/ was not
associated with a decrease in the total area dedicated to annual crops, as
other crops compensated for the decrease in wheat. In the 1983 agricultural
season, there were major increases in the areas planted to wheat (31Z), corn
(17%), rice (31Z) and sugarbeets (34%). The total area of the 14 crops
increased by 21% to 1,050,600 ha.
5.        In general, the changing allocation of land use to the crops in
this group can be explained by a price/profitability response of farmers, in
which price competition from freely imported goods (e.g., wheat, sugar, vege-
table oils)2/ and changing international prices for exports (pulses and bar-
ley) were the major factors. For 1983 plantings, the limited intervention
policies by Government, which provided a measure of guaranteed prices for
wheat, corn, rice and sugarbeets, also had a major influence (para. 7). The
reasons for the decline in total area harvested of the 14 crops from 1981 to
1983 is less apparent, but could be associated with the tight credit situa-
tion and the general lack of confidence in the economy which followed the
boom years.
6.        The Government has recently introduced a number of measures to
stimulate production of annual crops:
(a) In 1983 the State Bank introduced a line of credit for cereal
production which accepted the crop as guarantee and entailed a
lower than normal interest rate at 7% per annum on principal
indexed to the CPI.
(b) The import tariff level was increased from 10% to 20% of
c.i.f. value in April 1983, and was raised as a temporary
measure to 35% in September 1984.
(c) A minimum price for wheat was guaranteed (effective for the
1983/1984 harvest) by imposing a special variable tariff in
addition to the regular import tariff on c.i.f. value.
(d) Since December 1982, the State Bank has financed the major
agricultural cooperative union, COPAGRO, as a purchaser of
wheat, maize and rice; loans cover 80% of purchase value and
1/ Although the wheat area has declined continuously since 1976, in 1983 it
was still the most important crop, occupying 41% of the total harvested
area of the 14 crops.
2/ It should be noted that the existence of a liberal import policy did not
necessarily mean that farmers would receive a full import parity price
for their produce. Some studies indicate that producers were offered
prices significantly less than the full import parity price (-Estudios de
los Mercados de Cereales, Carne y Leche: Organizacion e Imperfecciones"-
Universidad Catolica de Chile).



- 27 -                        Annex 1
Page 3 of 16
bear 8% positive interest rate per annum. Although less than
8% of these crops were purchased through COPAGRO in 1983, mar-
ket prices did appear to reflect the influence of COPAGRO as a
competitor.
(e) For the 1984/1985 wheat season, the Government has introduced a
Tband- price scheme under which COPAGRO would be used to offer
a minimum price based on the lowest monthly f.o.b. Gulf price
for the previous five years after eliminating the 12 months
which had the lowest average prices. The special tariff would
be used as necessary to protect this minimum price. An upper
price limit, above which the general tariff level would be
reduced, was also established by eliminating the 12 months
which had the highest average prices over the last five years.
(f) In April 1984, a minimum price scheme similar to that provided
.or wheat was announced for oilseeds; current high world
prices, however, would indicate that this scheme will not be
invoked in the 1984/85 season.
(g) The state sugar enterprise, IANSA3/, in May 1983 introduced a
policy of guaranteeing a sugarbeet price which is designed to
remove the impact of major fluctuations in the world market and
to take into account local costs of production. The 1983 crop
price was established at US$47 to US$58 per m ton of sugarbeets
(before value-added tax) depending on distance from the mill.
Contracts are established at planting time, and IANSA makes
advance payments to cover production inputs which it also pro-
vides. However, due to low international prices permitting low
cost imports, IANSA has incurred financial losses and accumu.-
lated large stocks of sugar since the inception of the scheme.
Consequently, the Government introduced a temporary surcharge
of US$125 per ton on sugar imports in September 1983.
7.        The recent departures from the uniform tariff system provide incen-
tives for the production of the targeted commodities. However, the introduc-
tion of these intervention measures opens possibilities for expansion of this
form of protection to other commodities, which would have substantial infla-
tionary effects. The incentive to invest in some export-oriented crops
needed for longer-term economic growth is also reduced by protection measures
applied to the domestic production of imported commodities. Consequently,
product pricing and import tariff policies are issues currently being dis-
cussed by the Bank with Chilean authorities following the June 1984 agricul-
tural sector review mission.
Fruits
8.        Between 1954 and 1974, the area planted to fruits increased at a
rate of 3% per annum; from 1975 to 1983, the annual growth rate was 4.5%
(Table 10). The highest growth rate (18% per annum) has been in table
31 IANSA is a parastatal company which operates five plants in Curico,
Linares, Cochares, Los Angeles and Rapaco. After the current
administration took office, IANSA was sold in part to the private sector,
but more recently the Government has taken full control.

grapes, which occupied 19% of the area under fruits in 1983. Apples are
second in importance among the fruits, occupying 18% of the fruit area. The
following are the major fruits exported:

9.        The allocation of land to fruit production has been iaxgely in line
with market prices and profitability.  In the case of the five export fruits,
the volume and price of international markets has promoted the expansion of
table grapes and apples. The US is the major market for export grapes (75%),
nectarines (72%) and plums (64%), while the European and Saudi Arabian mar-
kets assume more importance with apples and pears. Chile's situation in the
southern hemisphere provides it with attractive opportunities for marketing
seasonally produced fruits in the northern hemisphere. This is particularly
so for grapes and soft fruits (plums, nectarines) which have a short storage
life; the latter factor limits the extent to which northern hemisphere seaso-
nal production can be held over for marketing in the off-season. However,
Chile does have competition in its fruit exports from South Africa,
Australia, New Zealand and Argentina. A positive effect of this competition
has been the development of a fruit industry in Chile which is technically
advanced in production methods and is competent in preparation and marketing
of its products. Quality control is the responsibility of exporters who have
their own Association of Exporters. SAG is responsible for sanitary control.
10.       Although there was some decline in export fruit prices in 1983,
fruit export prices are still profitable and have continued to be attractive
during the expansion period (Table 8). The local market is generally sup-
plied with fruit which is of lower quality than that exported, and farm-gate
prices are normally from 25% to 60% of that received for fruit destined for
export, depending on fruit type. The effective price received by the farmer
is the result of a mix of export and local prices. Because of the price dif-
ference in these markets, there is a very strong incentive for the farmer to
emphasize quality in production and presentation.
11.       Most fruits do not start yield'ng until the end of the third year
after planting and do not reach a production peak until the ninth to thir-
teenth year depending on fruit type. When this phenomenon is combined with
the recent expansion in plantings, it can be anticipated that the volume of
production in the next four to eight years will be substantially higher than
in 1983. The overall impact of this higher volume on export prices will
largely depend on the extent to which export markets can be expanded. It is
generally believed that the industry could operate profitably at signifi-
cantly lower export prices, and this is supported by farm budget analysis.

However, the area of apple orchards currently under development suggests that
there could be some export marketing difficulties with this fruit (Table 11).
Meat
12.       The cattle population increased steadily from 1965 to 1973 at an
annual growth rate of 1.2%. From 1974 to 1976 there was a slight reduction
of 1.0% annually, which was followed by a herd retention phase from 1977 to
1982, when the national herd had reached 3.8 million. In 1983, there was a
reduction in total inventory due to forced sales associated with drought con-
ditions in the major cattle zones. Government intervention has affected
these cycles: (a) between 1970 and 1973 the previous administration attempted
to prohibit the sale of female cattle to encourage herd build-up; (b) in
1974, when sale restrictions were removed, there was a liquidation phase; and
(c) in 1977, all imports of live cloven-footed animals and bone-in carcasses
were prohibited in the Government campaign to arrive at a FMD free status.
The latter action effectively protected the local beef industry against
imports from other Latin American countries. Although chilled and frozen
beef without bones could be imported, the local market was not geared to
handling non-fresh meat. Beef prices consequently rose, and the classical
retention phase began with rising market prices.
13.       An examination of Tables 12 and 13 indicates how price has affec-
ted consumption of alternative meat products, and also production in the case
of the more intensive poultry and pig enterprises. Sheep meat has followed
the price trend of beef but has moved upwards relative to beef price in re-
cent years when supply of mutton and lamb has decreased somewhat. As beef
prices rose, so did pork prices, and considerable investment was made after
1977 to increase pork production until prices stabilized at between 85% and
90% of beef prices in 1981 to 1983. Poultry meat production increased drama-
tically after 1977 as meat prices rose in general, and as the introduction of
efficjent production technology and relatively cheap maize enabled profitable
production at prices from 12% to 25% lower than beef.
14.       Meat price relationships can be expected to continue in a manner
similar to that demonstrated in recent years. Price levels will be deter-
mined by internal supply and demand forces and should therefore be maintained
at satisfactory levels. If beef production were to expand to enable an ex-
portable surplus, the main competitors would be Central America and Oceania
(as FMD free areas). Prices in 1983 in Queensland, the major beef exporting
state of Australia, were similar at final live markets to those existing in
Chile, which suggests that Chile may be able to enter the export market with-
out a significant negative effect on prices offered to producers. However,
considerable investment in meatworks would be necessary to bring existing
establishments up to export requirements; competition from established
exporting countries would also be very severe.
Milk
15.       The average national milk production per annum was estimated at 856
million liters in the period 1965-1974 compared to 1,016 million liters in
the period 1975-1983. In the latter period, an average of 570 million liters
per annum was delivered to pasteurizing plants. National production is



-30 -                             Annex I
Page 6 of 16
insufficient to meet demand for milk products, and imports (as whole milk
equivalent) have ranged from 22% to 37% of the total of imports and local,
plant processed milk volume in the last nine years; butter and whole milk
powder (26% fat) are the major imports, followed by skim milk powder.
16.       Both milk and beef production in Chile are largely based on
Friesian-type cattle grazing on native and improved pastures, sometimes com-
plemented by grazing crops or crops conserved as hay. This type of produc-
tion system inevitably is associated with a large variation in deliveries to
milk plants according to the seasonal feed cycle; summer is the period of
high production. There are two principal milk production zones: (a) the
southern zone with a wet Mediterranean and cool temperate climate, to which
about 80% of the national milking herd pertains, and in which the traditional
grazing system is the most common form of production; and (b) the central
zone of Mediterranean climate which comprises close to 20% of the national
milking herd and generally has a higher level of production technology
(greater use of fodder crops and crop conservation) and higher output per
animal and per hectare. The central zone has the advantage that it is close
to the major consumer markets and has better access, which facilitates both
input supply and the marketing of milk as a perishable commodity.
Consequently, the central zone milk plants process about 60% of the fluid
milk entering the formal market, 80% of the yoghurt and 14% of the butter,
while the southern zone processes all the powdered milk, 99% of cheese, 84%
of butter, 20% of yoghurt and 40% of fluid milk.
17.       The type of final milk product has a significant effect on the
price a plant can pay farmers for the primary product. This has given rise
to (a) producer price differentials between the southern and central zone
(the latter having a greater share of higher net margin products-fluid milk
and yoghurt), and (b) incentive payments to encourage production 'off-season'
and the presentation of a higher quality primary material (through clean-
liness, temperature control, etc.).
18.       Due to the open import system and the need to import milk products
to satisfy demand, the local producer price has been restricted by competi-
tion from imported products. International prices have been largely deter-
mined by the degree of subsidy applied to milk products by the European
Economic Community (EEC). Average producer price levels from 1977 to 1982
for the central and southern zones are presented in Table 14.4/
19.       There is a substantial informal market in fluid, unpasteurized milk
delivery to private customers in cities and towns and, especially in the
southern zone, production of cheese -on-farm for sale in local urban centers
is also very common. Producers generate substantial financial benefits by
marketing through the informal channels.
4/ The Government did not intervene in any price control in this period. In
December 1983, Santiago retail and wholesale prices for 2.5% fat fluid
milk were Ch$ 34.5/1 and Ch$ 31/1, respectively, both prices including
value-added tax.

Page 7 of 16
20.       In an attempt to reduce competition from subsidized exports from
other countries, the Government has introduced a special tariff on milk
products. The Government annually sets a "reference price' for whole and
skim milk powders, butter and cheese, which are equal to the estimated
wholesale price for these products in the EEC. Instead of the regular 20%
tariff, a 35Z tariff is then applied over the reference price for the
product, or over the c.i.f. price, whichever is greater.5/ This measure
already has had some effect on prices in 1983 and in 1984, particularly in
the southern zone. Average prices, excluding value-added tax, received in
1983 and being offered in 1984 by milk plants are approximately Ch$ 11.2/1
(US$0.13) and Ch$ 13.7/1 (US$0.16), respectively, in the southern zone.
Other Agricultural Products
21.       Forestry.  In 1974, the new administration adopted policies of ex-
panding forest plantations as a potentially significant export earner and
of transferring industry responsibility to the private sector. Table 15 dem-
onstrates how effective these policies have been, and the success can be
attributed largely to the investment incentives provided by Government to the
private sector. Initially, the subsidy was equivalent to 75% of the cost of
developing new plantations, and this was later increased to 90Z. Forest pro-
duction has increased substantially (Table 16), and cellulose exports have
increased from 179,200 m ton in 1974 to 462,000 m ton in 1982.
22.       Wine.  There are about 110,000 ha planted to wine grapes.  Prices
for wine increased between 1977 and 1980, but then dropped 50% to 60%
(depending on type) in 1981 and 1982. This price decline was due to a number
of factors: (a) an increased volume of wine caused by some improvement in
wine processing technology, the maturation of vines planted earlier in the
1970s, and deregulation of the market which allowed the production of wines
of lower alcoholic content; (b) an increased volume on the local market not
only due to more production but also because of the entry of imported wines;
and (c) a reduction in local per capita consumption of 20% on historical
intake. There are few prospects for Chile to significantly expand its wine
exports in the near future, as world-wide production has increased substan-
tially in recent years in developed countries (Western Europe, Yugoslavia and
the US), and per capita consumption is lower due to the general economic
recession.
23.       Vegetables.  The area allocated to vegetable growing has been rela-
tively constant at around 100,000 ha in recent years. The area of each
species varies in accordance with supply and demand effects. Onions are a
significant export at about 26,000 m ton annually.
5/ Reference prices for 1984 are US$2,155 for whole milk powder, US$1,405
for skim milk powder, US$3,418 for butter and US$2,436 for cheese.

CHILE
AGRICULTURAL SERVICES AND CREDIT PROJECT
The Technical Assistance Program
Background
1.        After 1973, in accordance with the general policy of reducing the
intervention by and services provided through public sector institutions,
fewer resources were allocated to the agricultural extension service, which
was implemented through SAG. It is generally acknowledged that the level of
agricultural extension services provided in the 1970s to the majority of
farmers was relatively poor. Despite this, in the same period many innova-
tive commercial farmers did make use of improved technology originating from
national and external research and commercial institutions to develop high
production levels per hectare. The Government, at the beginning of 1979,
disbanded the SAG extension service, and indicated that (a) improved technol-
ogy would be transferred to farmers through diffusion from the national
(INIA) and private agricultural research institutions and universities; and
(b) direct agricultural extension services would be provided by the private
sector.
2.        To enhance the development of private sector services, the
Government in mid-1978 initiated the Asistencia Tecnica Empresarial' (ATE)
program, which was executed through the regional offices of MINAG. The ATE
beneficiaries were smaller farmers (less than 15 IHE) who were serviced
through private consulting firms which were financed by a MINAG subsidy and
the recipient farmers. About 48,000 farmers had received some degree of
attention through ATE between 1979 and 1982 when the program ceased. The
results of the services offered under the ATE program were variable and de-
pended largely on the capability and diligence of the individual consulting
firms providing the services. However, ATE did demonstrate (a) that a large
proportion of farmers were willing to pay for technical assistance, and
(b) that, to ensure success, careful selection and supervision of the
consulting firms would be necessary, as well as continued training of their
technicians.
3.        Although the Government relinquished direct responsibility for
extension services in 1979, INDAP did maintain responsibility for providing
or organizing technical assistance to its clientele of smaller farmers. It
made some use of the ATE program to provide technical assistance associated
with its lending operations, and in the 1982 agricultural year, introduced a
pilot technical assistance program (TAP) using subsidized private consultant
services in an agricultural region to the south of Santiago to gain
experience for a larger program. Preliminary results have demonstrated that
technical assistance can be effectively delivered through this system and
have also confirmed the lessons already demonstrated in using private sector
technical services under the ATE program.

Current Program for Small Farmers
4.        Based on its successful experience with the 1982 pilot program, in
the 1983 agricultural year INDAP expanded TAP to cover 13,730 farmers. INDAP
is further extending the program in the 1984 season. From 1984 through the
1992 agricultural year, INDAP plans to cover about 50,000 of the small-scale
farmers with between 0.8 and 12.0 IHE. This would represent 34X of the
farmers in this group, and, therefore, would cover most farmers who could be
classed as relatively receptive to improved technology. The estimated
schedule for TAP is presented in Table 1, and financial support under the
proposed loan would commence in the 1985 agricultural year. The scale of the
program is in accordance with the capacity of INDAP to organize and
administer TAP, and with an acceptable degree of Government subsidy for the
service. The program would be country-wide, and the usual process of
diffusion of improved practices from the recipients of TAP to other farmers
in the small-scale farmer group could be anticipated. Those clients of INDAP
who receive minor production credit or long-term loans for single items would
not normally be serviced through TAP, but would receive written
recommendations at the time of borrowing concerning appropriate use of the
production inputs financed; INDAP technicians would provide this restricted
service.
5.        The TAP would include individual farm visits and group services for
a period of three years. Each participant would receive ten visits per year
from the technician of the contracted firm.-/ The technician would develop
long-term plans and annual plans with the farmer and deal with agro-economic
aspects of the farm operation during each visit. In groups of 16 farmers
with similar production circumstances, training would be given through
demonstrations and actual case studies by the contracted firms (ten meetings
per year). Two field days on production aspects appropriate to
specific agro-ecological zones would be provided annually. A farm recording
system has been developed and is being revised by INDAP to be more
appropriate to farmer circumstances. This would be introduced on a 101
sample of recipient farms. The consulting firms would also be rerponsible
for providing home economics training to farm families in groups of 16 (three
meetings per year).
6.        Each consulting firm employed would be approved by INDAP, and would
be employed under annual contrac;s which can be revoked or extended depending
on performance. To enhance the capacity of INDAP to reliably assess the per-
formance of each firm, ten experienced professional consultants would be
contracted to supervise the field operations and effectiveness of the firms
involved in TAP. INDAP would also organize short training programs (using
INIA and agrarian universities) for the members of the consulting firms, at
which attendance would be obligatory. This control/supervision program was
shown to be necessary both from the results of the former ATE program and
INDAP's pilot experience.
1/  Each technician from the contracted firm would cover about 48 farmers.  A
consulting group would include a maximum of three technicians per
professional. A consultant operating without associates would require
professional qualifications.

Costs of TAP
7.        The costs of TAP per farmer, including the subsidy and farmer con-
tribution, are presented in Table 2. The costs of farm visits in the
southern zone are a little higher than elsewhere due to distances involved
and difficulty in access. The total costs of the program over the four years
of the project are indicated in Table 3.
Technical Assistance by INIA
8.        Although INIA has always had a Department of Information and had
production specialists on its staff, increased emphasis has been given to the
role of INIA in technology transfer since 1982. This institution now has a
Director of Technology Transfer and a Director of Research. "Technology
transfer groups' have been formed as a means of providing technical assist-
ance; these usually consist of 12 to 16 commercial farmers who meet on a
voluntary basis to exchange experiences and discuss appropriate technology
and enterprise management. A professional from INIA is assigned to each
group as a technical coordinator who generally assists the groups in their
meetings and organizes visits by specialists where appropriate. Some farmer
groups also retain a private agricultural consultant vho services individual
group members. Despite the increased emphasis on technology transfer, INIA
has not received additional budgetary allocations for this purpose.
Therefore, the average professional in INIA is expected to dedicate about 20%
to 25% of his work hours to this program. The system has been well accepted
and 95 farmer groups were operating in March 1984, covering about 1,400
farmers.  INIA intends to double this number over the next three years.  No
financing for this service is provided under the proposed loan. As indicated
in para. 6, INIA also participates in training of staff of the consultancy
firms contracted under TAP.

CHILE
AGRICULTURAL SERVICES AND CREDIT PROJECT
The Agricultural Development Institute (INDAP)
Organization and Objectives
1.        INDAP was established in 1962 as a Government agency to provide
financial and technical assistance to "minifundio" and small-scale farmers.
Although operationally independent and with full capacity to acquire and exer-
cise rights and contract obligations, its budget, action programs, and poli-
cies are to be approved by the Ministry of Agriculture. INDAP'a main respon-
sibilities are to: (a) provide production and development credit and technical
assistauce to small-scale farmers; and (b) promote the development of disad-
vantaged rural subsectors. particularly among indigenous population groups.
Policy decisions are made by a permanent council chaired by the Minister of
Agriculture. The council has five members in addition to the chairman; these
members are the Vice-President of INDAP, the Executive Director of SAG, the
President of the State Bank and two 'armer representatives. Management is
under the direct responsibility of the Executive Vice Presidency. It has a
National Directorate in Santiago and 13 Regional Directorates which in turn
are assisted by 84 field offices throughout the country. The National
Directorate has four support units (Operations, Indian Affairs, Finance and
Administration) and one advisory unit (Studies) (Chart 1). As a result of
reorganizations and adjustments undertaken during the past ten years, the
number of employees has been reduced from 4,429 in December 1973 to 2,532 in
September 1975, and to 980 currently; about 50% of the employees are techni-
cally qualified in agriculture.
Operations
2.        INDAP's operational efficiency has improved substantially during the
past three years. It is now a well-established and reputable entity which
is capable of channeling supervised credit to small-scale farmers. Lending
operations include short-term credit for annual crops and working capital
requirements, medium-term credit for farm development and agricultural equip-
ment, and long-term credit for establishment of perennial crops. breeding
livestock, land development and infrastructural works. Credit is granted to
individual farmers and to farmer associations or cooperatives. Technical
assistance is tied to lending operations and is provided through individual
private agricultural consultants or consulting firms. For its lending opera-
tions, INDAP is funded mainly with borrowings from the Central Bank and has
recently received support for rescheduling the loans (from the Cantral Bank
through the State Bank). Although its operations are similar to those of a
development bank, INDAP is not regulated by the banking legislation ana it is
not authorized to receive cash deposits except as debt service payments made
by its clients. Its banking operations are conducted through branches of the
State Bank.

Lending Policies and Procedures
3.        INDAP's lending policies are geared to the efficient use of the
financial resources it makes available to its borrowers. Among these poli-
cies, the following are the most significant:
(a) loans are made only to farmers (individuals or associations)
with less than 12 IHE;
(b) loans are made on the basis of technically and finam.ca'Lly
viable investment plans oriented to improve production;
(c) grace and amortization periods are in accordance with type of
investment and cash flow projections;
(d) loan amounts are commensurate with the repayment capacity of
the borrower;
(e) interest rates are positive in real terms;
(f) personal, chattel or mortgage guarantee are required for all
types of loans; and
(g)  INDAP's lending progr-is are prepared annually on the basis of
credit demand and the administrative capacity of INDAP as a
lending institution.
4.        General lending procedures are spelled out in the credit regulations
approved by INDAP's permanent council on September 1, 1983, and effective
since January 1, 1984. Among them, the most relevant are:
(a) eligible loan beneficiaries should: (i) be receiving technical
assistance satisfactory to INDAP; (ii) have agricultural pro-
duction as their main source of income; (iii) have assets not
exceeding UF 3,500 (equivalent to about US$73,000) as of
December 31, 1983 and (iv) have a satisfactory credit status
with INDAP;
(b) loan principal is indexed by being denominated in UF whose
equivalence in Chilean pesos is continuously adjusted until the
loan is fully repaid;
(c) execution of the investment plans and the use of loan proceeds
are to be supervised;
(d) loan applications are received at field offices and their
approval or rejection is made bv the field office loan
committee, by the regional loan committee, or by the national
loan committee depending on size and type of investment;



-48 -                           Annex 3
Page 3 of 16
(e) in accordance with the circumstances of each loan, disburse-
ments are made in a single amount or in installments, either in
kind (inputs, fertilizers), by direct payment to supplier, or
exceptionally in cash;
(f) loan amounts can be increased, repayment of one or more
installments can be rescheduled, and the loan conditions can be
revised (renegotiated) after formal approval by the corre-
sponding regional or national loan committees. Rescheduling of
amounts in arrears include capitalization of interest due and
unpaid;
(g) interest rates are set and revised from time to time by the
Executive Vice-president of INDAP and are applied nationwide.
They can vary according to the type of loan, and have usually
been higher for short-term than for long-term loans; and
(h) short-term loans in excess of 150 UF must be supported by a
cash flow analysis and long-term loans must have at least 18Z
internal rate of return and have cash flow viability.
5.        Other procedures not disclosed in INDAP credit regulations but cur-
rently in practice include:
(a) collateral or personal guarantee should have a value of at
least 1.5 times the loan amount; and
(b) unpaid installments are transferred from current loans to loans
in arrears, and higher penalty interest rates are charged on
amounts outstanding in arrears.
Accounting and Auditing Procedures
6.        Accounting procedures were improved during the past five years as a
result of recommendations made under previous Bank-financed projectai (Loans
1119-CH and 1350-CH) and with the assistance of USAID, ODEPA and private con-
sultants. There is still room for further improvements, mainly in the presen-
tation of INDAP's financial statements and in recording of lending and borrow-
ing transactions. As the bulk of lending and borrowing transactions have been
handled manually, a program for computerization of INDAP's accounts was pre-
pared by INDAP's staff and a Bank consultant in March 1984; partial financing
was approved under Loan 1902-CH and the program has commenced.
7.        An accrual basis of accounting is in use and financial statements
are prepared quarterly. Presentation of financial statements conform to
requirements of the National Controller's Office (NCO), which are inappropri-
ate for a credit institution. INDAP would therefore be required to prepare
additional statements in which proper disclosure is made of its lending and
borrowing portfolios, of accrued interest receivable and payable, and of
annual disbursements/repayments of loans/borrowings. Currently, outstanding
balances of the current portfolio, interest accrued and principal plus inter-
est in arrears are aggregated in the financial statements.
8.        Internal auditing is performed by INDAP's own Controller's unit and
by representatives of the NCO working full time at INDAP's headquarters. This
audit is oriented mainly to ensure proper use of budgetary allocations, and
little is done regarding internal control procedures. Improvements in control

Page 4 of 16
procedures should be made during execution of the proposed project. External
auditing of INDAP's accounts is performed by the Administrative Audits Divi-
sion of the NCO. The scope of this audit is limited to an opinion on the fair-
ness of the presentation of INDAP's financial statement and of its compliance
with guidelines of the NCO and with those of the Superintendent of Securities
and Insurance. It does not comment on internal control procedures, nor on
contractual obligations of INDAP. Under the proposed project the external
audit would conform to 'Bank Guidelines for Financial Reporting and Auditing
of Projects Financed by the World Bank."
Loan Portfolio, its Control and Management
9.        At the end of 1983, INDAP's gross loan portfolio, including capital-
ized interest on arrears, was equivalent to about US$104 million and accounted
for about 86% of its total assets. Close to US$31 million, or about 30% of
its lending portfolio was in arrears, and accumulated provisions for uncol-
lectables totalled about US$22 million. Although this arrears situation is
unsatisfactory, the following factors have to be considered in its interpre-
tation: (a) INDAP has not been permitted to write off bad debts; (b) all prin-
cipal in arrears is indexed to the CPI; and (c) the higher interest rate on
arrears is capitalized and amounted to about US$7 million on December 31,
1983. Had progressive write-offs been made, the amounts in arrears would have
been reduced to a reasonable level, especially when the reduced repayment
capacity of farmers due to unfavorable economic conditions in recent years is
taken into account.
10.       As shown in Table 2, most of the amount in arrears is overdue for
more than one year. In 1983, INDAP improved its collection record, and 60% of
the amount due in 1983 was either paid in advance or by the due date. About
US$2.0 million equivalent of the amount overdue at the beginning of 1983 was
collected in that year, and close to US$11.0 million equivalent of arrears was
rescheduled; the latter included about US$4.0 million equivalent due in 1983.
Also, a committee was establish.ed early in 1984 to address the problem of col-
lection of amounts in arrears. To further emphasize the need for improvement
in this area, specific collection levels are required under the proposed loan
and the submission of a satisfactory plan to rationalize the arrears situation
was a condition of Board presentation.
11.       INDAP has a manual system to control its loan portfolio.  Individual
files are kept for each loan on a control card and a separate card is used to
record amounts in arrears transferred from current loans (unpaid install-
ments). Field offices prepare on a monthly basis schedules of repayments due;
action is also taken to help farmers to make their repayment, to warn them
aboui the penalties for overdue amounts, and to propose solutions to their
problems. A computerized system will be developed during 1984-85 to improve
INDAP's efficiency in managing its portfolio (para. 6).
Financial Performance
12.       INDAP's financial statements for the period 1981-83 are presented in
Tables 3-5. Although a modest operating profit was recorded in 1982, and a
further improvement occurred in 1983, non-operating expenses and non-cash
charges (provision for bad debts and monetary corrections) resulted in net
losses in cash of the three years. Provisions for bad debts (para. 9) and



-50 -                           Annex 3
Page 5 of 16
monetary corrections were equivalent to about 90% of net losses in 1981, and
1OOZ of net losses in 1982 and 1983. INDAP has therefore been unable to
internally generate the funds needed to maintain its lending programs.
13.       Government contributions, which are not shown as revenue but as
equity, have been made to cover INDAP's payroll expenses and the cost of some
social programs for low income, underprivileged groups. Since its inception,
INDAP has been responsible for improving the welfare of the lower-income rural
population, rather than being profit-oriented. The necessary intensive ser-
vice to small-scale farmer clients in promotion and preparation of loan sub-
missions, in loan supervision and in technical assistance, results in a high
cost per unit value of portfolio. Such costs cannot be expected to be met by
the 3-4Z interest spread under which INDAP has been operating on its borrowed
funds. Consequently, the Government subsidy in meeting the payroll is justi-
fied.
14.       Government contributions a'lowed the release of part of INDAP's
reserves for use in its short-term lending program. However, substantial bor-
rowing from the Central Bank during the 1981-83 period and from the State Bank
in 1983 was necessary to allow INDAP to cope with credit demand. Outstanding
borrowings at the end of 1983 were equivalent to about US$41 million, and
equity to about US$56 million. Borrowings were equivalent to 41% of INDAP's
total assets and provided a 42% debt to capitalization ratio which indicate a
satisfactory indebtedness position. While most of INDAP's borrowings are
mediumr- to long-terr, about 252 of its lending portfolio is short-term, thus
allowing about US$20 million equivalent to be rolled over annually.
Financial Forecast
15.       INDAP's future financial performance is expected to improve substan-
tially as a result of additional inflow of funds, combined with actions to
improve its collection performance and its managerial efficiency. Financial
self-sufficiency will not be reached In the near future, however, and Govern-
ment support will continue to be needed to cover personnel costs. This sup-
port is justified in view of the nature of INDAP's function (para. 13'. Fore-
casted financial indicators and financial statements together with assumptions
used for the projections are shown in Tables 6-8. The financial projections
exclude about US$22 million equivalent of loan plus interest in arrears that
INDAP assumes uncollectable (hence, they have been considered as bad debt
write-offs in the projections). Any successful attempt to collect or resched-
ule these amounts may further improve INDAP's finE.ces.  The financial projec-
tions are presented in constant 1984 US dollar equivalents to reduce the
uncertainties of estimating the fluctuations of the Chilean peso. The projec-
tions show that INDAP would be able to maintain after 1989 a constant level of
about US$15 million of medium- and long-term investment credit, and about
US$73.5 million in a short-term line of credit; about 55% of its lending oper-
ations would be funded from annual roll-over of its short-term borrowings from
the Central Bank.  She large influx of funds associated with an expanded lend-
ing program in 1984, coimbined with the availability of roll-over funds and an
ambitious collection performance, are the main reasons for the large cash
balances from 1985 to 1991 projected in Table 7.

INDAP - Main Assumptions Used for Financial Forecast in Tables 6, 7 and 8
General
1.        Constant US dollars were used to approximate INDAP's finances for
the period 1984-1993.
Revenue
2.        The following interest rates were used to estimate interest revenues
on loans:
10% for existing loan portfolio
9% for new loan portfolio
3.        Earnings on sale of inputs are net of cost of inputs, and were esti-
mated at constant US$0.5 million per year.
Expenses
4.        The following interest rates were used to estimate interest expenses
on borrowings:
5.5% for existing borrowing portfolio
5.5% for new portfolio
5-.       A 2% annual growth in personnel was used to account for promotions
and salary improvements of qualified staff. The number of staff is assumed to
remain at December 1983 levels.
6.        A 2% annual growth in administrative expenses was assumed to account
for additional expenses due to computer applications for loan portfolio
management.
7.        A 5% annual decrease in non-operational expenses was assumed to
account for expected improved controls on this type of expenditures.
8.        Depreciation was estimated at 5% of gross fixed assets.
9.        Provision for bad debts was estimated at 1% of amounts in arrears at
the end of each year.
10.       At least 30% of INDAP's personnel costs can be attributed directly
to technical assistance functions rather than its credit function; hence 30%
of personnel costs are transferred to technology-transfer expenditures.

85%  in 1984 for existing short-term portfolio
9OZ  in 1985 for existing short-term portfolio
95%  1986-93 for existing short-term portfolio
80%  in 1984 for existing long-term portfolio

30%  in 1986 for existing portfolio in arrears
35%  in 1987 for existing portfolio in arrears
402  in 1988 for existing portfolio in arrears
50%  1989-93 for existing portfolio in arrears
95%  1985-93 for new short and long-term portfolio
80%  1985-93 for new portfolio in arrears

date.

1.        Consistent with the open-market economic system adopted in 1973, the
Chilean financial market is dominated by the private banking system. In addi-
tion, there are two official banks, the Central Bank and the State Bank, and a
number of public financial entities.1/ Although lending terms are determined
by competition in the open market, basic policies related to monetary and
credit matters are set by and are under the supervision of the Government's
National Monetary Council.2/ The current credit policy is based on two basic
principles: (a) the volume of credit should be compatible with the policies
for monetary stabilization; and (b) the cost of credit should be positive in
real terms.
2.        Chile's credit market comprises a local currency market and a
foreign currency market. The local currency market is denominated in a con-
stant value unit termed "Unidad de Fomento' (UF) whose Chilean peso equivalent
is adjusted daily in accordance with the Chilean CPI. Disbursements and
repayments of these credits, including interest payments, are made in Chilean
pesos at the UF-Chilean peso rate prevailing on the date of the cash
transaction. The foreign currency market, in which the US dollar currency is
dominant, is regulated by the Law of International Exchange, and by specific
resolutions issued by the Executive Committee of the Central Bank.  Until May
1982, at which time Chile commenced a progressive devaluation phase of the
Chilean peso, disbursements of credits in foreign currency could be made
either in foreign currency or in the Chilean peso equivalent of the UF amount
involved. From that date, commercial banks were authorized to disburse local
currency in lieu of foreign currency up to an aggregate amount not exceeding
50% of their capital and reserves.
3.        The easy access to credits in foreign currency resulted in an over-
use of costly foreign funds, especially in investments of a non-productive or
low yielding nature. The financial system's portfolio in foreign currency
increased from US$2.2 billion equivalent at the end of 1979 to US$6.6 billion
equivalent at the end of 1982. By the end of 1983, this portfolio decreased
to US$4.1 billion equivalent, reflecting lower demand for credit in foreign
currency.

4.        The decline in export values that began in 1981, plus the increase
in imports of goods for consuim.ption that began in 1977, accompanied by gradual
maturities of grace periods, and followed by the devaluation of the Chilean
peso, had a serious impact on debtors in foreign currency. At the same time,
local currency obligations, which in December 1983 were equivalent to about
US$7.6 billion, alsu fi areased in peso terms due to the indexing of outstand-
ing principal. These fa-tors overburdened the payment capacity of the pro-
ductive secters and seriously affected the short-term liquidity of the finan-
cial system. As a result of this situation, various alleviating measures were
imposed by the Government during 1983/84. These included (a) rescheduling of
debt; (b) establishment of a preferential exchange rate for the purchase of US
dollars for pavment of foreign currency debt; and Cc) purchases by the Central
Bank of overdue obligations under repurchase agreements.
5.        A line of credit3/ for the financial entities amounting to UF 127.4
million (equivalent to about US$2,650 million) was made available by the
Central Bank to reschedule the debt of about 130,000 debtors it identified as
eligible for debt rescheduling. These debtors represented about 15% of total
debtors to the financial system, and their aggregate obligations4/ amounted
to about US$6,150 million equivalent, or 47% of the total amount owed to the
financial system. During the period allowed for rescheduling (May-October
1983), about 48,000 debtors (37% of those eligible) rescheduled their
obligations. The amounts rescheduled reached UF 123.3 million (US$2,568
million equivalent), or 97% of the line of credit (equivalent to 38% of the
total debt owed to the financial system). The preferential exchange rate for
US dollars to be used for payment of foreign currency debts was set at about
20% below the official exchange rate and its use was limited to a maximum of
US$20,000 for each debt. Purchases by the Central Bank of overdue debts to
the financial system began in January 1984. Under this program, the financial
entities are allowed to sell their risky portfolio to the Central Bank, up to
an amount of 1.5 times their capital plus reserves. The proceeds of these
sales should only be used to pay amounts in arrears to the Central Bank.
Beneficiary entities are obliged to repurchase rhese obligations to the
Central Bank at 5% per annum over the sale price. This program constitutes an
accounting mechanism that improves the equity position of the financial enti-
ties. In summary, the main schemes described above relieved the liquidity
position of the productive sectors and of the financial entities, and improved
the availability of funds for productive investments.
3/ Repayable in UF or US dollars, in ten years (including five years of grace
period for principal, and one year grace for overdue interest), at 5%
annual interest rate payable by the financial entities to the Central
Bank, but at 7% annual interest rate payable by the debtors to the
financial institutions. Under this scheme, financial institutions
receivec financing for up to 30% of the amounts rescheduled.
4/ Foreign plus local currency estimated to have been yielding average annual
interest rates of 12% on UF obligations, and LIBOR + 2.125%, or prime + 2%
on foreign obligations, and with average maturities of about six years.

Credit to the Agriculture Sector
6.        The agricultural sector is heavily dependent on the private banking
system for investment and working capital credit, although the official State
Bank of Chile also has an important role. The Central Bank discounts funds
derived from international resources to the banking system. Outside the
financial system, institutional credit is provided by three specialized public
entities-CORFO, INDAP and IFICOOP. A substantial amount of non-institutional
credit is also provided by agroindustries and by traders, but actual figures
are unknown. Credit by the financial system to the agriculture sector was
abundant in the "boom' years from 1976 to 1981. Under these buoyant
conditions, evaluation of investment plans and supervision of their
implementation by many commercial banks was unsatisfactory. This led to some
diversion of funds to nonproductive investments and also to over-extension of
the safe borrowing capacity of many farmers. Exceptions to this trend were
evident in lines of credit linked to funds from international development
agencies (USAID, IDB, and the Bank). At the end of 1983, around 15,000
farmers owed about US$1.5 billion equivalent to the financial system,
accounting for about 13% of the system's lending portfolio. One-third of such
debt was incurred in foreign currency. On the one hand, about 1,400 farmers
(9% of the total farmers involved) had debts exceeding US$300,000 equivalent
and were liable for about US$980 million equivalent (65% of the total agricul-
tural debt). On the other hand, about 7,800 farmers (52Z of agricultural
debtors) had debts under US$25,000 equivalent and were liable for about US$67
million equivalent (5% of the total debt). Therefore, it appears that only
1,400 farmers may have serious difficulties to re-establish their
credit-worthiness. This suggests that existing indebtedness in the sector
should not be a serious constraint to loan demand and disbursements when
opportunities for profitable investments exist.
The State Bank of Chile
7.        The State Bank is an autonomous public institution established in
1953 by a merger of five public institutions, each dealing with savings, mort-
gage, commercial credit, agricultural credit, or industrial credit. In 1960,
a Govercmnt decree modified the State Bank's statutes, policies, and proce-
dures, authorizing it to handle (a) banking, development and commercial opera-
tions, (b) savings deposits, (c) mortgage lending, and (d) issuance of bonds.
It also was appointed as fiscal and financial agent of Government-owned enter-
prises.
8.        7he State Bank has a network of close to 200 branches, widely dis-
tributed throughout Chile. Each branch has a manager who has a well-defined
Level of responsibility and authority, and an agricultural section staffed
with experienced technicians who have ready access to advice from groups of
cenior agronomists at regional level. The State Bank also owns and operates a
country-wide networ'x of warehouses which is linked with the state railways
system and is used to store agricultural inputs to be sold on credit to
farmers; the marketing activity is no'o gradually being transferred to the pri-
vate and cooperative sectors.

The Development Corporation (CORFO)
9.        CORFO is an autonomous public development corporation established in
1939 to plan, promote, and coordinate public and private investment. CORFO is
involved in a wide variety of activities, such as agricultural, industrial,
mining production and development, modernization and development of communi-
cation and transportation networks, investigation and exploitation of natural
resources, trade promotion, and technological research and development.
However, since 1973, CORFO has been divesting itself of the ownership of most
small- and medium-size enterprises. CORFO has followed a policy of adminis-
trative decentralization with regional offices which handle agricultural
development and production. Its main sources of funds are the Government
budget, the Central Bank and external credit from private and public
institutions. Since August 1982, CORFO has been executing a US$231 million
credit project, which is supported by IDB and directed at investments in
agriculture, forestry, fisheries, industry, mining and tourism.
Others
10.       A number of specialized financial institutions and commercial banks
are becoming increasingly active in supplying credit to agriculture. The most
relevant in terms of number of loans and portfolio is IFICOOP, established in
1965 as a development bank. It is owned by its member cooperatives and has
the State Bank as a minority shareholder. Its stated objectives are to pro-
vide credit facilities and technical and managerial services to cooperatives,
and to encourage a more rational distribution of resources between urban and
rural areas. Apart from its main office in Santiago, it has one branch office
located in Osorno, which serves as the center for IFICOOP operations in the
south. It is financed mainly by USAID.
11.       There are many private banks providing agricultural lending; among
them, the most important are Banco de Santiago, Banco Nacional, Banco de
Fomento Bio-Bio, Centrobanco and Banco Sudamericano. Fourteen private banks,
including the ones mentioned above, are handling agricultural lending
partially financed by the Bank Loan 1902-CH, through the Central Bank's
discount facility.

CHILE
AGRICULTURAL SERVICES AND CREDIT PROJECT
Illustrative Investment Plans
1.        The credit program would not be restricted to specific regions of
Chile, but the majority of lending would be directed to farmers in the main
agricultural zone which lies between 32' and 42- south latitude.
2.        A significant proportion of larger, commercial farmers and some
small-scale farmers have adopted relatively intensive production methods.
These farmers can be expected to continue to improve their production systems
and expand their use of credit, in accordance with cost-benefit indications.
However, in general, farms in the small-scale subsector (0.8 to 12.0 IHE) are
not intensively cropped and consume few production inputs and little credit.
Only about 20% of the farmers in this group use credit; in over 90% of these
cases the credit is for relatively small amounts of short-term production
credit. This situation occurs even though the majority of farms in the
central and northern agricultural zones have adequate irrigation
infrastructure and water supply to permit more intensive land use; a common
occurrence is to have irrigation canals passing through fields of natural
pasture which are used to graze work oxen. This relatively low input/low
output system has been due to (a) traditional production, based on draft
power, of basic commodities (wheat and beans) for subsistence and some
commercial marketing; (b) lack of effective technical services; and (c) poor
access to production and development credit.l/ In the southern zone, severe
drought conditions in 1983 have led to a decline in the livestock numbers
carried, so that available pasture is, in most cases, underutilized. To
examine the incentives which might exist to encourage small-scale farmers to
enter and/or make significant use of the credit system (with the support of
TAP), five illustrative farm models based on the common, traditional
situation of underutilized farm resources have been prepared.
3.        All m.odels include greatly increased use of production inputs with
the support of the comprehensive TAP services. Annual short-term loan
requirements are based on projected cash flows within the agricultural year,
and on access to funds carried over from the previous year; hence, there are
relatively low production loan requirements for milk production which has a
well distributed cash income. The annual family labor requirement in the
1/ Until late 1979, the Government, in trying to interest the private
banking system in financing small-scale farmers, did not permit INDAP to
lend to the 40,000 beneficiaries of the agrarian reform.



- 67 -                          Annex 5
Page 2 of 14
various models ranges from 130 to 217 man-days in the pre-development
situation, leaving ample family labor available for off-farm employment and
more labor-intensive on-farm activities. The relatively low farm cash income
level in the pre-development situation implies that most small-scale farm
families would seek and obtain some off-farm employment. It also assumes
that US$250 to US$350 is available from these sources in the agricultural
investment models to complement production loans at the beginning of the
development period. Although the cost of family labor is not included as a
cost in calculating family farm benefits, it is included at the full rural
wage rate in the estimation of rates of return.
Products and Financial Prices
4.        The long-term investments include development of table grape
vineyards and apple orchards, as examples of export fruit crops, and milk and
meat production enterprises. Annual crops are wheat, maize, sugarbeets,
beans and potatoes, the first three of which are currently imported
commodities, as are milk products. The prices of production investments and
inputs are expressed in constant 1984 US dollar equivalents. In the case of
imported fertilizers, the local unit costs in each project year are based on
the Bank's commodity price projections adjusted for transport, tariffs,
taxes, local handling costs and trading margins. Product prices at the farm
level (Table 1) include value-added tax and are derived as follows:
(a) The import substitution cereals--wheat and maize-are valued at
85% of a figure calculated from the Bdnk's projected commodity
prices plus transport, tariffs and all local handling and
financing charges.
(b) Sugarbeet values are in accordance with the IANSA policy of
taking into account international price trends and local pro-
ducLion costs to determine the price offered to growers.
(c) Bean and potato values are based on local averages (in constant
terms) since 1977.
(d) Milk price is that which is being offered in 1984 by milk
plants in the southern milk zones (US$0.14/1 without value-
added tax), where most milk is processed into milk powder,
butter and cheese. This price is related to, but lower than,
the financial cost of importing these products under the
recently introduced variable import levy system.
(e) Beef prices are indexed to the Bank's commodity price
projections with 1983 local values as a base. This is justi-
fied as the Chilean 1983 prices were similar to Australian
liveweight prices for specific classes of animals in that year,
and, if Chile is able to enter the export market, Australia,
being also free of FND, would be a major competitor; the
Australian beef prices are largely determined by export
markets.

(f) The values of exported grapes and apples are taken as the
f.o.b. averages for 1979 to 1983, after deducting all
preparation and marketing costs. Sale prices for the local
fresh fruit market are based on wholesale averages since 1977,
with producer prices being 40% of the wholesale value. Fruit
for processing is valued at one third of the local fresh fruit
market value.
Economic Prices
5.        Economic prices (Table 2) are based on import parity for fertiliz-
ers (as inputs) and for wheat, corn and sugar (as outputs) in accordance with
Bank projections of international prices.  Milk pr..ce is similarly determined
based on an import cost of whole milk powder at US$1,480/m ton, c.i.f. The
cost of the Government's technical assistance subsidy per farm is added as an
economic cost of production on each farm. After removing value-added taxes,
all Chilean peso costs and returns are adjusted by a standard conversion
factor of 0.93 to allow for distortions caused by import tariffs.
Yields
6.        Yields and production coefficients (Table 3) are in accordance with
average results being obtained in the Chilean agricultural areas with use of
the production investment and input package included in the models.
Implications of Model Analysis
7.        The favorable cash flows and financial rates of return on the
models indicate that the product-technology mixes are appropriate for the
production and economic conditions which exist in Chile. This is supported
by individual crop gross margin analysis (in project file) and by the iavest-
ments and technical improvements currently being adopted by farmers in
response to price and market condition's. The farm models using the high
value crops--grapes and apples--result in very high incremental family
benefits, but do entail a large initial investment, as well as high annual
costs. Investment in table grapes is significantly more attractive than
apples and also has better market prospects than apples. The annual crop
model, which does not entail any long-term investment, uses substantial
annual expenditure on production inputs to give a high rate of return and a
satisfactory income l-ithout incurring the risks inherent in high investment
in perennial crops. The milk farm gives a high return without excsssive
outlay; this is largely due to the investment in animals which are
immediately productive and which can make use of an underutilized grazing
resource for part of their input requirements, and higher milk prices. The
beef enterprise is not as attractive as the dairy enterprise, as could be
expected without the benefit of milk sales.
8.        It can be anticipated that most demand by INDAP clients would be
for short-term credit to increase productivity of annual crops; this trend



-69 -                           Annex 5
Page 4 of 14
should be even more pronounced with farms at the lover end of the small-scale
farm size category wherc a willingness to undertake heavy investment is
traditionally more limited. The grape and dairy enterprises should be
attractive to both large and sm- -. investors because of their favorable
returns and, in the case of INDAP clients, because of their capacity to make
better use of available family labor. Apples would not be as favored as
grapes, and it is possible that better prospects of sustained favorable
export prices for nectarines and peaches will result in expansion of these
pome fruit crops rather than apples. Although the orchard and vineyard
models assume a 4-ha unit Ls established, a proportion of small-scale farmers
may prefer to invest in a smaller area. The beef investment, being less
intensive, is not as suitable for smaller holdings, especially in cases where
it is not feasible to market cheese as a byproduct of the beef enterprise.
Beef, however, is well suited to larger holdings, especially in less
accessible areas where land tax is lower and alternatives are limited.
Individual Models 2/
9.        Table Grape and Annual Crop Model (Table 4). This plan represents
a 17 ha irrigated farm (5.95 IRE) typical of the central and central northern
agricultural areas. Before development, the farm has 6 ha of wheat and 2 ha
of beans, and the remaining 9 ha in natural pasture. Within the program,
4 ha of table grapes are introduced and 3 ha of wheat (undersown with red
elover), 2 ha of corn and 2 ha of beans are grown annually in association
with clover ley. Of the grapes produced, 65Z are destined for export, 25%
for local consumption and 10% for processing. The cropping intensity
(excluding the clover ley) is increased from 47Z to 65%. Although the typi-
cal farm would not require additional irrigation infrastructure (apart from
the fine levelling and furrow construction in land preparation included in
the model), the effect of incurring an extra irrigation expenditure of
US$2,000 on each of the 4 ha included under grapes is also examined in the
financial return calculations below. The returns on the grape investments
alone are also analyzed.

calculations, however, a continuous with- and without-project analysis
has been used, as some input and output prices change in constant terms
over time.

are used to produce milk for sale to a milk plant. The farm has ten cows in
milk, has some partly improved grazing paddocks (14 ha) and 0.5 ha of summer
grown potatoes, but is understocked by about 18%. The development program
introduces six in-calf Friesian heifers and develops 5.0 ha of improved
tem'erate pasture (ryegrass, cockfoot, white clover) by undersowing crops of
oats (1 ha annually at full development). The 0.5 ha of potatoes are
retained, but with much heavier fertilization.

80 days (2.5 1/day) to enable sale of cottage and white cheese from the
farm. The farm is mainly natural pasture, but has 6 ha of improved temperate
pasture, another 4 ha of partially improved pasture and is understocked by
about 20% (15 adults and 8 calves); 2 ha of wheat and 0.5 ha of potatoes are
grown. The program introduces six in-calf heifers, and 11 ha of native
pastures are transformed into improved pasture by undersowing wheat crops
with temperate grass-clover species. The wheat and potato cultivations are
maintained. In the financial return calculations indicated below, the effect
of not having cheese sales is also examined.
