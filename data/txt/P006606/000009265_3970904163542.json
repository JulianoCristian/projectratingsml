It will also; (b)\n            help small-scale farmers to increase their earnings, improve\n            their living conditions and develop their farms into\n            commercially viable production units.  In addition,\n            INDAP's financial and operational position would be\n            strengthened. The project will provide investment credit for\n            on-farm development and agroindustry, and short-term credit\n            to small farmers.  The project will include a comprehensive\n            technical assistance program associated with credit to\n            small-scale farmers, and assistance to INDAP for the\n            completion of an electronic data processing system for\n            portfolio management.  INDAP will also be strengthened by\n            carrying out a plan for the recovery of portfolio arrears."}, "docdt": "1984-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
