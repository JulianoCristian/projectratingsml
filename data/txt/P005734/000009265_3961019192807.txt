IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING PROJECT
(Loan No. 3255-TUN)
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Employment and Training
Project in Tunisia, for which Loan 3255-TUN in the amount of US$12.0 million equivalent was
approved on September 4, 1990 and became effective on March 21, 1991.
The loan was closed on June 30, 1995, after one extension from its original closing date of
June 30, 1994. It was almost fully disbursed (97.6%, with US$288,179.42 canceled), and the last
disbursement took place on December 6, 1995. Co-financing was provided by USAID during the
initial phase of the project.
The ICR was prepared by Mr. Francis Steier, MN1HR of the MENA Region, and
reviewed by Ms. Roslyn G. Hees, MN1HR Division Chief and Mr. Fritz Rodriguez, Acting MN1
Project Adviser. The borrower provided a completion report that is included as an appendix to the
ICR.
Preparation of this ICR was begun prior to the Bank's final completion mission in
November, 1995. It is based on material in the project file, visits in the field, and interviews with
Tunisian officials and Bank staff. The Borrower contributed to the preparation of the ICR by
organizing meetings and visits in the field, preparing its own evaluation of the project's execution and
initial preparation, and commenting on a draft of the ICR left by the completion mission.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING PROJECT
(Loan No. 3255-TUN)
Evaluation Summary
Introduction
The project was one of the very first in the Bank that used a fund approach for insertion and
training; its main operational features - training fund, decentralized operations and "bottom-up"
demand - were highly innovative at the time of Board approval.
Project Objectives
As formally stated in the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR), the objectives of the project were to:
(i) accelerate the adaptation of the labor force through more effective training and labor market
intermediation; and (ii) improve existing human capital by developing in-company training activities.
In order to achieve its objectives, the project included two components. The first component
created a regionally based Employment and Training Fund (ETF) to finance sub-projects aimed at
facilitating the placement of the unemployed into existing job opportunities, as well as improving
productivity of existing workers through systematic in-company training efforts. The second
component set up an institutional development program aimed at strengthening key services to
enterprises (selection, placement and in-company training), developing job and training information and
orientation of young people and adults, setting up a labor market insertion monitoring system and
strengthening project management.
Summary of Findings, Future Operations and Key Lessons Learned
It is clear that the project achieved its first objective; achievement of the second objective
cannot be as easily assessed, but indications are positive. The project did accelerate the adaptation of
the labor force through more effective training and labor market intermediation: the total number of
individual beneficiaries of all insertion/training actions was 34,161 (compaKed to 30,000 envisaged in
the SAR), of whom 24,893 were inserted, resulting in an average insertion rate of close to 73%. The
ETF project also improved existing human capital by developing in-company training activities, but the
degree to which companies now internalize the new training philosophy remains to be seen.
The two project components were fully implemented. The project was off to a slow start,
however, and even though project implementation got up to full speed as of May 1993, the closing
date had to be extended by one year, to June 30, 1995. Several factors caused the early delays, and
they had been - in general terms - suggested as possible risks in the SAR: the decentralized nature of
the project, and possible changes in project management structures.



ii
In April 1995, the project received an European Union (EU) financing of 3.85 million ECUs,
using the same 'Manual of Procedures" Due to the success of the project, the Tunisian Government is
now preparing a legal framework for continuation of project activities under nornal budgetary
financing. The Tunisian budget will now finance most of the continuing ETF activities.
A number of lessons can be learned in the design and implementation of future similar
operations. They can be drawn from key factors that were critical to the success of the project, as well
as from those that could use further improvement.
There are five major lessons to be learned from the factors of success:
(a)    The project benefited from its simple design, as well as the economic vision that
underpinned its design and implementation (as opposed to one geared towards meeting
social needs).
(b)    The grass-roots "bottom-up" approach ensured flexible implementation, as well as local
project ownership.
(c)    With its flexible project design, the ETF allowed modifications during implementation
to reflect institutional changes, as weUl as ongoing evaluations of project impact.
(d)    The project became an integral part of the Tunisian Employment Agency's operations;
this considerably increased its effectiveness. The project management system was
efficient, with respect to both ongoing and post completion monitoring of beneficiaries.
(e)    The fund approach resulted in local staff learning how to prepare and evaluate project
proposals; it encouraged innovation, as well as competition between public and private
VT providers and between regions.
Lessons can also be gleaned from project weaknesses. A future project should:
(a)   Include project implementation and impact indicators. No such indicators were given
in the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR). The mid-term review did suggest some impact
indicators, but these were not systematically monitored thereafter. A more detailed
impact monitoring system would be desirable; it would among others help determine
priorities among instruments, and thereby increase overall effectiveness.
(b)    Anticipate the practical implications of institutional issues. These were suggested in
general terms under the "Risks" section of the SAR, but specific issues were not
foreseen. They included structure and personnel changes in the project management
institutions, lack of project accounting framework, insufficient numbers of qualified
implementing staff, insufficient reimbursement for travel expenses of local
implementing staff, and impact of Tunisian procurement regulations and Central Bank
requirements for reimbursements of project expenditures.



iii
(c)    Improve project accounting system. Although the overall costs of the project are now
up to date, the budget is too global, and it cannot at present be used for analytical or
planning purposes. For example, there is no way to know total amounts spent for
specific beneficiaries, on specific instruments, by region or sector.






IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINNG PROJECT
(Loan No. 3255-TUN)
PART I
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A.    Project Objectives
1.    As formally stated in the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR), the objectives of the project were to:
(i) accelerate the adaptation of the labor force through more effective training and labor market
intermediation; and (ii) improve existing human capital by developing in-company training activities.
The project was one of the very first in the Bank that used a fund approach for insertion and training;
its main operational features - training fund, decentralized operations and "bottom up" demand - were
highly innovative at the time of Board approval.
2.    In light of Tunisia's continuing economic liberalization and implementation of an outward-
oriented development strategy, issues of employment and labor productivity were deemed to require
considerable attention. By focusing on the structure of labor intermediation, the project complemented
past Bank interventions in the areas of macro-economic policies, population, education and training.
The project was to assist the Government in its efforts to improve labor market operations by testing
regional-based mechanisms aimed at improving labor market insertion opportunities and improving
human capital in existing enterprises.  The shift of responsibilities toward local governments in
identifying employment opportunities and the move toward private labor market intermediation were
new directions for the Government's, as well as international donors', employment promotion efforts.
3.    In order to achieve the proposed objectives, the project included two components, to be
implemented by the Ministry of Vocational Training and Employment (Ministere de la Fonnation
Professionnelle et de l'Emploi, MFPE), through the intermediary of its Office of Vocatienal Training
and Employment (Office de la Formationi Professionnelle et de I'Emploi, OFPE). The first
component (US$19.6 million, 90% of total base costs) was to create a regionally based Employment
apd Training Fund (ETF) to finance sub-projects aimed at facilitating the placement of the unemployed
into existing job opportunities, as well as improving productivity of existing workers through
systematic in-company training efforts. Five types of sub-projects, referred to as "instruments", were
envisaged at first for financing:



-2 -
A.    Training for placement in an enterprise.
B.    Training for installation in self-employment.
C.    In-company training/extension services.
D.    Sub-contracting to training/placement companies.
E.    Allowances for job interview and relocation close to work site.
A sixth instrument (F - In-company training for enterprises undergoing economic restructuring) was
added after May 1, 1991.
4.     The second component (US$2.2 million, 10%  of total base costs) set up an institutional
development program aimed at strengthening key services to enterprises (selection, placement and in-
company training), developing information and orientation of young people and adults, setting up a
labor market insertion monitoring system and strengthening project management.
B.    Achievement of Project Objectives
5.     The project objectives were well defined, and consistent with the overall Bank strategy in
Tunisia's social sectors. They were an integral part of the Government's objectives, and were
supported by USAID in the form of a pilot phase of the project. The project was quite innovative in
Tunisia, and was initially met with opposition from major players in the field: public vocational training
providers, who feared the appearance of new (private) providers; and some OFPE staff, who feared the
decentralization aspect implicit in the project, and the possible resulting loss of control over some of
the agency's operations. During appraisal, in fact, concerns about the implications of the project were
expressed in some quarters, but in the end all officials involved backed the project fully.
6.     Another feature of the project was its built-in flexibility, on two fronts. First, the project
foresaw the possibility of including new instruments in the ETF mechanism. Second, the project was
managed by a highly decentralized agency.
7.    It is clear that the project achieved its first objective; achievement of the second objective
cannot be as easily assessed, but indications are positive. The project did accelerate labor force
insertion through more effective training and labor market intermediation: the total number of
individual beneficiaries' of all instruments except E was 34,161 (with 2,542 sub-projects), of whom
24,893 were inserted, resulting in an average insertion rate of 73% (Table IA). In addition, 13,859
workers benefited from instrument E (allowances for job interview and relocation close to work site).
The average (direct) cost of training/adaptation per beneficiary during the period was 543 TD, while
the average insertion cost (per inserted worker) was 735 TD; these costs are comparable to or below
the corresponding costs for other Tunisian insertion programs.
8.     The ETF project did improve existing human capital by developing in-company training
activities for new recruits, but the degree to which companies that benefited from the project now train
These numbers are as of June 30, 1995. They do not include the 3,356 beneficiaries of some 190 actions which have been undertaken
before that date, but not yet completed.



-3-
their existing work force remains to be seen (see section G). Human capital improvement can be
deducted from the high insertion rates and the fact that a majority of ETF beneficiaries were unskilled
long-term unemployed.
9.    Table IA summarizes results of the program by economic sector; insertion rates range
from 54-55% (construction and hotel trades) to a high of 82% in the leather industry. Table IB
describes the distribution of ETF interventions, by instrument. Instrument A holds the lion's share
of total number of interventions (with 79%), while instruments B and D covered 10% each. The
share of instruments C and F was statistically insignificant, due in part to the grass-roots, demand-
driven, nature of the project and the high success rates of instrument A.
C.    Implementation Record
10.   The project benefited from a pilot phase, covering 7 Govemorates (out of 23), and using only
the first of the six instruments (training-insertion) from early 1990 until April 30, 1991. This phase was
financed by USAID. On the basis of the successful implementation of this limited phase, the program
was extended to the whole country and with the five remaining instruments on May 1, 1991.
11.   The two project components were fully implemented. The project was off to a slow start,
however, and even though project implementation got up to full speed as of May 1993, the closing
date had to be extended by one year, to June 30, 1995. Several factors caused the early delays, and
they had been - in general terms - foreseen as possible risks in the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR): the
decentralized nature of the project, and possible changes in project management structures. In order to
correct the political dimension of decentralization - i.e. the tendency of some Governorates to use the
ETF for social purposes like traditional employment programs - MFPE decided to apply more
rigorously the selection criteria in the Fall of 1992. Other causes for delay were technical in nature, and
their impact on implementation had not been fully anticipated:
(a)    Change in the structures of the managing institutions. and change in personnel.
At the time of negotiations, the OFPE, which was to be the project managing authority,
was shifted from the Ministry of Social Affairs (Ministere des Affaires Sociales, MAS)
to the newly created Ministry of Vocational Training (Ministere de la Formation
Professionnelle et de l'Emploi, MFPE). In early 1991, implementation was delayed
due to the change in Minister, and the resulting change in statutes of the OFPE. In
March 1993, in order to complete the overhaul of the vocational training (VT) and
employment system, the vocational training and employment functions of OFPE were
delegated to two new agencies, the Agence Tunisienne de la Formation
Professionnelle (ATFEP) and the Agence Tunisienne de l'Emploi (ATE), respectively.
The latter became responsible for the ETF project.
(b)   Problems with accounting and auditing. This was caused, at first, by a lack of
sub-project accounts, caused by the small amounts involved linked to the highly
decentralized nature of the project. The problem was compounded by a lack of
specialized personnel and later by insufficient monitoring tools (hardware and



-4 -
software). The first audits (for CY91 and CY92) were received by the Bank in
September 1994.
(c)   Insufficient local and central personnel. This issue was addressed in September
1992, by hiring the necessary personnel at both levels ("economats").
(d)   Insufficient reimbursement for travel expenses incurred by OFPE personnel. By
the very nature of ETF, OFPE personnel were required to travel extensively
throughout the governorates, yet Tunisian regulations did not provide sufficient travel
allowances (per diems), thereby hampering OFPE's work.
(e)    Slow purchases of necessary equipment. Vehicle acquisition was considerably
delayed due to Tunisian import regulations and quotas (cars were finally acquired in
July 1992); similarly the acquisition of computer hardware and software was also
delayed, among others, for procurement reasons, thereby hampering project
monitoring and management. Until May 1992, the central monitoring unit had only
one personal computer. Ultimately the funds envisaged under the second component
were fully utilized as agreed with the Bank.
(f)    Tunisian Central Bank procedures. Since the ETF consisted in a multitude of
decentralized projects, a minimum of two months was necessary for the preparation of
invoices to the Central Bank for payment. This forced OFPE to prefinance ETF
activities from its normal operating budget, thereby resulting in a freeze of ETF
activities at the end of the 1991, which was not conducive to a positive project image.
The problem was solved in November 1992 when the Bank gave its non-objection to
pre-financing, which enabled the Central Bank to issue the necessary advances to
OFPE.
12.   In January 1994, prompted by the experience of the ETF and its institutional development
program, the ATE instituted a new three-year program (called "SERVIR"), a full-fledged, and
demand-driven, service approach towards its "clients" (firms and job seekers). This in tum resulted in
new structures and new approaches for all ATE activities, including the ETF project. The latter
included intemal measures (e.g. reinforcing technical and budgetary follow-up of ATE interventions)
and extemal ones (e.g. assistance to enterprises in identifying, designing, monitoring and evaluating the
impact of ETF interventions).
D.    Project Sustainability
13.   In April 1995, the project received a European Union (EU) financing of 3.85 million ECUs,
using the same "Manual of Procedures". Although the closing date of the EU project is December 31,
1998, it is foreseen that EU funding will be exhausted in about one year. It is also foreseen that part of
the activities of the ETF will be continued through the joint World Bank - Govenmment financing
provided under the Employment and Training II Project (with a possible further contribution from the
European Union).



- 5 -
14.   The ETF project was a pilot project, and MFPE and ATE consider that its demonstration
effect has been successful. The Tunisian budget will now finance most of the ETF activities.
E.    Bank Performance
15.   Bank performance was satisfactory throughout preparation and supervision. The latter was
carried out under three Task Managers, but continuity was ensured, among others, by the use of the
sarne consultant.  Extensive consultations were undertaken in Tunisia during preparation, and
supervision was adequate, both in terms of resource use and responsiveness to issues that arose during
implementation. The Bank responded expeditiously to the Borrower's requests, and all project related
studies, including the mid-term review report, received extensive comments from Bank staff
F.    Borrower Performance
16.   The Borrower's overall performance was excellent with regard to analyzing issues and
designing solutions. With respect to the implementation of these solutions, however, the early
problems of institutional change and rigidities of the management agency's structure, as well as
insufficient staff during the pre-1993 phase of the project, were an obstacle.
17.   The mid-term review was carried out, as specified in the Legal Agreement, by an independent
local consulting firm. The terms of reference were drafted by the Borrower and received extensive
comments from the Task Manager. The Borrower worked closely with the consultants. The review
was thorough in its descriptive aspects, but was found by the Bank to be lacking in its analytical
impact. Among the questions that remained unanswered after the review were:
(a)    What was the value added of the ETF in termns of skills?
(b)    Could other instruments have produced the same results (e.g. a reform of the
Vocational Training tax giving enterprises the means to finance their own internal
training)?; and
(c)    What was the impact of the ETF on the private training sector?
18.   The MFPE will assess these questions fully in its forthcoming evaluation of the project.
19.   Initial audit reports were prepared with considerable delays, as those for CY91 and CY92 were
received by the Bank in September 1994. As pointed out earlier, key reasons included the lack of
project accounts, as well as insufficiently trained staff and monitoring tools. Full audit reporting
complimnce was achieved for CY93 and beyond.



-6 -
G.    Assessment of Outcome
20.   In addition to responding to the question of whether project objectives were met (section B),
an assessment of project outcomes would need to answer four broad sets of questions. The first would
review the impact of the project on potential groups of beneficiaries - e.g. economic sectors, regions,
age, educational and gender groups. The second would assess possible modifications in the supply of
Tunisian VT, i.e. whether as a result of the project: (i) private vocational training supply was increased,
(ii) the behavior of public suppliers was "privatized", and (iii) enterprise behavior was modified to the
point of increasing in-company training. The third issue of interest is whether the project achieved its
institutional development objectives. Finally, was the ETF the most economical way of achieving these
objectives, i.e. how does the real cost per person trained compare to those trained under other
programs?
21.   The sectoral distribution of ETF interventions was discussed in section B. A regional analysis
of ETF interventions suggests that the project was more used in govemorates with high unemployment
rates, and that insertion rates in those govemorates were also higher. The project was also successful
at targeting younger persons, as close to 52% of all beneficiaries were less than 25 years of age, while
another 28% were less than 30. More than half (54%) had primary education only, while 19% had
achieved a first cycle secondary education, and 7% were illiterate. Women have benefited considerably
from the project, (63% of all beneficiaries) but a more complete evaluation is currently being
undertaken, through a Bank IDF grant, by the Ministry of Women's Affairs and the Family. The
evaluation is studying the impact of two kinds of instruments: on-the-job training and placement, and
preparation for self-employment.
22.   On the second question, it is worth noting that the bulk of the training provided under all
instruments (except E) was supplied by private VT enterprises. It is not yet possible, however, to
evaluate the long-term change in behavior on the part of public VT providers. The project does not
seem to have had a major impact on enterprise behavior with respect to on-the-job training for their
existing employees, as instruments C and F were little used.
23.   In response to the third question, the answer is unambiguously positive, as the project did
contribute to a considerable change in employment services institutions and behaviors. The synergy
developed between the project and ATE and the advent of the SERVIR system as a result of project
experience are commendable.
24.   The last question would require further analysis, and an improvement of the ATE cost
accounting system in order to be able to determine total costs involved with ETF operations. Recent
studies have suggested that among the programs managed by the ATE, ETF average direct costs by
inserted worker were the lowest.
H.    Future Operation
25.   The next ETF operation, currently being prepared, needs to draw from the lessons of
experience (see section I). It will expand the use of instruments C and F.



-7 -
I.    Key Lessons Learned
26.   Although the overall project performance was satisfactory, a number of lessons can be learned
by bo.;l the Bank and the MIFPE and ATE in the design and implementation of future similar
operations. They can be drawn from key factors that were critical to the success of the project, as well
as those that could use improvement.
27.   There are five major lessons to be learned from the factors of success:
(a)    Ihe project benefited from its simple design, as well as the economic, i.e.
global, vision that underpinned its design and implementation (as opposed to one
geared towards meeting social needs).
(b)    The grass-roots, "bottom-up", approach ensured flexible implementation, as
well as local project ownership.
(c)    With its flexible project design, the ETF allowed modifications during
implementation to reflect institutional changes, as well as ongoing evaluations of
project impact.
(d)    The project became an integral part of ATE operations; this considerably
increased its effectiveness. The project management system was efficient, with respect
to both ongoing and post completion monitoring of beneficiaries.
(e)    The fund approach resulted in local staff learning how to prepare and evaluate
project proposals; it encouraged innovation, as well as competition between public and
private VT providers and between regions.
28.   Lessons can also be gleaned from project weaknesses. A future project should:
(a)   Include project implementation and impact indicators. No such indicators were
given in the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR). The mid-term review did suggest some
impact indicators, but these were not systematically monitored thereafter. A more
detailed impact monitoring system would be desirable; it would among others help
determine priorities among instruments, and thereby increase overall effectiveness.
(b)    Anticipate the practical implications of institutional issues. These issues were
suggested in general terms under the "Risks" section of the SAR, but specific issues
were not foreseen. These included structure and personnel changes in the project
management institutions, lack of project accounting framework insufficient numbers of
qualified implementing staff, insufficient reimbursement for travel expenses of local
implementing staff, and impact of Tunisian procurement regulations and Central Bank
requirements for reimbursements of project expenditures.



- 8 -
(c)    Improve project accounting system. Although the overall costs of the project
are now up to date, the budget is too global, and it cannot at present be used for
analytical or planning purposes. For example, there is no way to know total amounts
spent for specific beneficiaries, on specific instruments, by region or sector.

leavers and for skill upgrading of the workforce. The project            December 1988..
specifically supported plans for expanding and upgrading the
apprentice training scheme, broaden ing the range of adult
training opportunities through the establishment of new centers
and the addition of new sections to existing centers, and
improving the quality of vocational training through the re-
equipping of poorly equipped workshops.

Government's education and training sector reform and assists            disbursed. Closing date:
the Borrower in carrying out reform activities during this phase.        March 31. 1996.
The objectives ofthe reform program are to make the provision
of education more consistent with the country's medium-term
development needs, more equitable and more cost-effective. It
would do this through three policy changes: (a) allocation of a
larger share of resources to quality basic education cycle (grades
1-9); (b) improvement in the quality and the relevance of
secondary education (grades 10-13) while better controlling
access to it; (c) promotion of pre-service and in-service training
in collaboration with companies in the productive sectors, and
mobilization of additional resources for training.
Higher Education Restructuring  The project aims to assist the Borrower in making its higher  March 1992  Under supervision; 11%

graduates; (b) providing incentives to higher education
institutions to reform their programs and curricula; and (c)
strengthening the higher education system's planning and
masiagement capacity and imnproving the distribution and use of
resources following a norrnative system for rescurce allocation.

capacity to monitor the operation of labor markets and training
incentives so as to provide labor market information to individu-
als, enterprises and managers from training centers. (b)
Development of labor market services for displaced workers.
Based on the experience of the Employment and Training Fund
(ETF), the project would support a fund for the development of
re-training and placement services for workers affected by
economic restructuring, and (c) Reinforcement of the economici
relevance of training, which would consist of. (i) financing of the
reconversion and upgrading of existing training centers under the
MFPE and creation of new training centers, on the basis of an as-
sessment of the demand for the skills to be provided by the center
and by an agreement between the MFPE and a federation of
enterprises for the provision of "dual" training. (ii) Technical
assistance would be provided for improving management ofthe
VT tax and for the reinforcement ofthe CNFCPP. (iii) Technical
assistance for the development of apprenticeships including firm-
level training oftrainers, curricula and pedagogical

REPUBUC OF TUNISIA
MISTRY OF VOCATIONAL TRAINING AND EMPLOYMENT
IMPLEMIENTATION COMNPLETION REPORT
NOTE ON THE IMPACT OF THE EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING FUND
1.    Background to the Creation of the Employment and Training Fund (ETF)
1.    As a result of the economic adjustment process in Tunisia, unemployment has become a
matter of major concern to the authorities. The challenge consists in promoting employment,
mainly by improving national vocational training facilities, encouraging private sector investment,
and fostering the micro- and small-enterprise sector.
Concem with promoting employment mounted under the pressure of a rising unemployment
rate, which the 1989 Population and Employment Census put at 15.3%, and under the prospect of
additional demand for jobs.
2.    In order to keep unemployment within tolerable limits, the Govemment has introduced
numerous employment promotion programs over the years as a way to help meet the demand for
jobs.
T'here have been three types of programs:
Public works programs:  Introduced in the 1960s, these programs provide a
subsistence wage in exchange for temporary  work in reforestation, soil
conservation, maintenance of public infrastructure, and other public works. Their
main limitation is that they have not succeeded in creating opportunities for long-
term employment.
*     Assistance to promote self-employment and micro-enterprises: This dates from the
creation in 1981 of the National Fund for Handicrafts and Small-Trade Promotion
and regional rural and urban development programs.
*     Programs to foster employment of first-time job-seekers: These have taken the
form of the Employment/Training Contracts (CEF) introduced in 1981, and two
types of Professional Intemships (SIVP), the first (dating from 1987) for higher-
education graduates and the second (dating from 1988) for secondary school
graduates entering the workforce.
These programs were strengthened in 1993, giving rise to better intemal rates of return and
a higher degree of impact on the population groups targeted. They share the common characteristic



-22 -
of supporting specific categories of job-seekers or potential employers, and therefore serve as
mechanisms for dealing with unemployment from the job-seeker side of the market.
3.    The attention paid by the authorities to unemployment problems associated with structural
adjustment lending has resulted in the introduction of an employment strategy that calls among
others for far-reaching structural reforms. These began in 1990 with the creation of the Ministry of
Vocational Training and Employment, followed by a reorganization of the former Office of
Vocational Training and Employment. By 1993, this restructuring had led to establishment of the
following specialized entities: the Tunisian Employment Agency, the Tunisian Vocational Training
Agency, the National Center for In-Service Training and Vocational Advancement, and the
National Center for Trainer Training and Training Theory and Practice.
The country's firm commitment to a policy of economic liberalization has made bolstering
its vocational training and retraining capabilities a prime necessity if Tunisian busines, enterprises
are to command all possible means of improving the competitiveness and quality of their products.
4.    The unportance of the human factor in the reform program undertaken by the Government
in order to liberalize the economy and capture highly developed and competitive markets has
created a need for ways of responding to the demands of an economic system undergoing massive
changes. The creation of the Employment and Training Fund in 1990 was a major step toward this
goal.
EkF provides a wide range of services: training for placement in companies, training for
self-employment,  in-company  training/extension  services,  subcontracting  to  private
training/placement companies, and allowances for relocation/refresher training/retraining for the
staff of companies in difficulty. ETF is therefore in a position to respond to the complex
manpower needs of the economy in an innovative manner -more so than previous programs.
ElF objectives are to finance training programs that will lead to the placement of job-
seekers; improve productivity by raising the competence level of existing skills; and implement an
institutional development program designed to increase the effectiveness of governmental agencies
responsible for labor market promotion.
II.   Establishment of the Employment and Training Fund
5.    From the beginning of 1990 until April 30, 1991, EJTF was regarded as being in a pilot
phase. This period was devoted exclusively to program "A" (i.e. training for placement in an
enterprise) and involved seven regions of the country, where 96 subprograms involving 1,794 job-
seekers were carried out. With financing from USAID, an evaluation survey of this phase was
conducted by the Maghreb Development Financing Institute (ED) in September 1991; it
confilmed the success of this approach, and called for expansion of the program.
6.    As of May 1991, E1F activities were extended throughout the country: training for job
placemelit, subcontracting to private training/placement companies, training for self-employment,



-23 -
in-company training/extension services, allowances for relocation of job-seekers, and refresher
training/retraining for the staff of companies in difficulty.
World Bank financial support was made available for ETF under the terms of a Loan
Agreement with Tunisia, ratified by Law No. 91/4 of February 12, 1991.
The funds allocated for the program covered the period from May 1991 up to December
31, 1993 as far as commitment authority was concemed, and up to June 30, 1994 for payment
authority. The goal set for this period was to train 30,000 job-seekers and integrate them into the
active population.
7.    The initial allocation pattem of ETF funding was as follows (in thousands of dinars):
Source of Financing   Training for         Structural           Total
Placement in an    Reinforcement
Enterprise
National budget           9,000               170               9,170
World Bank loan           9,000              2,000              11,000
TOTAL                    18,000              2,170              20,170
ETF activities were conducted on a decentralized basis, in each of the country's 23
governorates. The ETF Manual of Procedures, required under the terms of Article m, Section
3.02 (b), of Loan Agreement 3255-TUN, was finalized in March 1991 with World Bank
approval.
Implementation of ETF as financed by the World Bank proceeded in two stages:
8.    The results of the initial phase, extending from May 1, 1991 to April 30, 1992, were
evaluated through two surveys of companies and trainees conducted by a private consulting
firm  in May 1993.  The survey sample was representative of that period's program
beneficiaries. The following findings were obtained:
*     ETF provided flexible and appropriate solutions to requests made by companies
with respect to training for job placement and also helped previously
unsuccessful job-seekers.
*     A job placement rate of 72.4% was achieved, with the following breakdown:
placements with companies where in-service training took place, 59.0%;
placements with other companies, 6.4%; and self-employment, 7.0%.
*     The majority (61.5%) of ETF beneficiaries were young people under age 25;
only 5 % were 40 or over.



- 24 -
*     A total of 65.8 % of beneficiaries had not had schooling beyond grade six of the
primary cycle, a figure which confirms that ETF is the sole source of support
for this category of job-seekers.
*     In cost-benefit terms, ETF is the least costly program. This mid-term review
shows costs as follows per beneficiary: training, D 687; placement, D 1,163.
9.    A second phase began after an Executive Session of the Cabinet held on June 7, 1993,
which reviewed ETF accomplishments and decided to continue the initiative, bolstering its
capacity in order to actively target the needs of the economy.
In order to enable ETF to operate efficiently and coherently, a series of practical steps
were taken to improve its internal management and its impact. Technical and budgetary
monitoring was strengthened, and assistance was provided to regional operators to ensure the
economic effectiveness of ETF actions.
Measures taken focused essentially on:
*     encouraging regional technical committees to take action to support ETF in
performing its mandate of addressing the human resources needs of the
economy;
*     introducing a requirement for budgetary clearance prior to approval of actions
by regional coordinating committees;
*     establishing a monitoring system to follow up on developments in all areas;
*     establishing an accounting system specific to ETF to facilitate project audit
operations;
*     creating a central commission in charge of promoting the project and providing
assistance to the regions;
*     strengthening the Central Coordinating and Management Unit of ETF.
m1.  ETF Accomplishments
10.   The accomplishments of the ETF project in vocational training and placement are
apparent in the following results:



- 25 -
No. of actions implemented (programs A, B, C, D and F)                     2,811
No. of beneficiaries trained (completed as of October 1995)               34,861
No. of beneficiaries placed in jobs                                       25,043
No. of beneficiaries in training                                              40
No. of program E beneficiaries (relocation)                               13,859
In order to evaluate the overall results and thereby gauge the importance of ETF
actions, results must be broken down by economic sector, by instrument, and by region. It
should be noted that actions completed as of June 30, 1995 numbered 2,573 and benefited
34,861 persons, including 25,043 trainees who obtained employment immeciately after
completing their vocational training.

Leather and footwear           70         614           478          79

Construction                   73         637           297          47
Wood                           70         187            124         66
Hotel Sector                  207       4,074          2,164         53
Other services                 98         432           410          95
TOTAL                       2,811      34,861         25,043         72
As the table shows, ETF activities have taken place in all economic sectors. The
results are indicative of the situation prevailing in each sector in terms of human resource
needs. The overall placement rate (number of beneficiaries having found employment as a
percentage of the number of beneficiaries trained) is 72 %.
The placement rate posted by the hotel sector, however, does not reflect the results of
activities carried out therein. Labor mobility in the sector has had an impact on ETF's
beneficiaries, who are in demand by establishments other than those in which they were
trained and hired as a result.
11.   A simple comparison of the number of actions carried out under each program in the
first half of 1994 and 1995 shows a clear progression in terms of project dynamics and
expansion of the scope of project activities.

B                  26           467             32           523
C                   2            90              8            331
D                  15           237             22            380
E        _             _                         6            104
TOTAL                243         4,501           252           4,102
12.   Moreover, a breakdown of the results of ETF activities shows that it encompasses the
entire employment market at the regional and national levels. It should be noted that ETF has
had more impact in the coastal regions, where the economy is more highly developed. This
observation, however, in no way detracts from the significance of ETF's impact in those
regions of the interior where activity has focused on economic sectors of particular significance
to the region in question, e.g. agriculture and handicrafts.
IV.  Strengthening the Structure of Employment Services (ETF Component B)
13.   This component is part of an institutional development program designed to reinforce
employment services and boost their intervention capacity. The contribution of this program

V.   World Bank Contribution
14.   The success of the ETF project is attributable to the World Bank's contribution, which
materialized principally in the following ways:
*     several project supervision missions carried out by Bank experts, which enabled
corrective action to be taken to put the project on the right track and gain better
control over all its components;
*     implementation of a policy based on a continuing process of consultation, which
allowed the Tunisian staff managing ETF activities to steer the project according
to rules and procedures agreed upon with the Bank, as needed;
*     the Bank's willingness to support the project and work towards its success, as
reflected in the responsiveness of the Bank's units to all requests made by the
Tunisian units in charge of the project, reflecting the Bank's confidence in the
project's importance and beneficial effects;
*     the Bank's close follow-up on all project monitoring and auditing operations, as
evidenced by the comments made by the Bank's units, which enabled actions to
be either validated or corrected by taking the necessary actions.
Moreover, while the organizational structure and procedures set forth in the
management procedures manual have been observed faithfully, several improvements have
been made in the management of the various operating programs.

These improvements have been made in line with recommendations made by the
National Management Committee, in light of an analysis of the quantitative and qualitative
results as measured by internal monitoring mechanisms, expert missions by the Bank, and the
mid-term project review.
VI.   Conclusions
15.  In conclusion, this project - which had already won World Bank support and is
expected to contribute to improving the competitive position of Tunisian enterprises - still has
significant room for development.
The political will to further develop ETF flows from a desire to strengthen ETF
programs in full support of the thrust of reform and liberalization of the Tunisian economy.
16.   ETF is being called upon to play an increasingly pivotal role in underpinning the
national production apparatus.  The economy's needs in terms of improving skills and
qualifications to underwrite the development and expansion of the nation's enterprises,
together with the emergence of new production units, will require particular support and
specific actions in vocational training, skills upgrading, and retraining of human resources.
Against this backdrop, ETF is the appropriate means of helping to achieve these
objectives using the various instruments available to it, particularly programs C and F, which
will provide significant leverage for action benefiting enterprises.
To this end, Tunisia has undertaken a process of institutionalizing ETF, thereby
demonstrating a willingness to pursue the avenues of action available under this project in
order to boost the national economy.
