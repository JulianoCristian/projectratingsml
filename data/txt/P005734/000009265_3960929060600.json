The project finances the\n            creation of a regionally based Employment and Training Fund\n            and an institutional development program.  The Employment\n            and Training Fund consists of: (a) training for placement in\n            a specific enterprise; (b) training for self-employment; (c)\n            in-company training / extension services; (d)\n            sub-contracting to private training / placement companies;\n            and (e) allowances for interview / relocation closer to job\n            site.  The institutional development program assists the\n            Office of Vocational Training and Employment (OFPE) in its\n            efforts to improve the quality and efficiency of its\n            employment / training regional services and to promote the\n            development of private intermediaries."}, "docdt": "1990-07-13T00:00:00Z"}
