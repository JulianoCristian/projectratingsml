APPRAISAL OF HAZIRA FERTILIZER PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of India (GOI, the Government) has requested IDA
financing for the Hazira Fertilizer Project (the Project) to be located at
Hazira, about 15 km west of Surat, in the State of Gujarat (Map IBRD 14854).
The Project will be owned and operated by Krishak Bharati Cooperative Ltd
(KRIBHCO), a cooperative society established in April 1980, with equity
shareholding by the Government (66%), IFFCO (28%), and several domestic
cooperative marketing societies (6%). KRIBHCO's By-Laws provide for the
eventual transfer of the Government equity shares to the cooperatives. The
Project was originally sponsored by the Indian Farmers Fertilizer Cooperative
Ltd (IFFCO), a major producer of fertilizers, owning three large fertilizer
plants at Kalol (ammonia/urea), Kandla (NPK) and Phulpur (ammonia/urea). The
Phulpur Complex was partly financed by the Bank (Loan No. 1079-IN dated
January 24, 1975). Given its successful project implementation and operating
experience, IFFCO had the primary responsibility for the sponsorship of
KRIBHCO; it nominated, by seconding from IFFCO, KRIBHCO's senior management
officials, and will handle the sales and marketing of KRIBHCO's output.  The
proposed Project is expected to be initiated in April 1981 and mechanically
completed by July 1985. It is estimated to cost US$1,277 million equivalent,
including about US$476 million in foreign exchange. KRIBHCO's shareholders
will contribute US$437 million equivalent in equity financing; about
US$81 million equivalent will be provided from KRIBHCO's internally generated
funds to finance part of its working capital requirements, bringing total
equity financing to 43% of the estimated long-term financing requirements.
The IDA credit would cover approximately 33% of the estimated long term
financing requirements. The remaining debt financing will be provided by the
Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF - Japan), about US$99 million; the
Overseas Development Administration (ODA - UK), about US$105 million; and
Indian financing institutions coordinated by the Industrial Development Bank
of India (IDBI), about US$93 million equivalent.
1.02      The Project is aimed at producing 1.31 million metric tons per
year (tpy) of urea, for sale to farmers principally in Northern and Western
India, and a marginal surplus of 17,820 tpy of ammonia to be shipped to
IFFCO's compound fertilizer plant at Kandla, Gujarat, which is being expanded
and will require 65,000 tpy of outside ammonia for the production of NPK. The
proposed Project will include two single-train ammonia units each with a
capacity of 1,350 metric tons per day (tpd) of ammonia, four urea units each
of 1,100 tpd capacity, related offsite and utilities facilities, and infra-
structure requirements. The Project is part of the overall Government plan to
use most economically the large off-shore Bombay natural gas deposits discovered
in 1974. At present, these gas deposits are expected to yield approximately
3.0 million normal cubic meters per day (Ncmpd), of associated gas (Bombay
High field) at full oil production levels of 9.0 million tpy, and about 18
million Ncmpd of non-associated gas (South Bassein field), for a period of
over 20 years. The large gas availability has changed Government policy
on fertilizer plant feedstock (formerly emphasizing naphtha and fuel oil);
natural gas is technically and economically the preferred feedstock for



- 2 -
nitrogenous fertilizer production and these offshore reserves can feed--in
addition to present users in Bombay, the Thal Project located at Maharashtra,
and the proposed Hazira Project--six ammonia plants of 1,350 tpd each.
Additional substantial gas reserves have recently been identified in the
Arabian Sea.
1.03       The Project was appraised in October/November 1979 by a Bank mis-
sion consisting of Messrs. E. Segura (Mission Chief), D. Caplin, R. Heathi
J. Kuroda and P. Larroque, all of the Industrial Projects Department.
Mr. Krogh-Poulsen of the Transportation Division, South Asia, assisted in
reviewing transportation requirements. The appraisal mission was joined by
representatives of OECF, ODA and IDBI, the prospective colenders to the
Project. Following delays in the initiation the Project due to delays in the
appointment of engineering firms, the Project was reappraised in November
1980, by a mission consisting of Messrs. Segura, Heath and Larroque.
II. THE INDIAN FERTILIZER INDUSTRY
A.   The Fertilizer Industry
2.01       The Government of India has attached high priority to the develop-
ment of the fertilizer industry to ensure efficient and stable supply of
fertilizers to farmers and to achieve continuous modernization of the agri-
cultural sector. Since further possibilities of expanding the area under
cultivation are limited, more intensive use of land with modern inputs such as
fertilizers is the cornerstone of the Government's agricultural policy.
The fertilizer industry, therefore, has received priority in India's investment
plans. As a result, a large number of fertilizer plants have been set up
during the last decade. Due to the substantial capital investment needs and
institution building requirements associated with these plants, the country
has received continued Bank Group assistance for the sector since 1967.
1.   Past Production Capacity Growth
2.02       In 1980 India had a nitrogenous fertilizer capacity of 3.9 million
nutrient tpy, representing 5% of total world capacity, making it the fourth
largest producer after the USSR, US and China. There are 21 major operating
fertilizer companies in India with a total of 43 plants, of which 25, repre-
senting 50% of capacity, are owned by the Government. Including the coopera-
tive and joint sector, the public sector directly or indirectly accounts for
about 70% of domestic nitrogen capacity and its share is expected to increase
further to about 90% by 1984/85. The capacity and location of Indian fertil-
izer producers are shown in Annex 2-1 and Map IBRD 13342R1. Past growth of
nitrogenous fertilizer production capacity is shown in Annex 2-2.
2.03       In spite of the high rate of growth in the past (from 738,000
tpy of nitrogen in fiscal year 1966/67 to 3,498,000 in 1979/80, or 13% p.a.),
domestic demand for nitrogenous fertilizer has continually exceeded domestic
production, necessitating the importation of between 25% and 30% of the
Indian nitrogenous fertilizer consumption requirements.
2.   Feedstock for Nitrogenous Fertilizers
2.04       Since major natural gas reserves had not yet been located, emphasis
in the 1960s was mainly on the use of naphtha as feedstock for nitrogen



production. Long-term planning in the early 1970s envisaged a change first to
fuel oil and subsequently to coal as a means of decreasing dependence on
imported hydrocarbon feedstocks. The first four of the seven fuel oil plants
planned are already in operation (Nangal was commissioned in 1978 and Sindri,
Panipat and Bhatinda in 1979), and the two coal-based plants at Talcher and
Ramagundam were commissioned in late 1980. No further coal-based plants are
planned until sufficient operating experience has been gained from these two
plants and newer technologies are evaluated. With the large quantities of
natural gas now available off the Bombay coast, the next 2.0 million tpy of
nitrogen production capacity, in addition to the Hazira and Thal projects, is
expected to use this natural gas as feedstock. By the mid-1980s, therefore,
natural gas will account for about one-third of nitrogenous fertilizer
capacity; naphtha will account for 35%; fuel oil 23%; and coal for most of the
remaining 9% of capacity.
3.   Plant Capacities and Technologies
2.05      A wide range of plant capacities and ammonia production technologies
have been used in India. Plant capacities range from the small plants installed
in the 1960s to the large units of up to 1,100 tpd of ammonia used recently.
This evolution reflects mainly the technologies available at the time of
construction. Production processes in commercial use include coke gasification,
electrolysis of water, coke oven gas cracking, partial oxidation of fuel oil,
and steam reforming of gas and naphtha. Following the developments in more
advanced countries, since the early 1970s, new installations involve large
plant capacities (in the range of 600 to 1,100 tpd of ammonia), which allow
for the use of more economical centrifugal compressors and are based mainly on
steam reforming of naphtha and natural gas. As a result of the past large
capacity expansion programs, India has acquired substantial experience both in
building and in operating modern plants with a wide range of plant sizes and
technologies.
4.   Capacity Utilization
2.06      In addition to the plans for expanding fertilizer production capacity,
the Government is placing considerable emphasis on measures necessary to
increase capacity utilization of existing plants from the relatively low
overall rates achieved in the past as well as to ensure reasonable production
levels from recently completed projects. The Bank Group is participating
in these programs through IDA Credits 481-IN (Trombay IV) and 1079-IN (Fertilizer
Industry Credit). A detailed analysis of capacity utilization by sectors for
the period 1971-80 is given in Annex 2-3 and summarized below for the last 4
years:
India - Percentage Capacity Utilization of Nitrogenous Industry
Year ending
March 31      Private      Joint      Cooperative      Public    Overall
1976/77          80          69           81             69          73
1977/78          86          73           88             64          74
1978/79          77          73           92             62          72
1979/80          79          79           73             49          66
The average capacity utilization, which was showing perceptible improvement in
the last few years, took an unfavorable turn during 1980. Production suffered



- 4 -
in several plants because of non-availability of inputs such as naphtha, fuel
oil, coal and because of power cuts and interruptions. These factors alone
were responsible for loss in production of about 330,000 tons of nitrogen.
Some of the constraints were due to unforeseen external factors, including
operational difficulties within the railways and political disturbances in the
oil producing State of Assam which cut the supply of naphtha and fuel oil to
many parts of the country. In late January 1981, however, the Assam pipeline
was restarted and is now meeting the feedstock needs of plants in eastern and
central India. In addition, in late 1980, with the introduction of unit-train
operations, railway movements of coal and fuel oil have significantly improved.
These factors have resulted in recent significant improvements in the capacity
utilization of fertilizer plants. Together with special measures being adopted
by GOI to ensure sustained and adequate supplies of inputs (para. 2.08),
further improvements are expected to be achieved in the future.
2.07      The cooperative sector, i.e. IFFCO, has generally shown the highest
level of capacity utilization, followed by the private and joint sectors. The
overall performance of the public sector has been low. These differences,
however, cannot be entirely explained as being due to management and ownership.
The private sector plants are generally of smaller capacity based on proven
design. As a group they have been in operation longer and have already solved
initial problems. The public sector plants, on the other hand, are generally
of more recent origin, are larger, use a more varied range of feedstocks and
were built with a much greater involvement of local equipment and engineering.
The major problem areas leading to low overall capacity utilization rates are:
(i) problems in commissioning and debugging new projects; (ii) equipment
failures due to difficult raw materials; (iii) continuing operating problems
in several of the older public sector plants comprising about 35% of the
public sector capacity--resulting partly from severe original design defects;
(iv) organizational and administrative problems resulting from the industry's
substantial production capacity expansion; (v) problems in obtaining adequate
supply of inputs such as coal, fuel oil, naphtha and power; and (vi) difficulties
resulting from a policy of maximizing the use of local engineering and equipment
without a full appreciation of the risks and penalties involved in developing
rapidly the country's technological base.
2.08      Problems affecting the performance of the public sector fertilizer
plants were studied by a Government committee in 1978 and several of the
recommended remedial measures have been adopted, including those for plant
modifications and better planning of preventive maintenance to minimize
unscheduled losses. The Government has also established a control and monitor-
ing system to review performance against unitwise monthly production targets
developed after detailed discussions with plant managements. Weekly production
statistics are now being received and reviewed by the Ministry of Chemicals
and Fertilizers to monitor progress and identify constraints to better produc-
tion and to evolve solutions. Foreign exchange for import of normal maintenance
and emergency spares is now more readily available. Furthermore, to improve
the decision-making process and the performance of public fertilizer companies,
the Government restructured the sector in April 1978, regrouping Government-
owned production units previously owned by the Fertilizer Corporation of India
and National Fertilizers Ltd into four separate geographically-oriented
companies. The full impact of all these efforts should be gradually reflected
in higher capacity utilization during the next few years with overall industry



- 5 -
capacity utilization targeted to increase from 66% i.n 1979/80 to a satisfactory
average level of about 85% by 1985/86, as shown in Annex 2-4. Since
public and private sector plants without technical problems have shown satis-
factory capacity utilization and considering that the proposed Project is
based on gas as feedstock, the 90% average capacity utilization rate from the
third operating year assumed for the Project (para. 9.01) is considered
reasonable.
B.   Strategy for the Future Development of the Fertilizer Sector
2.09      As mentioned above, in spite of rapid increases in production in the
last two decades, India still imports about one-third of its nitrogen and
phosphate fertilizer requirements, principally due to the success of the
Government measures to promote fertilizer use and agricultural output. The
entire potash requirements are imported as the country has no domestic resources.
Even under conservative assumptions for future fertilizer consumption growth
rates (Chapter IV) and after taking into consideration the large projects
now underway and firmly planned, nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer consumption
is expected to exceed domestic output significantly.
2.10       Regarding nitrogenous fertilizers, the gap between domestic consump-
tion and production is expected to reach 1.8 million nutrient tpy by 1987/88,
and 3.1 million tpy by 1989/90 (para. 4.10). Given the size of this gap over
the next 10 years, the question arises as to whether it should be met through
imports from abroad or through the provision of additional domestic manufac-
turing capacity. The GOI strategy incorporates both of these features.
Nitrogenous fertilizer plants are capital intensive, and recent international
inflationary trends have further escalated project costs. Given competing
demands on limited resources, India may not find it easy to allocate in full
the financing required to build the entire additional capacity required
to meet its nitrogen needs. Managerial and technical skills essential to
implement efficiently such a very large program might also be a constraint.
The Government, therefore, intends to cover part of the future nitrogenous
production gap by imports from countries in Asia and the Middle East either
from jointly financed new plants or from large fertilizer plants already
under construction aiming at export possibilities.
2.11      Additional local ammonia production capacity in the next few years
will be based on natural gas from the recently discovered large fields offshore
Bombay. On the basis of proven gas reserves off the West Coast, during 1982
to 1988 Government intends to set up in the interior of the country, six
ammonia units (after the four for Thal and Hazira) of 1,350 tpd each. For
this purpose, the Government intends to build a 800-1,200 km gas pipeline to
the center of the country, where future fertilizer needs are expected to be
substantial. However, the location and timing of the nitrogenous fertilizer
plants to be installed in the center of the country have not yet been established.
Additional units may be justified on the basis of possible gas reserves
recently discovered in the area. The Government is also considering the use
of coal (which is abundant in India) as feedstock once its technical and
economic feasibility is confirmed on the basis of initial operating experience
in the coal-based Talcher and Ramagundam plants and when the emerging new coal
gasification technology is evaluated.
2.12      Regarding phosphate fertilizers, India may not be able to expand
local capacity significantly as needed, since rock phosphate reserves (located
mainly in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh) are small and are not expected to
contribute to more than about 200,000 tpy of P205. The Government is, therefore,



- 6 -
planning the development of phosphatic fertilizer capacity on the basis of
imported rock phosphate and sulfur or imported phosphoric acid. Capacity
additions are being planned at Kandla, Goa and Tuticorin, based mostly on
imported phosphoric acid.
C.   Bank Group Role
2.13      The Bank Group has so far participated in the financing of ten
fertilizer projects in India with a total contribution of US$481.9 million.
The most recent operation was an IFC investment of US$8.54 million in Deepak
Fertilizer Project (IFC/T-287 approved in November 1979). An IBRD loan for the
Thal Fertilizer project approved by the Board in June 1979, did not become
effective. Bank financing has been through IDA for six public sector projects,
IFC for three private sector projects, and IBRD for a cooperative sector
project, as shown on the following page.
2.14      The first three IDA-financed projects at Cochin II, Gorakhpur and
Nangal suffered physical completion delays of between 16 to 31 months and cost
overruns of 35%-45%. While delays in finalizing engineering arrangements
postponed execution of the Gorakhpur project, the Cochin II project suffered
from inadequate project engineering and from the company's financial problems.
The Nangal project was affected by delayed delivery of equipment and cost
increases following the 1973 oil crisis. However, performance has substantially
improved in the more recently financed projects. The Sindri and Trombay
projects have been physically completed with three- and six month delays,
respectively, and at costs close to appraisal estimates. The IFFCO Phulpur
project was initially delayed by 7 months due to a change from fuel oil to
naphtha as feedstock, which necessitated a complete change in the design and
scope of the Project. It suffered a further 12-month delay towards the end of
construction due to severe delivery delays of local structural steel and power
interruptions from the national grid due to temporary drought conditions. It
was mechanically completed in March 1980, 19 months behind the originial
completion date. The actual capital costs are about 6% above original estimates.
2.15      The Fertilizer Industry Credit included several sub-projects,
principally for improving the utilization of fertilizer production capacity
at existing plants; about 11 are in operation. There have been delays in the
start of some of the sub-projects. Sub-projects not taken up for implemen-
tation have been replaced by others with similar objectives, which are now
generally proceeding satisfactorily. As part of the same Credit, three
important studies relating to timely availability of fertilizers to the
farmers were contemplated. The National Council of Applied Economic Research
has carried out the Fertilizer Demand and Marketing Study which included
considerable field survey. The draft report is completed, and preliminary
demand projections have become available. Rail India Technical and Economic
Services Ltd has completed the Fertilizer and Raw Material Transportation
Study, and the findings, after discussions with the industry, are now being
reviewed by the Government for implementation of the recommendations. The
Administrative Staff College, Hyderabad, carried out the Fertilizer Ware-
housing Study.
2.16      Despite implementation difficulties, all the projects so far financed
by the Bank Group remain economically justified, with economic rates of return
calculated at project completion in line with the expectations at the time of
appraisal. Currently, the economics of these projects should be even better
due to substantial increases in actual and projected long-term international
fertilizer prices in real terms since the projects were originally appraised
and completed. The Bank's major objective in all the above projects has

been to assist India in building up its domestic fertilizer production. The
Bank/IDA financed projects have also aimed at improving project management
capabilities in the public sector, project implementation time and fertilizer
capacity utilization. On the whole, these objectives have been satisfactorily
achieved, particularly in the more recent projects. At the same time., continued
Bank Group assistance is necessary and justified, considering that during the
next ten years India plans to invest over US$7 billion in new fertilizer
production and related gas development facilities, and that the next gener-
ation of plants--to be based mainly on the newly found offshore natural
gas--would involve new entities and larger and more complex plants than now
existing in India.
III. PROJECT OWNERS AND SPONSORS
A.   Krishak Bharati Cooperative Ltd (KRIBHCO)
3.01      The Project will be owned and operated by KRIBHCO, a new cooperative
society which was formally established in April 1980. Its shareholders
include the Government of India (66%), IFFCO (28%) and several Indian coopera-
tive marketing societies (6%). KRIBHCO's authorized capital amounts to Rs
5,000 million (US$625 million), of which Rs 3,500 million (US$437 million)
will be paid-in over the next five years as required by the Project. To
permit an increasing participation of cooperatives in the operations of
KRIBHCO, its By-Laws provide for the eventual, partial or full transfer of the
shares initially held by the GOI and IFFCO to the cooperatives, as may be
agreed periodically between KRIBHCO and the concerned shareholders. The Board
of Directors, which determines KRIBHCO's policies, consists of 23 directors,
who are nominated and appointed by the Government, after consultation with
IFFCO, for a term of ten years. The Board is composed of five members from
IFFCO, five from the GOI, six from the shareholding cooperative societies,
three from participating domestic financial institutions, two outside experts
invited by the Government, and KRIBHCO's Managing Director and Finance Director.
After the initial ten-year period, KRIBHCO's Board of Directors will be
appointed by its shareholders. KRIBHCO's Managing Director and Finance
Director, who are ex officio members of the Board of Directors and the most
important senior officials responsible for day-to-day operations, can be
appointed, suspended or removed only with IFFCO's and the GOI's prior approval.
Both IFFCO and GOI also nominate two members each to the 12-member Executive
Committee of KRIBHCO, which is made up of members of the Board to oversee the
day-to-day management of KRIBHCO. IFFCO and GOI will thus play a major role
in the management and sponsorship of KRIBHCO and in the implementation of the
proposed Project.
3.02      KRIBHCO's staffing is proceeding on schedule with 55 professionals
already transferred from IFFCO, and the key positions of Managing Director,
Project Manager and Finance Director adequately filled. KRIBHCO's Managing
Director, Mr. Paul Pothen, is a highly competent executive experienced in the
fertilizer industry. Much of the successful development of IFFCO, of which he
was previously Managing Director, is attributed to his management capabilities.
Mr. Pothen is due to retire in early 1982, but both GOI and KRIBHCO are fully
aware of the need to provide competent and continuous leadership in management--
particularly in the next two years when the major decisions for the Hazira
project implementation will be made. KRIBHCO has agreed in the event of a
vacancy in its senior management positions, prior to making any appointment to
such positions, that it will furnish to the Association the details of quali-
fications and experience of the proposed nominees.



- 9 -
3.03      IFFCO will play a direct role in the sales and marketing of KRIBHCO's
products. The KRIBHCO By-Laws stipulate that the marketing of all its products
will be handled in close coordination with IFFCO. A joint sales, marketing
and distribution program has been already approved by IFFCO and will be
approved by KRIBHCO Board shortly. KRIBHCO has agreed to sign the sales and
marketing agreement with IFFCO by December 31, 1981. A joint marketing
committee consisting of five members each from IFFCO and KRIBHCO, including
the Chairmen and the Managing Directors of both companies, will be formed to
draw up a marketing strategy and to plan annual Statewise fertilizer allo-
cations and sales terms and conditions; these plans will be submitted for
approval to the Boards of Directors of IFFCO and KRIBHCO. This arrangement
will make maximum use of IFFCO's marketing experience and expertise in order
to ensure the smooth and efficient marketing of KRIBHCO products.
B.   IFFCO's Organization and Management
3.04      IFFCO was registered on November 3, 1967, under the Bombay Coopera-
tive Societies Act and, subsequently, as a Central Cooperative Society in
New Delhi. As of September 30, 1980, IFFCO's paid-in share capital stood
at Rs 818 million (US$102 million), of which Rs 502 million (62%) was subscribed
by the Government of India, and Rs 316 million (38%) by member cooperatives.
The Board of Directors of IFFCO consists of 25 members, including 14 members
from the shareholding cooperatives, 8 members from the Government and public
institutions, and IFFCO's Managing, Finance and Marketing Directors. IFFCO
has currently about 3,600 staff. Its organization includes three production
plants (Kalol, Kandla and Phulpur), one marketing division and an administra-
tion unit at the head office (Annex 3-1). Mr. L. R. Talwar, who replaced Mr.
Paul Pothen as Managing Director of IFFCO, is very competent and experienced
in the fertilizer industry.
C.   IFFCO's Plants On-Stream and Under Construction
3.05      Two IFFCO plants are already in operation in the State of Gujarat,
one at Kalol, near Ahmedabad, and the other about 320 km away, at Kandla.
The Kalol plant, comprising a 910 tpd gas-based ammonia unit and a 1,200 tpd
urea unit, was completed in October 1974 and started commercial production
in February 1975. About 700 tpd of ammonia are transformed to urea and the
remaining balance is transported to the Kandla plant for the manufacture of
complex fertilizers. A debottlenecking scheme for the Kalol plant has been
recently completed with the assistance of IDA Credit 598-IN. Under this
credit, an amine guard system for the ammonia plant has been installed and
other debottlenecking schemes, such as a purge gas recovery plant and install-
ation of an oil-fired boiler, were completed in late 1980. Over the past two
years, the Kalol plant units have been operating at about 87% capacity utiliza-
tion. The Kandla plant is presently operating at 129% of its rated capacity
of 1,250 tpd, producing about 1,620 tpd of NPK fertilizers, all on the basis
of imported phosphoric acid and potassium chloride as well as local and
imported ammonia. This plant was completed in November 1974 and started
production January 1975. A new NPK unit with a capacity of 1,170 tpd of NPK
is presently being constructed to expand production capacity. The contract
for the new unit was signed in January 1979 and orders for major equipment
have been placed. The work is proceeding ahead of schedule and its completion
is now expected for July 1981. The Bank-financed Phulpur project, located



- 10 -
near Allahabad in the State of Uttar Pradesh, was mechanically completed in
March 1980 and during commissioning, the ammonia plant reached 76% of rated
capacity. However, due to difficulties in securing supply of naphtha caused
by the closure of the Assam oil pipeline (para. 2.06), it is able to start
commercial production only in March 1981. The project consists of a 900 tpd
naphtha-based ammonia plant and a 1,550 tpd urea plant (para. 2.14).
3.06       The Kalol and Kandla plants are operating satisfactorily and, apart
from last year when the Kalol plant was shut down a month due to an equipment
failure, have shown consistent production improvement since start-up, as shown
below:

D.   Financial Performance of IFFCO Operations
3.07       Since 1975, when its Kalol and Kandla plants started commercial
operations, IFFCO has had good financial performances. In 1979/80, its net
profits stood at Rs 216 million (US$27 million). This net profit represents
10% of sales and 12% of net worth. As of June 1980, IFFCO's debt/equity ratio
stood at 40:60. Actual financial statements of IFFCO are shown in Annex 3-2.
3.08       IFFCO's projected financial statements (excluding its expected
equity participation in KRIBHCO) are summarized in the following page and
their breakdown by plant is shown in Annex 3-3. For the existing units at the
Kandla plant, it has been conservatively assumed that the present high level
of capacity utilization will not be sustained in the future, levelling off
from 129% capacity utilization in 1979/80 to 90% in 1984/85. Feedstock prices
are assumed to remain at their 1980 levels in constant terms, Rs 320 per Ncm
for natural gas and Rs 1,200 per ton for naphtha at Kalol and Rs 1,260 per ton
for naphtha at Phulpur. IFFCO's overall profitability would not be affected
by increasses in real feedstock prices since these would be recovered under
GOI's price retention formula (para. 9.02). IFFCO's cash position is expected
to improve significantly now that the Phulpur plant is starting up. Internal]ly
generated cash will amount to about US$46 million in 1980/81. Thereafter when
the Phulpur project increases its production capacity, IFFCO's cash flow will
double to about US$90-110 million annually, which is more than adequate to
cover IFFCO's debt service and its equity contribution to KRIBHCO. IFFCO is
expected to contribute about US$30 million per year as equity to KRIBHCO
during 1981-84.

IV. FERTILIZER MARKET IN INDIA
A.   Fertilizer Use in Agriculture
4.01       The agricultural sector is by far the largest in the Indian economy,
and accounts for 72% of the labor force; its productivity, however, is still
low, with the sector accounting for only 42% of the country's gross domestic
product. For centuries crop production was wholly dependent on monsoon rains,
which failed periodically, as in 1943, when a serious drought aggravated by
a breakdown in the foodgrain distribution led to a severe famine. However
since 1951, Indian agriculture has been gradually transformed; in the period
from 1951 to 1979, foodgrain output increased at an average rate of 2.9% as
compared to a population growth rate of 2.1% per year (Annex 4-1). Part of
this increase in agricultural output can be attributed to changes in crop
patterns, but most of the increase is due to higher productivity achieved with
the introduction of irrigation and fertilizers, an increase in the area under
multiple cropping and the widespread cultivation of high-yielding varieties
(HYVs), particularly wheat and rice. As a result of these improvements,
India is now almost self-sufficient in foodgrain production. There is still,
however, ample room for further increases in agricultural production.



- 12 -
4.02       India now ranks third in cultivated areas (after the USSR and
US), and has one of the largest irrigated areas; the gross cropped area now
stands at 176 million ha, of which 75% is under foodgrain (Annex 4-1). Since
possibilities of further increases in cropped areas are limited, further
increases in foodgrain production will have to come mainly through more
irrigation, increased use of HYVs, greater intensity of fertilizer use and
multiple cropping. Fertilizer consumption per hectare (all nutrients) has
increased substantially during the last three decades from 0.5 kg per hectare
in 1951/52 to 7.0 kg/ha in 1966/67 and 31.2 kg/ha in 1979/80. However, India
still consumes less fertilizer per hectare than many other developing countries;
i.e., in 1979 Brazil consumed 79.0 kg/ha; Pakistan 43.3; Mexico 45.5; and the
Philippines 38.5.
4.03       There is wide variation in the intensity of use of fertilizers among
different States in India. While the Punjab recorded a fertilizer usage of
108.6 kg/ha in 1980, five other major States (Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan,
Orissa, Bihar and Maharashtra) which account for more than 45% of the cropped
area, used only 12.4 kg/ha.  In the States to be served by the Hazira Project,
fertilizer usage presently ranges from 8.6 kg/ha in Rajasthan to 108.6 kg/ha
in the Punjab (Annex 4-2). Part of this variation can be attributed to
differences in irrigation, climatic and topographical conditions, as well as
in soil characteristics, but much of it is explained by differences in the
actual use of fertilizer and HYVs. Since in several States, such as Uttar
Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, the percentage of farmers using any
fertilizer at all is very low, there is a significant potential for increasing
fertilizer consumption simply by increasing the number of farmers using
fertilizer, as well as through improvements in farm management practices and
farmer education. While fertilizer companies play a role in propagating
fertilizer use, the main efforts in this area must be carried through the
State agricultural extension services. These extension services are being
reorganized in many States with Bank assistance (para. 5.21) and a number of
measures are being implemented to improve credit availability (para. 5.18).
Furthermore, fertilizer consumption is still concentrated in relatively few
districts, often close to railheads. With easier availability, fertilizer
consumption in remote areas can be encouraged (para. 5.05). Therefore, the
potential for considerable increases in fertilizer consumption in India is
significant.
4.04       Nitrogenous fertilizer is available in the form of four main products:
urea (46% nitrogen); ammonium sulphate (20.6% N); ammonium sulphate nitrate
(26% N); and calcium ammonium nitrate (21%-26% N). The pattern of consumption
has changed markedly over the years; in 1961 more than half the nitrogen
was consumed in the form of ammonium sulphate, with only 22% being supplied in
the form of urea. Since then, due to cost savings in bagging, storage and
trans port per unit of nutrient, high analysis material such as urea has
been dominating the market; 78% of total nitrogenous fertilizers are now
being supplied as urea. The other straight nitrogenous fertilizers account
presently for only 9% of the consumption, with about 13% nitrogen supplied in
the form of NPK complex fertilizers (Annex 4-3).
B. Historical Growth of Fertilizer Consumption and Production
4.05       Historical fertilizer consumption, production and imports are given
in Annex 4-4 and summarized in the following page. In the decade 1962-72,
nitrogenous fertilizer consumption grew at an average rate of 21.8% per year.



- 13 -
For the next three years, consumption remained static due principally to
adverse weather conditions and sharp increases in fertilizer prices. In the
year ending January 31, 1976 (i.e. 1975/76), nitrogen consumption again
increases, and this growth was sustained through 1979/80 with the growth rate
in the period 1975-80 averaging 14.6% per year. Consumption of phosphatic and
potassic fertilizers followed a similar pattern, but did not begin to recover
until 1976/77. By 1979/80, fertilizer consumption stood at 3.5 million tpy
of nitrogen, 1.2 million tpy of P205, and 0.6 million tpy of K20. In 1979/80,
one of the most severe droughts experienced in the 20th century struck the
summer Kharif crops (when in some non-irrigated areas production dropped 93%),
and rainfall during the first months of winter Rabi was below normal, with the
result that fertilizer consumption in 1979/80 increased by only 2.7% over the
previous year. During 1980/81, however, the sector partly recovered, with

4.06        Although fertilizer production in India has increased at a rapid
pace of about 16% per year during the last 18 years, it has generally lagged
behind domestic consumption. Therefore, in the period 1971-80, an average of
857,000 tons of N and 220,000 tons of P20 were imported, representing about
one-third of domestic consumption. India s fertilizer import policy is
centered on supplementing domestic production with imports to ensure adequate
availability on the domestic market; while domestic production is planned to
increase considerably over the next five years, the share of imports is
expected to remain at about 20% of demand.



- 14 -
4.07       As shown in the previous table, the NPK ratio today stands at
approximately 6-2-1. It has been estimated that from an optimal agronomical
standpoint the ultimate NPK ratio to be reached in the 1990s should be close
to 4-2-1. Therefore, in order to ensure the optimal benefit from the use of
nitrogenous fertilizers, the use of phosphatic and potassic fertilizers will
need to increase at a faster rate than nitrogen. A committee formed by the
Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers is examining the desirability of con-
structing three major phosphatic fertilizer plants during the next five
years.
C.   Projected Growth of Nitrogenous Fertilizer Demand and Production
4.08        A number of estimates of the projected demand for nitrogenous
fertilizer have been prepared by various Indian organizations (Reference A -
Project File). Bank staff has also prepared projections--high, median and
low estimates. While based on Box-Jenkins forecasting techniques, Bank
projections also take into account factors such as distribution losses,
build-up of additional stocks in the distribution system and estimated dimin-
ishing return levels for nitrogen consumption. The median Bank estimate
projects a growth rate consistent with that achieved over the period 1971 to
1979 and includes a cyclical movement superimposed on the main trend, again
consistent with past data. It assumes that recovery from the current depressed
levels due to the 1979 drought will take two or three years to work itself
out. The median estimate results in a growth rate of 10.1% p.a. in the next
five years, compared to rates of 15.8% in 1961-79 and 10.7% in 1967-79. The
high estimate projects a rate of growth of 12.5% p.a. over the next five
years, which is a more optimistic growth rate than that experienced in 1971-78,
and assumes an immediate recovery from the effects of the drought. The low
projection of 8.5% p.a. takes a more pessimistic view of these factors. The
projections for the longer term assume that the estimated potential level of
consumption of nitrogenous fertilizers of at least 10 million tons of nutrient
will be attained in the early l990s. li These projections are compared with
prepared by a number of Indian organizations in Annex 4-5; in general they do
not differ substantially from Bank projections.
4.09        Relatively rapid growth of consumption is expected in the future
due to (i) the determined Government efforts to increase agricultural output
and promote the use of fertilizers, including improving agricultural support
services; (ii) the current wide disparities in fertilizer use among the States
which provide an opportunity for rapid growth in use by broadening the fer-
tilizer demand base; and (iii) the fast growth in fertilizer use in the
past combined with the still relatively low overall level of consumption which
provides a very large potential demand. It will take at least another decade
of the present high growth rate before the level of consumption approaches
optimum levels. However, the maintenance of rapid rates of growth in demand
will depend on the continuance of key policies concerning the agricultural
sector. The relative financial prosperity of the farming sector since the
mid-1970s has undoubtedly been a major factor sustaining growth of demand.
1/   A potential level of nitrogenous fertilizer consumption of at least 10
million nutrient tons per year was estimated using data on optimal
fertilizer usage on different crops, projections of irrigation, HYV
development, crop patterns, etc. (Reference B - Project File).



- 15 -
At current fertilizer/crop price ratios, fertilizer use remains profitable
(para. 5.23), and it is assumed that these favorable ratios will be maintained
in the future. Other Government policies that will have a significant impact
on consumption, including agricultural extension, credit and research are
discussed in Chapter V.
4.10        The Bank projections of demand and production of nitrogenous
fertilizers are summarized in the table below.  The fertilizer production
estimates given there take into account plants already in operation, under
construction and firmly planned (Annex 2-1 and 2-4). The estimates include
production from the major projects now in the planning stage and expected to
come on stream by 1984/85. These newer plants are assumed to operate at 90% of
their capacity from their third year of operation. For the older and problem
plants, past performance and the effect of modification schemes have been
taken into account in estimating the likely production levels. The comparison
of nitrogen production and demand projections shows that, as noted previously,
the current shortfall in domestic supply is likely to continue; i.e. antici-
pated production will be only 81% of projected demand in 1986. This gap may
even be higher if existing older production facilities have to be shut down.
This indicates that not only the Hazira Project, but also other large plants
now in the preliminary planning stage will be required.

V. MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION
A.   Market for Project's Output
5.01       IFFCO plans to move fertilizers from the project site to the market-
ing area in unit trains owned and operated by the Indian Railways, with



- 16 -
dispatches spread out uniformly throughout the year.  A supply plan for the
Hazira marketing area for 1986/87 (Annex 5-1) has been produced by Bank staff
on the basis of estimates of Statewise demand for urea prepared by a working
group constituted by the GOI, and taking into consideration GOI's distribution
principles as stated in para. 5.02. As shown in Annex 5-1 and Map IBRD 14853,
the major markets for the Project's output are expected to be Gujarat, the
Punjab and Haryana, each taking approximately 23% of the Project's output
(about 300,000 tpy of urea each), Madhya Pradesh, 16% (about 200,000 tpy) and
Uttar Pradesh, 8% (about 100,000 tpy). While most of the Project's output
sold in Gujarat will move by road, urea marketed in the Punjab, Haryana and
Rajasthan will be moved on the Western Railway system, and urea marketed in
Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh will be transported on the Central Railway
system.
B.   Fertilizer Distribution System in India
5.02      The Ministry of Agriculture coordinates through six-monthly zonal
conferences the distribution of domestically produced fertilizers to different
States, to ensure that (i) no important production unit relies entirely on
the market in one State and that no State relies on one production unit for
its entire requirements; (ii) market requirements are met from domestic
production as far as possible; (iii) there are no radical changes from year
to year in the marketing areas of individual producers; and (iv) the average
freight distance from individual producing units is minimized. Once the
Statewise allocations are made, plans are coordinated with the railways for
the movements of fertilizer over the next six-month period, eliminating as far
as possible cross-movements of similar fertilizers from different producers.
5.03      Fertilizers are marketed to farmers through the following agencies
(Annex 5-2): (i) cooperatives and other institutional agencies; (ii) private
trade agencies; and (iii) manufacturers' outlets. In India, the cooperative
system is the most important fertilizer channel, distributing about 60% of
all fertilizers. For all India, there are some 43,000 cooperative selling
points. In almost all States, there is an Apex Cooperative Marketing Federa-
tion which coordinates the marketing of fertilizers and other agricultural
inputs in the State and undertakes the marketing of agricultural products.
The private trade agencies handle about 40% of all fertilizer sales and
include (i) wholesale agencies, of which there are three major companies in
India; and (ii) private dealers which are appointed by any of the public/
private sector manufacturers or by the wholesale agencies. Some private
dealers sell part of their material to retailers and the rest directly to
farmers. Fertilizer manufacturers are not significantly involved in distri-
bution, though some maintain a few outlets as sales points/service centers.
5.04      The institutional structure of the cooperatives engaged in fertil-
izer marketing varies somewhat from State to State, with a two-tier structure
(State Apex Cooperative Federation and Village Cooperatives) in some States,
and a three-tier structure (Apex Cooperative, District-level Cooperatives and
Village Cooperatives) in others. Operating in parallel with Apex Cooperatives
are the Apex Cooperative Banks which are the main channels for providing
cooperative credit to the farmers (para. 5.18). IFFCO and KRIBHCO products
will be almost entirely marketed through the cooperative system. IFFCO will
deal directly and exclusively with about 20 State Apex Cooperatives for the
selling of its products. At present, in accordance with a shipment plan
agreed upon with the Apex Cooperatives, IFFCO moves its products to about 270



- 17 -
warehouses located in its marketing area. IFFCO products are then lifted by
the State Apex Cooperatives from these warehouses, which are generally situ-
ated at railheads, to their own warehouses, where on average the material is
held for three to four months. In turn, the lower level cooperative societies
normally draw their products from the Apex warehouses according to their
requirements. Usually the handling charges, transport cost and point-of-sale
storage costs are borne by the lower level societies themselves and must be
met out of the share of the dealer's margin passed on to them by the Apex
Cooperative; in some cases, however, the Apex Cooperative itself assumes
responsibility for transferring the material to the primary societies' godowns,
in which case a larger proportion of the dealer's margin is retained by the
Apex Cooperative.
5.05       The bulk of fertilizers are moved by rail from manufacturing points
or import ports. This has led to the concentration, principally by private
dealers, of stocking points as well as sales outlets near the railhead. This
concentration away from the final consuming points, in the future could act as
a major deterrent to rapid increases in fertilizer consumption. The Government
of India is aware of the need for the opening of more sales points in areas
away from the railheads and is planning to introduce incentives for private
dealers to operate away from the railheads. With Bank/IDA support, it is also
improving the availability of fertilizers near consuming points by expanding
cooperative godown facilities.
5.06       Imports of nitrogenous and phosphatic fertilizers are effected by
the Government-owned Minerals and Metals Trading Corporation on behalf of the
Central Fertilizer Pool. They are then distributed by the Food Corporation
of India on behalf of the Pool. Potash is distributed by Indian Potash Ltd.
These agencies, however, rely heavily on the cooperatives and private dealers
for the actual distribution within the country. In order to make efficient
use of unit trains over long distances and to minimize double loadings and
handling, imported nitrogenous fertilizer is normally destined for distant
marketing in Uttar Pradesh and the Punjab (in addition to the coastal States in
the South), the demand in other States being satisfied from domestic production.
C.   Distribution Infrastructure
5.07       By 1986 about 20 million tons of fertilizer products will be moved
from production sites and importing ports to the farmers. The provision of
adequate distribution infrastructure to handle this quantity of material is
of major importance. The major physical facilities utilized are the railways,
roads, ports and warehouses.
5.08       Railways.  Railways carry about 90% of fertilizers distributed
in India, representing about 4% of total rail movements. The transportation
and distribution of fertilizers are currently facing difficulties because
of railway capacity constraints and operational inefficiencies. Regarding
capacity constraints, some rail corridors are already insufficient to cope
with traffic. This problem is recognized by the Indian Railways and is being
tackled through an active program of line strengthening. For the Project
itself, during project appraisal, a program of work for line strengthening in
the two principal Project corridors was agreed upon with the Indian Raili
(Annex 5-3). In addition, the GOI has agreed to provide required railway
facilities, so that the transport of all coal and finished products of the Project



- 18 -
will be timely and expeditiously carried out. A letter confirming these
undertakings has been sent to the Bank by GOI. As shown in Annex 5-3, most
of the required line strengthening works are already included in the Railway
Budget and Work Program. The remaining works in the Project's product and
coal corridors are relatively minor, consisting principally of additional
loops and signalling improvements to increase line capacity, except for the
last segment of the main corridor near Delhi (Bayanato Palwal), where additional
doubling of tracks may be necessary (Map IBRD 14853).
5.09       In addition to capacity constraints, maintaining an efficient level
of railway operations can be a major problem, since fertilizer traffic is
almost exclusively in one direction and there is often difficulty in finding
an adequate number of empty wagons close to the production sites. Also there
is an excessively long turnaround time for empty wagons, due to inadequate
terminal handling facilities and deficient telecommunications between marshal-
ling points and central control. In order to ensure a more efficient trans-
portation of inputs and outputs for the Hazira Project, rail movements will be
carried out by rakeloads (unit trains). Under this scheme, urea will be moved
only to a limited number of nodal points in different States, which have been
identified on the basis of proximity to centers of demand. To ensure a proper
planning of unit train operations, the Government of India set up a working
group that carried out a "Nodal Points Study." The study included estimation
of the likely volume of total fertilizer traffic from the West Coast ports and
fertilizer plants, identification of nodal points to which this traffic would
be moved, and assessment of the additional facilities that would be needed at
these nodal points for unloading and handling. These facilities will include
railway sidings, secondary road transport and storage. The Government is now
reviewing the results of the study, and has agreed to take appropriate actions
on fertilizer distribution and railway operations in the light of the Nodal
Points Study recommendations, to ensure the efficient movement as the Project's
inputs and outputs.
5.10      Road Transport.  The transportation of fertilizers in Gujarat State
(where the Project is located) will be by road. Since the project site is
close to Surat, an important commercial center where a large number of empty
trucks are normally generated, no problem is envisaged in finding the number
of trucks required for moving urea in the State. Road transport will also be
utilized for movements of fertilizer from the nodal points in the market area
to buffer storage and thence to the primary societies' godowns. In most
States, private and road transport is coordinated by road transport unions
which are organizations of the carriers themselves.  These unions help in
allocating traffic among the different operators and also try to minimize
empty haulage.
5.11      Ports.  Currently, over 35% of nitrogenous fertilizers required
(2.8 million product tpy) are imported.  In 1986/87, unless further production
capacity is added to that already planned, over 5 million product tons of
nitrogenous fertilizers (or about 28% of total demand) will have to be imported.
A major problem of all Indian ports is congestion; in several ports unloading



- 19 -
berths are not readily available, causing significant delays after ships
arrive. Greater emphasis has been given in recent years to importing fertilizer
in bulk, but facilities for bulk handling and port storage are unsatisfactory
in many of the ports and even where they exist, labor disputes often prevent
their full utilization. Bagging is carried out manually, resulting in a
significant proportion of underweight and damaged bags. The Government is
aware of the problem and efforts are being made to improve port operations,
including permitting some of the domestic fertilizer companies to import the
material directly and bag it under their control. The products of the proposed
Project are not intended to be moved by sea through any port.
5.12      Warehousing.  The main agencies engaged in the provision of storage
facilities for agricultural products as well as fertilizers are the Central
Warehousing Corporation (CWC), the State Warehousing Corporations (SWC)
and the cooperatives. In addition, a few fertilizer manufacturers, as well
as the Food Corporation of India (which is responsible for holding most of
the stock of imported fertilizers on behalf of the Central Fertilizer Pool),
maintain independent warehousing capacity.  In June 1979, the CWC h ad a
total warehousing capacity of 3.2 million tons, the SWC 5.1 million tons, and
the cooperatives 4.3 million tons (2.3 million tons at the district level and
2.0 million tons in rural areas), with an additional capacity of 1.2 million
tons under construction, in part with IDA assistance. About 25% of the
storage space in CWC and a higher percentage of that of the other organiza-
tions is utilized for fertilizer storage. To effect product distribution by
unit trains to nodal points, there will be a need for building significant
additional storage capacity as well as for constructing offloading facilities
to handle frequent rakehauls, railways sidings with platforms of the requisite
length and covered platform storage. It is understood that the CWC is prepared
to erect warehouses with such railway facilities in places where required
fertilizer storage amounts to at least 25,000 tons and such storage capacity
is contracted for a period of at least 10 years. Although no single fertilizer
manufacturer would be in a position to guarantee the need for 25,000 tons of
warehousing capacity at a nodal point, several producers jointly would require
and are expected to contract such storage capacity.
5.13      IFFCO's Storage Requirements.  Currently, IFFCO rents storage
space in some 270 warehouses with a total reserved storage capacity of
240,000 tons. Most of this space is located at or near railheads at market
centers from where the cooperative societies can be most conveniently fed.
For the Project's output, plant site storage is planned at 90,000 tons for
bulk (about 3 weeks production) and 6,000 tons for bagged material. At
full capacity, in 1986, IFFCO will require 426,000 tons of storage capacity in
the market area; the Statewise warehouse space requirements would be as
follows:  138,000 tons in Haryana; 133,000 tons in Punjab; 93,000 tons in
Madhya Pradesh; 49,000 tons in Uttar Pradesh; and 13,000 tons in Rajasthan.
No storage is required in Gujarat since the cooperatives will lift the mate-
rial directly from the plant. These estimates assume a warehouse turnover
of 2.25 times per year, which is considered reasonable. IFFCO intends to
rent the required storage space and no problem in securing such space is
anticipated; but IFFCO is prepared, should the need arise, to erect and
operate its own warehouse space in the field, principally as buffer storage to
cover unexpected needs.

D.   IFFCO's Sales and Marketing Efforts
5.14      IFFCO shareholders include about 27,000 cooperatives which distri-
bute IFFCO fertilizer to member farmers. However, because of the pyramidal
nature of the cooperative system in India, IFFCO deals only with the 20 Apex
Cooperatives that form the top echelon of the cooperative system. As discussed
in para. 5.04, these Apex Cooperatives lift the material from IFFCO warehouses,
rented by IFFCO from the Government-owned Central and State Warehousing
Corporations, and distribute it to the lower layers of the cooperative system.
Thus, the direct sales effort by IFFCO itself is relatively small and the
sales department's main function is to ensure that the material is distributed
on time to 270 railhead warehouses in accordance with the shipment plan agreed
upon with the Apex Cooperatives. These efforts have been successfully carried
out up to now. IFFCO's marketing division consists of 140 head office staff
(about 50 management and professionals) and 711 field employees. It is
currently adequately staffed and will be strengthened according to the needs
of the Project.
5.15       In addition to its sales department, IFFCO, like the other fertil-
izer producers, undertakes market development aimed at promoting the company's
products. This function contains some elements of extension, such as free
soil testing, seed treatment, insecticide use, agricultural advice, demon-
stration plots, farmers' meetings, seminars, etc. However, the manpower
resources which the fertilizer companies can bring to bear on this activity
are of necessity very much smaller than those of the State extension services.
Nevertheless, the extension work of the companies provides an important cata-
lytic effect on consumption, and the response in terms of increased fertilizer
consumption resulting from their activities is significant. IFFCO's marketing
division consists of a marketing director with five functional managers and
four zonal managers reporting to him (Annex 5-4). Functional managers include
those in charge of cooperative relations, marketing services (including train-
ing), marketing accounts, personnel and administration, and distribution and
transportation. In order to improve the control and supervision of field
activities, the marketing administration was recently decentralized and four
zonal offices established. These four zonal managers will supervise the 13
states marketing managers, who have under their control 32 area offices. Each
area office has a manager and an agronomist with about 10 field representatives.
E.   Agricultural Credit
5.16      Credit for fertilizers plays an important role in determining
fertilizer use. This credit is needed at two stages: (a) distribution
credit required by the marketing cooperatives in order to hold the stock,
and (b) farmers' credit required by the farmers in order to enable them
to invest in inputs until the harvest is sold.
5.17      Distribution Credit.  The sources of distribution credit are the
Central Fertilizer Pool and domestic manufacturers (33%), central cooperative
banks (31%), and commercial banks (36%). At present, distribution credit
covers only about 70% of the country's actual requirements and the maturities
of the credits are generally shorter than required. By 1986, the value of
fertilizer trade will be over Rs 31 billion (US$3.9 billion), and the



- 21 -
distribution credit needs will have risen to almost Rs 15 billion. About 60%
of these requirements will be for cooperatives. The Government is aware of
the need for adequate distribution credit and a number of measures have been
taken to make it more readily available; e.g., the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
is extending credit to the cooperatives that are unable to obtain credit
from commercial banks, and is now making funds available to Regional Rural
Banks which in turn make distribution credit available to cooperative socie-
ties (para 5.19).
5.18       Farmers Credits.  For the farmer, the main sources of credit are
the cooperative system, commercial banks, regional rural banks and private
money lenders. In 1979, 42% of the institutional direct finance for agricul-
ture came from Cooperative Primary Agricultural Credit Societies, 28% from
the Land Development Banks and about 30% from the commercial banks. The farm
credit needs of the cooperatives are met primarily by the RBI routing credit
through the Apex level and district level cooperative banks. Farm credit
requirements for fertilizers in 1980 were estimated at Rs 15,000 million
(US$1,900 million), assuming that 70% of fertilizer sales are made on credit.
The Government aims at substantially increasing credit available to the
agricultural sector, both for fertilizers and other purposes, by progressively
institutionalizing credit sources and by adopting a multi-agency approach.
Some years ago, difficulties arose with the system of crop credit due princi-
pally to the small size of many of the primary cooperatives and defaults among
members in repaying the loans. The problem was specially serious in the
States of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar. At present in all India, the
average number of cooperative loans not paid on time is about 43%, although
much of this money is recovered in the long run. Until recently, any society
which defaulted in loan repayments was not entitled to further advances,
resulting in a large number of societies becoming inoperative. In an effort
to revive such societies, small primary level societies are being reorganized
by integrating them into large units with a minimum credit activity of
Rs 200,000 in short-term loans. At this level of activity each society will
be able to employ a full-time secretary, will cover 2,500 families and be
located not more than 10 km from any farmer. Furthermore, in many States, the
cooperative structure is being overhauled by integrating village societies
into minibanks where a farmer can obtain, in one location, credit, agricultural
inputs and essential consumer goods.
5.19       The Government has for some time been encouraging the commercial
banks to extend their activities into areas where the cooperatives do not
operate, for instance, in extending credit to the larger farm owners whose
credit needs exceed the limit permitted by the cooperatives. Under-banked
areas will receive preference in the establishment of new bank branches.
To further strengthen the credit system, in 1975 the GOI set up regional
rural banks, and by early 1980, 48 regional rural banks with 1,400 branches
had been put into operation. These banks extend loans to small and marginal
farm owners, landless laborers and rural artisans for purchase of fertilizers
and other agricultural inputs. Furthermore, the GOI is currently reviewing
the desirability of setting up an Agricultural Development Bank to meet
specific credit needs in different areas. Although the past growth of fertil-
izer consumption does not seem to have been constrained by credit availability,
the GOI and RBI are aware of the need to strengthen the operations of credit
institutions and are taking measures with Bank support to ensure the adequate
and timely availability of agricultural credit.



- 22 -
F.   Agricultural Extension and Research
5.20      Extension service activities are essential to generate demand for
fertilizer in States that are using less fertilizers. Extension services
are carried out principally by the Agriculture Departments of the States,
with some guidance from the Central Government. The services are executed
through the Block Development Program, which aims at creating suitable condi-
tions and infrastructure for rural development. More than 112,000 people are
employed at the State Government level in extension in India. The extension
organization varies from State to State, but broadly speaking, each of the
5,000 Community Development Blocks in India is under the charge of a Block
Development Officer (BDO), who has under his supervision several Village Level
Workers (VLW), with each one of these VLW serving about 10 villages. In
addition to agricultural extension work, the VLW assists in animal husbandry,
public health, primary education and village saving schemes. Attached to
each Block are Extension Officers who are specialists in crop growing, plant
protection, animal husbandry, education, etc.
5.21      In order to improve the traditional system of extension services,
frequent and continuous follow-up by specialized technicians is necessary.
In the last few years, the Training and Visit System (T&V) has been introduced
in many states with IDA financial assistance. The scheme--which is based on
the provision of know-how at regular intervals from specialists to extension
workers who then transfer the know-how through visits to the farms--is being
expanded gradually since it requires a major reorganization of large numbers
of staff and the systematic development of their technical competence.
Nonetheless, progress in many States is encouraging; the reorganized extension
services in 9 States now cover 13 million farm families, while at full
development these services will cover almost 30 million farm families.
Efforts are under way to extend the system to other States and eventually
to all of India's 70 million farm families.
G.   Fertilizer and Product Prices
5.22      The retail and ex-factory prices of urea (and other nitrogenous
fertilizers) are statutorily controlled in India. A comparison of the retail
price to farmers (excluding local sales tax) with the import price of urea--on
the basis of import prices, CIF India, plus an allowance for port handling and
internal distribution but excluding import duties and taxes--is given in the
table in the following page. It shows that broadly domestic retail prices
have been quite close to import prices except during the abnormal conditions
in the international fertilizer market in 1974/75.
5.23      The incentive to the farmer to utilize fertilizer depends not
only on the price of fertilizer but also on the price he obtains for his
crops. Annex 5-5 presents an analysis of the historical movement of the price
of crops and fertilizer in terms of the amount of grain required to buy 1 kg
of nitrogen in the form of urea. It shows that since 1974, when the urea
price reached its peak, the amount of wheat or paddy needed to be sold by the
farmer to buy 1 kg of nitrogen has declined, and currently stands slightly
above 1971 levels. Studies on the yield response to fertilizer application
show that at current price levels, fertilizer use is profitable to farmers,



- 23 -
and that the economic optimum is reached with very much higher application
rates than are currently achieved, even in the Punjab, which records the
highest fertilizer usage of all Indian States.

5.24      The GOI recognizes that its ex-factory pricing policy determines
to a large extent the success of its fertilizer industry development strategy.
In 1976, it set up a committee charged with developing a rational ex-factory
pricing system which would (i) ensure the financial viability of the fertil-
izer plants; (ii) motivate the industry to invest in new plants; (iii) give
a strong incentive for the producing units to operate efficiently; and (iv)
ensure that the Government's subsidy to the farmers for fertilizer would not
in time become too large a burden on public finances. The Committee recom-
mended a system of "retention prices" which satisfied the above-mentioned
objectives. This system, introduced in November 1977, determines the ex-
factory price per ton of fertilizer for each producing unit so that, operating
at 80% capacity utilization, such unit obtains an annual 29% pre-tax return
on capital (para. 9.02). This policy ensures a satisfactory financial situa-
tion for the manufacturers and, at the same time, enables the authorities
to maintain low fertilizer prices for the farmers, at a reduced cost to
the public finances, by what amounts to a cross subsidization from old to new
fertilizer plants. The Government has agreed not to take or cause to be taken
any action which would prevent fertilizer manufacturers, under conditions of
efficient operation from meeting all their expenses, servicing their debts,
and earning a reasonable return on invested capital.

VI. THE PROJECT
A.   Project Location
6.01       The Project will be constructed on a 770-ha site at Hazira, Gujarat,
on the Northern bank of the River Tapti, about 15 km west of Surat (Map IBRD
14854). It is close to the planned port of Hazira, which the State Govern-
ment expects to expand into a major industrial area. The site was selected
following a survey and evaluation of five alternative sites in Gujarat,
which was carried out by a technical committee constituted by the Government
(Reference C-Project File), taking into consideration the sites, transporta-
tion, infrastructure and utility advantages, as well as their impact on
pollution and environmental aspects (paras. 6.15 to 6.19). The proposed
site is well located in between the Project's sources of raw materials and the
major fertilizer consuming states, i.e., 300 km north of the South Bassein
offshore gas fields and about 800 km south of the median marketing area. The
site is connected to the rest of the country by main roads and broad-gauge
railway lines. Its easy access to deep sea water will facilitate the trans-
portation of heavy equipment to the plant. Furthermore, the site is close to
large available water supply resources and power generation facilities. It
has ample space for expansion. On the basis of site soil investigation work
so far carried out by the Fertilizer Planning and Development India Ltd
(FPDIL), the soil bearing capacity is adequate for most foundation work,
requiring piling only for some heavy equipment.
6.02       The land required for the Project has been already acquired by
KRIBHCO.  About one quarter of this land was owned by the Government and the
remainder by about 250 farmers. The farmers have been fully compensated.
The land was under limited cultivation and had no permanent structures.
Acquisition did not require displacement of any residences.
B.   Project Scope and Technology
6.03       The proposed Project will be based on steam-reforming of non-
associated natural gas from the South Bassein fields. It will consist of:
(i) two single-train ammonia units with a capacity of 1,350 tpd each;
(ii) four urea units of 1,100 tpd each; (iii) three steam plants of 275
metric tons per hour each; (iv) two power units of 15 MW each; (v) ammonia
storage of 20,000 tons; (vi) urea bagging facilities and silos for 90,000 tons
of bulk storage; (vii) a township with 960 housing units; and (viii) offsite
facilities for workshops, gas terminal plant, water treatment plant, adminis-
tration building, laboratories and other facilities. The plant layout is
shown in Map IBRD 21236. On the basis of 330 days per year of operation, the
Project facilities would produce 1,306,800 tpy of urea at 90% of rated capac-
ity. The ammonia units would produce 17,820 tpy of ammonia in excess of that
required for urea production, which will be easily absorbed by IFFCO's Kandla
plants for the production of NPK.



- 25 -
6.04       The ammonia plants will be similar in capacity to the plants being
built for the Thal fertilizer project. They will be the largest steam-reforming
units in India, though similar capacity plants are successfully in operation
elsewhere. The ammonia process design will be based on the technology developed
by M. W. Kellogg Company of the US. The urea plants will be based on a total
recycle, ammonia constant pressure stripping process developed by Snamprogetti
(Italy).
C.   Gas Supply Arrangements
6.05       The discovery since 1974 of large offshore oil and gas fields
at Bombay High and Bassein represents a significant step in reducing India's
dependence on imported energy. At full production in the mid-1980s these
offshore fields, together with onshore deposits in Gujarat and Assam, are
expected to meet about 50% of India's petroleum requirements at that time.
With the Bank's assistance under Loans 1473-IN of June 1977 and 1925-IN of
December 1980, the Oil and Natural Gas Commission (ONGC) has been developing
the Bombay High field, and has completed oil and gas pipelines to the Bombay
area. Associated gas from this field is expected to reach about 2.7 million
Ncmpd by 1982, when oil production would reach its planned level of
12.0 million tpy. Since the requirements of actual and potential customers
for natural gas in the Bombay area alone already exceed expected associated
gas production, the Government is planning to develop the South Bassein
non-associated gas field. According to ONGC estimates and an independent
study carried out in 1978 by the consultants Degolyer and McNaughton (US), the
non-associated gas reserves at South Bassein are about 230 billion Ncm, of
which 60% is considered recoverable. These reserves are capable of maintaining
a production level of 18 million Ncmpd over a 20-year period and are thus
adequate to meet the Project's requirements of 2.8 million Ncmpd at full
production during its full economic life. A 300 km gas pipeline will be built
from South Bassein to Hazira (Map IBRD 13340) to satisfy the requirements of
the Project and the future needs of the Gujarat gas network (0.8 million
Ncpmd). Subsequently, this pipeline would be extended to the country's
interior to satisfy the requirements of additional fertilizer plants to be
installed there.
6.06       The Government has also requested Bank assistance for the South
Bassein development and pipeline project. On the basis of available information,
the gas project appears economically justified. Preliminary estimates of the
gas project indicates that it would cost about US$1,257 million in 1981 prices
and yield an economic rate of return of about 33%. This return is based on
a gas price in 1981 dollars of US$207 per thousand Ncm (i.e., US$5.50 per
million BTU)for 1983/84, wh-ch is equivalent to a fuel oil price of US$220 per
ton.   After 1984, gas prices are assumed to increase by 3.5% p.a. in real
terms (para. 10.04). On the basis of a return of 10% on investment, the
delivered production and transportation cost of gas to Hazira would be only
US$42 per thousand Ncm (or US$1.12 per million BTU). This low delivery cost
highlights the potential profitability of the South Bassein project. The
actual gas price to KRIBHCO will be determined by the Government on the basis
of parity with delivered local naphtha prices (about US$150/ton) and is
expected to be about US$128 per thousand Ncm (US$3.40 per million BTU), due to
the current relatively low naphtha pric-s in India.



- 26 -
6.07      The Government has already approved the execution of the South
Bassein gas project, and KRIBHCO has signed a long-term contract with ONGC for
the supply of gas. Further, the Government has agreed to execute the gas
development and pipeline project, as it relates to the Hazira Project, in
accordance with a schedule agreed upon with the Association and complete it
not later than January 31, 1984 unless otherwise agreed with the Association.
For this purpose, the Government will provide or cause to be provided as and
when needed, funds, facilities, services and resources for the timely execution
of this gas project.
D.   Coal Supply
6.08      The Project will require about 1,800 tpd of Grade I or II coal
(with 19%-27% ash and 0.3-0.7% sulphur content), to generate the process steam
required for the urea plant as well as for captive power generation. This
coal will be supplied from the Korea-Rewa and Pench coal fields in Madhya
Pradesh belonging to the Western Coal Fields Ltd, about 900 km from Hazira.
The use of coal-fired steam generation plants is consistent with the Govern-
ment's policy of promoting the use of local coal for power generation, while
encouraging the use of gas mainly as feedstock in fertilizers and petro-
chemicals. In the recent past, however, industrial coal users have experienced
difficulties in obtaining timely coal supplies, principally due to rail
transportation deficiencies and labor unrest at the coal mines. To minimize
this risk, the Project will have the flexibility to use gas as fuel in case of
coal shortages. An adequate coal storage area will be provided near the steam
generation plant. The site will also have a suitable area for ash disposal.
KRIBHCO has already signed a long-term contract with Western Coal Fields
Ltd, committing the supply of 540,000 tpy of Grade I or II coal, as required
by the boiler specifications, from the above-mentioned coal fields. During
Project appraisal, the Indian Railways confirmed that the transportation of
coal to the Project (about one unit train per day) should not pose major
difficulties, especially after the strengthening of the 300-km section from
Udhna to Jalgaon is completed by March 1984. The Government has agreed that
it will take measures to ensure the timely and adequate provision of railway
facilities for coal transportation.
E.   Power Supply
6.09      At full capacity, the Project will require 30.8 MW of power, which
will be almost entirely generated within the plant in order to permit con-
tinuous operations and avoid damage to equipment and catalysts by power
variations and shut-downs in the grid. The Project will include two in-plant
power generation units of 15 MW capacity each, capable of providing an average
of about 27 MW, which are sufficient to maintain the ammonia and urea units
in operation. The remaining 3.8 MW required by the Project will be provided
from the State grid. The 220-Kv sub-station at Vav, which belongs to the
Gujarat Electricity Board is about 30 km from the site and a double circuit
line of 66-Kv is expected to be laid by December 1981, from this station to
the site. KRIBHCO's share of the cost of this line is included in the project
cost. The Vav sub-station is supplied from both the Tarapur and Ukai power
plants and hence reasonably stable supply is assured. The State grid will be
capable of providing up to 20 MVA (i.e. about 17 MW) as stand-by power, in
case one of the project turbogenerators is not in operation.



- 27 -
6.10      During construction, the power needs of the Project will peak
in May 1983, at about 2.5 MW. This power requirement will be met by the
existing 22-Kv transmission line available in the area, supplemented by two or
more 250 KW diesel generator sets that IFFCO intends to bring from the recently
completed Phulpur project.   KRIBHCO has made arrangements with State and
Central Government authorities to (i) be able to generate captive power
and (ii) ensure adequate and timely power supplies from the State grid during
construction and operation. KRIBHCO has agreed to finalize an adequate
contract for the provision of power by the State, including emergency power,
by December 1981.
F.   Water Supply
6.11      At full operation, the estimated total water requirements of the
Project will be about 90,000 cubic meters per day (cmpd), or about 37 cubic
feet per second (cusecs). Although the Project will be located on the bank
of the Tapti River, the water of the river at that point is not suitable for
the Project because of its excessive salinity. Therefore, the Project's
water needs will be supplied by the Gujarat State Government from the irriga-
tion canal system based on the Ukai Dam, which taps the Tapti River 90 km
upstream. The Hazira branch of the canal, which passes through the edge of
the site, takes off from the main Ukai canal at a distance of 35 km from the
site; at that point its present capacity is 780 cusecs. The Hazira branch
will be widened to increase its capacity at the project site from 18 cusecs at
present to 65 cusecs, to meet the Project's requirements including possible
losses from the project reservoir.   The State Government intends to complete
the widening of the Hazira branch in the section needed by the Project by
December 1983, which is satisfactory for project operations. During construc-
tion, the Project will require about 1.5 cusecs, which will be supplied from
the existing flows of the Hazira branch. The State Government has confirmed
that the widening of the Hazira branch can be undertaken without interrupting
the flow of water to the Project. The Project will also contain a water
reservoir with a capacity of three weeks supply as well as adequate water
filtration and demineralization treatment facilities. Given the large avail-
ability of water resources of the region, water supply to the Project is not
anticipated to be a problem. KRIBHCO has already entered agreement with
Gujarat State to ensure that, the Project will be able to draw its water
requirements on a continuous basis from the Hazira branch canal systems, or
another satisfactory source.
G.   Other Infrastructure
6.12      Other important infrastructure for the Project includes the con-
struction of employees housing, a 35 km railway spur track between the site
and the main Western Railways' Bombay-Delhi and Central Railways' Udhna-Jalgaon
lines, the strengthening of the existing 15 km road to Surat, and the dredging
of a navigational channel in the Tapti River to bring heavy equipment to the
site. The Project includes construction of a township on the southern bank of
the Tapti River with 960 housing units which will also contain: a hotel,
shops, a school and a clinic. The construction of the railway spur is critical
for the movement of finished products and raw materials, especially coal.
Indian Railways has already completed the feasibility/engineering survey of
the spur line north of the Tapti River. The railway spur will be



- 28 -
directly connected at the Udhna junction to the Central Railways, in order to
avoid unnecessary overloading of the Bombay-Delhi line (see Map IBRD 14854).
Construction of the line has already been initiated and will take 24 months
to complete. Its total cost of US$19.8 million is included in the project cost
estimate.
6.13      The existing 15 km road from the site to Surat and the National
Highwav No. 8, is an asphaltic, all-weather road, but it is inadequate to
accommodate the heavy traffic during construction and operation of the
Project. The Gujarat State is, therefore, widening and strengthening this
road to 22 m with a view to complete it in time for the transportation of
equipment to the site, scheduled to start in mid-1982.   In connection with
the existing works for a cement factory, a navigational channel is currently
being dredged in the Tapti River by the Gujarat State Government. The chan-
nel, which will pass by the project site and will be utilized by the Project
for the transportation of heavy equipment to the site, is scheduled to be
completely dredged by December 1981. Should the channel not be available by
that time, alternative arrangements will be made by KRIBHCO in time, as needed
for the expeditious transportation of the equipment.
6.14      Since the infrastructure and utilities required for the Project are
substantial and since their execution is critical for the timely and efficient
implementation of the Project, the Government is taking steps to ensure that
the work of the various Central and State Government agencies be closely
coordinated. A high level committee (with the participation of the Ministry
of Chemicals and Fertilizers, IFFCO, the Indian Railways, and the State
Secretaries of Power, Industry, Public Works, Agriculture and Finance) has
been formed to coordinate and monitor the execution of the infrastructure
necessary for the Project. The Chairman of the Committee is the Chief Secre-
tary of the Gujarat State.
H.   Environmental Considerations
6.15      As mentioned, the proposed site was selected among several alterna-
tive locations in Gujarat State.  In early 1978, on the basis of economic,
infrastructure and environmental factors, IFFCO reviewed the desirability of
eleven sites in the State and subsequently recommended five possible sites
for the location of the Project. These recommendations were submitted to
the Government, which formed a Task Force to consider the proposed sites
from the environmental and pollution aspects. The Task Force consisted of
representatives of the National Committee on Environmental Planning and
Coordination, the National Department of Science and Technology, the Gujarat
Water Pollution Control Board, the National Environmental Engineering Research
Institute, the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers, the Central Board for
the Prevention and Control of Water Pollution, and the Indian Meteorological
Department.  The Task Force gave first preference to the Hazira location
(Reference C-Project File) and the site has been accepted by all concerned
parties. The Project will be built and operated in accordance with State
and local water pollution standards which are rigorous. Since currently
there are no Indian standards relating to air pollution, the Project will be
designed to meet WHO and US standards.



- 29 -
6.16      The major potential pollutants from the Project are:  (i) liquid
effluents from the process plant containing ammonia and urea, and from the
water treatment facilities; (ii) air pollutants consisting of urea dust
from the prilling towers and fly ash and sulphur dioxide from the coal-fired
boilers; and (iii) solid waste ash from the boilers. Regarding liquid
effluents, the plant will be designed and operated so as to minimize the
introduction of ammonia and urea into the plant's effluent stream. Effluents
from the process plant will be hydrolyzed to decompose the urea into carbon
dioxide and ammonia which will be recycled into the plant. The liquid effluent
will be carried out by a submarine pipeline to the open sea away from the
coast where strong currents of 2 to 5 knots will facilitate the easy mixing
and dilution of effluents. The effluents from the water treatment plant
and other waste streams will be treated, neutralized and used for pumping the
ash slurry.
6.17      Regarding air pollution, the major potential pollutants will origi-
nate from the burning of 1,800 tpd of coal, containing high ash and 0.3-0.7%
sulphur, in the boiler plants. The coal-fired boilers will be fitted with
an appropriate stack of about 100 meter height and electrostatic precipitators
to minimize fly ash dust ejected into the atmosphere. Sulphur dioxide emis-
sions are not to exceed Bank guidelines (Reference E-Project File). The
urea dust, which escapes from the urea prilling towers into the atmosphere,
will be no more than 40 mg of urea per Ncm through the use of a natural
draft-prilling tower. Flue gas from the gas reforming furnace and boilers
(containing hydrogen, carbon monoxide, methane and ammonia) will be discharged
without adverse impacts through stacks of suitable height. Wind direction to
Surat is relatively favorable since the annual mean frequency of occurrences
of winds from the site to Surat is about 25%.
6.18      The solid waste from the plant will consist principally of ash
from the coal-fired boilers and the electrostatic precipitators. The ash will
be disposed of in fallow and impervious areas that are available within
the project site. The pond area contains clays which provide adequate seepage
control. Precautions will be taken to prevent drainage of wastes into water
courses. Safety and fire precautions under the Project will also meet ade-
quate local standards which are acceptable to the Association.
6.19      To assist in the design of environmental measures and to ensure
their proper implementation, KRIBHCO has engaged environmental consultants.
KRIBHCO will build and operate the Project in accordance with environmental
standards satisfactory to the Association and set up adequate monitoring
stations to collect relevant information on meteorological conditions (includ-
ing wind direction and wind speed) and base pollution levels. KRIBHCO has
also agreed to employ a competent Environmental Officer to coordinate these
activities.
VII. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND EXECUTION
A.   Project Management
7.01      Since KRIBHCO--the owner of the Project--has only recently been
formed, IFFCO and the Government agreed that IFFCO would be responsible for
project preparation and for ensuring that KRIBHCO is adequately organized and



- 30 -
staffed for the project implementation period. To fulfill this responsibility,
IFFCO has transferred to KRIBHCO about 55 professional staff representing the
major part of the project team that was responsible for the recently completed
Phulpur project. Many members of this project team have also worked on the
Kalol and Kandla projects. The Kalol project (910 tpd ammonia by natural gas
reforming and 1,200 tpd urea) was implemented between July 1971 and January
1975 with USAID and ODA financing, under lump-sum turn key contracts with
foreign engineering firms. The IFFCO project team was assisted in the
project management of the Kalol project by a 10-man team from Cooperative
Fertilizers International (CFI) of the U.S. The Phulpur project (900 tpd
ammonia by naphtha reforming, 1,500 tpd urea, 3 x 125 tph coal fired boilers
and one 12.5 MW turbo generator) now in production was implemented under fixed
price contracts for engineering and procurement services, with other costs
reimbursable. Although the Phulpur project experienced schedule delays and
minor cost overruns (para. 2.14), the IFFCO project team acted energetically
and effectively after identifying problems in order to minimize the ensuing
delays. The project team has considerable experience in project implementation
and operation and has performed satisfactorily on previous projects. The
Executive Director and Project Manager of KRIBHCO worked in those capacities
in both the Kalol and Phulpur projects and are considered well qualified for
these key positions.
7.02      The proposed project implementation organization is shown in
Annex 7-1. The overall coordination of the Hazira Project with the process
foreign engineering firms, the local engineering consultants and other con-
tractors will rest with KRIBHCO's project authorities, who will have direct
responsibility for project implementation. Project groups will supervise
the ammonia plants and urea plants under the Project Manager and the steam,
power and offsites under the Utilities Manager. Each group will be respon-
sible for the management of the respective engineering contracts, including
the control, monitoring and reporting of cost, schedules and quality. These
groups will also coordinate construction with the Engineering Department
which will have responsibility for all construction activities, inspection,
spare parts ordering, supply of external utilities (power, water and gas) and
technical support to the project groups.   All arrangements for import and
receipt of equipment and materials will be handled by the Materials Manage-
ment Group. Inland transportation and site unloading will be the responsi-
bility of the Transportation Manager. Cost control will be exercised by the
Finance Group, with inputs from the other departments. A separate monitoring
and reporting group will coordinate the reports from the individual depart-
ments and report to the Executive Director on the status of the overall
project schedule. KRIBHCO has already issued a detailed Project Implemen-
tation Manual in January 1980, and will submit an updated version by
June 30, 1981 for review by IDA. In order to facilitate project control and
monitoring, KRIBHCO has agreed to install or cause to be installed a
computerized control and monitoring system to cover material status, cost
control and construction scheduling for the Project, such system to be
operative by September 30, 1981.



- 31 -
B. Engineering and Transfer of Technology
7.03      Engineering agreements have been finalized on a fixed price basis
for the supply of engineering, procurement services, construction supervision
and technical supervision of commissioning for the ammonia, urea , steam,
power and offsite plants. The M. W. Kellogg Company (US) has been
selected as engineering contractor for the ammonia plants. Kellogg is an
international leader in ammonia engineering and construction with some 50% of
current world ammonia capacity in approximately 130 plants in operation based
on Kellogg technology. It has engineered and constructed three 1,350 tpd
ammonia plants (the size selected for Hazira), of which two in Mexico have
been in successful, stable operation for some time and the other in Ireland
has recently started production. Kellogg has experience of Indian conditions
through the engineering and construction of the IFFCO 900 tpd ammonia plants
at Kalol and Phulpur, completed in October 1974 and March 1980 respectively.
It is considered to be an excellent engineering company with a good record for
project cost and schedule control. Kellogg has engaged "Fact Engineering and
Design Organization" (FEDO) of India as a sub-contractor to carry out detailed
engineering procurement services for non-critical equipment and construction
supervision assistance. Although FEDO is not experienced in projects of this
size, and the Project will absorb a major portion of FEDO's manpower, arrange-
ments have been made that satisfactorily minimize the risks to the Project
arising from these factors.  These arrangements include (i) minimization of
the FEDO work load in the key area of procurement services, and by substantial
duplication of a previous Kellogg plant; (ii) the clear placement in Kellogg
of responsibility for FEDO work as regards both quality and schedule, and
(iii) a commitment by FEDO to KRIBHCO to ensure adequate manning of the FEDO
project task force. The contract for the urea plant is on a similar basis
with Snamprogetti (Italy) as the foreign contractor and Fertilizer Planning
and Development India Ltd. (FPDIL) as the local contractor. In view of the
considerable experience of FPDIL in similar projects, Snamprogetti and FPDIL
have formed a consortium for the work to be carried out in India. Snamprogetti
is a highly experienced urea contractor with recent experience in India. The
arrangements are acceptable. The coal-fired boilers have been ordered from
Foster Wheeler Power Products Ltd (UK) on a fixed price basis that covers both
supply and erection. Development Consultants Ltd (India) have been selected
as contractors responsible for the power plant, coal and ash handling system
and other offsites.
7.04      The contracts between Kellogg and FEDO, and Snamprogetti and FPDIL
specify arrangements for the transfer of process design knowledge and such
relevant information necessary for FEDO and FPDIL to enable them to design and
engineer future ammonia and urea plants respectively in India with minimal
expatriate assistance.
C.   Employment and Training
7.05      The Project is expected to employ about 5,000 people during construc-
tion and 1,400 people on a permanent basis at full operation. Arrangements
for the supply and training of operating personnel are based on the system
used by IFFCO for the Phulpur project. A number of key operations personnel
have been assigned to fill project execution positions; trainees will then be



- 32 -
recruited by KRIBHCO and trained in the IFFCO operating plants taking as many
entrants as possible from the project execution area so that skilled operators
and maintenance technicians with at least one year's training are available
for the Project. Semi-skilled and unskilled personnel will be locally recruited,
with training provided at the project site before project completion. KRIBHCO
has agreed that it will develop, before June 30, 1982, a satisfactory training
and recruitment plan for its operating staff.
D.   Project Schedule
7.06      The overall project schedule is given in Annex 7-2.  The first
ammonia stream with its two associated urea plants and necessary offsites are
planned to be mechanically completed by July 1984--39 months from the project
zero date of April 1, 1981. Commissioning is expected to take a further
three months. The second ammonia plant with the remaining two urea plants and
the remaining offsites are scheduled for mechanical completion 12 months after
the first phase, giving an overall project schedule of 51 months to mechanical
completion and 54 months to the start of normal operations. Considering the
work already accomplished, and the considerable implementation experience of
the KRIBHCO project team, the schedules for the ammonia plants and urea
plants are considered achievable. In fact, these schedules already include a
contingency element to take account of local conditions and the complex
project infrastructure. Similar projects in Japan, US and Western Europe are
normally implemented in 24 to 28 months, rather than 39 months. Although the
Hazira schedules are about one-third longer than comparable schedules in the
developed countries, they are realistic in India due to unforeseeable delays
experienced in other projects in the past. These schedules are more conser-
vative than the schedules guaranteed by Kellogg and Snamprogetti/FPDIL in the
respective ammonia and urea contracts which also incorporate bonus/penalty
formulae for early or late completion. The guarantee completion dates are
subject, however, to revision in the light of events outside the contractors
control--such as late equipment delivery. Problems in coordination and
supervision are not expected to be significant due to the phasing between the
two streams. The schedule for the power generation and offsites is reasonable.
The three-month commissioning period for each stream is considered acceptable
in light of the KRIBHCO team's previous success in meeting similar schedules
on other projects and considering that precommissioning activities are scheduled
to begin three months prior to mechanical completion.
7.07      The implementation schedule for the Project is reasonable, the
different activities on it have been well planned, and the proposed measures
to carry out the Project are satisfactory. However, the Bank's experience in
India is that unexpected problems and delays are normally encountered. Given
the complexity of the Project, there will be a need during project execution
for concerted efforts by project authorities and IDA to review project progress
closely to ensure that the plans are properly carried out. In this regard,
the Project would require above-normal IDA supervision efforts, particularly
in its initial phases.

VIII. CAPITAL COST, FINANCING PLAN, PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENTS
A.   Project Capital Cost
8.01       The total financing requirements of the Project, including physical
contingencies, price escalation, working capital and interest during construc-
tion are estimated at US$1,276.9 million equivalent (Rs 10,215 million), of
which about US$475.7 million equivalent (Rs 3,805 million) will be in foreign
exchange. This estimate includes the infrastructure investments for the rail
spur to the national railway system, KRIBHCO's share of the cost of access
roads, power supply, and widening of the water supply canal; but excludes the
cost of the natural gas pipeline to the plant, which is to be financed and
executed separately. The capital cost breakdown by project components is given
in Annex 8-1 and summarized below:

8.02       The base cost estimate, in January 1981 prices, was prepared by
Bank staff and is derived from KRIBHCO estimates prepared on the basis of
actual quotations for equipment and materials received for the IFFCO steam-
reforming fertilizer plant at Phulpur (Loan 1079-IN) after making suitable
adjustments for changes in price levels, foreign exchange rates, process
differences, and scale of operations (Project File - Reference F). Except
for the steam plant and foreign engineering services (which are set at a firm
price), price escalation for all other project items is based on (i) a project
construction period of 39 months for the first ammonia-urea train and 51
months for the second train from the zero date of April 1, 1981, when the
ammonia and urea engineering contracts are expected to be effective;
(ii) placement of most orders for major equipment and supplies by January
1982; and (iii) international and local annual inflation rates in US Dollar
terms of 10.5% in 1980, 9% in 1981, and 8% in 1982, 7% per year in 1983-85,
and 6% thereafter. Working Capital was estimated at US$160.5 million equivalent
using conservative assumptions on the level of current assets required by the
Project during initial operations (Annex 8-2). Interest During Construction
was estimated assuming (i) capitalization of interest up to June 1985, when
all plant facilities are expected to become fully operational; (ii) Government
equity paid first and Government loans last; and (iii) loans of US$400 million
from the Bank, US$203.2 million from OECF and ODA, and US$93.0 million from
TDBI on terms specified in paras. 8.06-8.07.
8.03      The capital cost estimate for the Hazira Project was cross-checked
by the Bank staff with estimates for similar projects outside India. The
base cost estimate is slightly higher than for similar projects elsewhere
and is considered adequate at the current project stage. A definitive capital
cost estimate will be available by April 1982 when detailed engineering
work is advanced.
B.   Financing Plan
8.04      On the basis of the above capital cost estimate, the financing plan
for the Project agreed upon with the Government and IFFCO is shown on the
following page. Detailed terms of each financing source are given in Annexes
9-1 and 9-5.
8.05       The Project's long term financing needs will be met by external
equity contributions totalling the equivalent of US$437.5 million (36% of
total), internal cash generation of US$80.6 million (7%)1/, and long-term
debt of US$696.2 million (57%). In addition, short-term debt for working
capital purposes will amount to US$62.6 million. The Government will con-
tribute US$287.5 million in equity funds (66% of the equity). IFFCO will
pay-in US$125.0 million in equity (representing 28% ownership), from internal
cash flow generated from its ongoing operations at Kandla, Kalol and Phulpur.
Several local marketing cooperative societies will contribute the remaining
6% of the equity or US$25.0 million. The Government is interested in fostering
as large a participation of the cooperative institutions in KRIBHCO as possible.
The By-Laws of KRIBHCO, therefore, provide for the eventual partial or full
retirement of the shares held by the Government
l/   To help finance working capital needs after Project start-up.

and IFFCO in KRIBHCO as may be agreed periodically between them and the
concerned shareholders. Since the collection of equity funds from the
cooperatives may not proceed in step with the Project's requirements,
the Government has agreed that it will promptly make available to KRIBHCO
additional equity funds to cover any shortfalls in the contribution from the
IFFCO and the cooperatives.
8.06      The proposed IDA credit of US$400 million equivalent will be made
di.rectly to the Government. The Government will relend the funds to KRIBHCO
at an annual interest rate of 10.75% with a repayment over 15 years including
5 years of grace.  The Government will bear the exchange risk.   The proposed
IDA Credit of US$400 million would cover about 33% of the estimated long term
financing requirements.



- 36 -
8.07      The remaining debt financing for the Project will be provided as
follows: The Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF - Japan), Yen 20
billion, equivalent to about US$98.7 million; the Overseas Development Admin-
istration (ODA - UK), e 45 million, equivalent to US$104.5 million of which
US$67.4 million equivalent will be in Pounds Sterling and US$37.1 million in
Rupees; and a consortium of local financial institutions led by the Industrial
Development Bank of India (IDBI), US$93.0 million equivalent in Rupees. The
loan from IDBI will be made directly to KRIBHCO, with the guarantee of the
Government, at an interest rate of 11.8% p.a. for 15 years, including 5 years
of grace. The loans from ODA and OECF will be made to the Government, which
will make the foreign exchange equivalent of these two loans available to the
Project. The Rupee equivalent of this foreign financing of US$203.2 million
equivalent will be channelled to KRIBHCO partly through direct Government general
lending (about US$137.5 million at 10.75% p.a.) and partly through additional
lending by IDBI (about US$65.7 million). IDBI's total lending in Rupees to
KRIBHCO will therefore amount to US$150.7 million equivalent.
8.08       The Project was appraised simultaneously by all colenders and the
various loans are likely to be considered for approval at about the same time.
Given that the Government's budget and foreign exchange reserves are large
enough to cover any gap temporarily caused by a delay in securing the external
loans, the risk of delay in disbursement under the IDA credit, which is
inherent in formal conditions of cross-effectiveness with other lenders, is
not warranted. Therefore, the effectiveness of the proposed credit will not
be conditional on the signing of the other loans. Similarly, loans from other
colenders are not expected to be conditional on the effectiveness of the
proposed IDA credit. However, the Government has agreed that it will provide
or cause to be provided necessary funds and foreign exchange resources to
cover any gap in the financing plan as well as any cost overrun.
C.   Procurement and Disbursement
8.09      Equipment financed by the IDA credit will be procured by international
competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with IDA guidelines, except for
equipment proprietary to the process design, items whose supply is critical
to efficient project execution, and small items estimated to cost less than
US$100,000 which may be procured through limited international tendering from
qualified suppliers from at least three IDA member countries, according to a
li.st of goods to be agreed upon with the IDA. The aggregate of such con-
tracts under the IDA credit procured without ICB procedures will not exceed
US$40 million equivalent. For purposes of bid evaluation under ICB, qualified
local suppliers will enjoy a margin of preference of 15% or the applicable
duty, whichever is lower. The IDA credit will also be used to finance the
local engineering costs for the ammonia, urea, steam and offsite plants. As
part of the process of developing an agreed vendors list, KRIBHCO has agreed
to complete by June 30, 1981--before the issuance of bidding documents and
with the assistance of IFFCO--a survey of the available capacities of local
equipment suppliers to determine whether local firms presently expected to bid
under the Project would be able to deliver the goods on time. ODA funds will
be utilized to finance items already ordered from UK and Indian suppliers,
i.e., the steam plant and related facilities. OECF funds will be used to



- 37 -
finance equipment for the ammonia plant  procured under OECF's selective
bidding procedures from Japan, India and qualified developing countries.
KRIBHCO's equity and the IDBI loan will be used to cover the cost of civil
works, erection services and minor equipment not suitable for international
procurement which will be procured under local competitive bidding procedures
acceptable to the Association.
8.10       The proposed allocation of funds from the various colenders to
project components is detailed in Annex 8-3, and that from the IDA credit is
summarized below:

Equipment, Materials and Spares             320.0             100% of foreign ex-
penditures and 100% of

(ex-factory). Alter-

items, 70% of expenditures

Total                                 400.0
8.11       Of the US$400 million IDA credit, it is expected that US$161 million
will be used to finance imported equipment, US$45 million for foreign and
local engineering services for the Project and US$194 million (or about 48%
of the IDA credit) for local equipment procured by international competitive
bidding. The IDA credit would retroactively finance up to US$15 million of
eligible expenditures for engineering consulting services incurred after
October 1, 1980. Such retroactive financing is necessary to avoid delays in
project execution and to avoid creating a gap in the financing of direct
foreign exchange cost. The IDA credit is expected to be completely disbursed
by June 30, 1986. A disbursement schedule is given in Annex 8-4.
IX. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A.   Revenues and Operating Costs
9.01       Key assumptions used in the financial analysis are given in Annex 9-1.
It is assumed that the first stream of ammonia and urea plants will start
commercial production in October 1984, 42 months after effectivness of the



- 38 -
engineering contract for the ammonia plant in April 1981; the second stream
will begin commercial operations *twelve months later.  The plants are expected
to operate at 60% capacity utilization in the first 12 months of operation,
80% in the second year and 90% thereafter. At 90% capacity utilization, the
Project will produce 801,900 tpy of ammonia, of which 784,080 tpy will be
converted to 1,306,800 tpy of urea, and the remaining 17,820 tpy will be sold
to IFFCO's Kandla compound fertilizer plant.
9.02       For the financial analysis, urea ex-factory prices have been cal-
culated according to the price formula established by the Government under
the current fertilizer pricing policy. The price formula sets the urea
ex-factory price--i.e., "retention" price--at a level needed to enable pro-
ducers, operating efficiently at 80% capacity, to generate sufficient cash to
cover production costs and obtain a 29% before tax return on capital
(Annex 9-2). Under the formula, capital employed in the business is defined
for a 3-year pricing period as share capital plus retained earnings, minus
capital employed outside the business and accumulated surplus cash. Since
accummulated surplus cash may increase faster than retained earnings, the
formula could cause retention prices to decrease over time. In order to put a
floor to these decreases, the pricing formula establishes that "employed
capital" cannot decrease below share capital. For the Hazira Project, since
no increases in share capital are scheduled after 1989 and since after 1987
accumulated surplus cash is greater than retained earnings, the provision on
the lower limit applies, and the capital employed in business is set at share
capital. It thus stays constant in current terms, but decreases in constant
prices. This reduction in retention prices is to some extent compensated by
increases in production costs due to inflation. For the Hazira Project, the
retention price in current terms is projected to grow at an average of 2% per
year over the project life. In real terms, however, the retention price and
therefore project revrenues will decline over the project life. The formula,
however, will always allow the Project to cover its costs and earn an annual
29% before tax return on capital, provided it is operating efficiently at
satisfactory capacity utilization (80%). Excess ammonia for sale is limited
and its ex-factory price has been assumed at 90% of the urea retention price.
The table on the following page compares the calculated urea ex-factory price
in current and constant terms with projected urea economic prices (para. 10.03).

a/ These economic prices were derived on the basis of natural gas prices
of US$1.0 to US$3.00 per million BTU in 1981 terms. With the recent
policy changes in the U.S. regarding gas deregulation, urea economic
prices may be higher in the future.

9.03       The production costs of ammonia and urea are given in Annex 9-3,
and summarized below. The costs of inputs have been estimated on the basis of
IFFCO's contracts with its major suppliers. These are public companies and
the input prices have been assumed to keep pace with inflation. Natural gas
and depreciation represent about 80% of total operating costs for urea. The
unit cost for natural gas has been estimated on the basis of ONGC's announced
policy which relates the gas price to the local price of naphtha on a calorific
basis (para. 6.06). Depreciation has been computed by the straight line
method, assuming a project economic life of 12 years.

B.   Financial Projections
9.04       Detailed financial projections for the Project in current Rupees
are given in Annex 9-4 and summarized on the following page.
9.05       Due to the combined effects of the retention price formula and
the build-up of capacity utilization, the project revenues are expected to
increase rapidly in current terms during the first four years of operations,
from Rs 1,029 million in 1985 (fiscal year ending June 30) to Rs 4,396 million
in 1987 and stabilize thereafter. Operating profit is expected to increase
from Rs 295 million in 1985 to Rs 1,704 million in 1989, but decline steadily
thereafter to Rs 1,309 million in 1994, due to increases in production
costs associated with inflation. Net profit before tax is also expected to
show a similar trend during the project life, increasing from Rs 267 million
in 1985 to Rs 1,283 million in 1990, and thereafter declining to Rs 1,134
million in 1994. As detailed in Annex 9-1, the Project will benefit from

investment tax credits and tax holidays under the Indian tax laws so that tax
liabilities are expected to be postponed until 1990. Net profit after taxes,
which is expected to increase from Rs 267 million in 1985 to Rs 1,230 million
in 1989, would decrease rapidly after 1989 and reach only Rs 377 million in
1994, the tenth year of operations. Profits and cash flow, however, will
always remain positive.
9.06        The Project is expected to generate a large amount of cash early in
its economic life, with accumulated cash surplus increasing from Rs 458
million in 1985 to Rs 5,496 million in 1994. In our analysis, this cash
surplus is not assumed to be reinvested and generate earnings. In practice,
KRIBHCO is likely to reinvest this cash in new projects, in securities, or
reduce its debt burden. To that extent, the financial projections presented
here are conservative.



- 41 -
9,07       The pricing formula would enable the Project to generate sufficient
revenues to meet all its operating expenses and debt service obligations
(Annex 9-5). The debt service coverage ratio is expected to increase from 2.1
in 1985 to 2.5 in 1990, and stabilize thereafter at around 2.8 during the
project life. The current ratio excluding excess cash is expected to remain
at about 2.5 after 1985. The debt to equity ratio is expected to peak at
58:42 in 1985, decrease steadily thereafter to reach 8/92 in 1994. Therefore,
in spite of declining revenues and profits, the Project is expected to remain
in a satisfactory financial situation throughout its life and should be able to
pay yearly dividends of 6% of share capital in 1988 and 10% thereafter. As
mentioned, the objective of the retention price formula--in addition to
ensuring a satisfactory financial situation of producers--is to motivate the
industry to invest in new plants (para 5.24), by providing adequate returns.
This is achieved by cross-subsidization between new and old plants, with the
resulting decline in the cash flow and profits of producers in their outer
years.
C.   Financial Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis
9.08       The base case financial rate of return (before tax), on the basis
of the above assumptions, is calculated at 9.1% in constant Rupees. This
-low financial rate of return, compared to the economic rate of return of
16.6% (para. 10.05) is due to the retention price formula under which the
urea ex-factory price decreases over time in constant Rupees. Sensitivity
tests have been conducted to determine the effects of variations in capital
costs, production costs, capacity utilization and delay in project completion.
As shown on the following page, the financial return is not sensitive to
changes in capital and operating costs since the retention price formula has
been designed to ensure, under efficient operation, that the Project will
cover its costs and earn a return on capital.
9.09       The return is most sensitive to a decline in capacity utilization.
Indeed, the retention price formula assures that most of the adverse effects
are to a great extent compensated by increases in the retention price,
except for capacity utilization. Since the Project will be (i) based on
commercially proven technology, (ii) implemented and operated by personnel
with experience in this field, and (iii) assured of a large enough market for
the plant's products, the Project should operate at relatively high capacity
utilization, and therefore it should not encounter major financial difficulties
during its operation, provided the retention price formula is maintained in
the future.
D.   Financial Covenants
9.10       The Government has agreed to provide KRIBHCO adequate funds including
capital cost overruns, to complete the Project. Agreement has been reached
with KRIBHCO that it will follow prudent financial practices, and will:
(a) maintain at all times a long-term debt to equity ratio of 60:40 or better;
(b) maintain a current ratio of at least 1.2 at and after project completion;
(c) not to incur additional debt in any fiscal year if by so doing the pro-
jected debt service coverage ratio (as agreed with the Association) would fall
below 1.4; (d) not take any action, such as distribution of dividends, entrv

excess of US$10 million in any year (except for maintenance purposes) without
prior approval of the Association. KRIBHCO will submit monthly progress
reports on the Project and its annual audited reports within six months of
the ending of its fiscal year in a form satisfactory to the Association.
E.   Major Risks
9.11      The Project faces four major potential risks.  First, since it is a
green-field plant, delays or problems in the implementation of the Project and
its infrastructure could seriously affect the Project viability. In partic-
ular, delays in the execution of the engineering work will affect the implemen-
tation schedule. Also, any major delays by the Government in executing the
South Bassein gas development and pipeline project may place the supply of
gas in the critical path of the project schedule. These ri.sks have been
reduced to satisfactory levels, by securing the necessary Government approvals
on the gas project prior to IDA's Board consideration of the Project.
Also the signing of the engineering contract for the ammonia plants has now
been executed. Risks of delays during project execution are not unduly severe,
since the project sponsor has already: (i) acquired the project site;
(ii) engineering surveys for the railway sidings have been completed by the
Indian Railways and civil work has already started; (iii) work on water and
power supply from the State will be initiated immediately since the contracts
are already signed and corresponding payments made; and (iv) with the award
of steam generation plant and engineering contracts, the Project can be
expected to avoid delays in ini.tial implementation stages often faced by other
projects in India and elsewhere. The establishment of a high level committee
to monitor and coordinate the execution of infrastructure will assist in
ensuring that the Project infrastructure will be executed in a timely and
efficient manner (para. 6.14).
9.12      The second risk facing the Project concerns possible delays in
the commercial start-up of the plant, due to technical problems in the commission-
ing of this large fertilizer complex. This risk is reduced by the fact that
the Project will use commercially proven technologies (supplied by internation-
ally recognized engineering firms). Furthermore, KRIBHCO's project staff,
who will implement this Project, has been recruited from IFFCO's Phulpur
project team, which is experienced in the erection and start-up of a similar,
though somewhat smaller plant. Finally, agreement will be reached with
KRIBHCO on the preparation of an appropriate training and recruitment plan for
operating staff.



- 43 -
9.13       The third major risk concerns possible cost overruns.  This could be
caused by a start-up delay, by problems in the construction and transportation
of the large pieces of equipment needed for a plant of this size or by unfore-
seen problems in the civil works and erection of the plant. The successful
experience of IFFCO in implementing its other projects, should lower this
risk. Furthermore, this risk is reduced by the location of the Project near
the ocean, where the bulk of equipment can be unloaded and barged through the
mouth of the Tapti river to the plant site. Finally, considering the complexity
and size of the Project and that KRIBHCO is a new organization only now being
set up, the Project could face major management risks. The Government therefore
intends to ensure continuity of efficient senior management of KRIBHCO.
Overall, the risks associated with the Project are considered acceptable.
X. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A.   Economic Costs and Benefits
10.01      The assumptions used in the economic analysis of the Project are
given in Annex 10-1. All economic costs and benefits for tradeable items
have been valued at international prices estimated to prevail during the
economic life of the Project. For non-tradeable items, domestic prices have
been taken and, where applicable, adjusted to reflect the economic prices of
their internationally traded components.
10.02      The economic capital cost of the Project was obtained by deflating
the financial capital cost in current prices to January 1981 prices, using
appropriate currency deflation factors and after deducting import duties and
local taxes on equipment and other items. Since Hazira is a green-field
project, its capital cost includes the cost of required infrastructure,
including the township, the railroad siding from Udhna to the project site,
power generation and distribution and KRIBHCO's share of the water supply
channel. The only infrastructure facility financed by another agency is the
gas pipeline (ONGC). Since the gas prices charged to the Project include the
full cost of their delivery to the project site, no further adjustment for
deriving economic capital costs is necessary.
10.03      For calculating economic benefits, the future price of bagged urea,
FOB Europe, is assumed to increase from the current level of US$228/ton
to US$267/ton in 1984 (fiscal year ending June 30), US$287/ton in 1985 and
US$302/ton in 1990 (all prices in January 1981 constant dollars). These
prices reflect expected future increases of 3.5% per year in energy costs as
well as a more balanced demand and supply situation for urea in the mid-1980s.
Including the international freight to India (estimated at around US$50/ton),
unloading, port handling and storage charges (US$5/ton), and inland freight
from Bombay to the Project site (US$7/ton), the economic ex-factory price (in
January 1981 dollars) of bagged urea is calculated at US$318/ton for 1984,
rising to US$373/ton by 1990. The FOB Europe price of ammonia in 1984 is
assumed to be US$240/ton (90% of bagged urea price) and with marine freight to
India of US$40/ton, unloading charges of US$5/ton, and inland freight of
US$7/ton, the economic ammonia price is assumed at US$292/ton (in 1981 dollars).
As is the case with urea, this ammonia price is assumed to increase gradually
during the 1980s reaching US$340/ton by 1990.



- 44 -
10.04     The economic price of non-associatged natural gas is assumed to be
the cost of substituting gas for fuel oil in steam generation and has thus
been related to the fuel oil price based on its calorific value. On the basis
of a CIF fuel oil price in India of US$220/ton in 1984 (in January 1981
dollars), the economic price of natural gas in 1984 is calculated at US$207
per thousand Ncm, i.e., US$5.50 per thousand standard cubic feet (Scf) (in
1981 dollars). Thereafter the economic price of natural gas is assumed to
increase at a real rate of 3.5% per year, reaching, US$250 per thousand Ncm by
1990. The sensitivity analysis also includes the case where the gas price is
assumed to be at the level that would ensure a reasonable return (10%) on
investment in the gas project. On this basis, the delivered cost of gas to
Hazira would be only US$42 per thousand Ncm (US$1.12 per thousand Scf). All
other tradeable and non-tradeable items are valued at their respective domestic
prices, after adjusting for local taxes and duties.
B.   Economic Rate of Return
10.05     The base case economic rate of return has been calculated at 16.6%
The cash flows for the economic rate of return are given in Annex 10-2 and
the results of sensitivity analysis are graphically shown in Annex 10-3 and
summarized below.
Hazira - Economic Rate of Return - Sensitivity Analysis
(in percent)
Base Case                                               16.6
Capital Costs up 10%                                    15.0
Operating Costs up 10%                                  14.2
Capacity Utilization down by 10%                        13.9
Delay of Completion by 1 year                           13.7
Economic Product Prices down 10%                        12.3
Economic Product Prices up 10%                          20.5
Gas Price Increases 20%                                 12.8
Gas Price assumed at US$42/thousand Ncm                 27.2
10.06     The economic rate of return is sensitive to changes in product
prices and, to a lesser extent, operating costs. The difference between
the financial rate of return and economic rate of return is mainly due to the
difference between the financial price for urea, based on the retention price
formula and the forecast international urea price. Although the economic cost
of gas (US$207-250 per thousand Ncm) is higher than the financial cost of gas
(US$128 per thousand Ncm), the international product prices used for calculat-
ing the economic returns, compared to the decreasing financial product prices,
lead to a higher return for the economic analysis.
C.   Other Benefits
10.07     The Project will also generate other substantial benefits to India.
The expansion of domestic fertilizer production will directly reduce the
country's import requirements. The net foreign exchange savings over the
12-year life of the Project, after deduction of principal and interest payments
on the foreign loans and deducting foreign exchange components of operating



- 45 -
costs, are estimated at over US$3,440 million (in 1981 dollars) as shown
in Annex 10-4. The increased domestic production will also help ensure
a continuous and secured supply of fertilizer, thus allowing India to pursue
its agricultural growth targets with more certainty. The Government has
put a heavy emphasis on agricultural stability and growth, and stepped-up
fertilizer production will play a key role in increasing agricultural output
by improving yields. In fact, by 1988 when the Project reaches full capacity
operation, it alone will provide 10% of the forecast domestic supply and 7%
of forecast consumption of nitrogen fertilizers.
10.08     The local engineering firms involved in project implementation will
gain valuable know-how and experience by the proposed transfer of technology
arrangements. Direct employment created by the Project would be about
1,400 permanent jobs. The investment cost per permanent direct job is
US$910;000. At the peak period of construction activity, more than 4,000
people will be employed, for project implementation. Furthermore, it is
expected conservatively that through secondary and tertiary employment
creation effects, the Project will generate some 5,000 jobs in the transport
and service sectors. Finally, since about 48% of the equipment for the
Project is expected to be supplied by local manufacturers, the Project will
have significant backward linkages with the industrial sector, creating
additional jobs and investments. The local erection and civil work contracts
will also have a positive impact on the local economy. Installation of a
large fertilizer complex in the area will help attract small and medium scale
service industries needed to provide maintenance and other services for the
complex, and the improved road and rail connections can assist in the industrial
development of Hazira.

a/ Expected production figures for individual units exclude production sold to other fertilizer producers and are based on
projections by the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizer for production from various units, taking into account the long-term
measures the Ministry is implementing in order to raise capacity utilization.
b/ To be converted to methanol production.
c/ At present, measures to improve capacity utilization are not fully effective and therefore overall production shortfalls
in the next few years can be anticipated. In addition, the fertilizer industry overall is experiencing severe external
constraints on production due to shortage of raw materials (naphtha, fuel oil and coal) and extensive power supply problems.
As examples for 1979-80: Sindri has been supplied with only 25% of its fuel oil requirements. Gorakhpur has lost about
12,000 tons (N) of production due to inadequate supply of coal and naphtha and has experienced further losses due to power
cuts imposed by the State Government. In projecting future production it is considered that the measures being adopted
to remove both internal and external constraints will not become fully effective until 1985/86.
d/ This capacity will be achieved by 1988.

INDIA - HAZIRA FERTILIZER PROJECT
ESTIMATES OF FUTURE NITROGEN CONSUMPTION
1.       A number of organizations have prepared estimates of future nitrogen
consumption in India (Project File - Reference A). Virtually all these estimates
are based on some form of extrapolation method. The estimates selected for
comparison are the following:
(a) Fertilizer Association of India (FAI)(December 1980), which
uses a quadratic regression method, omitting from the analysis
certain years in the 1970s considered as atypical.
(b) IFFCO (August 1979), which was fitted exponential curves to
past consumption data.
(c) Ministry of Agirculture projections (September 1980), based on
Statewise analysis. These estimates are extrapolations of past
trends, but modified to incorporate the effect of planned changes
in irrigation levels, extension services, etc.
(d) IBRD estimates (January 1981), based on the use of Box-Jenkins
adaptive forecasting methods but modified for later years by con-
sideration of a maximum consumption of 10 million tons of nitrogen
per annum, which takes into account such factors as optimal level
of per hectare usage for wheat and rice crops, expected levels of
irrigation and HYV cultivation, and increases in the number of
farmers utilizing fertilizer (Project File - Reference B). Three
estimates are shown: (i) a low estimate which is based on the
assumption that the effect of the 1979 drought will lower future
demand for several years below the pre-drought trend line; (ii) a
median estimate which assumes a faster return to the pre-drought
trend line; and (iii) a high estimate which is also based on the
assumption that the current drought will not affect future growth.

2.       A comparison of these estimates is given in the Graph attached to
this Annex. It shows that the Bank high estimate lies generally close to the
FAI estimate. The wide range of the three Bank projections indicate the in-
herent uncertainty in such projections; by 1986, the difference between the
high and low estimates is about 2 million tons or about 25%.
3.       In order to convert consumption figures into demand estimates, each
annual figure was increased by 2% to cover distribution losses and by 20% of
the increase in consumption over the previous year to allow for additional
material in transit and stocks to be maintained at appropriate levels. These
adjusted demand estimates are shown in the following table, together with pro-
jections of future production:

4.       It should be noted that even if the IBRD low estimate is used to
forecast annual demand, projected production will be insufficient to meet
demand throughout the next decade.

ANNEX 9-1

INDIA - HAZIRA FERTILIZER PROJECT
ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF THE PROJECT
1.        The financial projections of the Project are calculated in current
Rupees. Revenues are determined on current terms by the retention price
formula (Annex 9-2). Costs have been escalated with inflation prices of
15% in 1980/81, 9% per year in 1981/82, 8.5% in 1982/83, 7.5% from 1983/84
till 1985/86 and 6% thereafter for years ending March 31. The financial
projections are presented according to KRIBHCO cooperative years from July 1 to June 30.
A.   Financing Plan and Debt Service
2.        The project financing plan is detailed in Chapter VIII of the
report and the debt service schedule is presented in Annex 9-5. The following
assumptions have been used to compute the debt service schedule:
(i)  The IDA credit will be on lent by the Government at 10.75% per
annum. Its maturity will be 15 years including 5 years of grace.
(ii) The ODA and OECF funds will be partly channeled through GOI,
and will be on-lent to KRIBCO at an interest of 10.75% per annum
and partly through IDBI. For the GOI channeled funds, each
yearly disbursenent will be paid back over 15 years after 5 years
of grace (equal principal repayment once a year); this corresponds
to a total maturity of 20 years. No commitment charge will be
levied.
(iii) The IDBI loan will be at 11.85% per annum. Its maturity
will be 15 years, including 5 years of grace. Commitment
fee will amount to D.5% of the undisbursed amount.
For the financial projections, interest during construction and commitment
fees were capitalized.
B.   Capacity Build-up
3.        It is assumed that the first stream of ammonia and urea plants will
start commercial operation by October 1984, 42 months after zero date. This
first stream of ammonia and urea plants is assumed to operate at 60% capacity
utilization the first year of operation, 80% the second year and 90% there-
after. The second stream of ammonia and urea plants is assumed to follow
this exact pattern with a lag of 12 months. It has been assumed that 0.6
tons of ammonia will yield 1 ton of urea, so that at 90% capacity utilization,
the project will produce 801,900 tpy of ammonia of which 784,080 tpy will be
used in the production of 1,306,800 tpy of urea and 17,820 tpy will be sold
to other IFFCO's plant at Kandla for the production of NPK fertilizers.

ANNEX 9-1
Page 2 of 2
C.   Revenues
4.        All revenues are at ex-factory prices.  They do not include govern-
ment levy, excise duty, freight and storing costs, dealer's margin, nor any
charges that determine the spread between ex-factory and retail price. This
is consistent with the fact that ex-factory prices are set by the retention
price formula (Annex 9-2) and distribution expenses do not accrue to the
Project entity.
D.   Operating Costs and Working Capital
5.        Production costs, which are presented in Annex 9-4 in January 1981
Rupees, are based on IFFCO estimates and have been cross-checked with similar
estimates for the Thal and other projects. The estimates are realistic. As
mentioned in para 1 of this Annex, all costs have been escalated for price
inflation. A 12-year straight line depreciation has been used for the finan-
cial projections and for the retention price calculation. Working capital
requirements are detailed in Annex 8-2.
E.   Taxes and Dividends
6.        Following Indian tax laws, the Project will benefit from Investment
Tax Credit and Tax Holidays. For income tax calculations, depreciation is
calculated following the written down value method; 75% of plant cost is
credited as Investment Tax Credit the first year of operation; and 7.5% of
capital employed is deducted from profit under the Tax Holiday law for the
first 7 years of operation. Benefits accruing for the last two items are
carried forward for 8 years of operation.
7.        It is expected that dividends of 6% of share equity will be
distributed in 1988, and 10% thereafter.

ANNEX 9-2

INDIA - HAZIRA FERTILIZER PROJECT
UREA RETENTION PRICE CALCULATION
1.        The urea retention price is calculated as per the formula enunciated
by the Marathe Committee. The calculations are made for pricing periods of
3 years as follows:
(i'    Share capital used in urea production (95% of total share
capital). In each successive pricing period, share capital
is equal to that prevailing at the beginning of the period.
(ii) +  Retained earnings.
(iii) -  Capital employed outside the business and accumulated surplus cash.
(iv) =  Capital employed in the business.  A lower limit has been set for
this cap-tal employed and it cannot decrease below
share capital.
(v)    29.4% return on capital employed.
(vi) +  Variable and fixed production costs at 80% capacity utilization
related to urea production, with depreciation as provided in
the company balance sheet.
(vii) +  Interest on short aLd long-term debt associated with urea
production. In each successive block of 3 years, interest
on long and short-term debt are considered equal to those of
the middle year.
(viii) +  Sum = ex-factory revenue to producer.
(ix)    Production volume of urea at 80% capacity utilization.
(x)    Urea Retention Price allowed.
2.       As can be seen in the price retention schedule below, captial employed
in business equals share capital after 1985. This is because accumulated surplus
cash exceeds retained earnings, and the provision on the lower limit applies.
Meanwhile increases in production costs due to inflation tend to increase the
retention price. The formula provides the Company a large cash flow during the
initial years of operations, declining in real terms thereafter. In fact, over
the 10-year period considered, the retention increases at about 2% per year in
current terms, which is well below the assumed inflation rates. The Project's
revenues decrease at about 5% per annum in real terms.

INDIA - HAZIRA FERTILIZER PROJECT
ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF THE PROJECT
A. Capital Cost Estimate
1.       The economic capital cost of the Project in "Adjusted 1981 prices," is
obtained from the financial capital cost in current prices after deflating it
to January 1981 prices using a currency deflation factor of 7.0% p.a. and after
deducting import duties and local taxes on imported equipment and other items.
Installed Cost in current prices                  Rs 7,988
Less Duties                                       -    738
Less Physical Contingencies on Duties             -      74
Less Price Contingencies on Duties                 -    203
Economic Capital Cost (current prices)         Rs 6,973
Then according to the phasing of expenditures, the above capital cost is
deflated as follows:
Year                                                   Capital Cost in Adjusted
Ending        Phased Capital Costs                        January 1981. Prices

1981/82   21           1,443.4              .935               1,349.6
1982/83   24           1,687.5              .837               1,473.2
1983/84   29           2,029.1              .816               1,655.8

100           6,973.0                                 5,972.0
B. Working Capital
2.       The economic working capital for the Project has been calculated as the
incremental requirements that the Project will impose on the total working
capital requirements for the country. In addition to taxes and duties, Accounts
Receivables/Payables and Minimum Cash have been omitted as they do not represent
costs incurred by the economy, but merely instruments of "transfer of obligations."
Finished Goods Inventory has also been omitted since in this case of import
substitution the inventory of urea produced by the Project substitutes for that
of imported urea and does not increase the country's total inventory. Working
capital requirements for the Project have thus been taken as follows:
Economic Value
(Adjusted 1981 Rs million)
(a) Raw Material Inventory
(i)   Coal           =  45 days of purchase                 15.4
(ii)   Bags           =  45 days of purchase                 18.7
(iii)   Chemicals      =  60 days of purchase                  7.8
(b)  Goods in Process
3 days of variable production costs                      20.6
Total Economic Working Capital                        62.5

C. Operating Cost Estin-ates
(i) Natural Gas: The economic price of natural gas in January 1981
prices is assumed at US$214 per thousand Ncm (US$5.7 per thousand
scf) in 1984/85. This cost is derived from the relationship between
the calorific value of gas and fuel oil and assuming a fuel oil price
in 1984/85, landed at Bombay, at US$227/t (FOB Middle-East US$210/ton
plus ocean freight US$17/ton). Since fuel oil price is assumed to
increase at an average of 3.2% p.a. natural gas economic value also
increases in real terms, at an average rate of 3.2% p.a. An alter-
native approach to derive the economic cost of gas was also con-
sidered, under which the economic price of gas is set at the level
that will ensure capital investment recovery for the gas field
development and pipeline project plus a reasonable return on this
investment.  The price derived under this approach is US$42    per
thousand Ncm which provides a 10% return to the investment in both
the gas field and pipeline project (Project File, Reference E).
This price relating to the economic cost of delivering the gas to
the Project is lower than the gas opportunity value derived from
fuel oil prices, and the higher value has been used in the economic
analysis. However, the sensitivity analysis includes calculations
based on the lower economic cost of delivering gas to the Project.

based on economic mine head production costs of Rs 112/tcn and
economic transport costs of Rs 92/ton.
(iii) Water, Power, Bags and Chemicals: Economic costs of water, power,
bags and chemicals are derived from financial costs after deducting local
taxes, as summarized below:

D. Revenues
5.        Economic price for urea, ex-factory, was based on the CIF
Bombay price plus domestic economic distribution freight to Hazira. This
was worked out in January 1981 prices, as follows for the year 1984/85.
Calculations for the other years are presented on page 4 of this Annex.

Hazira Ex-factory Price                                    339.6
The economic ammonia price was estimated on the basis of its FOB
N. W. Europe price, assumed at 0.9 times that of bagged urea. Thus the
ammonia price for 1985/86 is estimated at US$310.6/ton. The detailed
year by year economic price of ammonia is shown on page 4 of this Annex.
