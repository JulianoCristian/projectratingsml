{"cdata!": "Ratings for the Jiangxi Shihutang\n            Navigation and Hydropower Complex Project for China were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was low or negligible, the Bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            preparation of a RAP acceptable to the Bank is an important,\n            but not sufficient condition for successful project\n            implementation. Project design should be flexible to allow\n            for unanticipated land acquisition and resettlement issues,\n            as was the case with the difficulties in land acquisition\n            for the Donggang diversion canal. Power generation\n            investments can be significantly impacted by slow progress\n            of civil works and equipment installation. Therefore, a more\n            flexible power generation schedule should be prepared. In\n            addition, estimates of power generation should allow for a\n            phased build up to full capacity. The combination of a\n            hydropower station with ship lock development makes the\n            project financially viable. As Jiangxi Province does not\n            charge ships for use of the ship lock, revenue from power\n            generation provides financial support for the operations and\n            maintenance of the ship lock and the dam and servicing the\n            debt. Free use of the ship lock is expected to attract more\n            low value commodities to IWT from other transport modes."}, "docdt": "2014-12-18T00:00:00Z"}
