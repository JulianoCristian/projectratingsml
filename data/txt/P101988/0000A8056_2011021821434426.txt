                         The development objective (PDO) of the proposed project is to improve utilization of the Gan River for more reliable freight transport and for cleaner energy
                         production through: (a) improving inland waterway transport capacity and service levels for primary and secondary industries in the Nanchang-Ganzhou
                         corridor of the Gan River; and (b) generating renewable electricity to help meet rapidly growing demand for energy in the region.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The overall implementation of the project is satisfactory. The implementation capacity of the Project Management Office of Shihutang Complex (JPMO), the supervision engineers
                         and the contractors has been gradually improved. The main civil works of Shihutang Complex was behind the original schedule due to the extraordinary flood occurred this year.
                         Equipment installation for the powerhouse is scheduled for end April 2011 and the target power generation is set for October 2011. The resettlement implementation under the

                         project has been going well recently. Most of the permanent land acquisition has been completed. However, to match with the planned schedule of civil works, the resettlement
                         progress will need to be accelerated. Key aspects of the Environmental Management Plan has been implemented well. Domestic training has been underway and the

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Resettlement implementation has been satisfactory. However, resettlement work will need to be accelerated to match the planned schedule of civil works.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
