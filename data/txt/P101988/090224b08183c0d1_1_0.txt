                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective (PDO) of the proposed project is to improve utilization of the Gan River for more reliable freight transport and for cleaner energy production
                         through: (a) improving inland waterway transport capacity and service levels for primary and secondary industries in the Nanchang-Ganzhou corridor of the Gan River;
                         and (b) generating renewable electricity to help meet rapidly growing demand for energy in the region.

                         Training and study tours are being implemented as planned. A carbon financing verification on emission reduction for the first reporting period February 2012-Dec. 31, 2012 will be
                         conducted in January or February 2013.
                         Effective actions should be taken to complete the remaining resettlement works before the end of 2012, including to provide full public facilities at Donggang Site, allocate farmland to
                         the affected people, and construct houses at Huangkeng Site.
