                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The overall implementation of the Project remains satisfactory. The main work of the Shihutang Complex is completed on schedule. All six generator units started power generation
                         and have transferred the operation formally to the Provincial Port Investment Group. The first payment transfer for carbon financing was initialed at October 2013. With the complete
                         of hydropower station and shiplock, PDO is achieved. PMO is preparing as-built for finished work and the project acceptance document.
