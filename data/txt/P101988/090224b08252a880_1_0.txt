                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective (PDO) of the proposed project is to improve utilization of the Gan River for more reliable freight transport and for cleaner energy production
                         through: (a) improving inland waterway transport capacity and service levels for primary and secondary industries in the Nanchang-Ganzhou corridor of the Gan River;
                         and (b) generating renewable electricity to help meet rapidly growing demand for energy in the region.

                         The Shihutang navigation and hydropower complex has been completed on schedule. With the dam and ship lock in place, the navigation time per year for 1000-ton vessels on the
                         38km channel increase from 27% to 95%. Six generators are installed at power station. Over 270 GWH electricity was generated and sent to national power grid in Year 2013.

                         Component 2: flood protection works (47km of dikes, 506km of diversion canals, 8 pump stations, 2 free drainage sluices and 2 regulating sluices).

                         Most of flood protection works are completed, except Donggang pump station, which was unable to construct due to the difficult land acquisition. With the completed flood protection
                         work (dike, diversion canal, pump stations, drainage sluices and regulating sluices), 4389 Ha of crop field is protected against 10-year flood.

                         Component 3: technical assistance:
                         Two technical studies defined in the result framework were completed on schedule. And the number of trainees under Shihutang project exceeded the end target value.

                         An implementation completion report (ICR) will be prepared by the Bank and Borrower. A full assessment of achievement of PDO and implementation experience will be carried out in
                         ICR.
