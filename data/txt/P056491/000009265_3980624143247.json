Republic of China to help finance the Hebei Earthquake\n            Rehabilitation Project. The project's primary objective\n            is to assist in the restoration of economic and social\n            activities following an earthquake in Zhangjiakou\n            Municipality in northwest Hebei province, by restoring\n            social and economic infrastructure and priority production\n            facilities. A second objective is to strengthen the\n            socioeconomic situation in the area through enhancing\n            productive activities, which would alleviate the extreme\n            poverty. The project supports emergency reconstruction,\n            repair, and rehabilitation (and for some components,\n            equipment purchases) of housing; schools; health care\n            facilities; grain storage facilities; drinking water\n            facilities--including distribution networks; water\n            conservancy facilities--a reservoir, wells, buildings,\n            canals, bridges, aqueducts, etc.; and irrigation\n            works--shallow stone wells, dug wells, tube wells, and small\n            sprinkler irrigation systems. An added component provides\n            technical assistance, training, and support to municipal,\n            county, and township level agencies, particularly for\n            building standard development, project management, and monitoring."}, "docdt": "1998-05-04T00:00:00Z"}
