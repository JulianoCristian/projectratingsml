     showing highly satisfactory ratings on project outcome, and\n            performances by the Bank, and Borrower, highly likely\n            sustainability, and substantial institutional development.\n            Key lessons include: 1) the replicability of lessons quoted\n            in the appraisal documentation, i.e., need for strong local\n            leadership, attention to Borrower's view, fast tracking\n            of project processing, and minimization of cash flow\n            bottlenecks, appropriately taken into account for project\n            design, and implementation arrangements, and, at the same\n            time, general suggestions from emergency operations, e.g.,\n            longer implementation period, were correctly, discarded by\n            the project team in this specific case; 2) the adequate\n            attention given to project preparation, and design\n            simplicity, which avoided overburdening the reconstruction\n            effort, conditionality, studies, and surveys. The selection\n            of components focused around the life of communities, such\n            as the reconstruction of basic services to support their\n            livelihoods, a relevant, and responsive approach; 3) the\n            flexible procurement methods, such as force account to\n            construct small works, conducive to an effective\n            implementation; 4) the introduction of seismic-resistant\n            construction methods, a key element for sustainability,\n            which included training, and dissemination of these\n            practices; 5) the close consultation with beneficiaries -\n            for both reconstruction, and poverty alleviation components\n            - which ensured project representation in the smallest\n            villages, and a fast implementation; and, 6) the successful\n            economic rehabilitation, attained through the provision of\n            infrastructure reconstruction, reduced vulnerability of\n            local populations, and strengthened social capacity."}, "docdt": "2001-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
