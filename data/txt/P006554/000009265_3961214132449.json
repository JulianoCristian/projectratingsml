The project will\n            finance the following two components: 1) an investment fund\n            to finance rehabilitation, equipment, management and\n            maintenance subprojects; and 2) institutional development,\n            which will support: an adequate framework for pricing and\n            reimbursing health care providers; a list of priority health\n            benefits to be financed by the SUS; a differentiated\n            reimbursement schedule favoring more cost-effective\n            interventions; the introduction of cost recovery for care\n            provided to privately-insured patients under the SUS; and\n            better management of the quality of services and fraud control."}, "docdt": "1996-05-21T00:00:00Z"}
