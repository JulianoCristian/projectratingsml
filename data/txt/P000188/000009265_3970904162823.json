improve the\n            reliability and supply of electricity to Bujumbura and its\n            environs; and (ii) extend the availability of electricity to\n            yet unserved markets; and b) strengthen the financial\n            performance, management and power planning functions in\n            Regideso. The project components will include: a) a 110 kV\n            transmission line (83 km) from Ruzizi II to Bubanza; b)\n            construction of 110/30 kV subtransmission lines (42 km) to\n            supply four regional towns, a 15 or 30 kV feeder to Katumba\n            and distribution networks in these towns; c) construction of\n            distribution networks to consumers in six low-income\n            districts of Bujumbura; d) rehabilitation of the Bujumbura\n            substation and Bujumbura - Ruzizi I transmission line; e)\n            consulting engineering services, management assistance to\n            Regideso, establishment of a training center and technical\n            assistance for the training of Regideso staff; and f)\n            continuation of the dissemination program of improved\n            charcoal stoves in Bujumbura, and the services of an advisor\n            to assist the Government in devising strategies to import\n            petroleum products at least cost."}, "docdt": "1985-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
