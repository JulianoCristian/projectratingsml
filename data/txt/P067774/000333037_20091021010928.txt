1.1 Context at Appraisal

Macroeconomic situation. At the time this project was identified in November 2000, Jamaica
was experiencing low or negative economic growth (gross domestic product declined in real
terms about 4 percent between the fiscal years 1994 to 1999), a tight monetary policy adopted in
1995, large fiscal deficits (mainly due to a long-term accumulation of outstanding debt and the
Government's bail out of large indebted banks during 1997) and inflation averaging about 8
percent in 1999. About 62 percent of the Government of Jamaica's (GOJ) central budget was
spent on interests and redemption payments. As a consequence, spending in other areas, in
particular, social spending was dramatically curtailed.

Despite the negative economic growth experienced since 1995, social indicators in Jamaica
continued to be reasonably good compared to other countries in the Latin America and the
Caribbean Region (LAC) and poverty was on a declining trend. In 1999, 17 percent of the
population was poor as compared to a staggering 44 percent in 1991. Migration, increased
remittances from abroad, and informal sector economic activities contributed to this decline in
poverty.

Data made available at the time of the lending process indicated that poor people had
disproportionately lower access to quality educational opportunities and were more exposed to
violence. Almost half of the poor people were under the age of 18 while about 10 percent were
over 65 years. Poverty was also overwhelmingly rural in character, with nearly 80 percent of the
poor people living in rural areas and less than 10 percent in the Kingston metropolitan area.
Although women headed only 44 percent of Jamaican households, 66 percent of poor households
were headed by women at the time of the identification. Poor households were large, with 40
percent of poor families having six or more members and nearly 20 percent with 8 or more
members.

Despite Jamaica's long tradition of public provision of welfare programs dating back to the 19th
century, sound health and education policies together with a well-designed targeted safety net
strategy were urgently needed to further alleviate living conditions, particularly of the poorest and
most vulnerable groups in the Jamaica population.

Issues. The following six sector issues bounded the project design concept:

Expenditures on the social safety net. Despite GOJ's investments in education and health in 2000
(6.2 percent and 2.5 percent of GDP respectively), a considerable allocation as compared to other
middle-income countries in the LAC region, those allocated for social protection programs (SPP)
accounted for only 2.6 percent of GDP (about US$78.4 million equivalent), well below the
average in LAC where expenditures on SPP ranged at that time from a high of almost 9 percent in
Chile to a low of 0.7 percent in Haiti. Of these SPP expenditures, only a small proportion was
spent on targeted social safety net (SSN) programs for the poor.

Multiple uncoordinated programs. In addition to the comparatively low budget allocations to
SSN, the modest amount was spent by GOJ in an array of over 20 uncoordinated SSN programs
aimed at benefiting the poor and/or vulnerable population. Duplication of administrative systems


                                                 1
and a lack of coordination increased both the direct cost of the programs and the indirect costs to
the beneficiaries.

Insufficient targeting and coverage. An assessment undertaken at the time of project preparation
of Jamaica's SSN programs indicated that they were not well targeted and that they had low
coverage of the poor and/or vulnerable population. This assessment concluded that the means
testing criteria and procedures differed for the different programs despite the fact that many of
them sought to reach the same population. Some programs were not targeted at all. There were
significant Type I errors of exclusion (when a poor person is found not to be eligible) and of Type
II of leakage or incorrect inclusion (when a non-poor person is found to be eligible).

The formal social insurance system that offered income protection through pensions was limited
primarily to those with formal sector employment who had made contributions, excluding the
elderly who had a history of insufficient contributions. The biggest SSN program in Jamaica at
that time, the Food Stamp Program, provided benefits to about 170,000 individuals covering only
15 percent of the poorest quintile and 9 percent of the second poorest quintile. The Poor Relief
Program reached between 5 and 7 percent of the households of the poorest quintile. While these
programs were progressive in the distribution of benefits, they also presented leakages. In the
Food Stamp Program, for example, approximately one third of beneficiaries came from the 3
richest per capita household consumption quintiles.

Low level of benefits. The benefits provided by most of the SSN in Jamaica were low and
therefore failed to provide adequate protection to the poor and/or vulnerable population. For
example, the Food Stamp Program paid about US$1.88 equivalent per child per month,
representing only 1.2 percent of the basic food basket; the average Poor Relief and Public
Assistance benefits (mainly directed towards elderly and disabled persons) were of about US$4
equivalent per person. The per capita value of the three transfers combined (the Food Stamp
Program, the Poor Relief Program and the Public Assistance Program) added up to about 10
percent of the overall poverty line defined for Jamaica in 2000.

Persistent low school attendance. The social indicators at the time of identification indicated that
access of the poor to primary education was not an issue. But these indicators failed to accurately
portray the situation: access to education was not the problem but attendance was still low. In
1999, 35 percent of children from families of the poorest quintile attended school less than 15
days per month. The main reason given by poor families for school absence was "money
problems". In addition, poor educational quality combined with low school attendance,
particularly in schools in inner cities and in the rural areas. Approximately 30 percent of sixth
graders were functionally illiterate. Access to secondary education of students in the 15 to 16
year old age-bracket from the poorest quintile fell to 67 percent against a national average of 83
percent and 94 percent of students of the wealthiest quintile. As a consequence, only 21 percent
of the youngsters in the 17-19 age-cohort from the poorest quintile were enrolled in secondary
school, as compared to 87 percent in the wealthiest quintile. Educational indicators in both
primary and secondary education were better for girls than for boys.

Declining health indicators. At the time of project preparation there were increasing problems in
maintaining health indicators. Immunization rates among infants from birth to eleven months
went down from 93 percent in 1993 to 85 percent in 1999. Although most children were
eventually immunized by the time they started primary school at age 6, the late receipt of
vaccinations increased the risk of preventable illnesses. In addition, increasing problems with
prenatal care paralleled the decline in on-time immunizations. At the end of the nineties, only 25

                                                 2
percent of mothers had their first prenatal visit during the first four months of pregnancy.
Anemia in pregnancy affected approximately 50 percent of all pregnant women and was a
contributing factor to the persistent incidence (10 percent) of low birth weight babies.

Government's strategy.        The World Bank (Bank)-financed SSN project (project) was
designed under the context of GOJ's Poverty Eradication Strategy signed by the Prime Minister
in 1997 and the Comprehensive Reform Proposal for the Social Safety Net jointly prepared in
1998 by the Office of the Prime Minister and the Planning Institute of Jamaica (PIOJ) and
endorsed by the Cabinet. The SSN reform aimed at:

    a) Tailoring programs to risks and conditions associated with poverty and vulnerability
       including targeting mechanisms;
    b) Integrating the different SSN programs to reduce delivery costs;
    c) Ensuring a comprehensive range of benefits to address different conditions (including
       age-specific factors) associated with poverty and vulnerability;
    d) Introducing flexibility in programs (for up- or down-scaling as needed); and
    e) Ensuring efficiency and fiscal sustainability of programs, notably by maximizing
       complementarity and partnership with non-governmental organizations (NGOs).

The above-mentioned reform identified the following as target groups: (i) children in poverty; (ii)
youth at risk; (iii) the elderly poor; (iv) the disabled; (v) poor single-parent households; (vi) large
poor rural families; (vii) the long-term unemployed; and (viii) victims of social or natural disaster
or HIV/AIDS. Special priority was given by the reform to children and youth.

As a result of the above comprehensive framework, GOJ developed a Sector-Wide approach for
the SSN Reform, which was approved by the Cabinet on October 31, 2000. This approach
addressed institutional, administrative, managerial and programmatic changes. Among the key
reform measures proposed was the development and implementation of a universal targeting
system based on a proxy means test to ensure increased transparency in the selection of
beneficiaries, reduce administrative costs associated with having each program carry out its own
assessment of eligibility and improve targeting. The approach also called for the unification of
the three main cash/in-kind transfer programs existing at the time of project identification (food
stamps, poor relief and public assistance) into one unified benefit, thereby reducing fragmentation
and duplication. This approach placed great emphasis on the developing of monitoring and
evaluation systems for the various programs, building on existing instruments, such as the yearly
Survey of Living Conditions (SLC). Finally, the piloting of the scoring formula using the SLC to
minimize errors of Type I and of Type II was considered a pre-requisite for the launching of the
unified SSN approach. On February 24, 2001, the Cabinet decided on the categories of
beneficiaries eligible under the unified benefit program (UBP) and on the levels of benefit.
Finally, in early April 2001, the Jamaican Parliament approved an incremental allocation of J$69
million (about US$1.5 million equivalent) for the UBP in the FY 2001/02 budget.

The Cabinet also decided to entrust the Ministry of Labor and Social Security (MLSS) with the
responsibility of implementing the unified benefit program using a new improved targeting
mechanism to be supported by the new Bank-financed project.

Rationale for Bank's assistance. The rationale for Bank's assistance was argued on the basis
of the overarching support the Bank was already providing GOJ to implement its reform plan for
the SSN through the implementation of the Jamaica Social Investment Fund (Ln.4088-JM). In
particular, the Bank's value added consisted of: (i) transferring experiences from similar projects


                                                  3
in other countries (Armenia, Brazil, Colombia, Honduras and Mexico) in project design and
implementation; (ii) providing technical assistance (through two Japanese Grant funds) on the
content and process of the SSN reform and its implementation; (iii) providing technical assistance
in developing and implementing the targeting mechanism and the scoring formula; (iv) providing
technical assistance to develop and implement a monitoring and impact evaluation scheme and
identifying necessary adjustments in the delivery mechanism; and (v) assisting GOJ in
coordinating with other donors, in particular the Inter American Development Bank (IDB) which
was financing other parts of the SSN reform.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The original Project Development Objectives (PDOs) were to support the GOJ's efforts to reform
its social safety net in order to provide better and more cost-effective social assistance to the
extreme poor. More specifically, by `better" and "more cost-effective" the project intended to:
(a) consolidate major income transfer programs into a UBP (latter to be renamed by GOJ as
Program of Advancement Through Health and Education or PATH) that would ensure: (i)
meaningful level of benefits; (ii) cost-efficient and accessible delivery systems; (iii) access to
benefits linked to desirable behavioral changes for promoting investment in human capital
development of the poor, especially children; (iv) effective targeting of social assistance to
special groups; and (b) strengthen institutional capacity to: (i) operate the program effectively and
efficiently; and (ii) implement overall social safety net reform elements, including transparent
targeting mechanism.

According to the Supplemental Letter dated October 10, 2001 attached to the Loan Agreement
(LA) 7076-JM, the following outcome and output indicators were agreed with the GOJ. The
outcome/impact indicators were to be assessed through an evaluation of net changes comparing a
representative sample of program beneficiaries to a comparison group with similar characteristics,
using baseline and follow-up surveys. The output indicators were to be tracked through the
program management information system.

Outcome/impact indicators

    a)   Net change in school attendance;
    b)   Net change of enrollment for secondary school;
    c)   Net change in the percentage of children brought to health centers for preventive care;
    d)   Net change in children age 0-6 and not enrolled in school with on-time, complete
         immunization scheme;
    e)   Net change in poor pregnant/lactating mothers visiting health centers for timely check-
         ups;
    f)   Net change in poor elderly, disabled and other beneficiaries visiting health centers;
    g)   Beneficiary satisfaction with the UBP (to be assessed through regular beneficiary
         consultations); and
    h)   Percentage of overall SSN expenditure channeled through the UBP (with a target to be
         larger than 19.5 percent).

Output indicators

    a) Number of beneficiaries (with a target of over 217,000 accumulated in year 3 of the
       project);



                                                 4
    b) Approximate monthly benefit under the program (with a target of US$6 equivalent per
       person/month by year 1 and 2, US$7.50 equivalent by year 3 and US$9 equivalent from
       year 4 onwards);
    c) School attendance rate of primary and secondary students eligible under the UBP of at
       least 85 percent of school sessions during the academic year;
    d) Health care utilization by children 0-6 and not enrolled in school (with a target that the
       number of visits be larger than the ones required by the national standards);
    e) Percentage of grant recipients below the poverty line (target 70 percent or more);
    f) Percentage of eligible poor not receiving grant (target less than 30 percent); and
    g) Administrative costs financed by the Loan below 15 percent.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

The PDOs were not modified during project implementation.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

According to Section C3 and Annex 1 to the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) the project
aimed at providing benefits to the poor and vulnerable representing about 17 percent of the
Jamaican population, including 160,000 children and 57,000 adults as shown in Table 1.

1.5 Original Components

The Implementation Completion Report (ICR) notes that the description of the project
components in Section C and Annex 2 to the PAD (Child Assistance Grants, Social Assistance
Grants and Institutional Strengthening) does not exactly mirror their description in Schedule 2 to
the LA (Education grants, health grants, social assistance grants to adults and Institutional
Strengthening). This is due to the fact that Component B was fully financed by counterpart
funding and appeared in the project description in the PAD but was not part of the legal
covenants between the GOJ and the Bank. Its two related outcome indicators (referred to in
paragraphs 1.2(e) and (f) above) were included in the Supplemental Letter to the LA. Based on


                                                       5
ICR current guidelines, the description of the project components that follows in this section of
the ICR corresponds to the one provided in the PAD.

Component A: Child assistance grants (total cost US$50.67 million; US$28.73
million from the Loan). This component represented about 71.8 percent of the total loan
aimed at providing conditional grants for poor children in the age cohort 0-17 years old who met
the eligibility criteria set forth in the Operational Manual. These grants were to finance direct
costs to keep poor children healthy and in school. The receipt of benefits were to be conditioned
on regular health clinic visits for children age 0-6 not enrolled in school, as well as on school
attendance for children age 6-17. Eligible and registered beneficiaries would receive the grants
for as long as they complied with the agreed requirements set forth in the Operational Manual.
The benefit would be paid to the family representative, which in general would be the mother, or
if the mother was not available, the child's caretaker. Payments were to be made bimonthly with
health and educational conditionalities verified at least three times per year. The average monthly
benefit per person was set at J$250 (about US$5.50 equivalent at the time of appraisal) for the
first year increasing to J$500 (about US$9 equivalent) during and after the third year of program
implementation.

Component B: Social Assistance Grants for Adults (total cost US$14.14 million; US$0.0
million from the Loan). This component, financed 100 percent by counterpart funds, aimed at
providing conditional grants to eligible poor pregnant/lactating mothers, elderly poor over 65
years-old and disabled and destitute adults under 65 years-old. The receipts of benefits were
conditioned on regular health clinic visits by the adult beneficiaries. The average monthly benefit
per person was set the same as for the child assistance transfer and increased accordingly over
time. The selection of grant beneficiaries and the verification compliance with the requirements
of their receipt was to be done in accordance with procedures and criteria described in the
Operational Manual. The total targets are presented in table 1 above.

Component C: Institutional strengthening (total cost US$11.92 million; US$10.50 million
from the Loan). This component, representing about 26.2 percent of the total loan, aimed at
financing the strengthening of the MLSS's institutional capacity to operate a streamlined and
efficient social safety net in Jamaica. To this end, this component was to provide support for the:
(i) development of a targeting mechanism and beneficiary identification system; (ii) development
of a management information system to support efficient management of the UBP; (iii) training to
the staff at MLSS, the Ministry of Education, Youth and Culture and the Ministry of Health as
well as to family representatives and other relevant members of civil society; (iv) carrying out of
awareness campaigns to promote and disseminate the objectives of the project and the availability
of the grants among the general public, potential beneficiaries and stakeholders; (v) monitoring
and evaluation of the implementation of the project; and (vi) carrying out workshops, research
and analysis to strengthen GOJ's social protection policies.

1.6 Revised Components

No revision of components was made during the implementation process.

1.7 Other significant changes

An amendment was made to the LA removing a loan disbursement requirement against the grant
category of expenditure further detailed in section 2.2 of the ICR. Also, reallocations were
authorized by the Bank among the different expenditure categories and two extensions to the
Loan closing date were made. No other significant changes were introduced to this project during
the implementation process.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The following sections in the ICR were written based on: (i) a thorough review of the Project
files; and (ii) the findings of an ICR field mission carried out May 4th to 8th , 2009, that included a
visit to the Parish of Manchester to interact with the MLSS's Parish Manager in charge of the
local operation of the PATH and its staff of social workers, as well as a group of beneficiaries.

The ICR rates Quality at Entry as moderately satisfactory based on current best quality at entry
practices recommended in Bank guidelines, which were not in place at the time of Project
appraisal. A summary of the ICR's assessment on these topics follows, while section 5.1 (a) of
the ICR provides more detail on this assessment.

The strategic relevance and approach selected by the Bank team was the correct one based on
the series of studies and consultative workshops financed by the Bank during the project
preparation phase and the GOJ's own SSN Reform strategy. These studies pointed to the need for
reform in the social safety net to reduce fragmentation and duplication of services, improve the
targeting of benefits and increase the coverage of the poor and vulnerable population in Jamaica.
Accordingly, in order to keep the project design focused, a series of other alternatives (explained
in section D1 of the PAD) were rightly excluded in the design. The project design had clarity
between policy reform (sought to enable sector-wide improvements in the SSN programs) and
project interventions directed towards the poor and vulnerable population.

                                                   7
The Project's lending files attest to client orientation through effective policy dialogue with the
GOJ and an extensive consultation process with key project stakeholders, including key
Government Ministries, academia, social workers and representatives of civil society including
potential beneficiaries. In addition, as fully detailed in section 5.2(a) of the ICR, the project files
attest to GOJ's ownership of the Project design.

Relations with other agencies. Although no other multilateral or bilateral institution was
included in the financing of this project, IDB financed other parts of the reform, in particular, the
development of the targeting mechanism as well as some required studies. The IDB accompanied
the Bank on the Project Committee chaired by the PIOJ, and had a good working relationship
with the Bank.

PDOs, outcome and output indicators. As fully explained in sections 2.3 and 3.2 of the ICR,
the PDO could have been worded in a more precise way to define what the specific outcomes
were, because the outcomes could only be discerned from the indicators.

Technical, financial and economic aspects. The Bank team was familiar with the operational
characteristics of the cash-transfer programs including the targeting and scoring formulas,
registration and verification of beneficiaries, payment mechanisms, monitoring of beneficiaries'
behavioral changes and impact evaluation studies. Various cost-benefit analyses for different
scenarios were undertaken during the preparation cycle as well as a simulation of fiscal impact at
the closing of the loan.

During negotiations, an unexpected request was made by the Bank's financial management unit
to include operational audits as a Loan disbursement condition. This intended to verify
beneficiaries' compliance with the required behaviors associated to the conditionality of the cash-
transfer benefit. This request was approved by Bank management despite the lack of any
technical and operational description of this covenant, and without allowing sufficient time for
the Borrower and the Bank team to think through the likely implementation consequences. This
decision proved to be ill-advised, seriously hindering the physical and financial implementation
progress of the most important component of the project until it was first waived in November
2003. It was later removed from the LA (amendment of November 2007), as explained
elsewhere in the ICR.

The Bank team ensured compliance with Bank's safeguard policies. Procurement and financial
management assessments were carried out, a first-year procurement plan was made available and
a thorough social assessment was undertaken highlighting key issues to be addressed by the SSN
reform.

Implementation readiness conditions were not fully present at the time of Board approval for
the six reasons fully detailed in section 5.1(a) of the ICR.

Risk assessments. The Bank team highlighted in the PAD some potential critical risks and
proposed some mitigating measures as detailed in section 5.1(a) of the ICR.

Lessons learned. Lessons learned from similar cash transfer Bank-financed programs, especially
in Mexico and Brazil, further explained in section 5.1(a) of the ICR, were incorporated in the
project design.



                                                  8
Weighting the above strengths and weaknesses of the preparation cycle, the ICR ranks the
Quality at Entry of this Project as moderately satisfactory.

2.2 Implementation

This Bank-financed UBP, renamed by the GOJ as PATH at the onset of project implementation,
has become the country's flagship social assistance program registering about 307,000 poor
beneficiaries at the end of March 2009. Through transparent and objective targeting mechanisms,
280,000 have been verified as eligible participants receiving PATH benefits every other month. A
rigorous impact evaluation study has shown that the PATH has also contributed to positive
behavioral changes in health and education among the beneficiaries as further explained in
section 3.2 of the ICR.

The PATH's Loan was approved by the Board on September 4, 2001. The LA was signed on
October 10, 2001 and became effective on February 28, 2002, almost six months after Board
approval and two months after the expected date of effectiveness set for in the PAD.

Implementing agency. The PATH was implemented by the MLSS through its Public Assistance
Division, which assumed the responsibilities of managing the procurement and financial fiduciary
aspects as well as the monitoring and evaluation. The implementation of the PATH required the
MLSS to liaise with the PIOJ, the Office of the Prime Minister, the Ministries of Finance, of
Education, Youth and Culture, of Health and Environment and of Local Government and
Community Development (MLGCD) (to be renamed Ministry of Local Government and
Environment, then Ministry of Local Government and currently, Department of Local
Government) and with an assortment of civil society organizations. The required core staff
within the Public Assistance Division ensured an appropriate implementation and defined the
roles and responsibilities as clearly described in the PAD (Section C.4 (b) and Annex 13). Most
of the staff was recruited from the MLSS while some were filled with qualified consultants. At
each one of the 13 Parishes, the implementation of the PATH was entrusted to the MLSS's Parish
Manager through its Public Assistance and National Insurance administrators.

The following paragraphs describe key decisions and events, at the government and
implementing agency levels and outside government control, which contributed to the PATH's
achievements and shortcomings. This section complements the information also presented in
sections 5.1 (b) and 5.2 (b) of the ICR. The PATH's implementation assessment is described
along the following three, arbitrarily defined time periods to better accommodate the sequence of
key implementation events: (i) the launching and piloting period going from loan effectiveness at
the end of February 2002 to about September 2003; (ii) the scaling up period running from the
last quarter of 2003 until the summer of 2007 at the time the follow-up operation was identified
(the Jamaica: Social Protection Project (P105024) and approved by the Board on May 8, 2008);
and (iii) the consolidation and sustainability period running from the second semester of 2007
until the closing of the loan in March 31, 2009.

Events outside Government control. Two hurricanes that hit Jamaica during the implementation
cycle (Ivan in September 2004 and Dean in August 2007) were the only factors beyond
government control that introduced some delays in project execution. During this time, the PATH
program proved to be a useful tool to assist the poorest victims of these natural disasters. This
type of assistance through PATH was considered eligible under the SSN reform program and thus
subject to Bank reimbursement.



                                               9
First period. This period is characterized by: (i) the carrying out of a pilot of the PATH in the St.
Catherine Parish during the first 8 months of 2002, 100 percent financed by counterpart funding;
(ii) the start of the scaling up of the PATH island-wide in the second semester of 2002, after
having completed and evaluated the pilot, also 100 percent financed by counterpart funding; (iii)
the addressing of key project preparation gaps; and (iv) very slow disbursements of loan proceeds
which reached an accumulated amount of about US$1.77 million by September 2003.

The eight-month pilot in the Parish of St. Catherine accompanied by an evaluation process served
to assess implementation bottlenecks and allowed for the fine tuning of the original design before
scaling it up to full national coverage in the remaining 13 Parishes. The Parish of St. Catherine
(including its urban and rural areas) was selected as a good representative of the poverty and adult
vulnerability conditions existing at that time in the country.

During this period, 6,457-targeted beneficiaries (equivalent to about 1,620 families) were
incorporated into the PATH, receiving a total of 3 payments. Because only one out of 3.5
potential families in this pilot Parish were accepted into the PATH program, an assessment of the
pilot program was undertaken by the implementing unit within the MLSS to inform the decision
about nationwide expansion coverage. The findings of this assessment indicated that the lower
than expected participation in the program was mainly due to the fact that many potential
beneficiaries did not know about the program given a lack of an effective communication
campaign. Accordingly, a comprehensive public information and education program was
established during the expansion of the PATH. The proxy means testing scoring formula of the
Beneficiary Identification System (BIS) was fine-tuned to further reduce the type I (exclusion)
and type II errors (leakage or inclusion). These errors were averaging about 11 percent, which
was considered acceptable based on best practices from other countries.

During this pilot phase, a system of case management was designed in collaboration with social
workers from the three key existing income support programs mentioned before in the ICR. The
tasks assigned to the case manager included: intake, assessment, enrollment, monitoring of
behavioral outcomes, re-certification, referral to other agencies in case of special needs (for
example, Child guidance, Children's Services and Family Court) and graduation or termination of
the program. Case managers were also assigned with record keeping to feed data into the
envisaged program's management information system (MIS).

An appeal mechanism was also established during this period to address the concerns of
beneficiaries and civil society who were: (a) dissatisfied with the termination of the program; (b)
concerned about the exclusion of persons presumed to belong to the targeted population; and (c)
concerned about the inclusion of persons presumed not to belong to the target population. To this
end, a Local Appeal Committee was established including representatives of the program's
stakeholders, such as Community Health Aides, Guidance Counselors, Teachers, Ministers of
Religion, Parish Counselors and community representatives.

The project design considered several payment options of the cash transfers, including direct
deposits into the account of the beneficiary in the banking system through the use of personal
debit card. In some cases where the bank system was not readily available, the use of a qualified
payment company was considered. At the onset of the implementation stage, GOJ decided on the
latter option as the only payment option, and the Postal Corporation was selected to be the
payment agency for the project. The social workers were then entrusted with delivering the
beneficiaries' checks to the post offices (located in larger cities) and post agencies (in smaller
cities and villages) once every two months. In October 2006, the MLSS decided to pilot a pre-
paid cash-card scheme, which was successfully implemented and gradually scaled up to more

                                                 10
PATH beneficiaries towards the end of the implementation cycle currently reaching about 5
percent of total payments to families.

The scaling up process started in late May 2002 by rolling out a national enrollment process. By
the end of 2002, about 100,000 beneficiaries were receiving their payments; by August 2003
about 140,000 PATH beneficiaries were receiving their fourth payment. During this scaling up
period, the Outdoor Poor Relief Program (managed by the MLGCD) adopted PATH's payment
mechanism through the MLSS. Also during this period the MLSS addressed the issue of the
inadequacy of the PATH identification cards not containing appropriate safeguards to ensure
against fraudulent use. The payment system was fine-tuned to eliminate some problems
concerning codes and names of schools and health centers for the payment to be issued to the
beneficiaries. The first compliance check was carried out in June 2003 resulting in the discovery
that about 30 percent of beneficiaries that were not compliant. During the early phases of the
implementation cycle, compliance reports from the education sector were more punctually
produced than those from the health sector.

This first period also focused on addressing some key project preparation gaps detailed in section
5.1 (a) of the ICR, including: (i) the staffing of the Public Assistance Division of the MLSS with
qualified staff to handle procurement and financial fiduciary aspects of the loan; (ii) the
establishment of a monitoring and evaluation system and fielding the baseline information; (iii)
the attempt to establish the operational audits for the Bank to reimburse the grant category of
expenditure1; (iv) the development of the first set of user-friendly training materials for PATH-
related staff from the various participating ministries and agencies, social workers and
beneficiaries; (v) the establishment of inter-ministerial linkages between the MLSS and the
Ministries of Education, Youth and Culture, of Health and Environment and of MLGCD; and (vi)
the procurement processes for the selection of two qualifying firms, one to computerize the
financial management system (which was manually operated) and the other to develop an
appropriate MIS (which will only be established at the end of the implementation cycle after the
early in-house development of the first two modules of the system (enrollment and targeting) as
further explained in section 2.3 of the ICR).

Second period. This period was characterized by a more consistent physical and financial
implementation progress and a focus on outcomes and outputs. Documented disbursements
against the loan increased from US$1.77 million in September 2003 to US$31.2 million in
September 2007, at an average rate of about US$613,000 per month. The Public Assistance
Division started preparing the quarterly Project Management Reports (PMR) required by the
Bank, the first one covering the period September 2001 to June 2002. These PMRs became very
useful reporting instruments that included a wealth of information: number of registered
beneficiaries, paid beneficiaries, payments, compliance, targeting, selection and rejection, BIS,
consultancies, training, recertification, expenditures and findings of process evaluation. Parishes
started changing their focus from mass targeting and enrollment (characteristic during the first
period) to one ensuring an appropriate oversight in compliance, payment, training and case
management (characteristic during the second period).

 Resulting in a very untimely and complicated procedure for the Bank to be able to reimburse the grant
category of expenditure leading eventually to a request by the GOJ to first temporarily waive this condition,
and then, to amend the LA to eliminate this disbursement condition.


                                                     11
The scoring formula was revised again since the cut-off points discriminated against the urban
poor and people with disabilities. After testing and refining the BIS (which was based on a proxy
means test scoring formula), it was used nationwide to select beneficiaries not only for the PATH
program, but also for other social safety net programs, such as the secondary school fee waiver.

Some parts of the SSN reform were progressing well during this second period, especially the
expansion to cover more beneficiaries. Other parts of the reform, not necessarily financed under
the Bank loan, like the repeal of the antiquated Poor Relief Law (1886) and the enactment of a
new National Assistance Act (NAA) to merge the Outdoor Poor Relief Program with the PATH
were never implemented. Approval by Parliament of the proposed NAA establishing an
appropriate institutional framework for the delivery of social assistance benefits (indoor poor
relief, rehabilitation grants, compassionate grants, support for homeless and street persons and
indigent housing) was conceived as a way to reduce inefficiencies in the overall SSN reform and
avoid duplications. However, despite the numerous drafts of the proposed Legislation (a total of
nine), the Executive Branch of the GOJ has not presented this merging proposal to Parliament
because basic disagreements concerning the role of local (decentralized paradigm) and national
governments (centralized paradigm) in the delivery of social welfare have not yet been resolved.
Accordingly, one of the broader objectives of the SSN reform (not of the Bank-financed project)
concerning the consolidation of all cash grant programs in Jamaica has not yet occurred.

The following are some key operational issues addressed during this second period: (i) the
strengthening of the BIS to further avoid duplications; (ii) the follow-up of students dropping out
from one school likely to be enrolled in another school; (iii) the tracking of changes made at the
household level such as demographic composition of the family, addresses, schools, health
centers; (iv) the procedures to resolve appeals; (v) the reapplication for benefits, in cases when
families were considered not eligible the first time they applied and affirmative the second time
(because death of breadwinner, natural disaster, loss of assets); (v) the time schedule to process
applications including home verification, compliance with eligibility criteria and effective
enrollment; (vi) the reconciliation for the beneficiary account to address the issue of stale-dated
checks and other undetected payment irregularities; (vii) the processing of uncollected checks;
and (viii) the strengthening of the training scheme, in particular to social workers and
beneficiaries. At the time the above procedures were refined, changes were concurrently made in
the Operational Manual, in particular with respect to appeal processes, household information
verification, treatment of uncollected checks and case management.

During the second period, the Bank, at the request of the GOJ, approved on November 16, 2003 a
temporary waiver on the fulfillment of the disbursement condition for the grant category of
expenditures set for in Schedule 1, paragraphs 3(b) (i) and (ii) requiring the GOJ to submit
evidence of operational audits as a condition for the Bank to reimburse under such a category.
The significant delay shown by the MLSS in producing this evidence (operational audits) and the
fact that the GOJ was running out of cash to continue financing 100 percent these expenditures
motivated the Bank to temporarily waive this conditionality. As a consequence, accumulated
Loan disbursement jumped from US$2.3 million in November 2003 to US$7.26 million one
month later.

Recognizing the severe fiscal constraints existing in Jamaica towards the end of 2005, GOJ, in
compliance with paragraph 3 to Schedule 5 of the LA, addressed the erosion of the purchasing
power of the PATH benefit caused by inflation, increasing the PATH benefits from J$400 to
J$530 per beneficiary per month effective January 2006. During the third period the PATH
benefits were: (i) again increased by 23 percent from J$530 to J$650 per beneficiary per month


                                                12
effective April 1, 2008; and (ii) modified and increased one more time, differentiating the
increase by gender and level of education as shown in the table 3 below. The differentiation of
benefits by gender and grade was meant to address an equity issue of boys' school attendance
being worse than those for girls and to encourage secondary school students to continue and
complete high school. This increase became effective at the end of 2008, and is currently used in
the follow-up Bank-financed operation.

School attendance compliance among PATH beneficiaries remained relatively high at 85 percent,
and the health compliance for children under 12 months old at 80 percent. But health compliance
for children over 12 months old remained low at 55 percent. Accordingly, a series of quantitative
and qualitative studies to understand the causes were carried out by the implementing unit within
the MLSS, an intensive media drive (including newspaper advertising, radio messages in 3
stations and beneficiary meetings) was carried out and training on compliance management
provided to health personnel. These measures drove the health compliance rate for children in the
12-71 month cohort to about 66 percent, but still well below the 90 percent target set at appraisal.
Despite the fact that during the third period these compliances will further improve (as reflected
in the data sheet), they continue to be an issue at the time of writing the ICR.

With expansion, improving targeting mechanisms and periodic recertification of PATH
beneficiaries became very important activities at the end of this second period. Accordingly, a
decision was made by the MLSS to recertify PATH households every 4 years instead of two as
included in the original design. However, as explained elsewhere in the ICR, the recertification
procedure to determine continued eligibility or exit from the PATH could not be completed
before the closing of the loan and a massive recertification of approximately 40,000 families who
have been in the program for more than four years is being carried out at the time of the writing
of the ICR and expected to be completed by September 30, 2009.

Third period. This time-period is characterized by the consolidation of the PATH and ensuring its
institutional, financial and technical sustainability. One of the first key decisions taken at the start
of this third period was to amend the LA, coincidental with the expiration of the contracts of the
operational auditors. Given the continuous delays in the MLSS presenting timely operational
audits, the Bank and the GOJ decided to de-link the operational audits as a condition for the Bank
to reimburse against the grant category of expenditure. The idea was twofold: (i) convert the
operational audits into a project management instrument rather than a disbursement condition;
and (ii) strengthen the internal audit to carry out this function in a more-timely manner.
Accordingly, the GOJ requested on August 17, 2007, and the Bank approved on November 5,
2007 an amendment to the LA deleting paragraphs 3.06 (c) and 3(b) (i) of Schedule I requiring
the furnishing of operational audits as a condition to reimburse against the grant category of
expenditure. Subsequent disbursement of funds against the grant category of expenditure after
October 2006 was only subjected to the submission of PMRs and internal audit reports. As a
consequence of this amendment: (a) the operational audits (no longer required as a condition for
disbursement) were replaced by quality control reviews through process evaluations including

                                                     13
spot checks, focus groups, expert observations and semi-structured interviews with key
stakeholders; and (b) the internal auditing was strengthened to cover key aspects related to: intake,
compliance, payments and uncollected checks among others.

The health compliance requiring six health visits per year for PATH children less than 12 months
overloaded the health delivery system and was reduced to four visits per year keeping in line with
the Ministry of Health's protocols for children in that age cohort. A pilot on parenting education
(to replace some of the health center visits for children one to six years) was carried out in 4
parishes. However, parenting education could not be extended nationwide because of limited
capacity to provide this type of service.

During this period and for the first time in the entire implementation cycle, the reconciliation of
the beneficiary account was updated and reflected in the financial reporting. Inconsistencies with
the registration of education compliance with respect to the attendance of PATH beneficiaries at
multiple- versus single-shift schools were also addressed towards the end of the implementation
cycle. This inconsistency related to PATH students from single-shift schools arriving late that
were marked present (and thus entitled to the benefit) while students arriving late (but not being
absent) at multiple-shift schools that were marked absent (and thus, not entitled to the benefit).
Although this inconsistency issue has decreased somehow, it has not yet been fully addressed
nationwide.

Also during the second half of the implementation cycle, at the encouragement of the Bank and
financed by the Loan, the MLSS carried out consistent and periodic internal audits as an effective
means to address and correct some of the following operational issues: (i) some checks being
prepared for deceased beneficiaries; (ii) some checks being provided to non-eligible PATH
beneficiaries (for example, people receiving a pension from the national insurance system); (iii)
insufficient follow-ups by the social workers on some uncollected checks; (iv) retention of dated
checks at the Parishes offices instead of being returned to the Head Office; (v) insufficient
accountability to PATH once beneficiary checks were delivered to the Poor Relief Office; (vi)
some appeal cases not investigated by social workers; and (vii) standard internal controls still
lacking in the MIS. For example, about J$2.8 million of fraudulent checks were cashed, but that
money was later recovered by the GOJ and refunded to the project in July 2008. The findings
from internal audits allowed the PATH management to promptly address problems and step up
measure to prevent errors.

Reallocations between the different expenditure categories in the LA. After the findings of the
impact evaluation and quality assessment were made available showing positive PATH outcomes,
a decision was made by GOJ supported by the Bank team to reallocate a significant amount of the
Loan proceeds to the category of grants to finance the envisaged increase in the number of
beneficiaries. Accordingly, as shown in table 4 below, this category increased by almost 20
percent with respect to the allocation set at appraisal. As a consequence, goods and consultants
were decreased, the former by almost 56 percent and the latter by 36 percent, and the unallocated
was shifted to grants. GOJ ended up financing most of the required technical assistance in the
latter period of the implementation cycle.

Extension to the closing date. The Loan's original closing date of June 30, 2006 was extended
twice at the request of the GOJ. On June 16, 2006 the Bank approved a first extension of the
closing date of 21 months (to March 31, 2008) on the basis of the additional time needed to: (i)
select a qualified consulting firm to develop and install an appropriate comprehensive PATH-
related MIS; and (ii) complete the recertification process based on the new scoring formula for
the BIS. On February 27, 2008 the Bank approved a second extension of 12 months (to March 31,
2009) to allow the MIS to function and to complete the recertification process. The MIS has been
installed and tested while the recertification will be completed by September 30, 2009.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The monitoring and evaluation system and the baseline data were not ready at the time of Board
approval and no specific metric was in place to measure the attributes of "better" and "cost-
effectiveness" included in the statement of the PDO. Nevertheless, most of these gaps were
quickly addressed during the implementation cycle resulting in the PATH benefiting from an
appropriate M&E scheme. A baseline was completed by the second quarter of 2004, while
outcome and output indicators were first reported to Bank management in the Implementation
Status and Results Report (ISR) #9 dated April 28, 2005. Once reported, they were updated in
each subsequent ISR in a consistent fashion.

The PATH's M&E is based on 4 complementary elements: (i) an MIS to monitor inputs (physical
and financial indicators) and products (transfers received by intended beneficiaries); (ii)
qualitative assessments of the processes concerning program implementation to assess:
beneficiaries' knowledge and understanding of the PATH program, clients' perception of
changing behavior and of the quality of services delivery (education, health and distribution of
the grants) and to garner other beneficiaries' concerns, comments and recommendations; (iii)
tailor-made impact evaluation studies to assess results (such as access to the PATH, targeting
effectiveness, use of health services and student attendance in school) and impact (effects of
conditional cash transfer on key PATH outcome indicators in education and health); and (iv)
occasional tailor-made studies on specific topics of interest to the PATH.

MIS. The monitoring of inputs and products was to be carried through a tailor-made MIS. At the
early stages of the implementation cycle, two modules of the MIS (enrollment and targeting)
were developed by the MLSS in-house. A decision was then taken by the MLSS to develop the
remaining modules in-house, which proved to be a poor decision since it deprived the PATH of a
MIS for a significant part of its implementation cycle. In 2008, a qualified consulting firm was
selected to develop the remaining modules of the MIS. At the writing of the ICR, the MIS has

                                              15
been installed and tested and is to be made active October 1, 2009. Training for the utilization of
this new MIS has already begun in all the parishes and the city of Kingston.

The modules developed for the MIS provided useful information on: (i) the number and
distribution of active beneficiaries; (ii) the percentage compliant with health and education cash
transfer conditionalities; (iii) payments; (iv) the number of uncollected checks; and (v) the
number of beneficiaries not collecting more than three times and thus suspended from the system.
This feedback was used to fine-tune the PATH and its operational manual.

Qualitative assessments. The qualitative monitoring of program implementation was done
through two specially designed qualitative beneficiary assessments (April 2004 and December
2005). These assessments were carried out by the same firm that undertook the impact evaluation
study, which in turn, sub-contracted with other two qualified consulting firms under terms of
reference satisfactory to the Bank. These assessments were mostly circumscribed to gauge the
understanding of programs requirements and satisfaction among beneficiaries and other
stakeholders.

Impact evaluation study. The impact evaluation on school attendance and use of preventive
health services was carried out only once 18 months before the loans' original closing date. This
study was commissioned to a qualified consulting agency under terms of reference satisfactory to
the Bank. Because of the encouraging findings of this impact evaluation study (as further
detailed in section 3.2 of the ICR), its significant cost (of about US$500,000) and the findings
from similar programs in the region, a decision was made by GOJ and the Bank not to conduct a
second impact evaluation when the original closing date of the Loan was extended. The follow-
up operation includes financing for a second impact evaluation that will measure the long term
impact.

The findings of the impact evaluation study were reviewed and discussed by an ample group of
stakeholders in early 2006 (six months prior to the original closing of the loan) and they were
subsequently disseminated. The findings provided key inputs in improving the design of the
follow-up operation (described in section 2.5 of the ICR). The impact evaluation database was
made available to researchers through the Derek Gordon Data Bank at the University of the West
Indies. The key findings of the study are described in section 3.2 of the ICR.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

As further described in sections 2.1 and 5.1 (a) of the ICR, financial and procurement capacity
assessments were undertaken during the preparation cycle, finding gaps and providing
recommendations. The financial assessment found that overall the MLSS had well-established
financial management procedures satisfactory to the Bank but needed to strengthen the
monitoring aspects of the cash-transfer operations. The procurement assessment found that the
MLSS was not well equipped to carry out the acquisition of goods and services following Bank
procedures and an action plan to address these gaps was agreed between the MLSS and the Bank.
However, the Bank team did not ensure that these financial and procurement recommendations
were implemented in a timely manner by the MLSS around the time of Board approval.
Accordingly, the ICR states that neither adequate procurement nor financial management was
implemented at the time of loan effectiveness.

It took four months after loan effectiveness to fill the procurement position at the Public
Assistance Division with a qualified staff. In addition, the procurement processes for the
selection of the payment agency, the qualified consulting firm to develop the financial

                                                16
management computerized system, the operational auditors, the training and the development of
user-friendly training materials, the monitoring and impact evaluation studies and the
dissemination campaign were significantly delayed by over a year after loan effectiveness.
Downgrading the procurement rating to unsatisfactory in some of the early supervision reports
reflected this situation. It would take until August 2003, 18 months after loan effectiveness, to
complete all of the above procurement processes, except the MIS process which will complete at
the end of the implementation cycle.

Once the procurement gaps were satisfactorily addressed by the Public Assistance Division,
procurement of goods and services were carried out in a satisfactory manner following Bank
procedures as demonstrated in the procurement ex-post reviews, which were carried out at least
once a year from 2004 onwards. These reviews found the procurement staff to have acceptable
qualifications and experience in Bank procedures. The procurement filing was well-kept.

Several financial management-targeted supervision missions were carried out. Some of these
missions detected weaknesses in the financial management of the project and reflected this
situation by downgrading the corresponding rating in the ISRs. These weaknesses were mainly
concerned with: (i) the delay in computerizing the accounting system, which had been done
manually; (ii) the lack of timely reconciliation of the beneficiary account; (iii) the untimely
processing of uncollected checks; and (iv) the delay in submitting the operational audits. In time,
all of these issues, except the one of the operational audits, were satisfactorily addressed. For
example, the computerized financial management became ready by second quarter of 2005 (more
than three years after loan effectiveness).

Section 2.2 of the ICR describes in great detail the reasons for the disbursement waiver that was
granted to this project and the subsequent LA amendment that was required to address this issue.

There were delays in submitting the annual audit reports on time, although all of them were
unqualified (clean) and found by the Bank financial management team to be satisfactory. The
Bank was also provided with the quarterly financial management reports (FMRs) and the PMRs.

The supervision missions consistently rated procurement and financial management from
moderately satisfactory to satisfactory with respect to compliance with Bank's procurement and
financial management procedures.

There were no environmental issues to be addressed by this project during the entire
implementation cycle.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

A follow-up US$115 million operation, Jamaica Social Protection Project (P105024, being
partially financed by a Bank Loan of US$40 million and GOJ counterpart funding of US$75
million (65 percent of the total cost) was approved by the Board on May 8, 2008. This new
operation aims at: (i) continuing further improvements of the effectiveness of the PATH to foster
investment by poor families in human capital accumulation (mainly through education and
health); (ii) developing a structured system for assisting working-age members of PATH eligible
households to seek and retain employment; (iii) enabling the formulation of a reform program for
the public sector pension schemes; and (iv) developing a holistic social protection strategy.
According to the two supervision mission, implementation progress has been rated satisfactory.



                                                17
This new operation continues: (i) implementing the conditional PATH cash-transfers to children
and youngsters in the 0-19 year-old cohort, but now through a performance-based disbursement
scheme and a new scheme of benefits differentiated by grade level and gender to offset the
opportunity cost of schooling as shown before in table 3; and (ii) supporting PATH's institutional
strengthening in the areas of administration, financial management, monitoring and evaluation.
This new operation is expected to finance the carrying out of an impact evaluation study to assess
the long-term behavioral change pattern among PATH beneficiaries who have graduated from the
program and are no longer receiving PATH benefits.

The new activities not included in the previous operation are: (a) building capacity for the Steps-
to-Work program for working-age members of PATH eligible households to seek and retain
employment; and (b) improving the public sector pension system administration and building
capacity for reform. The rationale for including these new activities is that there is a need to
strengthen the overall social protection system, not only the social safety net.

This MLSS has overall project execution responsibility and it is also the implementing agency for
the PATH and Steps-to-Work components. The Ministry of Finance and Public Services is the
implementing agency of the pension reform component while the PIOJ is the implementing
agency of the component corresponding to the development of a holistic social protection strategy
in Jamaica. A project manager and two component coordinators (one for the pensions component
and one for the holistic social protection strategy component) have been recruited to help
implement the project. Qualified staff in the Public Assistance Division are dedicated full time to
address the financial management and procurement requirements of the PATH program and the
new Bank-financed operation.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

At the lending stage. The project PDOs were consistent with those outlined in the previously-
existing Bank's Jamaica Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for 2001-2002 (Report 21187- JM of
November 2, 2000), discussed by the Board on November 30, 2000. Accordingly, the project
rested on the following two of the four pillars of the CAS: (i) ensuring that growth would be
inclusive and the poor were adequately protected; and (ii) improving governance, efficiency and
effectiveness in the public sector.

The CAS provided the context for a poverty-reduction project design based on the following three
principles: (a) a focus on the Bank's core mandate of poverty reduction; (b) a focus on areas
where the Bank had comparative advantages; and (c) a focus on complementarity with other
development partners. The project design translated directly to the CAS goal of "protecting the
poor and ensuring inclusion" by enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the social safety
net, focusing particularly on improving assistance to the poorest.

Current GOJ's policy and Bank strategy. The project's PDOs is also consistent with the
current CASs for Jamaica (Report 31830-JM dated April 2006) covering the period 2006-2009.
A Progress Report on this CAS (Report 39969-JM) was discussed by the Board on July 19, 2007.

The project addresses the following two of the three pillars - accelerating inclusive economic
growth and improving human development and opportunity ­ as well as one of the two
crosscutting themes ­ governance ­ included in the current CAS. The institutional strengthening

                                                18
of the MLSS through unification of all cash assistance programs and better targeting of the poor
and vulnerable financed by the project, contributed to the continuing public sector reform aimed
by the first pillar as well with enhancing effectiveness of public resource utilization included in
the first crosscutting theme of the current CAS. The education grants to ensure student
attendance in primary education and increased enrollment in secondary education as well as the
social assistance grants, in particular those targeted to adult-health related issues, contributed to
the achievement of the second pillar of the current CAS. Therefore, the Project's PDO currently
continues to be highly relevant.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

This section summarizes progress in terms of the PDO outcomes and output indicators as detailed
in the ICR's Data Sheet. Annex 2 of the ICR provides further details on the achievements of the
Project's components while Section 3.3 and Annex 3 present the efficiency and economic
analysis.

The PDO could have been worded in a more precise way to define what the specific outcomes
were, because the outcomes could only be discerned from the indicators. Looking back on the
totality of PDO stated in the PAD and the key associated outcome indicators the ICR rates the
achievement of PDO as satisfactory.

Assessment of PDO outcome achievements. A rigorous impact evaluation has revealed that due
to PATH there has been a 38% increase in the health care visits for children 0 to 6 years-old
which has resulted in some of the improvements in the levels of immunization rates among
children. The program has also been effective at encouraging households to send their children to
school with greater regularity; school attendance rates of PATH students are 3% higher than that
of similar students not in the program. The enrollment for secondary school students has also
improved, most notably for the 15-16 years old where the increase was 14% relative to the
baseline, though this change cannot be entirely attributed to the PATH program. While 87% poor
pregnant/lactating mothers visit health centers for timely check-ups, no assessment could be made
of the net change because of the difficulty of selecting a control group and the small size of the
sample. No assessment was ever made of the net change in poor elderly, disabled and other
beneficiaries visiting health center because government decided to remove the conditionality for
poor elderly and disabled. While the expenditure channeled through PATH as a share of overall
SSN expenditures felt short by 17% of the target, it is expected that it will increase further
following the substantial increase in the number of beneficiaries and in the level of benefit that
has occurred towards the end of the project. Two qualitative assessments revealed that
beneficiaries were satisfied, considering PATH better than the previous Food Stamps program
and they appreciated the fact that, apart from the cash benefit, their children also benefited from
free textbooks, school lunches, and secondary school fee exemptions.

On balance, only four of the eight outcome targets have been met but the one that were achieved
were really the key outcomes expected from this type of programs.

At the time the ISRs were introduced in the Bank as the official format to communicate
supervisions' findings on or about 2004 (after the date of the Board approval), a directive was
issued by the Bank's Operations Policy Department to limit the number of outcome indicators to
no more than four or five. The ICR notes that the task team leader (TTL) applied this
recommendation reducing the supervision reporting to only 4 outcome and 2 output indicators,



                                                 19
except in the last two ISRs (#18 of 12-19-08 and #19 of 03-31-09), where the reporting was done
on the totality of outcome and output indicators included in the Supplemental Letter to the LA.

The ICR also notes that there is not a strict symmetry between the outcome and output indicators
listed in the Supplemental Letter to the LA and those reported in the ISR. For example, some
indicators listed as outputs in the Supplemental Letter, such as school attendance and health care
utilization by children 0-6 and not enrolled in school, were rephrased as outcomes in the ISRs.
The wording of one of the output indicators was slightly changed from "number of beneficiaries"
as it appears in the Supplemental Letter to the LA to "number of children receiving the transfers
regularly every two months" as it appears in the PAD and the ISRs.

The outcome and output indicators included in the Data Sheet of the ICR mirror those of the
Supplemental Letter to the LA. The source of information of these indicators is the last ISR #19
of 03-31-09, the PMR dated November 2008 and the information gathered during the ICR
mission. According to this information, the ICR rates the overall achievement towards the targets
set for the outcome and output indicators at the appraisal as satisfactory.

3.3 Efficiency

Economic Analysis. The largest expected benefits from PATH are those associated with gains in
education due to both an income and a price effect associated with the conditionality of minimum
school attendance required of school-age children. An impact evaluation found that PATH has
already contributed to an increase in school attendance: children in PATH have school attendance
rates that are 3% higher than similar children in non-beneficiary households. The government
introduced a differentiated scheme of incentives to compensate secondary school students for
higher opportunity costs, in particular for boys, and to motivate them to finish high school and
continue on to tertiary education or training. Simulations confirm that the additional benefits for
boys and secondary level students will contribute to higher retention. The share of boys in lower
secondary school with more than 85% attendance is projected to increase from 44% (the actual
figures in 2006 after receiving the existing benefit) to 48% after the receipt of the increased
benefits. The school attendance for upper secondary male students is expected to increase from
77% to 79%. Under the hypothesis that the observed short-run effect of the program is stable
over time, and that the actual structure of returns to education persist over time, the actual design
of the PATH would lead to an increment of 0.73 years of schooling for children exposed to the
program that can be later translated to a 7% increase in earning capacity for these children.
Detailed results of these simulations are presented in Annex 3.

PATH grants are directed at the poorest households in the country and with more than 80% of the
benefits going to the poorest two consumption quintiles, they help to reduce poverty and
inequality. Simulation results using 2006 Jamaica Survey of Living Conditions data suggest that
the Program is associated with a reduction of 8% in the poverty headcount index, 10% in the
poverty gap, and 13% in the severity of poverty. In addition, inequality could be reduced by
1.5%. These estimates improve significantly after the PATH increased the size of the benefits as
it did in April 2008 (when the base benefit increased from J$530 to J$650) and December 2009
(when benefits were further increased for boys at all grade levels and for lower and secondary
school level students).

Fiscal and Financial Analysis. The main investment of the project, the conditional cash
transfers, had a cost of about US$21 million in 2007, the equivalent of 0.2% of GDP or 1.2% of
primary budgetary expenditures. The cost of the PATH Program is expected to increase to


                                                 20
US$30 million in 2009, because of the increase in the number of beneficiaries and the
introduction of additional incentives for secondary school students. As a share of GDP, the cost
of PATH will stay in the range of 0.22-0.24% which is lower than similar programs in Brazil,
Mexico, and Colombia. The administrative cost of running PATH averages 10%, in line with
what is considered best practice given the size of the program.

Even if we do not have sufficient evidence to assess the cost-effectiveness there is a lot of
evidence that the SSN has become better and more efficient. Most notably: (i) two of the three
SSN programs, Food Stamps and Old Age and Incapacity, were consolidated, and the third,
Outdoor Poor Relief, was partially merged (full consolidation of Poor Relief pending approval of
a new legislation); (ii) benefits increased to meaningful levels; (iii) delivery of benefits is done in
a timely and efficient manner using the postal services and the banking system; and (iv) leakages
were significantly reduced under the project due to the development of a Beneficiary
Identification System (BIS) based on a proxy-means test; same BIS has been used by other
programs including secondary school fee and health fee waivers thus triggering improved
targeting in other programs. In addition, institutional capacity of the MLSS was strengthened not
only in terms of improved targeting mechanisms with less type I (exclusion) and II (leakage)
errors, but also in setting clear procedures for enrolling beneficiaries through the MLSS parish
offices, recertifying periodically their eligibility status, and obtaining timely information from
schools and health centers about compliance with PATH conditionalities and feeding the
information for payment purposes.

The ICR rates the efficiency of this Project as satisfactory based on the positive results from both
a rigorous impact evaluation and from the simulated effects of the program on poverty indicators
and returns to education, and on the reasonable administrative costs.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Based on the assessment of the PDO which continues to be highly relevant, the achievement of
the outcome and output indicators which is satisfactory, and that efficiency is also satisfactory,
the overall outcome of this Project as satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

According to the findings of the 2006 Jamaican Survey of Living Conditions, the country has
made significant gains in reducing poverty as evidenced by the decline in the poverty headcount
from 30.4 percent in 1989 to 14.3 percent in 2006. Poverty reduction remains, however, a
priority for the GOJ and a development challenge. Although direct causality ca not be attributed,
the ICR asserts that the PATH, which covers the extremely poor population in Jamaica (first
quintile), has positively contributed to this reduction for the following reasons:

(i)      The transfers contributed to the reduction of consumption deficit among poor
beneficiaries. The average transfer represented about 10 percent of average consumption of the
bottom quintile. Although the benefit increased in real terms three times during the life of the
project, it is much smaller than in other similar programs and has contributed marginally to
improve consumption. In addition, PATH beneficiaries are also entitled to: (a) school feeding
and; (b) school and health fee waivers, until these fees were eliminated by the GOJ (in education


                                                  21
in 2007 and in health in 2008).       As a result, PATH has improved current household's
consumption; and

(ii)    It reduced the opportunity cost of investing in preventive health care and education. By
conditioning the transfers on compliance with the use of these services and guaranteeing free
access to them, the PATH removes demand constraints. Hence, by increasing investments in
human capital during childhood and youth it also increases the level of schooling and thus the
likelihood of finding productive employment. According to the latest Bank Poverty Assessment
(2007), the poverty headcount drops significantly only after the head of the household has
completed the second cycle of secondary school.

(b)     Institutional Change/Strengthening

On the institutional aspects, PATH made significant contributions along the following two major
complementary dimensions: (i) strengthening of the MLSS; and (ii) garnering inter-institutional
support for the implementation, scaling up and fine-tuning of the GOJ's SSN agenda championed
by the PIOJ.

Along with the strengthening of the MLSS, one major achievement of the project was the
institutionalization of the PATH within the regular operations of the Public Assistance Division
of the MLSS, including a follow-up operation mentioned elsewhere in the ICR. The offices of
the MLSS in the Parishes have been strengthened to improve the delivery of the services,
including the carrying out of case management.

Notwithstanding the above, the challenge faced by GOJ is how to adjust periodically the
institutional capacity required by PATH at the national and parish levels in the context of severe
budgetary fiscal constraints and increased number of beneficiaries, while ensuring in the process
that the quality of the PATH is not jeopardized and the productivity of PATH-related staff is
improved. This adjustment will have to consider, among other things: (i) the workload of the
social workers at the parish level; and (b) the further strengthening of the appeals committees.

Along the second institutional dimension, the ICR identifies the following accomplishments: (i)
establishment of the ongoing SSN Reform Steering (for SSN-related policy matters advice to the
Cabinet and the Prime Minister's office), Targeting (inter-institutional technical body) and PATH
Implementation Committees (for operational oversight) with large representation of other
Ministries and Agencies ensuring better coordination among SSN stakeholders, more effective
targeting of SSN programs and more effective and efficient operation of the PATH; (ii) increased
expenditures on the SSN programs (from 2 percent of GDP in 2002 to 2.8 percent in 2008); (iii)
merging of once uncoordinated SSN programs (about 16.1 percent of all the SSN-related
resources are being channeled through PATH); and (iv) improving targeting and coverage. The
use of the Beneficiary Identification System developed under PATH to target beneficiaries by
most of the SSN programs has resulted in: (a) less duplication of administrative systems and
lower direct costs to the programs and indirect costs to the beneficiaries; (b) improved
transparency of eligibility criteria and application of procedures; and (c) reduced type I
(exclusion) and II (leakage) errors that were prevalent before 2002. In addition, having a
transparent and objective targeting mechanism, on the other hand, has prepared the GOJ, among
other things, to target and provide relief more quickly to victims of natural disasters.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
None

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

Not Applicable

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

The ICR rates as low to negligible the risk that some changes may occur that will be detrimental
to the ultimate achievement of the PDOs for the following three reasons.

First, there has been continuous political support for the PATH, and this has not faltered since its
creation in 2001 despite the democratic change of government in 2007. The PATH is considered
the flagship social assistance program in the country within the SSN umbrella, covering a large
share of the poor (about 307,000 at the time of writing the ICR) and has been shown, through a
rigorous independent impact evaluation study to be well targeted and to have increased the school
attendance of poor children as well as their use of preventive-health services.

Second, there is financial sustainability. Despite PATH being the largest social assistance
program in the country, its total cost, at 0.3 percent of Jamaica's GDP, is relatively small
compared to similar programs in the region. Whereas in the previous operation the GOJ financed
48 percent of the total cost (US$37.5 million out of US$77.5 million), for the new 2008 operation,
the counterpart funding has increased in relative (65 percent) and absolute terms (US$75 million
out of US$115 million). This is a clear signal of long-term financial commitment to the PATH.

Third, there is institutional and technical sustainability as the PATH is mainstreamed within the
MLSS and is managed by a team of seasoned staff in the Public Assistance Division and the
MLSS's Parish offices. Most of the team assigned to the new operation also participated in the
implementation of the previous project (the one closing March 31, 2009).

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

According to the project files, the lending cycle took about 32 months comprising 13 missions
from the pre-identification (January 11-19, 1999) to Board approval (September 4, 2001)
including a Project Concept Document (PCD) review meeting on November 8, 2000, appraisal
(June 18-22, 2001) and negotiations (July 18-20, 2001).

Lending cycle. For the sake of this assessment, we distinguish between two periods. The first
one totaling 6 exploratory missions running from early January 1999 to November 2000, included
two pre-identification attempts (in January and September 1999) in conjunction with some
analytical work-related missions (for the preparation of the Youth at Risk Policy Note), some
complementary studies (such as, inter-alia, a Social Safety Net Assessment, a Public Expenditure
Review, a Labor Market Review and a Profile of the Poor) and broader policy dialogue through a
workshop held in Jamaica in April 2000. The second period, running from the PCD review
meeting in November 2000 until Board presentation, included 5 preparation missions (comprising


                                                23
two short financial management-related ones), one pre-appraisal (April 23 ­May 1, 2001) and one
appraisal mission (June 18, 2001).

The project design benefited from a Quality Enhancement Review (QER) carried out on February
23, 2001. The QER panelist provided valuable guidance and recommendations on the following
project design-related topics: scoring formula, appeal mechanism, payment mechanism, public
information campaign, case management approach and sustainability of level of benefits. These
recommendations were included in the project design.

Preparation costs were partially financed by two Japanese PHRD grants: (i) the Bank-executed
TF025979 of US$600,000 signed by the GOJ on September 2, 1999 and closed on July 31, 2001;
and (ii) the GOJ executed TF026843 of US$130,000 signed by the GOJ on August 13, 2001 and
closed on December 4, 2001. The total documented disbursed grant proceeds amounted to
US$631,701 (86.5 percent of the total) and were utilized to finance the review of social assistance
programs in Jamaica and the updating of a poverty map for Jamaica based on the 1998 Living
Standards Measurement Survey and the latest Population Census to improve the targeting
mechanisms required in the proposed Bank-financed operation. In addition, these grants also
financed the carrying out of tailor-made studies and workshops with Jamaican policy makers and
relevant representatives from the civil society and representatives of the private sector to
determine and collectively agree upon the scope of the social safety net reforms needed in the
country and to elicit the participation of key stakeholders in the design of the proposed Bank-
financed SSN operation.

The Bank provided effective project preparation support to the GOJ through a highly qualified
and experienced core Bank team (as listed in Annex 4 of the ICR), which was also familiar with
the preparation and implementation of the then ongoing Bank-financed SSN operation (Jamaica
Social Investment Fund through Loan 4088-JM) and with the preparation of the Youth at Risk
Policy Note. When specific technical issues required attention, the Bank team drew on senior
expertise from across the Bank and from outside the Bank. While two different TTLs carried out
the two pre-identification attempts, from the third quarter of 1999 onwards, only one TTL was
assigned to this operation during the entire lending cycle until Board approval, including a
significant part of the implementation cycle, thus providing a welcomed continuity during the
preparation phase.

As already mentioned in Section 2.1, the ICR rated the quality at entry of this Project as
moderately satisfactory. What follows is a more detailed explanation on the reasons for this
rating, highlighting the strengths as well as the shortfalls emerging from the assessment of the
Project's lending cycle file along the dimensions appearing in bold.

Strategic relevance and approach. Project preparation benefited from: (i) a series of studies to
assess the SSN programs, the labor market and the existing pension system in Jamaica as well as
to review the country's social sector expenditure and provide a profile of the poor; and (ii)
consultative workshops financed by the Bank pointing to the need for reform in social services to
reduce fragmentation and duplication, to improve targeting of benefits and to increase the
coverage of the poor and vulnerable population in Jamaica.

The project design reflected clarity in the relationship between the policy reforms (sought to
enable sector-wide improvements in the SSN programs) and the project interventions (directed
towards the poor and vulnerable population). To ensure a focused project design, a series of other
alternatives, amply explained in section D1 of the PAD, were rightly excluded.


                                                24
The selection of a four-year sector investment loan as the financial instrument to gradually
achieve GOJ's SSN reform objective seems also to have been a correct decision by the Bank team.
The Bank team however was overly optimistic about the duration of the implementation cycle
given the lack of readiness conditions at the time of Board approval as mentioned elsewhere in
the ICR.

Level of GOJ's ownership and client orientation. The Bank team demonstrated a rich
understanding of the Jamaican social context and key issues that GOJ was interested in
addressing in the SSN sector. The Bank team ensured broad range participation in the conceptual
discussion of the reform as well as with the project design including several government agencies
(MLSS, PIOJ, the Ministries of Education, Youth and Culture and of Health and Environment),
academic and civil society representatives. As further described in section 5.2 (a) of the ICR, the
GOJ provided clear signs of its full support to the SSN reform during the entire lending cycle.
The signals of ownership and long-term commitment to the SSN reform sent by the GOJ
increased the likelihood of a follow-up operation at the closing of the Loan, which actually
happened with a new SSN protection operation covering the period 2008-2013.

Partnerships. This operation did not elicit the financial participation of other multi-lateral or
bilateral agencies. However, the proposed Bank-financed operation was seen as part of a broader
coordinated effort of financial and technical assistance requested by the GOJ from the donor
community to support the implementation of the SSN reform. The IDB, for example was
preparing a complementary US$40 million SSN sector loan to protect social sector and safety net
spending during a period of strong fiscal adjustment and to restructure and better target the
school-feeding program. Therefore, during the entire preparation cycle, the Bank team developed
good working relationships and ensured effective coordination with the IDB.

PDOs, outcome and output indicators. As already explained in sections 2.3 and 3.2, the ICR is
of the view that the PDOs were poorly defined and no baseline information for the agreed
outcome and output indicators was made available at the time of Board approval.

Technical, financial and economic aspects. The project files seem to indicate that the Bank
team was well aware of the operational technicalities associated with cash-transfer programs,
including targeting and scoring formulas, enrollment of beneficiaries and linking of benefits
payments to compliance with behavioral conditionalities. This technical knowledge was provided
by other similar cash-transfer programs financed by the Bank at that time, for example, Progresa
in Mexico and Bolsa Escola in Brazil. The team was, however, not familiar with the operational
and technical characteristics of the operational audits which were added as a covenant to the LA
during negotiations.

The Bank team carried out several cost benefit analyses under different scenarios to gauge the
expected benefits from providing conditional cash transfer to the poor and vulnerable population.
Under one scenario, assuming 236,000 beneficiaries with a cap of three children per household,
the education grant resulted in a 16 percent rate of return, while a second scenario, with no cap on
the number of children per household, the education grant rate of return more than doubled to
about 35 percent. Presented with the various findings, GOJ elected to pursue the former. Some
benefits, such as the health ones, were not quantified in the cost benefit analysis due to lack of
data. Efficiency gains from unifying all the SSN programs could not be estimated either at the
time of preparation.

A fiscal impact over the four-year implementation cycle was estimated by the Bank team
resulting in GOJ being in a position to finance the entire PATH with its own resources at the

                                                25
closing of the Loan. In order to ensure that this would happen, the Bank team rightly decided to
finance the institutional strengthening component of the project on a declining basis, while
keeping constant the share allocated to child assistance educational and health grants.

Implementation arrangements. The implementation arrangements for this project were the
appropriate ones. MLSS, through its Public Assistance Division was assigned overall
responsibility of project management, in particular, the fiduciary responsibilities of procurement
and financial management as well as with the tasks of planning, training, dissemination
campaigns, monitoring and evaluation. No parallel Project Coordination Unit was created though
additional staff had to be recruited as consultants to fill in positions in MIS, training and media,
monitoring and evaluation, procurement, and financial management. This mix was considered by
government as a hybrid project unit. The 13 MLSS's Parish Offices were assigned the
responsibility of executing the project at the local level. An institutional capacity assessment was
carried out in the MLSS to identify gaps likely to hinder timely implementation of the UBP.

Implementation readiness conditions. A thorough review of the project files, especially those
concerning the lending and first two-years of the project implementation cycle lead the ICR to
conclude that the implementation readiness conditions were not fully present at the time of Board
approval for the following six reasons.

First, the inclusion of effectiveness conditions beyond the Borrower's legal opinion caused some
implementation delays. The project's LA included three conditions for effectiveness, the first one
being the adoption by the Borrower of an Operational Manual acceptable to the Bank. The
version accepted by the GOJ and the Bank in February 28, 2002 as a sign of compliance with this
condition of effectiveness was incomplete, as it lacked, for example annexes on: family
guidelines, education guidelines, health guidelines, social workers' manual, targeting manual,
enrollment manual, appeals committee guidelines, monitoring indicators and operational
guidelines. This draft would undergo several modifications during the implementation cycle; the
first one in March 2003 derived from the findings of the PATH's piloting in the St. Catherine
Parish. The other two conditions for effectiveness were: (i) the appointment by the Borrower of
the financial auditors under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank; and (ii) the establishment
of a financial management system in the MLSS also satisfactory to the Bank. These conditions
were satisfied in February 2002, two months after the expected date of effectiveness consigned in
the PAD and 5 months after Board Approval.

Current good practices in the Bank point to the fact that no conditions of effectiveness are
desirable beyond the legal opinion of Government's competent authority. Furthermore,
nowadays, to complete an appraisal the Bank recommends that an Operational Manual,
satisfactory to the Bank be agreed with the Borrower.

Second, no first-year implementation plan satisfactory to the Bank was available at the time of
Board approval. One was produced at the time of approval of the first draft of the Operational
Manual.

Third, despite the gaps highlighted by the institutional capacity assessment undertaken in the
MLSS during the lending cycle, the Bank team completed the appraisal and proceeded for
negotiations and Board approval without ensuring that these gaps had been adequately addressed
by the MLSS. Accordingly, and as stated in the Project Status Report (PSR) number 3 dated
December 17, 2002, almost one year after project effectiveness, the MLSS had not yet developed
the managerial capacity to run the PATH. Key positions associated, for example, with the


                                                26
management of the MIS, the training and development of training materials, the operational
audits, the dissemination campaign and monitoring and evaluation had not yet been filled.

Fourth, despite the procurement capacity assessment undertaken during the lending cycle there
was no procurement readiness even at the time of loan effectiveness. The Public Assistance
Division took some time in filling the procurement position with a qualified staff. In addition,
the procurement processes for the selection of qualified consulting firms to developed the MIS,
the financial management computerized system, the operational audits, the training and the
development of friendly-user training materials, of the monitoring and impact evaluation studies
and of the dissemination campaign were significantly delayed by over a year after loan
effectiveness.

Fifth, disbursements under the grant category (cash transfers) were linked to the availability of
operational audit reports as specified in paragraphs 3(b) (i) and (ii) of Schedule I to the LA, but a
clear definition of their role and format was lacking at the time the project was taken to the Board,
with Management approval. This oversight resulted in no disbursements against the loan for this
category of expenditure from effectiveness until the last quarter of 2003 (almost 20 months).
Two waivers were requested by the GOJ and approved by the Bank in 2004 to disburse against
this category of expenditure without complying with the above legal covenant. Three years
elapsed from loan effectiveness until operational audits were made available regularly in the first
quarter of 2005. In addition, lacking operational audits, two of the output indicators included in
the ISRs (health conditionality compliance for children 0-6 years old and school attendance by
poor children and youth) were not updated in the ISRs until, and for the first time, in the ISR #9
dated April 28, 2005.

Sixth, the baseline data for the proposed outcome and output indicators as well as the
corresponding monitoring system were not available at the time of Board approval, which is what
has come to be recommended as good practice.

Compliance with Bank's safeguard policies. The Bank specialists carried out financial and
procurement capacity assessments. The financial assessment found that the internal controls,
planning, budgeting, accounting, financial reporting systems and auditing arrangements of the
MLSS had well-established procedures satisfactory to the Bank. The assessment, however, made
some recommendations to strengthen the monitoring aspects of the cash-transfer operations.
Notwithstanding that only about 26 percent of loan was intended for procuring goods and services,
the procurement assessment found that the MLSS was not well equipped to carry out these
activities following Bank procedures. Accordingly, an action plan was agreed between the MLSS
and the Bank team, including: (a) selection and staffing the MLSS with qualified staff to carry out
the required procurement tasks; (b) training of this staff on Bank procurement procedures; and (c)
preparation of a draft Procurement Manual. However, as mentioned before, the Bank team did
not ensure that this action plan was put into motion by the MLSS around the time of Board
approval or loan effectiveness.

The proposed operation posed no environmental issues at all. A thorough social assessment
involving key stakeholders that were to participate in the project, such as social workers from the
social programs to be merged as well as representatives of the beneficiary groups to be targeted
by the project, was carried out during the preparation cycle. This identified the key social issues
that were relevant to the project (described earlier in the ICR).

Risk assessments. The Bank team highlighted some potentially critical risks and proposed some
mitigating measures, in particular with respect to: (a) the possibility of delaying the

                                                27
implementation of the PATH scheme; (b) adequacy of the selected payment mechanisms; and (c)
the possibility of committing type I and II errors during the implementation cycle.

Lessons learned. Valuable lessons learned from similar cash transfer Bank-financed programs,
such as the Mexico Progresa (known also as Oportunidades from 2000 onwards) and the Brazil
Bolsa Familia, were incorporated in the project design. These projects demonstrated that
successful cash-transfer operations needed to include: (a) appropriate targeting mechanisms to
identify the poorest and most vulnerable population and to mitigate exclusion and inclusion
errors; (b) effective MIS to monitor program pay-out and eligibility status; (c) linkages of benefit
receipt of changed behavior; and (d) ample consultation with beneficiaries and local civil society.
All these lessons learned are described in Section D.3 of the PAD.

Rating criteria. Weighting the above-mentioned relevant achievements and shortfalls of the
Bank team at the lending stage in accordance with today's good standard practices in the Bank, in
particular the lack of implementation readiness conditions at the time of Board approval, the ICR
rates the Bank performance at the lending stage as moderately satisfactory.

(c) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Highly satisfactory

The implementation cycle had only two TTLs. The first one, also in charge of the entire lending
cycle, was responsible for the supervision from Board approval (September 2001) and Loan
effectiveness (February 2002) until the summer of 2005 at which point the second TTL took over
the supervisory responsibility. The transition in supervision leadership was well planned with
both TTLs being part of the same team for about eight months before the second TTL took over.
This second TTL, responsible for ensuring an orderly closing of this operation, was in charge of
identifying and supporting the preparation and current implementation of a follow-up operation
mentioned before in the ICR. The project files attest to the continuity that has been provided
during the entire lending and implementation cycle, ensuring a smooth and effective change of
command from the Bank's side.

After Board approval the project team fielded 26 supervision missions, including (i) a Mid-term
Review conducted in March 2004; (ii) several financial and/or procurement missions; and (iii) an
ICR mission in May 2009. . The above implies that in the 90 months (almost 7.5 years) elapsing
from Board Approval to the ICR field-mission, the Bank carried-out on average, about one
supervision every three and half months, thus maintaining a close oversight of the implementation
cycle.

The project file contains 8 PSRs and 11 ISRs for a total of 19 reporting instruments, indicating
that on average, the PSRs/ISRs were updated in the system about once every five months.

Supervision missions included the appropriate skill-mix to carry out their envisaged terms of
reference as attested in Annex 4 of the ICR. In particular, in the areas of social safety net and
conditional cash transfer and targeting mechanisms, the Bank supervision team benefited
throughout the entire implementation cycle from the continuous technical expertise provided by
two qualified consultants that were also involved in the preparation phase. The project files also
confirm the support provided by the various missions to the counterpart team, in particular by: (a)
addressing key project preparation gaps in the early stages of project implementation; (b)
assessing the impact of the project on some of the outcome and output indicators agreed with
GOJ and included in Annex 1 to the PAD mid-way through project implementation and onwards;

                                                28
and (c) supporting a follow-up operation to ensure long-term sustainability of the SSN reform
towards the closing of this project.

During the period elapsing from loan effectiveness to mid-2003, Bank supervisions mission were
mostly reactive in nature: (i) addressing project preparation gaps fully detailed elsewhere in the
ICR; (ii) focusing exclusively in having the MLSS getting the required inputs and processes in
place; (iii) supporting the completion of the pilot program in the St. Catherine Parish; and (iv)
assisting the MLSS in the PATH's scaling up process that started in the second semester of 2002.

During the mid-2003 to 2007, once most of the project preparation gaps were satisfactorily
addressed by the MLSS with the support of the Bank teams, the Bank supervision missions were
more pro-active and holistic focusing in intermediate outputs and observable outputs (impact)
while keeping also an oversight, mostly in fine tuning PATH processes and related institutional
capacity aspects. In this context, the Bank supervision missions assisted in the appropriate design
of the impact evaluation study that was undertaken by a qualified independent consulting firm
during 2003-2005 as well as with the two PATH qualitative assessments. GOJ was instrumental
in having the findings of these studies discussed with an ample group of stakeholders in 2006 and
widespread disseminated. The Bank also disseminated the evaluation methodology and results
Bank-wide through brown-bag lunches and during Human Development Learning week. In
addition, an institutional capacity assessment was undertaken in 2006.

During this period the Bank supported the MLSS ensuring an effective and consistent physical
and financial implementation progress. For example, the TTL was instrumental in getting Bank
management approval to eliminate the "problematic" operational audits as a requirement to
reimburse the GOJ for eligible expenditures against the grants category of expenditures as fully
detailed in section 2.2 of the ICR. With this amendment to the LA, loan disbursements started
flowing in a more consistent fashion. The TTL was also supportive in getting Bank Management
approve two extensions to the closing date to ensure a more orderly completion of this project and
bridging the start of the follow-up operation.

Towards the final phase of the implementation cycle, the Bank supervision missions focused on
the sustainability aspects of the PATH and in supporting the preparation and implementation of a
follow-up operation, which as explained in sections 2.4 and 4 of the ICR, raises the bar of the
SSN reform in progress in Jamaica.

Reporting and rating the PDOs during the first half of the implementation cycle was based more
on expectations than on facts. From 2006 onwards, once the findings of the impact evaluation
and qualitative assessment studies were made available and the PMRs were provided on a regular
quarterly basis, the reporting and the rating of the PDOs were based more on facts on the ground.

The findings of each supervision mission were conveyed to Bank management clearly and in a
straightforward and candid fashion, including the accomplishments as well as the implementation
shortcomings and potential risks and concerns assessed by the Bank team. While the reporting in
the PSRs/ISRs and corresponding Aide-Memoires was realistic, comprehensive and very detailed,
the ratings, especially the ones reflecting achievement of the PDOs during the early stages of the
implementation cycle (up to the end of 2003), were not always consistent with the story reflected
in the reporting documents.          The ratings provided mid-2003 onwards of the project
implementation cycle were more attuned to the story portrayed in the corresponding Aide-
Memoires and Back-to-Office Reports as indicated by the unsatisfactory (Us) and moderately
unsatisfactory (MUs) given in some PSRs/ISRs as described in the Data Sheet of the ICR. The


                                                29
Bank supervision teams strictly followed-up on commitments made by the MLSS on previous
missions and the findings reported accordingly in the ISRs.

One minor gap detected during the review of the project files concerns the lack of reporting, in
the supervision mission, Aide-Memoires and the corresponding PSRs/ISRs, of the following two
outcome indicators: net change in poor pregnant/lactating mothers visiting health centers for
timely check-ups and net change in poor elderly, disabled and other beneficiaries visiting health
centers. These two indicators are related to Component B of the project, which was fully financed
by the GOJ, and are included in the Supplemental Letter to the LA. Notwithstanding the above,
the ICR found that the GOJ's PMRs reported on the first indicator and eliminated the second one,
as mentioned in the Data Sheet, due to a decision made by the GOJ not to require PATH
compliance for elderly and disabled beneficiaries. The minor gap issue raised by the ICR
demonstrates the lack of connectivity between the Bank's reporting instruments (PSR/ISRs) and
the GOJ's (PMRs).

The Bank supervision teams were attentive to GOJ's compliance with the covenants included in
the LA, in particular those referring to preserving the purchasing power of the PATH's benefits.
The ICR commends the TTL for her firm position in addressing this issue with GOJ in the
context of the country's budgetary constraints, particularly towards the end of 2005. As a
consequence, the GOJ increased the PATH benefits from J$400 to J$530 per beneficiary per
month effective January 2006 (as mentioned before, a second increase took place in April 2008
and a third one, differentiating the PATH beneficiaries, by gender and educational level, at the
end of 2008), thus ensuring GOJ's compliance with paragraph 3 to Schedule 5 of the LA.

Taking into consideration the above supervision assessment, in particular: (i) the emphasis and
focus of the Bank team on following up on development impact through serious independent
impact evaluation studies; (ii) addressing, in a timely manner, the implementation readiness
conditions not present at the time of Board approval; (iii) proactive identification and resolution
of key issues, such as the increase in the amount of the grant to protect against inflationary
erosion; (iv) provision of good quality technical advice; (v) candor and quality of reporting in the
ISRs and Aide-Memoires; and (vi) ensuring technical, financial and institutional sustainability of
project activities at the closing of the Loan and an adequate transition to a follow up operation,
the ICR rates the Bank supervision performance as highly satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

According to current ICR rating guidelines, the overall Bank performance is rated moderately
satisfactory as the rating was moderately satisfactory at the lending stage and highly satisfactory
at the supervision stage.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating at the lending stage: Satisfactory.

Preparation took 32 months and was partially financed by two Japanese PHRD grants. An inter-
institutional task force led by the Jamaican PIOJ in conjunction with staff from the MLSS carried
out the preparation of the proposed project. The Bank team interacted with highly qualified

                                                30
technical counterpart teams. Some teams, especially those from the PIOJ, were familiar with
Bank operations through previous involvement in the design and implementation of a previous
Bank-financed project in the social sector (mentioned earlier in the ICR). These teams had clarity
about the key issues affecting the existing social safety net programs in Jamaica as well as the
relevant interventions used to address them. In addition, these teams were very receptive to the
recommendations provided by international experts who attended various thematic workshops
during the preparation cycle.

The political context in Jamaica during the lending phase provided the enabling conditions to
launch the SSN reform. Key aspects included: (a) GOJ support, through its PIOJ, for the carrying
out of a comprehensive package of analytical studies mentioned elsewhere in the ICR; (b) the
appointment of a Jamaican Task Force to develop a reform proposal with concrete suggestions for
SSN reform; (c) the carrying out of a series of tailor-made workshops and stakeholder
consultations with government agencies, academia, donors and civil society to discuss the results
of the above-mentioned studies and sharpen the focus of the envisaged reform; (d) the approval
by the Cabinet on October 30, 2001 of the Sector-Wide approach for the SSN Reform, which
established the National Action Program for the Reform of the SSN; (e) the approval by the
Cabinet on February 24, 2001 of the categories of beneficiaries eligible under the PATH and of
the benefit levels; and (f) the approval by the Jamaican Parliament of an incremental allocation
for the PATH in the FY01/02 budget at the request of the Ministry of Finance.

On the downside, the MLSS did not appropriately address key staffing gaps identified by the
institutional capacity assessment--in particular, the positions related to the training and
development of training materials, the operational audits, the dissemination campaign and
monitoring and evaluation--which might have led to faster pace of implementation. Likewise,
the MLSS did not address in a timely manner the gaps identified during the procurement capacity
assessment to ensure a more opportune completion of the selection of qualified consulting firms
to undertake the development of the financial management computerized system, the
dissemination campaigns, the operational audits, the monitoring and evaluation, the gathering of
the baseline data and the design of the impact evaluation study.

In the view of the ICR, GOJ's strengths shown at the lending cycle (for example, ownership and
commitment to achieving the PDOs, enabling environment for the conduction of the SSN reform,
support for the consultation and involvement process of different government agencies and other
stakeholders) significantly outweigh the weaknesses (concerning some implementation readiness
gaps mentioned above, which were satisfactorily addressed in the early stages of project
implementation). Accordingly, the ICR rates the GOJ performance during the preparation stage
as satisfactory.

Rating at the implementation stage: Satisfactory

GOJ created a task force for the preparation of the project along with the establishment of several
related Steering Committees. The SSN Steering Committee, chaired by the PIOJ, was established
to: (a) advise the Cabinet and the Prime Minister on SSN policy-related matters; and (b) ensure
appropriate coordination of the many key players involved in implementation of the SSN reform,
including high level officials, representatives of the MLSS, the MLGCD, the Ministries of
Education, Youth and Culture, of Health and Environment, and of Finance, as well as of the
Jamaican Association of Local Government Offices. The Targeting Committee, also chaired by
the PIOJ, was established to coordinate the development and fine tuning of the targeting
mechanisms of the SSN in conjunction with its scoring formula. The IDB, which was financing
the development of the targeting mechanism, was a participant in this Committee. Finally, the

                                                31
PATH Implementation Committee, chaired by the MLSS and including, among others,
representatives of the Parishes' Inspector of the Poor (accountable to the Board of Supervisors
and the Parish Council), was established to oversee and coordinate the different actors involved in
the implementation of the various PATH activities. The establishment of these Committees sent
a signal about the high priority given to the SSN reform by the two political administrations
governing Jamaica during the entire implementation cycle.

Through the preparation task force, the GOJ was able to unify two of the three main cash-in-kind
transfer programs existing at the time of project preparation and early implementation (Food
Stamps and Old Age Allowance) into one unified benefit, the PATH, thereby reducing
fragmentation and duplication. The Outdoor Poor Relief program was never merged for the
reasons explained elsewhere in the ICR, although the payment to its beneficiaries was channeled
through the PATH.

The Government is commended for making counterpart funds available, above the required share
set forth in the LA. As shown in Annex 1 to the ICR, total counterpart funding during the entire
implementation cycle amounted to US$80.69 million, 215 percent above the US$37.50 million
estimated at appraisal. Thanks to these funds: (i) the entire pilot scheme during the first 8 months
of 2002 as well as the earlier part of the scaling up process during the second semester of 2002
and the first nine months of 2003 were financed 100 percent by Government funds; and (ii) the
target set at appraisal of reaching 217,000 PATH registered beneficiaries at the end of the
implementation cycle was surpassed by 41.5 percent to about 307,000.

The merging of SSN programs into one unified program placed great emphasis on the
development of monitoring and evaluation systems for the various programs, building on existing
instruments, such as the yearly SLC. Thus GOJ was able to obtain timely information about the
improved targeting of the newly created PATH program compared to its predecessors ­ Food
Stamps and Old Age Allowance programs.

Another strength displayed by the GOJ during the implementation cycle relates to a key element
of the Jamaican SSN reform: the introduction of an island-wide BIS, based on a proxy means test
(scoring formula), developed by the PIOJ and implemented through the MLSS in all 13 parishes.
This targeting system, through which MLSS identified PATH beneficiaries, was also used for
other safety net programs outside the PATH's scope--for example, the secondary school fee
waivers and free school lunches.

Recognizing the difficulties imposed by the fiscal constraints existing at the time, the GOJ took
positive steps to ensure benefit increases to address the likely erosion of the purchasing power of
the PATH benefit. As mentioned elsewhere in the ICR, acting on the findings from the impact
evaluation study, the GOJ decided to carry out three such increases during the life of the project.
With this measure, the updated value of the PATH benefit stimulated the desired behavior among
extremely poor beneficiaries to continue participating in the program, thus increasing the
likelihood of improved education attendance and frequent preventive health visits among children.

Looking at the umbrella of the SSN reform and outside the scope of the project, the Jamaican
Parliament has not yet repealed the antiquated Poor Relief Law (1886) nor approved and enacted
a new NAA to merge the Outdoor Poor Relief Program (managed by the MLGCD) with the
PATH (managed by the MLSS). The reasons have been provided elsewhere in the ICR.
Accordingly, one of the broader objectives of the SSN reform (not of the Bank-financed project)
concerning the consolidation of all cash grant programs in Jamaica has not yet occurred.


                                                32
Another slight weakness associated with the GOJ's performance at the implementation stage
concerns the untimely delivery of the audit reports (on average about a three month delay),
although all of them were unqualified (clean).

Rating: Considering the GOJ's implementation strengths and the minor shortcomings (for
example, delaying the increase of the grant amount and the submission of the annual audit
reports), the ICR rates the Borrower performance at implementation as satisfactory.


(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

As mentioned earlier in the ICR, this project was implemented by the MLSS through its Public
Assistance Division. There were only two project coordinators assigned to this project by the
MLSS. The tenure of the first coordinator ranged from the identification to March 2004 and from
May 2006 until the closing. The tenure of the second coordinator extended for 24 months starting
in April 2004. The performance of the implementation agency is mixed, with ratings in the PSRs
ranging from unsatisfactory to moderately satisfactory during the first two years of project
implementation (2002-2004) and then in the ISRs, from moderately satisfactory to satisfactory
toward the second half of the implementation cycle (2006-2009).

Due to the implementation gaps at the time of Board approval, the key project management
positions at the Public Assistance Division were finally filled in May 2004, more than two years
after Loan effectiveness. As a consequence: (a) required procurement processes and financial
management reporting were significantly delayed; (b) the operational audits required for the Bank
to reimburse the grant category of expenditures were not completed on time; (c) the project's
monitoring scheme was also delayed; and (d) beyond the two MIS modules developed in-house in
the early stages of the implementation cycle, the remaining modules envisaged for the tailor-made
MIS were only developed at the very end of the project cycle, remaining a work-in-progress at
the writing of the ICR.

To address the lack of a fully developed and appropriate MIS for PATH, an unsuccessful attempt
was made to utilize the MLSS's MIS while a qualified consulting firm was selected to develop
the other required PATH's MIS modules and install the system in all the parishes.

Recurring Bank supervision reports during the first two years of project implementation point to
the weakness in program management made evident by the facts mentioned above. A
compounded consequence of these delays resulted in the change of the project manager in April
2006 and a request by GOJ of two extensions to the closing date, which the Bank approved.

A strength displayed by the MLSS and the PIOJ, highlighted in this ICR, is the support provided
to the consulting firms that were selected to conduct the impact evaluation study and the two
qualitative assessment studies.

The second half of the implementation cycle is characterized by the Public Assistance Division's
addressing of different issues flagged by the internal audits, which are fully detailed in section 2.2
of the ICR. Once the financial management system was computerized and the FMRs and PMRs
produced, all the subsequent Bank supervision missions benefited from these meticulous and
detailed progress reports prepared by the Public Assistance Division.


                                                 33
The ICR rates the implementing agency performance as satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

According to current ICR rating guidelines, the overall Borrower performance is rated
satisfactory since the ratings of the government performance at the lending and implementation
stages were rated both satisfactory and the rating of the implementation agency was also rated
satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

(a)     Political support and ownership is a key condition and a good predictor for success.
GOJ demonstrated this support and ownership through its different participating Ministries,
agencies and Steering Committees throughout the entire lending and implementation cycles. Of
particular note is the PIOJ's championing of the entire SSN reform process and the MLSS's
careful management of implementation. This continuous political support created the right
environment for effective implementation and for sustainability of the PATH, as well as for
preparing and launching the subsequent social protection project.

(b)     Ensuring implementation readiness conditions prior to negotiations lead to a more
effective and timely physical and financial execution cycle. The delays in physical and financial
implementation experienced by this project, especially in the period February 2002 to September
2003, could have been mitigated had the Bank team and management ensured appropriate
implementation readiness conditions at the time of appraisal, especially with respect to
compliance by the MLSS of the procurement-related observations made prior to appraisal.

(c)      Bank fiduciary requirements should be thoroughly discussed among the Bank team
well ahead of negotiations; incorporation of covenants without adequate consideration can
have adverse impacts on implementation. This refers to the operational audits requested by the
Bank financial team to be included as a condition of grant disbursements during negotiations
without prior knowledge by the task manager or the borrower. As amply indicated elsewhere in
the ICR, the operational audits did not work as expected. Once this covenant was waived and
then eliminated altogether from the LA, physical and financial implementation progress
significantly improved. Moreover, the rationale for inclusion of this covenant from a risk
mitigation standpoint was questionable; indeed, the annual project audits indicated that there was
never an issue with misuse of the proceeds of the grants.

(d)     An appropriate logical framework is needed to inform the Borrower and Bank
management about progress towards achieving the expected project developmental
objectives. The PDOs could have been expressed in a more appropriate way to reflect the thrust
of this operation, which was about improving human capital accumulation through increased
school attendance and use of preventive health services among poor children, by improving
coverage, targeting and adequacy of the PATH.

(e)      Strengthening human capital requires effective coordination between demand and
supply-side interventions. As shown in other operations in LAC and elsewhere in the world, for
conditional cash transfer programs to be effective, appropriate working arrangements must be
established with the different participating stakeholders (in the case of Jamaica, between the
MLSS and the Ministries of Education and of Health and Environment) to ensure appropriate


                                               34
supply and quality of services provided. The compliance with the health conditionality of twice a
year visits of children 1-6 years overburdened the system, which could not appropriately meet the
required supply of services. On the demand-side, these programs seek to address income-related
barriers impeding the poor from accessing basic services such as health and education and
therefore to improve the utilization of these services. But adequate supply is also necessary.

(f)      The choice of targeting approach is relevant for equity, transparency and
effectiveness. The PATH is a good example of: (a) a targeted intervention directed to the poorest
and most vulnerable segments of the Jamaican population (first income quintile); (b) an operation
including transparent selection criteria through its scoring formula and the BIS; and (c) a
sustainable activity, as proven by GOJ's decision to financially, technically and institutionally
sustain the PATH.

(g)    Piloting on a small scale prior to scaling up contributes in the identification of typical
implementation obstacles when introducing new schemes such as the PATH.

(h)      Continuous and sustained social marketing is a necessary, although not sufficient, tool
to make conditional cash transfer schemes (such as the PATH) effective in attaining the
envisaged behavioral changes expected from the beneficiaries and to reach larger segments of the
poor. Accordingly, Borrowers interested in implementing conditional cash transfer schemes in
their countries need to ensure the financial and technical resources to continuously launch and
target intensive social marketing campaigns. Sporadic dissemination campaigns are not effective
or efficient.

(i)     Arrangements for impact evaluation should be included at the onset of project
implementation, and monitoring can help identify needs for correcting course if necessary.
This provides appropriate information to test alternative mechanisms prior to scaling-up. The
findings of the impact evaluation study undertaken in the period 2004-2005: (i) revealed the
positive impact of PATH in the accumulation of human capital through increased school
attendance and use of preventive health services by poor children; and (ii) pointed to changes
needed in the design of the follow-up Bank-financed operation.

(j)      Benefit levels should be sufficiently high to both reduce the poverty gap and to
provide incentives for poor families to invest in human capital accumulation. Though there
is no definitive answer on the right size of the benefit, impact evaluations of conditional cash
transfer programs have demonstrated that programs with larger benefits relative to household
consumption had a bigger impact on reducing consumption deficit and improving health and
education outcomes than programs with smaller benefits. It was a good decision by the Bank
team to include a clause in the LA (paragraph 3 to Schedule 5) to ensure effective remedies
against the erosion of the purchasing power of the PATH benefit caused by inflation. In addition,
careful analytical work during the preparation of the follow-up Bank-financed operation led to a
substantial increase in the size of the benefit for secondary school students and boys, made
effective by GOJ at the end of 2008.


7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

Implementation Readiness. The implementation of a Bank funded project was new to the
Ministry of Labour and Social Security and the government felt that more time should have been
expended in preparation to ensure that the necessary staffing and systems were in place prior to
implementation. Although the implementation readiness conditions were not fully met, the
project was presented to the Board. The government rightly indicated that to mitigate this,
adequate training and support could have been provided by the Bank to aid implementation
especially in the areas of financial management and procurement procedures. This could have
prevented delays in procuring key systems including a proper system of financial management
reporting and a management information system.

Institutional and Project Management Arrangements. The Bank did not support the
establishment of a separate project unit to manage the implementation of the Project but felt that
the Project should be implemented by the Public Assistance Division (PAD) of the Ministry to
ensure the program supported by the project (PATH) is fully mainstreamed into the safety net
operated by the ministry. While there are good reasons for this approach, the PAD Division of
the Ministry lacked the necessary qualified and experienced staff to undertake such a large and
complex Project. Eventually a hybrid Project Unit was established with a mixture of GOJ staff
and salaried consultants. Despite numerous discussions to agree to a project structure and to
allow for the expenditure to be reimbursed under the loan, this was not supported by the Bank.
Retrospectively, the bank team considers that even though a project unit administrative structure
might have facilitated a smoother implementation, it was worth investing in the training of
permanent staff of the ministry, particularly of social workers, to ensure continuity of adequate
staffing.

Operational Audits. The government expressed that during the Project preparation the subject
of operational audits was not properly discussed. There is a perception that linking disbursement
to independent operational audits was introduced at loan negotiations without a clear
understanding of their scope. As the government indicated, the audits became the `Achilles Heel'
in the Project that resulted in very little or no disbursements until 2004 (three years into project
implementation). The slow pace of disbursement and the overall state of financial management
resulted in the Project being downgraded to unsatisfactory in 2003. The government voiced its
disagreement to the operational audits at negotiations and during implementation. After the
implementation of ten operational audits the bank agreed to eliminate them. The bank also
realized that most important was for the MLSS to improve its own internal audit and quality
control systems to ensure proper adherence to financial regulations and increased accountability.
Today these internal audits fulfill a key function in the implementation of the PATH program and
their findings contribute greatly to both correction and early detection of problems.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

This section describes the outputs of each of the three components included in the original project
design as well as the sources of financing. The assessment is primarily based on the Aide-
Memoires, PSRs/ISRs, PMRs and FMRs that were prepared during the implementation cycle
encompassing 26 supervision missions including the May 2009 field ICR mission.

Two cost tables are presented to substantiate the story provided in the ICR: (a) the documented
expenditure by component and by source of financing at appraisal and at the time of the ICR
mission (table A2.1); and (b) the documented expenditure by category and by source of financing
at appraisal and at the time of the ICR mission (table A2.2).

Component A: Child assistance grants. According to Table A2.1 below, although this
component was estimated to cost about US$50.67 million (US$28.73 million from the Loan and
US$21.94 million from GOJ), it eventually documented expenditures amounting to US$75.25
million (US$33.58 million from the Loan and US$41.67 million from GOJ, 148.5 percent of the
total estimated at appraisal). This increase in spending is mainly due to the increase in the
number of registered beneficiaries compared to the initial target, the extension of the project
implementation duration allowing for three more years of execution of the project, and the
increase in the real value of benefits at the end of the project. In fact, GOJ disbursed US$41.67
million for this component, more than US$19.7 million above the expected target set at appraisal
of US$21.94 million. The following is the assessment of the key activities included under this
Component A.

As of the writing of the ICR there were 307,000 registered beneficiaries (290,432 from PATH
and 16,568 of the Poor Relief Program that was merged with PATH). Of these, about 90 percent
were receiving their regular benefit. The remaining 10 percent were either in the process of
verification of the information provided at the registration, not complying with some of the cash
transfer education and/or health requirements, or administrative reasons are temporarily detaining
the payment. Of registered PATH beneficiaries mentioned above, 233,202 children and youth
were receiving an average weighted monthly benefit amounting to J$794.04 (US$9.34 equivalent
at the median exchange rate registered for March 2009 of J$88 for one US dollar) as described in
table 3 of the main text of the ICR. Accordingly, male students at the upper secondary level were
receiving a monthly benefit 46.7 percent higher than those provided to male primary education
students. Boys at all grade levels were receiving a 10 percent increase relative to girls. 76
percent of the PATH registered beneficiaries were persons in the 0-17 year-old age-cohort.

According to the Data Sheet, the average beneficiary education compliance was 89 percent for
primary education and 81 percent for secondary education. Beneficiaries at the primary level
tended to be more compliant with the school attendance conditionality than those at the secondary
education level. In addition, girls at all grade levels had a higher compliance rate than boys. The
average health beneficiary compliance for babies less than 12 months old, implying four health
visits per year, was 87 percent and for children in the 12-71 month age-cohort was 67 percent,
lower than the expected target set for at appraisal.

Rating component A. Weighting the achievement as well as the shortfalls fully described above,
the ICR rates the overall implementation of this Component A as satisfactory.

Component B: Social Assistance Grants for Adults. According to Table A2.1 below, this
component was estimated to cost about US$14.14 million (100 percent financed by counterpart
funds), but documented expenditures amounted to US$32.7 million (fully financed by GOJ),

                                                38
226.8 percent above the total estimated at appraisal. The reasons provided above for Component
A are also applicable for this component.

As mentioned before, the project files, comprising the Aide-Memoires, Back-to-Office Reports,
PSRs and ISRs of all the supervision missions undertaken during the implementation cycle do not
include any information with respect to the physical and financial progress and issues of this
component, mainly because its implementation was 100 percent fully assigned to the GOJ. The
only source of information available was the MLSS's PMRs.

As of the end of 2008, 65,681 adults were receiving PATH benefits under component B including
40,477 elderly, 16,883 adults under the Poor Outdoor Relief program, 6,743 disabled adults and
the rest were either pregnant and/or lactating poor women or other poor adult people registered in
the PATH. As of June 2008, there was an 87 percent compliance of poor pregnant/lactating
mothers visiting health centers for timely check-ups.

No assessment could be made for the net change in poor pregnant/lactating mothers visiting
health centers for timely check-ups (outcome indicator included in the Supplemental Letter to the
LA) because it was difficult to select the control group given that the corresponding cells were
too small in the sample population. In addition, a comparison with a baseline was not possible
because no baseline was ever provided.

In the case of poor elderly and disabled beneficiaries, a decision was taken by GOJ at the start of
the PATH not to require any type of conditionality for the receipt of their monthly benefit.
Accordingly, the outcome indicator included in the Supplemental Letter to the LA referred to the
net change against a comparable control group could not be assessed. Likewise, since no baseline
updated information concerning health compliance of this group about was ever recorded, the
ICR could not gauge the changes made over time during the implementation cycle.

Rating component B. Beyond enrollment figures by type of beneficiary adult and administrative
information on compliance, the ICR cannot rate the implementation of this component due to lack
of appropriate information to carry out an assessment.

Component C: Institutional strengthening. According to Table A2.1 below, this component
was estimated to cost about US$11.92 million (US$10.50 million from the Loan and US$1.42
million from GOJ), but documented expenditures amounted to US$12.97 million (US$6.02
million from the Loan and US$6.95 million from GOJ, 108.8 percent of the total estimated at
appraisal). The various training programs provided to the national and parish-level PATH staff
and the social marketing that was required to support the targeting, registration and verification of
an increased number of beneficiaries partially explains the slight overspending of this component
as compared to the estimates at appraisal. In addition, the cost of the impact evaluation study, as
well as the two qualitative assessments carried out during the life of the project also explains the
overspending. Finally, the project incurred almost three additional years of institutional
strengthening-related expenditures as compared to the initial total implementation timing set at
appraisal. During 2008-09, there were expenditures associated with the design of a tailor-made
MIS and the start of the verification process of about 40,000 PATH beneficiaries. The following
is the assessment of the key activities included under this Component C.

The implementation performance of this Component C is mixed. This component was able to
build and strengthen MLSS's capacity to operate the PATH through the recruiting and training of
key personnel at the MLSS and in all the MLSS's parishes, equipping the central and parish
offices with the needed hardware and software, development of user-friendly training materials,

                                                 39
strengthening the internal audit team, and the launching of tailor-made mass-media
communication campaigns. Accordingly, MLSS was able to set into motion: (i) the targeting and
registration of eligible participants in ever increasing numbers in the entire island; (ii) the setting
of a payment mechanism through the postal and banking systems, timely delivery of the cash-
transfers every other month to registered beneficiaries who comply with their co-responsibilities
(276,000 participants out of the 307,000 that were registered at the closing of the Loan); (iii) the
timely collection of information from schools and health centers regarding compliance with
conditionalities; (iv) the elaboration of quarterly PMRs and FMRs; and (v) the carrying out of a
valuable impact evaluation and two qualitative assessment studies.

But Component C was not able to set a timely operational audit scheme to verify the accuracy of
the health and education compliance monitoring carried out by the MLSS and to send timely
reports to the Bank to reimburse against eligible expenditures for grant category. As explained
before in the ICR, late in 2003 a waiver for the disbursement of this category of expenditure was
approved; this was followed later on during the implementation cycle by a LA amendment to
remove this covenant altogether. Also, as detailed before, an appropriate functional MIS has
been installed and tested and the recertification processes will be completed by September 30,
2009.

Finally, the different internal audits showed a series of implementation issues that started to be
thoroughly addressed in mid 2007 and are being continued under the follow-up Bank-financed
operation. These PATH-related operational issues include: (a) checks prepared for deceased
beneficiaries; (b) lack of timely follow-up on uncollected checks; (c) retention of staled checks at
the Parishes; (d) backlog on appeal cases not yet investigated by social workers; and (e) fine
tuning of some standard internal controls. The PATH has to be commended though for the
permanent oversight and control exercised by the internal auditors. The periodic internal audits
allow the program to identify bottlenecks in implementation and take actions to address them.

Rating component C. Weighting the achievement as well as the shortfalls fully described above,
the ICR rates the overall implementation of this Component C as satisfactory.

According to tables A2.1 and A2.2, the total project cost estimated at appraisal was US$77.5
million equivalent, corresponding US$40.0 million equivalent from the Bank (52 percent of the
total) and US$37.5 million equivalent from the GOJ (48 percent of the total). At the time of the
closing of the Loan, the total documented expenditure amounted to US$120.69 million equivalent
(155.7 percent above of the appraised total), corresponding US$40 million equivalent from the


                                                       40
Bank (100 percent of the appraised total) and US$80.69 million equivalent from the GOJ (215.2
percent of the appraised total).

The following reasons explain the above-mentioned overspending, especially of the counterpart
funds. First, there were almost three more years of implementation from the original timing
expected at appraisal. Second, the number of registered PATH beneficiaries exceeded the
original target set at appraisal by 41.5 percent, as correlated by a 165.6 percent overspending in
the grant category of expenditure (table A2.2). Finally, as explained elsewhere in the ICR, the
level of benefits was increased three times during the implementation cycle, to a weighted
average equivalent of US$9.34 above the US$9 set as a target during the appraisal (a more than
100% increase).

As mentioned before, the reallocation of loan proceeds from consultants to grants compelled the
GOJ to finance the required technical assistance required by PATH; thus increasing the
expenditure in that category by almost nine times (888.9 percent) with respect to the amount set
at appraisal. In addition, the impact evaluation and the two assessment studies cost more than the
original estimates included in the PAD. The scoring formula utilized in the BIS targeting system
was subjected to several required fine tuning exercises to further decrease the type I and II errors
resulting in additional technical assistance expenditures which were not estimated at the appraisal
stage. The development of friendly-user training material, the training programs and the mass
educational communication campaign also added to the extra costs in this category.

Simulated effects on poverty/inequality and school outcomes2
The Program of Advancement through Health and Education (PATH) aims to reduce poverty in
the short run through cash transfers and in the long run through human capital investments in
children. PATH reached almost 300,000 individuals per month end of 2008. The amount of the
transfer until April 2008 was fixed per beneficiary, J$530 (approximately US$8)3. Poor children
aged 0-19 years-old, pregnant or lactating mothers, elderly individuals over age 65, persons with
disabilities and destitute adults under age 65 are eligible for the program. School attendance of
85% of days per month is required for children aged 6-19, health care center visits every two
months for children aged 0-5 years-old, and periodic health checkups for pregnant women are
also required. The grants for adults, the elderly and the persons with disabilities are not
conditional.
As of April 2008 the government increased the base benefit to J$650 per month and in December
2008 further increased the benefits for secondary students by 50%, and for upper secondary
students by almost 75% and introduced a 10% bonus for boys at all grade levels. In addition to
the monthly benefits specified above, PATH students moving to a tertiary institution would
receive a one off-bonus of JM$15,000 to assist with that transition.
Considering the benefit size, coverage, and eligibility criteria, this section estimates the effects of
the increase in PATH benefits on schooling outcomes and on poverty/inequality.
A response to this question depends on a comparison of the actual cost and benefits with the cost
and benefits under this alternative design. At this point, the long-term benefits of such a program
need not be considered since they depend on saving and investment behaviors and on future
returns to the (human and physical) assets accumulated.
A recent evaluation of PATH conducted by Levy and Ohls (2007)4 found that 58% of benefits
goes to the first quintile of the consumption distribution (comparing favorable with similar
programs in other countries); school attendance is increased by 0.5 days per month (3% increase)
compared to the control group; and there are 38% more visits to health care centers for children
0-6 years old -- all directly associated with the PATH.
The simulations reported below are based on a simple model of household behavior, applied to
the Jamaica Survey of Life Conditions (JSLC) sampled in 2002 and 2006. The method of analysis
follows the ex-ante evaluation model presented in Bourguignon, Ferreira and Leite (2003),
henceforth BFL, but adapted to the Jamaican case.
The Model
The BFL model combines arithmetic methods with demand for schooling models, generating
predictions of what would be the occupational choice of a child if the Conditional Cash Transfer
(CCT) Program were implemented and its short-run effects on poverty and inequality. The model
consists of two equations: first, an occupational choice equation for children, relating the
probability that a child chooses between 6 categories (not attending school; 1-5 days of
attendance, 6-10 days of attendance, 11-16 days of attendance, 17-18 days of attendance and 19-

20 days of attendance per month) to a number of personal and family characteristics; and second,
a standard Mincerian earnings equation to predict potential earnings for children who do not
report any market earnings in the JSLC, as well as the "mark-down" in potential earnings arising
from working part-time while also studying.
Denote j the occupational category of the child. Given that, the utility function for each category j
of the child i is specified by:
1 U i  j   Z i   j  Yi  yij   j  vij , where Zi stands for characteristics of both the child
and the household;
                          Yi is the household income without the child's earnings; yij is the child
                                       vij
income earned in alternative j; and           is the random term that stands for idiosyncratic preferences.
                      yij
The child earnings,           , is defined in alternative j = 0 as the observed market earnings of the child,
wi . In all categories j children can also work and study, spending less time in the labor market
than children from category j = 0. Then, for j = 1 children, can only receive a proportion M1
                                                                           y
(time devoted to work) of the observed market earnings, i.e., ij , is equal to 1 i . Similar
                                                                                             M w
specification can be made to children in j = 2-5 because they can all make contributions to
                                         Mj                                                                  yij
household income. Considering                 the proportion of time devoted to domestic production,
                M j  wi
can be set as             .
Replacing these values on equation 1 we have:
2 U i  j   Z i   j  Yi  yij    j  vij  Z i   j  Yi   j  wi   j  vij
         0   0 ;  j   j  M j ; j  1,...,5
Where                                                 .
When all parameters of equation 2 are known, child selects its occupation by maximizing its
                          k  Max[U ( j )]  j  0, 1, 2
utility function, i.e.,           i
                                                       . The implementation of the CCT affects
the utility by an increase of T, grant, in household income given that they must have 85% of
attendance per month. The equation 2 is re-written by equation 3 below, in which the transfers
made for category j = 0,1,2,3 are null:
(3) U i  j   Z i   j  Yi  Tij   j  wi   j  vij Ti 0  Ti1  Ti 2  Ti 3 0    T  Ti 5  T .
                                              ,                        and i 4
Finally the simulation of the likely effects of a given CCT program is represented below by
taking into account the means-test (threshold) that identifies the potential beneficiaries. Hence,
the simulation of the new occupational choice of a child is given by:

Results
The following results are counterfactuals on the basis of a household survey5. For this reason, the
starting point here presents the simulated effect of the actual design of PATH on the basis of the
JSLC 2002. Then, predictions with actual JSLC 2006 data are compared and the additional gains
due to the proposal redesign are simulated.
Table 2 presents the enrollment rate, participation rate, and attendance of 6-17 year-olds in the
three poorest deciles of consumption6 distribution as actually observed in 2002, prior to PATH's
implementation. The second column depicts the counterfactual simulated by the model under the
actual PATH transfer scheme. Enrollment rate of 6-17 years-old would increase by 1.3% in
presence of PATH driven by higher participation for secondary boys (3.2%) and secondary/upper
secondary girls (7.7% and 2.6% respectively). The share of students with more than 85% of
attendance would increase by 17.2% also driven by secondary boys and girls. Average days in
school rose to 16.76 representing 0.94 more days per month. Upper secondary boys would
increase their participation by no more than half day per month compared to secondary boys and
both secondary and upper secondary girls who would raise their average days by no less than one
day per month in response to the program.
Comparing these counterfactuals we note that with very few exceptions, such as enrollment of
primary students and more participation of primary level and upper secondary level girls,
predictions of the model are quite conservative mainly for secondary level girls, and
secondary/upper secondary boys for all three outcomes. However, at the aggregated level all three
predictions (1.2 percentage points increase of enrollment rate, 10.7 percentage points increase of
share of students with more than 85% of attendance, and 0.94 more days in school per month)
were quite similar to actual observed changes in 2006 of 1.25 p.p., 9.7 p.p and 0.89 days
respectively to enrollment, attendance and days in school. This gives us some confidence, despite
the need to run more sensitivity tests, to estimate the new design of the program using this
model.7
Adjusting the model used on the basis of 2002 data, we are able to make predictions on the basis
of the 2006 data to simulate the additional effect of the program given this new scheme of grants.
The column in Table 2 labeled "Proposal (J$580)" presents results of the new grant scheme on
the basis of 2006 data. Redefining the PATH only for the actual group of beneficiaries does not
affect actual enrollment by construction. However, higher grants would imply higher incentives
to spend more time in school. The share of students with more than 85% attendance increases by
almost 1 p.p., reaching 72.44% of school attendance among children 6-17 years-old. Secondary
boys respond more to the program reaching 48.04% but they are still worse off compared to all

  The household consumption excludes medical and other non-regular expenses as travel or events as
parties and funerals. From that, welfare numbers can differ from actual poverty/inequality estimates from
Jamaica government on the basis of the same survey.

other students. Additional gains range from 0.54 p.p. for primary level girls to 3.77 p.p. to
secondary level boys. Reforming PATH also affects the number of days in school, since the
average days would increase marginally to 16.80 among all poor children. This average increase
of 0.082 days per month basically results in a 0.33 day increase among secondary level boys. For
all others, the increment in the number of days in school ranges in between 0.026 (upper
secondary girls) and 0.340 (secondary boys).
The final two columns in Table 2 simulate the new PATH design for all poor children in the
population below the 3rd decile of consumption distribution. Hence, some people who are poor
and are not participating in the program can demand participation since grants now are more
attractive to them. The PATH thus would bring in additional secondary level boys and
secondary/upper secondary level girls among beneficiaries. The enrollment rate would reach to
92.69%. These new entrants would boost the share of participants to 74.64% and generate
additional 0.3 days in school for all poor children.
Table 3 presents the results for short-term poverty reduction and inequality changes. Presented
first are the estimated cost of program and average size of transfer. Then we compute the
incidence of poverty, the depth and the severity for both the poverty line and food poverty line. In
2002 the incidence of poverty was estimated in 22.2%. After calculations using the PATH
scheme on schooling behavior, the household consumption for each household in the sample was
recomputed, adding the grants for the elderly, adults and children 0-5 whenever necessary. From
that, applying a marginal propensity to consume equal to 0.9, the household per capita
consumption (adult equivalent) was recalculated.
Under the actual PATH, we estimate under the 2002 data a poverty reduction of almost 3 p.p.,
from 22.21% to 19.4%. Depth would drop to 4.8% (20% variation) and GINI also fell by 0.001
point (2%). All these changes are the result of well targeted transfers to the poor population of
J$1,324 per month per household. This represents around 10% of the actual consumption of poor
population (J$4,415.18 per capita). These simulations should be compared to the column in Table
3 labeled "OBS" from JSLC 2006 despite the fact that between 2002 and 2006 other major
economic changes were observed in Jamaica besides the PATH implementation. From that the
OBS column reflects not only the presence of the program but also all effort made by the
government to fight poverty as presented in the World Bank Poverty Assessment (2007).
Initially, poverty was simulated by removing PATH grants (J$530) for all beneficiaries identified
in the JSLC 2006. Poverty incidence is then estimated at 19.6% in absence of the program. At a
cost of 0.22% of GDP8 the combined effect of PATH and other environmental changes in
Jamaica pushed poverty incidence down to 18.63% that is 1 p.p. below the estimated 2006
without PATH. Depth and severity drop respectively to 4.2% and 1.6%, resulting in a 10% and a
13% decrease in the estimate due to presence of PATH.
It is also possible to compare estimates on the basis of 2002 data and 2006 in presence of PATH.
Note that for all poverty estimates (except severity using food poverty line) counterfactuals that
simulate the presence of the program on the basis of the 2002 data are quite conservative since
the Jamaican government had invested in different ways to fight poverty in recent years. The
important question is the following: how much more, in a short run, we can expect as result of
reforming PATH?
The last two columns of Table 3 show that the new PATH would generate alone additional 0.5
p.p. gains in incidence, 0.1 p.p. on depth and 0.05 p.p in severity of poverty at a cost of 0.29% of
GDP. Inequality would drop from 0.352 to 0.350 given the 20% increase in consumption of the

poor population. As before, since some children are now participating in the program, we can
have a 20% increase in the number of beneficiaries at additional cost, 0.34% of GDP. These new
entrants would affect poverty levels by 3%, depth by 2%, and severity by 2% compared to the
column labeled "Proposal J$580". These new entrants were not so vulnerable, with household
consumption close to the poverty line, because the poverty incidence effect is bigger than both
severity and depth.

      The main conclusions from Table 3 are as follows:
      The impact of the PATH is significant on the incidence of poverty but is larger for depth and
      severity as expected since the program targets poor households efficiently.
      Increases in the transfer amount contribute to greater poverty reduction generating an
      additional 2.8% reduction in poverty incidence (0.5 p.p.), 2.4% in depth and 2.8% in severity.
      Reforming the PATH generates additional 0.34% decline in the Gini coefficient generating
      overall significant reductions in inequality since 2002.
      Long-run effects on schooling
      The previous section estimated the short-run PATH effect on the enrollment rate and the
      attendance rate, but how can PATH affect poverty in the long run due to the human capital
      accumulation generated by the intervention? A cost-benefit analysis has not been carried out
      since there are data constraints, such as no information about the supply of schooling in
      Jamaica. As a consequence, below is a simple exercise of cost-effectiveness of the program to
      identify program enrollment impacts that enable us to estimate the impact of the program on
      extra years of education (without accounting for changes in the supply).9

      The main estimator for the exercise is the "double-difference" estimator, which compares
      changes in enrollment rates of the poor in the PATH compared with the non-PATH
      beneficiaries between pre-program and post-program periods, which can be obtained non-
      parametrically or parametrically through regression of enrollment using the JSLC 2002 as
      baseline and JSLC 2006 to isolate effect of the program. The parametric estimator is obtained
      by:
                                                              J

      Where S is a binary variable equal to 1 if enrolled; P indicates potential or actual beneficiary;
      R is a binary variable equal to 1 if the survey used is JSLC 2006; Ck is defined as 1 if the
      child has completed k years of schooling, and X is a vector of individual and household
      characteristics. Parameter 0 capture unrelated to PATH effects on enrollment; 1 captures
      credit constraints of poor to education; 2 is effect of PATH on enrollment; k is the effect on
      enrollment by grade level; and finally k is a pure program effect on grades.

      In addition, we estimate a Mincer type equation on the Labor Force Survey of 2002 to
      estimate the return to schooling for wage workers in Jamaica that will be used as a base to
      translate the estimated program impact on the schooling of the of poor into gains in lifetime
      earnings.

    In this sense, the analysis is based on the PROGRESA evaluation presented in Coady (2000).

     Table 4 presents returns to education for years of schooling - and separately to level of
     schooling, and the pure effect of the program of grades k, which represents the
     "Differences-in-differences" estimators calculated over time. The educational return of
     workers with completed primary level is 0.201. For workers with secondary level, completed
     returns is 0.296 indicating that by completing the secondary level salaries would be 7.8%
     higher (exp (0.296-0.200)-1). Reaching upper secondary increases wages by 13% and higher
     levels raise wages by 52% compared to primary level workers (See Figure 1). A similar
     analysis can be done directly at levels (bottom of the Table) and comparing it to the primary
     level, we observed increments in wages by 9%, 14.6% and 40% regarding primary level
     wages. On average, wages are 10.1% higher for each additional year of schooling after
     completing primary level.10

     Figures 2 and 3 highlight some basic differences pre and post intervention in Jamaica. Note
     how the enrollment rate of beneficiary children above 13 years old drastically changes
     between 2002 and 2006, mainly for children aged 16 and 17. Figure 3 shows that enrollment
     increases at the transition years between primary and secondary (9) and then to completion of
     upper secondary. Even the average of years of schooling increases a little among
     beneficiaries for older children as expected since they are more vulnerable to dropping out
     after they complete a level as primary or secondary.

     These results of better outcomes among PATH beneficiaries can be demographically
     extrapolated to forecast long run effects on final schooling according to Schultz (2001).11 He
     suggests that if the estimated pure effect of PATH on enrollments for each grade were
     sustained over the school-age period, children exposed to the program could accumulate
     additional years of schooling. And the approximation for the cumulative effect on average
     educational attainment would be the sum of the estimated probability of enrollment at each
     grade level for a child from a poor household. This result can be obtained by the double
     difference non parametric estimator without controls as presented in Table 5 or
     parametrically by the sum of pure effect k from Table 4. In other words, the statistic
     represents the additional number of years of schooling that a poor child exposed to the
     program can have compared to some other poor child that was not exposed to the program.
     Children aged 13 - 17 years old who completed grades 5 to 11 in the previous school year,
     reported statistically significantly higher enrollment rates generating a total of 0.73 years of
     schooling (sum of coefficients from Table 4) or 0.61 non-parametrically without controls
     (from Table 5) when exposed to the program. Combining these extra years of schooling and
     the average returns to schooling from above, without making assumptions about discount
     rates, these extra years of schooling would generate on average a 6-7.3% (0.61 or 0.73 times
     10.1%) increase in earning capacity for children exposed to the PATH.

     Conclusions
     The main conclusion is that increase in the benefit level for PATH would generate better
     outcomes for the poor population in Jamaica. Increases in school enrollment and school
     attendance can increase if the program enrolls more poor children that might find the program
     benefits more attractive. From that, more secondary and upper secondary level boys and
     upper secondary girls can join the program improving all schooling outcomes. All

   The ratio of returns of workers with upper secondary level and workers with primary level is 1.619
indicating 62% higher returns. Since, from primary to upper secondary we have 5 additional years of
schooling, we estimate 10.1% increase in returns for each additional year by (1+x)5=1.619.

   The author highlight that this exercise depends on the stability of the short-run program over time.

counterfactual information generated using the BFL model takes into account conditionality
of school enrollment.

Simulations suggest that the increases in the amounts transferred to boys and secondary level
students contribute to better outcomes even in its current poverty reduction effectiveness.
Under the very strong hypothesis that the observed short-run effect of the program is stable
over time, and that the actual structure of returns to education persist over time, the actual
design of the PATH would lead to an increment of 0.73 years of schooling for children
exposed to the program that can be later translated to a 7% increase in earning capacity for
these children.

II Financial Analysis
The main investment of the Project, the conditional cash transfers, had a cost of US$20 million in
2007, the equivalent of 0.22% of GDP or 1.2% of primary budgetary expenditures. The cost of
the Program is expected to increase to US$32 million in 2009, when the proposed increase in the
benefits resulting from adjustment to inflation and introduction of additional incentives for
secondary school students takes full effect. As a share of GDP, the cost of PATH will remain in
the range of 0.22-0.24%. The World Bank contribution to the cost of the transfers is expected to
decrease to 28% of the grants for children (or 20% of the total cost of grants) compared to 75%
during the implementation of the Social Safety Net project. The government is committed to
assuming all costs for the Program after the as demonstrated during the implementation of the
ongoing Social Safety Net Project.

Background

In 2001, the Government of Jamaica entered into a loan agreement with the International Bank
for Reconstruction and Development to support the Social Safety Net (SSN) reform efforts. Prior
to the reform, the cash assistance programs of Jamaica's Social Safety Net had little impact on the
poverty status of beneficiaries and they were not targeted only to the poor resulting in high
leakages. The system was inefficient, benefits were low and there was duplication across
programs.

Objectives of the Project

The overall objective of the SSN Project was to support GOJ efforts to reform the social safety
net into a fiscally sound and more efficient system of assistance to the poor and vulnerable.
Specifically this would be achieved through the following:
        1.       Consolidation of three major cash transfer programs
        2.       Increasing benefits to more meaningful levels
        3.       Improving targeting and reduce leakages
        4.       Linking benefits to desired behavioral changes.
        5.       Institutional strengthening for more effective and efficient operations of social
                 programs

Achievements of the Project

A number of performance targets (outcome and output indicators) were established to determine
whether or not the objectives were met (these have been articulated in section 1.2 of the
document). The majority of the targets set were achieved. However, full consolidation of the
three former cash transfer programs was not completed by project closing.

A new cash transfer program was developed under the Project. The new Program was initially
called UBP (Unified Benefits Programme) and subsequently called PATH (Programme of
Advancement through Health and Education). PATH was aimed to target 236,000 persons below
the poverty line within specific categories deemed to be vulnerable. In April 2008, the
Government expanded the scope of the Program from 236,000 to 360,000 beneficiaries. By the
close of the Project in March 2009, there were 306,699 registered beneficiaries, almost 30% more
than what was originally planned for the Project.

Consolidation of three major cash transfer programs Two of the three Programs (Food Stamp
and Old Age and Incapacity) were consolidated. Due to a legal impediment, the third, Outdoor
Poor Relief, was only partially merged. In order to reduce duplication of benefits, payments to
poor relief beneficiaries was merged with PATH. Other administrative aspects of the Outdoor
Poor Relief such as staffing and beneficiary selection continue to be managed by the Local
Authorities. These outstanding issues will need to be addressed under a legal framework, the
process of which has begun with the development of the new National Assistance Act. The GOJ
hopes to have the new National Assistance Act in place during the next legislative year.

Increase benefits to meaningful levels Benefits paid under the PATH were periodically
increased from $250 JA per month per eligible beneficiaries to maximum of $1,100.00 by
December 2008. The Project kept in-line with the planned benefit increases.

Improve targeting and reduce leakages Targeting to identify the poor was significantly
improved under the project. This was due to the development of a proxy-means test (scoring
formula) by the Planning Institute of Jamaica (PIOJ). Based on the results of a targeting
assessment that was done, 80% of PATH beneficiaries are from quintile 1 and 2.

Link Benefits to desired health and educational changes Benefits paid to beneficiaries are
contingent on children aged 6-17 years attending school at least 85% of the time or babies less
than 6 years maintaining a schedule of health center visits. The compliance requirements were
implemented as planned. However, despite years of training and public education, non-
compliance levels especially among children 1-6 years-old remain unacceptably high.

Institutional Strengthening A number of activities were undertaken to strengthen the
institutional capacity of the Ministry and the Public Assistance Division (PAD) to implement the
Program. These included: staff development and training, procurement of information
technology equipment and software, technical assistance in the development of a scoring formula,
and the development of a monitoring and evaluation system.

Key Lessons learned

Implementation Readiness The implementation of a Bank funded project was new to the
Ministry. More time should have been expended in preparation to ensure that the necessary
staffing and systems were in place prior to implementation. The project was presented to the
Board although the implementation readiness conditions were not fully met, This could have
been prevented by adequate training and support by the Bank to aid implementation especially in
the areas of World Bank financial management and procurement procedures. As a result a
number of procurement projects were delayed and the proper system of financial management
reporting took long to be fully established.

Institutional and Project Management Arrangements The Bank did not support the
establishment of a project unit to manage the implementation of the Project but felt that the
Project should be implemented by the Public Assistance Division (PAD) of the Ministry. Whilst
there are good reasons for this approach, the PAD Division of the Ministry lacked the necessary
qualified and experienced staff to undertake such a large and complex Project. Eventually a
hybrid Project Unit was established with a mixture of GOJ staff and salaried consultants. Despite
numerous discussions with the Bank to agree to a project structure and to allow for the
expenditure to be reimbursed under the loan, the Bank did not support this. This again resulted in
slow and difficult implementation in the first two years of the Project. Retrospectively, a proper
administrative structure should have been established to facilitate a smoother implementation.

Operational Audits During the Project preparation phase at no time was the subject of
operational audits discussed but was introduced at loan negotiations. There was no precedence
for such audits by any other project of similar type. The audits became the `Achilles Heel' in the
Project that resulted in very little or no disbursements until 2004 (three years into project
implementation). The slow pace of disbursement and the overall state of financial management
resulted in the Project being downgraded to unsatisfactory in 2003. Though the Government
voiced its disagreement to the operational audits at negotiations, it was eventually agreed without


                                                61
fully understanding its implications. The Government should have maintained its stance against
the audits.

Inter-Agency Coordination During the Project development phase, officials from key
Ministry's provided support in the design of PATH. MOU's were signed between the Ministries
of Health and Education. The Ministries are large and the support required involved thousands of
teachers and hundreds of schools and health center personnel. Many persons skeptically viewed
PATH initially, but through extensive training and public education, the Project eventually got
the support required. However, in the areas of compliance standards for health, the requirements
established were not in sync with the normal required schedule of health visits for babies. In
addition, the Ministry of health had supply-side constraints. The result was that the compliance
rates for children aged one to less than six years was far below desirable levels. The new Social
Protection Project look to change the compliance requirement to make them more realistic and
meaningful. Additionally, it should be noted that Jamaica already has high health indicators, such
as high levels of immunization and low malnutrition rates. Therefore the project would have very
little impact on these areas. The impact evaluation however, did show that the health seeking
behavior of families on PATH increase by 38% compared to the control group. This is expected
because of the compliance requirement; however, we were not able to determine whether PATH
had any impact on the health status of beneficiaries.

Timing The SSN loan was signed in October 2001, effective for February 2002. The preparation
for a pilot started in December 2001. By May 2002, the Program was being scaled up island-
wide before the pilot phase was completed and no detailed analysis and an examination of the
lessons learned. This posed a number of implementation challenges in the field. There should
have been a longer preparation phase for the Project and careful analysis of the pilot so that the
lessons learned could have been duly incorporated in the scaled up Program.

Management Information System (MIS) In order to handle the implementation of PATH, the
Ministry's internal resources developed several modules of a MIS system in order to handle
application, payment and compliance data. A more complete system wherein many centralized
functions could be decentralized should have been financed under the SSN Project. The
Government went to tender for such a system but due to the price of the bids felt that the MIS
could have been re-developed using internal resources of the Ministry. This proved difficult and
as a result the Project had to tender again for the MIS development. Not having a fully functional
decentralized MIS slowed operational processes.

Benefit Review Mechanism The Project established a benefit review mechanism to protect the
value of benefits. The review mechanism was approved by the Cabinet. That is, if inflation was
greater than 8% in any given year, the benefit should increase by the difference in inflation above
8%. This decision ensured that the economic value of the benefit was not eroded over time,
unlike previous social program in Jamaica.

Institutional Strengthening of the Monitoring and Evaluation Capacity of the Ministry
Throughout the Project a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation system was developed. This
enhanced the Ministry's capacity for impact and outcome evaluations which resulted in better
evidence-based decision making. It also proved useful in the design of measurable indicators for
the follow-up Social Protection Project.
