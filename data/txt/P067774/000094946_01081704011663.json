transform the\n            social safety net into a fiscally sound, and efficient\n            system of social assistance for the poor, and vulnerable\n            groups. The components will: 1) finance conditional grants\n            for poor children (up to age 17), eligible under the\n            program. Direct costs regarding schooling, and health care\n            delivery will be financed by those grants, conditioned to\n            regular health clinic visits for children up to the age of\n            six not enrolled in school, and for children on school\n            attendance up to the age of seventeen; 2) finance\n            conditional grants to poor pregnant/lactating mothers,\n            elderly poor over the age of sixty-five, and poor disabled,\n            and destitute adults under the age of sixty-five, eligible\n            under the program. Benefits will be conditional to regular\n            health clinic visits for adult beneficiaries; and, 3)\n            strengthen the institutional capacity of the Ministry of\n            Labor and Social Security, and institutions involved in the\n            operation, and streamlining of the social safety net in\n            Jamaica. Support will be provided for enrollment mechanisms\n            of temporary employees, hired for data processing, including\n            as well the financing of the necessary technology\n            information equipment, and software. Technical assistance,\n            will support implementation of the scoring formula, based on\n            data from the Survey of Living Conditions, namely at the\n            early stages, when the scoring formula will require periodic\n            review, and refinement. Also included are training, and\n            promotion assistance, project management costs, and,\n            monitoring, and evaluation systems."}, "docdt": "2001-08-09T00:00:00Z"}
