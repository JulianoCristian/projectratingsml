                    IEGWB Mission: Improving development results through excellence in evaluation.

About this Report
     The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes: first, to
ensure the integrity of the Banks self-evaluation process and to verify that the Banks work is producing the expected results,
and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the dissemination of lessons drawn from
experience. As part of this work, IEGWB annually assesses about 25 percent of the Banks lending operations through field
work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that are innovative, large, or complex; those that are
relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which Executive Directors or Bank management have requested
assessments; and those that are likely to generate important lessons.
     To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEGWB staff examine project files and other
documents, interview operational staff, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other
in-country stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
     Each PPAR is subject to internal IEGWB peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. IEGWB incorporates the comments as relevant.
The completed PPAR is then sent to the borrower for review; the borrowers' comments are attached to the document that is
sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the
public.

About the IEGWB Rating System
      IEGWB's use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to lending
instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEGWB evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive at their project
ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional information is available on
the IEGWB website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
      Outcome: The extent to which the operation's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to be
achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes relevance of
objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project's objectives are consistent with
the country's current development priorities and with current Bank country and sectoral assistance strategies and corporate
goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers,
Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which the project's design is consistent with the stated objectives.
Efficacy is the extent to which the project's objectives were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account
their relative importance. Efficiency is the extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher
than the opportunity cost of capital and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is
not applied to adjustment operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately
Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
      Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or expected
outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High, Significant,
Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
      Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the operation and
supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate transition arrangements
for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The
rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision. Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
      Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing agency or
agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and agreements, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government performance and implementing
agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately
Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.

Preface
This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for two investment loans to
Jamaica. The Social Safety Net Project (SSNP, US$77.5 million) was financed through
IBRD Loan 70760 in the amount of US$40 million. The SSNP was approved by the Bank's
Board on September 4,2001, with a midterm review on March 26,2004, and closed on
March 3 1, 2009, nearly 3 years later than planned. The National Community Development
Project (NCDP, US$29.7 million) was financed through IBRD Loan 71480 in the amount of
US$15 million. The NCDP was approved by the Bank's Board on May 30,2002, with a mid-
term review on January 9,2006, and closed on June 30,2008, 6 months later than planned.
Both loans were fully disbursed.

The two projects were part of the Bank's overall social protection and development support
to Jamaica albeit applying different approaches. Both were classified under the Bank's social
safety net theme. Therefore, the projects were chosen for review to feed into the forthcoming
IEG evaluation of Bank support to social safety nets worldwide.

This report was prepared by Victoria Monchuk. Evidence was collected from a review of
World Bank project files, government project reports and evaluations, and independent
published and un-published project assessments, and interviews with Bank staff and
consultants at World Bank headquarters. During a mission to Jamaica in October 2009,
additional interviews were conducted with government officials, development partners, and
members of civil society who were knowledgeable of Bank support in the social safety net
area, and with Bank staff and consultants in the Jamaica Country Office. The IEG team also
conducted field visits to five parishes, where it met with parish program officers, social
workers, school staff, health clinic staff, post office staff, workers from the Social
Development Commission, community development committee representatives, and
beneficiaries. A list of people interviewed is attached in Annex E. The IEG team gratefully
acknowledges all those who made time for interviews and provided documentation and
information. Mission support by Ms. Juliet Georgette Williams in the Jamaica office was also
greatly appreciated. Viktoriya Yevsyeyeva and Marie-Jeanne Ndiaye provided administrative
support.

Following standard IEG procedures, copies of the draft PPAR were sent to the relevant
government officials and agencies for review and comments. The Planning Institute of
Jamaica and the Ministry of Labour and Social Security provided comments in track changes
to the document which were taken into account in the final version of this report.

Summary
This is a Project Performance Assessment Report of the Jamaica Social Safety Net Project
(SSNP) (Ln. 70760) and the National Community Development Project (NCDP) (Ln.
71480). Both projects fall under the Bank's social safety net theme, but applied different
approaches to support Jamaica's social protection efforts. The SSNP disbursed US$40
million with the objective of providing better and more cost-effective social assistance to the
poor. The NCDP complemented a Bank emergency rehabilitation loan and disbursed US$15
million aimed at a) providing basic services and temporary employment in low-income
communities, and b) promoting greater social and community development among the poor.

Poverty rates in Jamaica have declined over the last two decades but poverty remains high
among certain groups, fueled by unemployment and Jamaica's vulnerability to natural
disasters. In the late 1990s the government embarked on a social sector reform for reducing
poverty. However, Jamaica's debt burden, caused by a reduction in the country's main
income sources such as tourism and mining as well as a domestic financial crisis, severely
restricted the fiscal space for social programs. Efforts to curb expenditure disproportionately
fell on capital outlays and social and community services.

To strengthen the existing social safety net, which suffered from weak targeting and high
overheads, the government launched a reform program in 2000 focused on children. It was
geared towards the second pillar of the government's 1997 development agenda: "Protecting
the poor and ensuring inclusion." The reform encompassed all safety net programs and aimed
to consolidate the three major income transfer programs, increase benefits, improve targeting,
and use cost-effective and transparent identification and delivery systems.

In 200 1, a drop in tourism following the September 11th terrorist attacks in the United States,
coupled with domestic instability in the form of riots and floods, hit the Jamaican economy
hard. Renewed attention was placed on community-based social service upgrading and
productive growth in low-income and vulnerable communities.

The Bank's support to social safety net reform came in the form of the SSNP. The objective
of improving social assistance in Jamaica was consistent with the government's development
agenda and Medium-Term Economic and Social Policy Frameworks (2000-03 and 2004-07).
It was supported by both political parties and well aligned with the overall package of donor
support. Because fiscal space for expanding social and development spending was limited
there was need for a focused approach to Bank support. The Bank concentrated its support to
the social sectors and to areas where it had a comparative advantage (for example safety nets)
and argued for linking social assistance to investments in human capital.

The SSNP introduced the new Program of Advancement through Health and Education
(PATH) which provided conditional cash transfers to families with children up to 17 years
old, pregnant and lactating women, and the elderly and disabled. Receipt of payments was
conditional on regular school attendance and health check-ups. A conditional cash transfer
design was a valid instrument for meeting the objectives, albeit rather narrow for addressing
the sources of vulnerability that stem from unemployment. The mechanisms for determining
targeting and benefit levels were flexible and could be adjusted. At the same time, the results
framework was weak.

The Bank designed the NCDP in response to the negative developments in Jamaica in 2001.
The NCDP spoke directly to the country's development priority of protecting the poor and
ensuring inclusion. The Bank's 2006-09 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) also emphasized
the need for providing basic services for the poor to improve human development and
prevent crime. In this sense, the relevance of the project objectives was substantial but could
have been higher if the project had also aimed at improving incomes and creating more
sustainable employment opportunities.

The NCDP was implemented by the Jamaica Social Investment Fund (JSIF) and designed to
address some existing weaknesses of JSIF operations. The approach was warranted based on
JSIFs mandate and capacity. Also, the demand-driven nature of JSIF's work made it a good
tool for building greater community cohesion. However, the project did not incorporate
mechanisms for ensuring unskilled employment and did not guarantee continued
maintenance of the infrastructure after it had been created. This was mainly because of weak
working agreements with the Social Development Commission (SDC) which partnered with
JSIF in order to strengthen social development outcomes. The results framework was also
weak.

SSNPs achievement of the three parts of its objective was as follows: The first objective, to
improve the social assistance system, was achieved. The new cash transfer system is better
targeted; has reduced waste and overlap; and benefits appear to have had a small effect on
reducing poverty. The program is well-managed and the project strengthened the capacity of
the systems and staff in place to implement PATH. However, evidence for increased human
capital investment is not strong. The effectiveness could be improved by further increasing
the benefit level, fine-tuning targeting, addressing remaining administrative overlap, and
understanding constraints that may limit the impacts on health and education outcomes.

Achievement of the second objective, providing a more cost-effective social assistance
system, was substantial. Overall and administrative costs were contained. Cost-effectiveness
was enhanced. But beyond the development and implementation of the PATH program,
efficiency gains in social assistance programs in Jamaica have not been reported.

The third objective, reaching the poor and vulnerable, was also achieved. Although SSNP did
not reach its ambitious targets, PATH still reached the poor well compared to earlier
programs and compared to other conditional cash transfer programs throughout the world.
Moreover, except for difficulties in reaching many elderly, PATH is benefitting the
vulnerable groups on which it focuses.

NCDPs achievement of the two objectives was as follows: The project provided well-
targeted and good quality basic services and created some temporary jobs. Fifty-nine percent
of the 276 sub-projects were in communities located in the poorest income quartile areas.
The project increased access of poor communities to social services and roads. Maintenance
of the infrastructure created, however, was poor due to the lack of maintenance training to
communities. Some temporary employment opportunities were created, although precise data
are not known.

Achievement of the second objective, to promote greater social and community development,
was modest. The project had some positive impact on the social development in the poor
communities reached. For example, some communities have been mobilized to generate
                                              xi


complementary funding for new projects. The use of community-based contracting was
higher than expected but community participation in planning was lower than planned. Many
of the project's social outcome indicators were achieved, but without baselines or targets we
do not know if they represent an improvement in overall social and community development.

Ratings
The SSNP achieved its relevant development objectives, with only minor shortcomings in
design. Therefore, and due also to substantial relevance and efficiency, the overall outcome
of the project is rated satisfactory. The risk to development outcomes is rated moderate. The
economic downturn has started to erode benefit levels. However, political support for PATH
is strong and implementation of the program continues to be refined. Bank performance is
rated moderately satisfactory. Quality at Entry was moderately unsatisfactory. Important
implementation arrangements were lacking which caused delays. Bank supervision was
satisfactory and helped strengthen the capacity and systems in the implementing agency.
Most of the gaps in design were addressed during supervision. Borrower performance is rated
satisfactory. Both the government and the implementing agency performed well. Policy
decisions for reform and the financial commitment to PATH have been unwavering. The
implementing agency (Ministry of Labour and Social Security) has been strengthened for
carrying out the program and is now equipped to do so.

The NCDPs outcome is rated moderately satisfactory. It substantially achieved the objective
of providing basic social services and modestly achieved the objective of promoting greater
social and community development with substantial efficiency, although there were
weaknesses in relevance of design. The risk to development outcome is rated moderate.
There has been inadequate attention to operation and maintenance, thereby reducing the
likelihood that the assets created by the project will be sustained. Bank performance is rated
moderately satisfactory-stronger in supervision than at start up. Borrower performance is
rated satisfactory overall. Government performance is rated satisfactory. Despite the tight
fiscal stance, government support to the project was strong. But much of the achievement of
NCDP can be credited to JSIF, the implementing agency, whose performance was
satisfactory.

Lessons
       The SSNP demonstrated that conditional cash transfer programs, such as PATH, can
       be useful tools for protecting the poor after localized shocks. PATH was able to
       quickly double benefit levels and waive compliance requirements in communities
       seriously affected by Hurricane Ivan, but only to those already participating in the
       program.
   0   Monitoring and evaluation in conditional cash transfer programs should pay more
       attention to the objective ofprotecting the chronically poor and vulnerable. Six of the
       eight SSNP performance indicators reflected human development outcomes. No
       indicators measured the extent to which social assistance benefits effectively reached
       the poor.
       Compliance requirements should be set with attention to supply side constraints (in
       health), the level of impact that could be expected on outcomes (in education), and
                                        xii


any costs incurred in conditioning benefits. Even though the Ministry of Health
advised on the number of health visits required per child, the SSNP still failed to fully
consider the limited capacity of the health system to absorb the demand for health
care. Similarly, school attendance rates, at least at the primary level, were already
high in Jamaica and significant impacts from the project due to the education
conditionality were small. Any impacts on behavioral changes also need to be viewed
in relation to costs incurred for monitoring compliance rates.
Social Investment Funds, such as JSIF, can be useful for dealing with emergencies
and for experimenting with new approaches. The NCDP proved flexible in
addressing the urgent need caused by Hurricane Ivan and for helping communities
gain experience with community contracting. However, uncertainties about a fund's
longevity may create ambiguity about responsibilities for continuing activities and
sustaining the benefits.
The delivery of infrastructure through Social Investment Funds needs to be
accompanied by measures that ensure the effective use, operation, and maintenance
of assets. When using a Social Investment Fund to help provide community chosen
investments quickly, it is also important to explicitly delineate the responsibilities for
operating and maintaining the social infrastructure and to ensure that the capacity for
service provision and infrastructure maintenance is built.

1. Background and context
Macroeconomic and Political Context
1.1    Prior to the turn of the millennium economic growth in Jamaica was slow. From 1981
to 2001 real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew at an average annual rate of only 1.5
percent. As a result of international economic shocks and the government's bailout of large
banks during the financial crisis of 1997, the country was left with a large debt. Moreover, in
2001 the decline in tourism due to the September 1lthterrorist attacks in the United States,
coupled with domestic instability in the form of riots, strikes, and floods, hit the Jamaican
economy hard. Nevertheless, poverty declined in the 1990s, from 45 percent in 1991 to 16
percent in 1998, but only to increase to 21 percent in 2002 (World Bank 2010).

1.2     The four pillars of the government's development agenda prepared in 1997 were: a)
restoring economic growth; b) protecting the poor and ensuring inclusion; c) improving
governance, efficiency and effectiveness of the public sector; and d) ensuring sustainable
development. The strategy for social safety nets included a focus on more development-
oriented programs, centering on families with small children and youth, and improving the
overall targeting and cost-effectiveness. Moreover, the government through its 2000-03 and
2004-07 Medium-Term Economic and Social Policy Frameworks also emphasized increasing
access to social and economic opportunities, facilitating human capital development for the
poor, and enhancing social harmony.

1.3     But the debt burden severely restricted fiscal space for social programs. In 2001,
public debt reached 144 percent of GDP with interest payments of 62 percent of government
expenditure (IDB 200 1). Rigid public wages further crowded out productive spending
directed towards improving social welfare especially of the poor. Efforts to curb expenditures
and restore the fiscal balance had mainly fallen on capital outlays and social and community
services. Public investments on essential services were on the back burner. In 2000/01 the
government spent 6.2 percent of GDP on education, a sizable allocation for a middle-income
country. However, the 2.6 percent of GDP (1 8 percent of government spending) spent on
social protection programs was well below the regional average even after controlling for the
countries' demographic profiles (World Bank 2001, Blank et al. 2000, World Bank 2007).2
At the same time, the lack of real economic growth placed increased demands on social
welfare services.

Poverty Profile and Social Sector Challenges
1.4     Poverty is highly concentrated in Jamaica. Children make up 49 percent of the poor                        ,


and intergenerational transmission of poverty is strong (Blank 2000; JSLC 1998). Erratic
school attendance by children in the low income group is commonly attributed to "money



1
  Although Jamaica and Barbados shared colonial and institutional backgrounds and had similar GDP per capita
in 1968, by 1999 per capita income was three times higher in Barbados than in Jamaica (World Bank 2010).
* Of this around 0.5 percent of GDP was spent on social assistance and 1.2 percent of GDP on social safety nets
overall (Blank 2000).

problems" (Mathematica 2007). Although schooling is free3 for all Jamaican children,
associated costs such as transportation4 and lunches are costly for the poor. Other important
Millennium Development Goal indicators on child health and nutrition are still far from
being achieved. For instance, measles immunization rates in 2002 (86 percent) lagged behind
the regional average in Latin America and the Caribbean (93 percent).

1.5     Rural areas experience the highest incidence of poverty and susceptibility to shocks.
Access to piped water and sanitation services in rural areas is half of that in urban areas
(Blank 2000). Quality and reliability of services is also low in rural areas. In addition, inner-
city areas are dominated by meager social conditions and are plagued by the highest rates of
crime and violence in the hemisphere. Urban poverty has grown quickly, spurring social and
political upheavals.

1.6     Unemployment is strongly related to poverty and economic vulnerability in Jamaica
and is the main cause of concern among the poor (World Bank 2000a). For 18-25 year-olds
in Kingston unemployment is as high as 65 percent (World Bank 2002b). The working poor
earn low wages, have large families, and face severe economic and social hardship.

1.7     Finally, the island's geographic location makes it vulnerable to natural disasters.
Storms, floods and landslides periodically ravage the island. Tourism declined after the 9/11
events, drug wars restrict productive growth, and the high debt burden makes the economy
sensitive to fluctuations in oil and food prices. Historically, political polarization5 divided
communities and caused violence and conflict. Today, gang wars driven by increased drug
trafficking cause insecurity and stir up violence especially in urban centers (World Bank
2005).

Social Safety Net Reform
1.8     Until the year 2000, the evolution of a social assistance system in Jamaica reflected
ad hoc political priorities without much coordination or long-term planning. The social
assistance system consisted of about 20 overlapping, poorly targeted, and uncoordinated
programs aimed at the poor and vulnerable (see Annex A for more details on the key
programs). Benefits were low and the program provided few productive incentives for the
poor to adopt strategies for escaping poverty, such as by investing in human capital or
gaining training and employment. In 2000, in order to protect the poor and vulnerable and
correct the above listed inefficiencies, the government launched a large social safety net
reform.

1.9    The reform program had a special focus on children and was geared towards the
second pillar of the government's development agenda: "Protecting the poor and ensuring

  Primary schooling is free for all children in Jamaica. In 2008 the government also made secondary schooling
free in response to the rising food prices.
4
    In rural areas it is common that secondary students have to use taxis to get all the way to school.
  In the 1930s and 40s two cousins, Norman Manley and Alexander Bustamante, established Jamaica's two
political parties, the People's National Party (PNP) and the Jamaica Labour Party (JLP), in an effort to gain
independence from British rule. Ever since, tensions between the two groups of party supporters have been
high, especially in urban areas. Party supporters have formed garrison towns and controlled the interaction with
other communities.
                                                       3


inclusion," which aimed at enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of social safety nets,
improving educational access and outcomes, improving health services, and stimulating
labor-intensive growth. The four objectives of the social safety net reform were to:

         tailor programs more specifically to risks and conditions associated with poverty and
         vulnerability and develop an associated targeting mechanism;
         integrate programs in order to reduce delivery costs;
         ensure a comprehensive range of benefits to address different conditions (including
         age-specific factors) associated with poverty and vulnerability; and
         introduce flexibility of programs, notably by maximizing complementarity and
         partnerships with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) (World Bank 200 1).

 1.10 In 1999/00 a Policy Matrix for Reform of Social Safety Nets was prepared by an
inter-institutional task force led by the Planning Institute of Jamaica (PIOJ). The reform
proposal was approved by the Cabinet in October 2000. The reform encompassed all social
safety net programs targeted to the poor. It called for consolidating the three major income
transfer programs6 into one conditional cash transfer program (CCT) and increasing benefits
to meaningful levels using cost-efficient and transparent identification and delivery systems.
The new income transfer program, the Program of Advancement Through Health and
Education (PATH)7, would link benefits to investments in human capital of the poor. The
objective of the consolidation was to reduce fragmentation and administrative costs and to
increase impact by raising benefit levels. To tighten the targeting, the reform would develop
a Beneficiary Identification System (BIS) and use a scoring formula for proxy means
testing.* The BIS would be adopted by all of the main safety net programs in Jamaica such as
school-based and health-based programs (World Bank 2000b). To implement the reform and
the new program, the government requested assistance from the Bank and the Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB).

Community-Driven Social Infrastructure Upgrades
1.11 In addition to creating a unified targeted transfer program, renewed attention was also
placed on upgrading community-based social services and productive growth in poor
communities most affected by the 2001 crises. The government's strategy included elements
aimed at upgrading the social infrastructure through focused investments essential for growth
and developing income-earnings capacity for the working poor. The government's
underlying National Poverty Eradication Program (1997) emphasized community-based and
community-led interventions undertaken in partnership with NGOs and the private sector
(World Bank 2OO2b).' The Jamaica Social Investment Fund (JSIF) has existed since 1996 as

6
 These were the Food Stamp Program, the Poor Relief Program, and the Economic and Social Assistance
Program.
' Initially the PATH was knows as the United Benefits Program (UBP).
 Proxy means testing is a method used by some government programs in determining eligibility for benefits
based on a score composed of household characteristics such as location, quality of its dwelling, ownership of
durable goods, demographic structure of the household, and others.
9
 Jamaica's rural policy envisioned an economically and socially viable rural population enjoying access to
services and actively participating in decision-making (World Bank 2005).
                                                       4

a vehicle for undertaking small-scale community-driven projects and to respond to the needs
of the most underserved groups. JSIF was a mechanism through which the iura1 development
goals and community-driven economic and social infrastructure updates could be undertaken.
Social infrastructure such as schools, and community and health centers were the focus.

CAS Priorities-the Bank's Support
 1.12 The pillars of the 2000 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) rested on the
government's development agenda with social programs a priority. Given the tight fiscal
environment and based on lessons from the past, the Bank focused its attention on priority
areas (supported by both political parties and civil society), including safety nets. To support
the government's efforts the Bank's strategy on safety nets was focused on: a) assisting the
reform of the social safety net system through the unification of the three income transfer
programs; and b) implementing and delivering social assistance through the development of
the PATH including funding conditional cash transfer payments to children. Also, although
not envisaged in the CAS but rather in response to the strong negative developments in
Jamaica in 200 1, the Bank supported the government in updating social services for the poor
using community-driven approaches and enhancing inclusion. The three objectives were to
be achieved through the two projects reviewed in this report: the Social Safety Net Project
(SSNP) and the National Community Development Project (NCDP). It should be noted that
the two projects were not coordinated or part of a larger Bank social safety net strategy in
Jamaica. The IDB also provided US$40 million for social safety net reform budget upp port.'^


2. Social Safety Net Project - Description
2.1     In response to the social safety net reform, the World Bank assisted the government
in designing the US$77.5 million Social Safety Net Project (SSNP). The project was
approved on September 4,2001, became effective on February 28,2002 and, after two
extensions, closed on March 3 1, 2009.

Objectives and Design
OBJECTIVES

2.2     The overall objective of the SSNP was to support the Government's efforts to
transform the social safety net into a fiscally sound and more efficient system of social
assistance for the poor and vulnerable. Specifically, according to the Project Appraisal




lo IDB support helped to protect spending on non-wage recurrent items for basic health and education while
reallocating funds within the safety net towards better targeting of programs. The IDB also provided assistance
to the development of the BIS for better targeting of transfers and other social programs such as the school
feeding program (IDB 2001). Finally, IDB funded studies and evaluations to support strategies for other
government safety net programs such as Lift Up Jamaica, school-feeding programs, and youth-at-risk
initiatives.

Document (PAD) the project's development objective was "toprovide better and more cost-
effective social assistance to the extreme poor" (World Bank 2001).                ''
2.3      To this end, the project would: (a) consolidate the major income transfer programs
into a Unified Benefit Program12that would ensure (i) meaningful level of benefits, (ii) cost-
effective and accessible delivery system, (iii) access to benefits linked to desirable behavioral
changes for promoting investment in the human capital development of the poor, especially
children, and (iv) effective targeting of social assistance to special groups; and (b) strengthen
institutional capacity to (i) operate the program effectively and efficiently, and (ii) implement
overall social safety net reform elements, including a transparent targeting mechanism.

DESIGN

2.4     Table 1 describes each of the three project components. The components and the
overall design were not altered during the project duration. The set of key indicators of
achievement as well as the institutional reform and strengthening to be under taken during
the project are listed in Annex Table B1 (including targets and baselines, when available).

2.5     Targeting; Around 17 percent of Jamaicans (about 360,000 people) were poor in
2001, The program focused on certain categories of the poor, such as children, pregnant and
lactating women, and the elderly, disabled or destitute adults. The SSNP used a proxy means
testing mechanism for selecting participants. The goal was that several social safety net
programs in Jamaica (for example school-based programs) would use this common system to
select beneficiaries. The Planning Institute of Jamaica (PIOJ) developed a scoring formula
that ranked households from highest to lowest score. To apply, households must provide
detailed information. l 3 The formula initially produced large errors of inclusion and exclusion
but was refined during piloting and implementation.

2.6     Benefits; In the first year of implementation, the level of monthly per capita benefit
was set at JM$250 or US$6, the second year at JM$375 or US$7.50, and the third year and
thereafter at JM$500 or US$9. The gradual increase was chosen for budgetary reasons and to
keep up with inflation. Benefits were the same for all beneficiarie~.'~

2.7     The PATHpackage; The benefits under the PATH program were not only limited to
cash transfers. School children on PATH were also entitled to school fee waivers, free school
lunches, and free health check-ups. Younger children, lactating and pregnant women, and the
elderly and disabled were provided free health care visits.


II
  The Loan Agreement phrases the development objective of the project as "to provide better and more cost
effective social assistance to the extreme poor in the Borrower's territory". For the purposes of evaluation the
two statements are considered identical.
     Initially the PATH was knows as the United Benefits Program (UBP).
l3 The application form includes questions on name, address, age, sex and schooling of all household members,
condition and permanency of dwelling, sanitary facilities, water, electricity and lighting, phone, household
amenities, and weekly household consumption.
l4 It was discussed whether older children should receive higher levels of benefits to compensate for higher
direct schooling costs. Given the limited budget, it was preferred that the program covered a larger number of
beneficiaries instead.
                                                                  6


2.8      Conditions; Receipt of benefits was conditioned on compliance with education and
health care conditions in order to strengthen human capital accumulation. Children under the
age of 7 not enrolled in school and pregnant and lactating women were to visit health care
centers every two months," while enrolled children between the ages of 6- 17 were to attend
at least 85 percent of the time. Non-pregnant or lactating adult beneficiaries (mainly the
elderly and disabled) were exempt from conditions.

2.9     Delivery of benefits: The government decided to use the Postal Corporation for
delivering the payment checks to the beneficiaries. Payments were made every two months
on the 1Sthof the month. Social workers transferred the checks to local post-offices for
distribution. The Government of Jamaica checks were also widely accepted in many stores.
Starting in 2006, to increase efficiency of delivering the payments, a cash-card system
operated via a large bank was piloted and implemented in late 2007.

           ARRANGEMENTS
IMPLEMENTATION

2.10 Implementing agencies: Implementation of the PATH fell under the Public Assistance
Division in the Ministry of Labour and Social Security (MLSS) and its offices in each parish.
Hence, the project did not make use of a temporary project executing unit. The PIOJ took the
lead in developing the scoring formula for eligibility, the Office of the Prime Minister was
responsible for implementing the required reforms, the Ministries of Education and Health
would be involved in compliance monitoring, and civil society would participate in an
appeals process and in identifying candidates for the program.

2.1 1 Institutional strengthening: In order to carry out the PATH program, institutional
changes would take place at different levels. Investments in staff and equipment for the
application system and scoring formula mechanism would be substantial. Special training for
staff involved in procurement and financial management would strengthen compliance with
requirements and procedures in the new program. Public information campaigns across the
country were scheduled to raise interest in the program. Finally, investments to ensure
adequate project management and evaluation would take place, including commissioning of a
rigorous impact evaluation.

2.12 Risks andfiscal constraints: Several risks were identified at appraisal. First and
foremost was the tight overarching fiscal framework and the uncertainty over the availability
of adequate project funds, especially for increasing the benefit level according to schedule.
The project also anticipated some opposition to the reform from unionized employees of
former programs and from former beneficiaries who would no longer be eligible under the
PATH. These risks did not strongly materialize.

Implementation
2.13 Due to slight delays in finalization, the project became effective two months late on
February 28,2002. The project was extended by almost three years, from June 30,2006, to
March 3 1,2009, to carry out the Management Information System (MIS) enhancement work
and the large recertification exercise which had been behind schedule. Throughout the
project, the supervision rating on the development objective was Satisfactory except in
2005/06, when the project was downgraded to Moderately Unsatisfactory and later
Moderately Satisfactory due to the government's temporary decision not to increase benefit
levels and to delays in legislation and in MIS development.

2.14 Adjusting the scoring formula: The BIS system went through some fine tuning. In
2008, it was agreed to retain two cut-off scores in the formula-one for urban and one for
rural households-to allow for differences in poverty status. In January, 2009 a large re-
certification exercise began for 40,000 families who had been in the program for four years
to verify their continued eligibility.

2.15 Compliance issues: Education compliance was smooth over the project but health
compliance remained very challenging. For children over 12 months of age the health
compliance rate continued to be low (only around 60 percent over the project). Health centers
were overwhelmed as a result of the compliance conditions of two visits per year per child.
The Ministry of Health suggested limiting the number of clinic visits to one visit per year per
child for children over 12 months of age. Instead a parenting health training pilot module
                                                8


 would be implemented. The pilot did not lead to much improvement in compliance rates. By
 the end of the project, compliance rates had reached 85 percent in primary education, 80
 percent in secondary, 85 percent for pregnant and lactating mothers, 92 percent for children
 under 12 months and 67 percent for children between the ages of 1-6 (Government of
 Jamaica, 2009).

2.16 Responding to shocks and hardship: In 2004, to compensate for the damages made by
Hurricane Ivan it was decided to give a one-time doubling of the benefit (JM$800). Also,
according to the loan agreement, if inflation was higher than 8 percent at any time the benefit
level was to adjust upward according to a set schedule. The first adjustment in 2004
increased the benefit from JM$250 to JM$400. It was further increased to JM$530 in
January, 2006 and to JM$650 in April, 2008. Moreover, towards the end of the project it was
agreed to differentiate the child grant for school children by grade level so that older children
received a higher benefit. The higher benefit for older children was meant to compensate for
the higher school costs at the secondary level. Also, boys were given higher benefits than
girls, as boys are more likely to drop out of school. In 2008, to offset the negative
implications on the poor caused by increased food and fuel prices and the international
financial crisis, the government launched a mass enrollment exercise. Coverage was
increased by 40 percent to all of the 360,000 Jamaicans below the poverty line (about 14
percent of the population). The impact of the coverage increase on poverty rates and other
outcomes is unknown.

2.1 8 Disbursements and procurement: Counterpart funding at closing was significantly
higher than appraised. The main reasons were the larger number of beneficiaries and higher
level of benefit than originally planned. Moreover, costs for the impact and qualitative
evaluations, fine tuning of the scoring formula and training materials were higher than
estimated. Initially, as design modifications were still being made, procurement and
disbursements were slow. There were delays in contracting for the MIS system, the pay
agency, the impact evaluation, and the operational audits. Consequently the procurement
rating of the project was downgraded in the early years. Towards the end of the project and
as a result of the positive findings of the impact evaluation, the government, supported by the
                                                     9


Bank, decided to reallocate some of the Bank's credit from goods and consultants to finance
an increased number of beneficiaries. Hence, the Bank's contribution to institutional
strengthening dropped by over 40 percent of what was planned, while the contribution to
child grants increased by almost 17 percent. l 6

2.19 Financial management and auditing; Because a large amount of Bank funds went
directly to cash transfers the Bank required an external operational audit (in addition to the
government's audits) for each payment period (every four months). However, there was no
knowledge in the MLSS of how to design and procure an external audit and it took over two
years before the first audit was completed. During this time all Bank disbursements were on
hold and the government had to borrow elsewhere to finance the program. At the completion
of the first few audits it was found that the internal audit procedures in the government were
sufficiently strong for monitoring the use of funds and the Bank waived its external audit
disbursement requirement.

Monitoring & Evaluation
2.20 Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) quality is rated substantial. The implementation
and use of M&E was substantial, mainly due to the quality of the impact evaluation and
targeting assessment, notwithstanding weaknesses in the results framework.

M&E DESIGN

2.21 The SSNP M&E system design consisted of four parts; a) an MIS that recorded
program processes such as inputs and outputs; b) two qualitative assessments that measured
implementation effectiveness and the perception of beneficiaries; c) impact evaluation
assessing impacts on final outcomes and targeting precision; and d) research studies to learn
about program fine-tuning and special areas of interest. Moreover, the MLSS internal audit
department, the auditor general reports, and the external audits contributed important
information on how the project performed.

2.22 At the time of project approval, the M&E framework had not yet been finalized. It
was adequate for monitoring some of the objectives, but not all. Significant weaknesses
existed. First, the phrasing of the development objective (aiming at creating a `better' social
assistance system) lacked specificity. Adjustments had to be made during the implementation
phase in order to specify indicators by which to assess `better'. Likewise there was no
definition in the results framework for who was classified as extreme poor. It was also not
clear how fiscal soundness of social assistance (part of the overall objective) would be
assessed. Secondly, six out of eight indicators for the development objective focused on the
use of health and education services which, while desirable, were not explicitly stated as part
of the development objective. Also, even though the number of beneficiaries expanded
beyond the initial plans, the target on program coverage (percent of the poor reached) was
unrealistic. Provided the budget, targeting criteria and benefit level, the PATH could by
default not achieve its goal of providing benefits to 70 percent of the nation's poor.

2.23 The impact evaluation design was rigorous. It employed a regression dis~ontinuity'~
method in calculating the effect of the program on health and education intermediate
outcomes on a set of 2,500 beneficiaries against a group of similar people whose application
                                                                  '
scores were found just above the eligibility cut-off criterion.

2.24 Although there were significant weaknesses in the monitoring and evaluation
framework for assessing achievement of the development objectives, the planned targeting
assessment, which provided rigorous evidence on how well the project reached and
benefitted the poor, compensated somewhat for this weakness. The targeting assessment
would assess coverage, benefit incidence, and poverty impact, and monitor key risk groups.

2.25 Because of the shortcomings in the definition of the development objective, and the
design of project results framework for assessing the achievement of the objective, M&E
design is rated modest.

M&E IMPLEMENTATION
2.26 The provisional MIS was expanded in 2003 to include modules on compliance, case
management, appeals, and payment. In 2008 a more adequate system was built, but it still
lacked a module for tracking household expansion. MIS data were used for bi-monthly
reports to the World Bank on compliance rates and distribution of benefits throughout the
project.

2.27 Mathematica Policy Research Inc. was hired to undertake the impact evaluation
including carrying out a detailed targeting assessment. l8 The baseline was fielded in early
2004 and the follow-up in the summer of 2005. JSLC data from 2002 was also used for the
baseline of the targeting assessment. Interim findings were available in 2005 and the final
report was prepared in March, 2007. Two qualitative beneficiary assessments and two
research studies on using the cash cards and parental training on child health were also
carried out. The research studies showed encouraging outcomes but pointed to limited uptake
of the initiatives. The implementation of the monitoring and evaluation system is rated
substantial.

M&E UTILIZATION

2.28 The targeting assessment, available in 2004, provided information about the poverty
level of PATH participants, the level to which the program reached the poor and the expected
effects on household consumption of the poor. Adjustments to the scoring formula were
made throughout the program, based on findings from the targeting assessment. Focus group
data generated in depth information on areas where targeting improvements could be made

  Regression discontinuity is a quasi-experimental evaluation method used to determine whether a program is
effective on the basis of comparing outcomes in similar households just above and below the eligibility cut-off
score, before and after the intervention.
''Originally, a second impact evaluation was planned to be undertaken before project closing. However,
because of the evaluation's encouraging findings and significant rigor and cost it was decided not to move
forward with a second round. In 2009-10 the new Social Protection Project is undertaking a second impact
evaluation of the PATH.
                                                        11


     and justified increased resources for social workers to be in regular contact with
     beneficiaries.

     2.29 Because the results from the impact evaluation were not available until 2005,
     information about the program's effect on human capital investment were not known during
     the first half of project implementation. However, when available, the results provided direct
     evidence on the positive impact on school attendance and health care utilization rates of
     PATH. Moreover, although only a year and a half had passed between the baseline and
     follow-up surveys, the evaluation shed some light on the limited impact on longer run human
     development outcomes such as academic achievement and health care status. Final
     evaluation data are available at the University of West Indies and findings have been widely
     cited in the World Bank and academic research on CCT programs. The findings have
     contributed to design modifications of PATH such as increased in the benefit level for
     secondary students.

 2.30 The qualitative assessments generated feedback from beneficiaries, social workers,
 parish offices, schools, health centers and post offices. Information was sought on program
 eligibility and selection processes; l9 the payment mechanism and its effectiveness; and
 beneficiary satisfaction and behavioral change. These findings fed back into the program for
 continuous fine-tuning. Changes that were made based on the information were:
 strengthening of the case management system, social worker rotation in order to avoid biases,
 piloting an alternative payment mechanism, and differentiation of the child grant benefit
 level by gender and grade level. Therefore, utilization of the monitoring and evaluation
 system is rated substantial.



 3. Social Safety Net Project - Achievement of Objectives
3.1     Assessing whether the SSNP achieved its development objective amounts to
assessing whether the social safety net system is a) `better' than prior to the project, b) more
cost-effective, and c) whether it reached the extreme poor Jamaicans. `Better' is defined
according to what the project intended to improve, namely more efficient social assistance
system with a transparent targeting mechanism and stimulating behavioral changes. Fiscal
soundness of the social safety net system is not specifically addressed. However, aspects of
fiscal sustainability are assessed within the objective of cost-effectiveness. Moreover,
although the objective states that the project would target the extreme poor, the project
description clarifies that the focus is on particularly vulnerable groups among the poor. IEG
assesses whether social assistance reached the extreme poor as well as particular vulnerable
poor groups.

PATHprogram. By merging administrative, selection, and payment procedures of the two
programs duplication and overlap have been reduced. Moreover, it has also reduced the
burden on beneficiaries as they only have to collect one benefit check instead of multiple
kinds of cash and in-kind transfers.21However, despite being re-drafted nine times, the
National Assistance Act, necessary to legally merge the Outdoor Poor Relief Program with
the PATH, has yet to be passed by the Parliament. Centrally, the program is administrated
together with PATH in the MLSS and co-administered locally by social workers from both
the MLSS and the MLGCD. The payment mechanism is merged and the same form and same
criteria is used to determine eligibility for PATH and the Outdoor Poor Relief Program. The
Outdoor Poor Relief Program only covers about 16,600 individuals (five percent of the
PATH) but the incomplete merge has caused some unnecessary duplication of functions on
case management at the parish level. Although data are from 2003, the JSLC 2004 reveals
that half of the households which are eligible for both the Outdoor Poor Relief Program and
the PATH receive both. With the full merger of the three programs there is further scope for
efficiency gains.
3.3     The beneficiary selection mechanism developed under the project has led to better
targeting. The project helped develop the scoring formula used in the BIS.22(Actual
targeting improvements are assessed under objective 3). The scoring formula has made the
selection of beneficiaries more transparent and depoliticized. Nationwide, PATH uses a
standard form for collecting household demographic information and a standard formula for
establishing eligibility. Before the project, political groups, churches and NGOs often
decided on who should benefit. Under PATH, interest groups still play a role in mobilizing
people to apply for benefits but do not determine selection which is done through the nation-
wide BIS. Also, parish program procedures such as the appeals process and the case-
management system help reduce errors of exclusion and inclusion and give rejected
applicants a chance for a more in-depth assessment.
3.4     The targeting mechanism has been moderately successful in its application to other
social safety netprograms. The intent behind the BIS was to use it also to identify
beneficiaries for social assistance programs in addition to PATH. Initially, education-based
programs took on the targeting mechanism for selecting beneficiaries for school fee waivers
for the poor. Similarly, provisions were made for schools to giving free lunches to PATH
children. However, schools had the discretion of enforcing the collection of fees and
providing lunches and many schools opted to treat all enrolled children equally. This
observation was confirmed by IEG mission visits to schools. At the time of the evaluation,
the new government had abolished schobl fees at the secondary level and instated universal
free health care. With the move to more universality in access to social services, the impact
expected from the use of the targeting mechanism in other health and education based
programs beyond PATH has been reduced.

need ("rehabilitation grants," "compassionate grants" and "emergency relief"). The Old Age and Incapacity
component was merged into the PATH program while the one-off grants remain as separate programs. The
Food Stamp Program and the Old Age and Incapacity Program commonly handled different benefits for similar
purposes to the same groups of people.
21
  When asked to compare the Food Stamp Program and the PATH, beneficiaries preferred the PATH (Hope
2005).
22
   The BIS was a collaborative effort between the Bank, the IDB, and the government, drawing on expertise
from the University of West Indies in Kingston.
                                                             13


3S      Benefit levels under PATH were on average low but had some effect on poverty.
Although increasing over the project period, benefit levels were low compared to other CCT
programs in Latin America (Annex Table Cl). On average, the monthly benefit level was
around US$9 per person. This was significantly higher than the Food Stamp Program (in
US$ equivalent and in percent of consumption) but still only around 10 percent of
consumption'expenditure of the poor and 5 percent of the incomes of the poor (Table 3,
World Bank 2008b; Fiszbein and Schady 2009). The PATH benefits were hence lower than
international standards for cash transfers.23 Nevertheless, evaluations show that the transfer
somewhat reduced poverty.24
3.6     Overall, beneficiaries, social workers and school and clinic staff found the PATH
benefits very helpful for them. But beneficiaries explained that the grant was too small to
fully compensate for the costs of sending children to school, especially secondary school.
They felt that further assistance was needed to cover transportation costs and school lunches.
The recent differentiation of PATH benefits effective under the new Social Protection
Program (boys and secondary students get higher benefits) was meant to partly address these
concerns.

23It is debated in the literature what should be commonly accepted standards of cash transfers in order to make
an impact on poverty. Blank (2000) suggests that the amount needed is around 40 percent of the food basket.
World Bank (2007) suggests a transfer equal to 25 percent of the poverty line. Comparing the headcount of
poverty, the poverty gap and the squared poverty gap (severity of poverty) the PATH program performed better
than the Bolsa Familia program in Brazil but worse than the programs in Ecuador and Mexico (Fiszbein and
Schady 2009).
24Under the new Social Protection Project the Bank is considering helping the government to prepare an
indexation formula for the benefit level so that it can be more quickly adjustable in response to price changes or
shocks.

3.7     PATH has linked benefts to human capital investments in health and education but
increases in service utilization have been modest.25 The impact evaluation shows that, on
average, PATH children (both primary and secondary students) have three percent higher
school attendance (equivalent to 0.5 days more per month) than comparable non-PATH
children (Table 4). Albeit statistically significant, this average effect is small in economic
magnitude. The impact evaluation did not explore whether there was a difference in the
impact by grade level or over time. Because enrollment rates, especially in primary school
were already high in Jamaica, primary enrollment rates rose only by 2.9 percentage points
(from 96.2 percent in 2000 to 99.2 percent in 2007) over the project period. At the secondary
level, enrollment increases were higher especially for 15-16 year olds (14 percent increase
from 74.5 to 84.9 percent) (Annex Table Bl). These increases are comparable in size to those
of similar CCT programs in other countries with high starting levels of school enrollment and
attendance (Mexico, Brazil). Countries with low educational outcomes (such as Nicaragua,
Cambodia) have generally seen higher effects. Also the observed changes in enrollment are
not measured only for PATH children (or compared to non-PATH children) but rather for the
nation as a whole. Other factors, such as the ongoing efforts to strengthen secondary school
quality, could have lead to the enrollment gain. School teachers surveyed for the PATH
evaluation did not observe an increase in overall enrollment rates (Hope 2004).
3.8      In the health sector, impacts were stronger, on average, but evidence is not
convincing enough to assert that health service utilization has increased among the poor. The
impact evaluation shows that PATH has contributed to a 38 percent increase in health center
visits for PATH children 0-6 years old compared to control individuals over a six-month
period (0.73 visits for control individuals and 1.01 for PATH children) (Table 4). This is
equivalent to 0.28 more visits per 6 months for the PATH children. The largest increase was
for children under 12 months who (required to attend centers 6 times per year) where PATH
children had 0.84 more visits than non-PATH children.26On the contrary, the impact
evaluation shows no significant differences in the frequency of visits compared to the
previous year (before beneficiaries were on the program) compared to non-participants, Both
among PATH participants and non-participants, 69 percent report that they attend health
clinics with about the same frequency as before. Also there were no noticeable increases in
overall children's immunization rates (World Bank 2009; Mathematica 2007).27Moreover,
there is no reliable information available to judge whether PATH has succeeded in increasing
health care utilization for pregnant and lactating women but the program reported high
compliance rates in this group. Because the impact evaluation only reflects a snap-shot in
time it is not known to what extent school attendance and health care visits also increased
compared to the control group over time.




25Education compliance for school aged children and health compliance for 0-12 month olds was high (around
80-90 percent) while health compliance for 1-6 year olds was mediocre (67 percent).
26This difference was not statistically significant as sample sizes were small when splitting the sample in
subgroups.
27   Immunization rates were already relatively high in Jamaica prior to the program.

3.9     Consequently, although not objectives of the project, the PATH program has not led
to any impacts on school achievement or health status (Mathematica 2007; Hope 2004 and
2005; Government of Jamaica 2008). Comparing test scores and health status outcomes
between PATH beneficiaries and control groups, no statistically significant differences were
detected. This is consistent with findings from other CCT programs in Latin America and the
Caribbean, which so far only have had limited impacts on human development outcomes
(Robalino et al. 2009; Government of Jamaica 2008).

3.10 The project has substantially helped improve the capacity of the MLSS to operate
safety netprograms. While it is clear that the capacity in the Public Assistance Division of
the MLSS was not sufficient at the start of the project, much improvement has been made.
The project provided technical assistance, paid for expert consultants, technical training and
software. The division has strengthened its procedures on enrolling and managing
beneficiaries; collection of information from health centers and schools; the payment
mechanism for delivering benefits; MIS and audit systems; and procurement and financial
management. MLSS has also received funding from IDB for institutional strengthening (and
direct transfers). Full attribution to the project is hence not feasible. However, staff in MLSS
expressed great appreciation for Bank technical assistance.

3 , l l In sum, the project has helped the government o Jamaica transform its social safety
                                                         f
net system. The new system is better targeted than the previous programs (see objective 3);
waste and overlap has been reduced; and benefits appear to have had a small effect on
poverty rates. The program is well managed and operated and the project has strengthened
the capacity of the systems and staff in place to implement the program. Nonetheless, there is
no strong evidence that indicate that PATH has been able to significantly increase human
capital investments for the poor. Also, the effectiveness of the program could be further

improved by increasing the benefit level, fine-tuning targeting and addressing remaining
overlap with the Outdoor Poor Relief Program.

Objective 2. Providing a more Cost-Effective Social Assistance System.
Rating: Substantial

3.12 Overall costs have been contained and administrative costs have remained low. In
2008, the government spent 0.2 percent of GDP on PATH which is consistent with spending
on the income transfer programs prior to reform. This level of spending is close to the mode
(0.2 percent) and just below the average (0.25 percent) for other CCT programs in Latin
America and the Caribbean (Robalino et al. 2009). On a similar budget the Food Stamp
Program covered more beneficiaries but provided a lower per capita benefit. Hence, at
project closing, the financing had slightly shifted towards covering fewer people but at a
higher level compared to before the project. With the expansion of the program coverage it is
expected that overall spending will increase to 0.3-0.5 percent by 2010. At closing,
administrative costs were 10 percent of total costs, below the target of 15 percent (Table 5
and Annex Table C2). On average, 90 percent of the budget went directly as cash transfers.
PATH administrative costs were similar to those of the Food Stamp Program (9 percent) but
much lower than in the stand alone Outdoor Poor Relief Program (69 percent) and the
Economic and Social Assistance Program (44 percent) (Blank et al. 2000).28

3.13 Delivering payments using Government of Jamaica checks via post ofices has proven
to be a relatively efficient method of reaching beneficiaries and an improvement in eficiency
and security compared tofood stamps. Under the Food Stamp Program benefits were handed
out by social workers at various locations without proper security for printing, transportation
and distribution of the stamps. Because most recipients used stamps for non-food items
printing the stamps was not an efficient use of funds. Payment receipt and collection rates are
now monitored electronically and overdue uncollected checks can be cancelled
automatically. The checks used by PATH are widely accepted and beneficiaries can use them
directly at most local stores. Nevertheless, post offices, especially in urban areas, are

beneficiaries (14 percent of costs) and some of the administrative costs of the Indoor Poor Relief Program.
Administration costs of Indoor and Outdoor Poor Relief Programs are very difficult to differentiate.

spending valuable resources on handing out payments and managing beneficiaries. A cash
card payment system has been developed and piloted. It has been found that the electronic
cash cards are much more efficient than check payments but are not fully accessible for all
PATH beneficiaries due to their rural location, especially for the elderly.

3.14 Efficiency gains from the project on other social assistance programs in Jamaica
have been limited beyond the development and implementation of the PATHprogram. Cost-
effectiveness could have been higher if the targeting mechanism and consolidation of the
reform initiatives with other social assistance programs had been more extensive. On
balance, cost-effectiveness was enhanced as a result of the project.

Objective 3. Reaching the Extreme Poor and Particularly Vulnerable
Groups among the Poor. Rating: Substantial
3.15 More people than expected benefittedfrom the PATH and coverage compares to the
coverage rates of other programs. 29 At closing, PATH benefits reached 306,69930people of
which 233,206 were children (Government of Jamaica 2009). This is well above the
expected 217,000 people (57,000 adults and 160,000 children) and similar to the number of
persons reached under the previous transfer programs (which PATH replaced). Towards the
close of the project the government expanded the number of beneficiaries to 360,000 in
response to the food and fuel crisis. However, the JSLC (2008) calculates that half of the
poorest quintile island-wide does not receive PATH. IEG calculates that PATH covers 39
percent of the poor.31Fiszbein and Schady (2009) rank Jamaica as having the fourth best
coverage rates of the poor out of 12 CCT programs worldwide. Although coverage rate of the
poor was lower than anticipated, PATH compares well with the coverage of other programs
(Table 6 and Annex Table C3).32

3.16 PATH is better targeted than most existing social safety net programs in Jamaica33
and compares well with targeting in other CCTs (Table 6 and Annex Table C3). Fifty-nine
percent of beneficiaries fall below the poverty line, 58 percent fall in the bottom quintile, 33
percent in the bottom decile (World Bank 2007; Mathematica 2007). The impact evaluation

29
  The project did not have an indicator for reaching the extreme poor but had two poverty targets: more than 70
percent of beneficiaries should be below the poverty line and more than 70 percent of the nation's poor should
receive the benefits. Neither of these targets was met. The 70 percent coverage target was very ambitious since
even with perfect targeting the expected number of participants would only account for less than half of all of
the poor Jamaicans. However, compared with other programs PATH is well targeted and has relatively good
coverage.

  Based on 59 percent targeting, 290,000 total beneficiaries, a national poverty level of 17 percent, and 2.6
million population size.
32 However, the impact evaluation, using data collected in the early years of the project, finds a actual coverage
rate for PATH of only 20 percent accounting for those eligible participants who do not regularly comply and
hence have their benefits revoked for any given time period. Similar data on actual coverage rates are not
available for other programs.

classified 27 percent of PATH beneficiaries as living in extreme poverty.34Eleven percent of
beneficiaries have consumption levels of more than 50 percent below the poverty line but 17
percent have consumption levels of more than 150 percent above the poverty line
(Mathematica 2007). In terms of allocating finds to the poor (benefit incidence) PATH
compares well with other CCT programs. PATH delivered around 61 percent of total benefits
to the poorest quintile. The average for six programs in Latin and Central America was 62
percent (Fiszbein and Schady 2009).

3.17 PATH is well targeted to particularly vulnerable groups among the poor. At closing
80 percent of beneficiaries were children and 19 percent were elderly (Government of
Jamaica 2009). While qualitative assessment^^^ show there is room for improvement of
targeting and coverage, PATH covered significant proportions of large households, those
without basic amenities and those who did not work over the last 12 months (Mathematica
2004).36

3.1 8 In sum, although it did not reach its ambitious target on coverage of the poor, PATH
still reaches the poor well compared to earlier programs and compared to other CCT
programs throughout the world. Moreover, except for the elderly, PATH is benefitting the
vulnerable groups on which it focuses. Therefore, the objective of reaching the extreme poor
and particular vulnerable poor groups is rated substantial.

households where the head did not work over the previous 12 months, 80 percent have a pit toilet, and only 9
percent have indoor tap water (Mathematica 2004). Compared to all poor Jamaicans PATH households are on
average larger and have fewer household amenities (JSLC 2002). Beneficiaries and social workers noted that
the selection process was biased against those who possess household amenities (such as TV, refrigerator,
flushing toilet) but who were still in dire need of assistance. It is also known that the PATH has had difficulty in
enrolling the elderly and disabled who cannot register for benefits on their own initiative. In December 2009,
the Bank approved a grant for more intense recruitment of elderly and disabled to PATH.

RELEVANCE

4.2     Relevance is rated substantial, on balance, based on consistency with government
objectives and Bank strategy. Although a CCT approach was suitable to address some of the
sources of chronic poverty and vulnerability there were shortcomings in design.

4.3     Relevance of objectives. The objectives of the SSNP, although poorly articulated,
were consistent with the second pillar of the government's 1997 development agenda:
"Protecting the poor and ensuring inclusion". The objectives also remained relevant
throughout implementation as the top priority of the Medium-Term Economic and Social
Policy Frameworks 2000-03 and 2004-07 was to facilitate human capital development
among the poor through the use of CCTs with links to behavior change in health and
education. Moreover, the project was targeted towards the groups of Jamaicans most
vulnerable to shocks and those who constantly struggle with poverty. These social goals were
relevant to both of the main political parties and supported by the larger NGO community.

4.4     The investment operation supporting selected parts of the larger reform was also
consistent with the 2000 CAS objectives which emphasized a focused Bank approach in
areas where the Bank had a comparative advantage (including safety nets). In the next CAS
(2006-09) the Bank's focus shifted more strongly to accelerating inclusive economic growth,
generating employment, and preventing crime while maintaining the priority of improving
human development. The conditional aspect of the child grants was consistent with the
Bank's social safety net strategy to support safety nets that encourage investments for the
future. The project supported the start of the Jamaican safety net reform which was
envisioned to roll out over several years. Therefore it was not intended to address such issues
as labor market weaknesses and the need for labor-intensive growth. The Bank's follow-on
Social Protection Project addresses these new priorities through labor market training for
adult members of PATH households and an expanded secondary school benefits intended to
                                                20


curb youth-at-risk behaviors. The project was also aligned with the broader IDB sector
support program protecting social sector expenditures.

4.5     Based on the relevance to the country's social safety net reform agenda, the
prevailing social and economic context and the setting within broader development support,
the relevance of project objectives is rated substantial. The one shortcoming was the lack of
attention to the strong links between poverty and unemployment and the weak articulation of
the objectives.

4.6     Relevance of design. In order to meet the dual goals of protecting the poor and
encouraging investment in human capital a CCT design was fitting. As discussed above, the
project took a pragmatic approach and did not try to be comprehensive in developing safety
nets to address all sources of vulnerability.

4.7      The overall design of the project, to help develop a targeting formula and the
Beneficiary Identification System to be used throughout social safety net programs and to
finance the start and implementation of the PATH while strengthening government's own
capacity to manage the program, was highly consistent with the project objectives. Merging
of the three income transfer programs and the development of a transparent and universal
targeting mechanism was based on supporting studies and evidence from other countries.
Initially, benefit levels under PATH were relatively low, especially for urban areas.
However, enough flexibility was built into the project to adjust the eligibility cut-off criterion
and differentiate the level of benefits at higher school grades when it was found necessary.
The comprehensiveness of the coverage of both younger and older children as well as
pregnant and lactating mothers and elderly and disabled was adequate for protecting the
various groups at risk (other CCTs have mainly focused on school aged children only).
Applying conditionality also to children below school age and to pregnant and lactating
mothers aimed at improving important child malnutrition and mortality outcomes which were
of high priority to the government.

4.8     The results framework of the project was adequate for monitoring some of the
objectives of the project but not all. It was not clear from the results framework how
providing a "better" social assistance system would be assessed. On the other hand, results
indicators mainly focused on health and education outcomes that were not explicitly part of
the development objective. While there was no indicator linked to poverty rates the targeting
assessment addressed the effect on poverty levels. The envisioned causal chain between
project funding and intended outcomes was straightforward.

4.9     Overall project design was appropriate given the government's general capacity and
willingness to undertake a social safety net reform. But the Public Assistance Division in the
MLSS was not initially set up to handle a program of this character. For instance, adequate
financial and information management systems were lacking. The choice to frontload the
capacity building and strengthening components of the project was wise but weak
implementation arrangements caused significant delays in implementation. The Bank's
requirement of a strict external audit proved to be expensive for the government which had to
borrow additional funds. The project should have better accounted for supply constraints in
the health sector for meeting the increased demand on clinics and health centers.
                                               21


4.10 The overall choice of design (a CCT program) was fitting for meeting the objectives,
albeit a narrow approach for addressing other sources of vulnerability. But there were
weaknesses in the results framework, and some of the institutional realities and constraints
were not well thought through in the design stage. Relevance of design is therefore rated
modest.

EFFICACY
4.1 1 Efficacy is rated substantial due to the substantial achievement of all of the three
parts of the development objective (see section 3). Annex Table B 1 lists the achievement of
the outcome and output indicators of the project and the progress on institutional reform and
strengthening. Although only two of the eight outcome indicators were fully achieved, most
of the outputs were produced.

EFFICIENCY
4.12 Cost-effectiveness is discussed at length in section 3, The core project activities were
carried out with relatively high efficiency. Although the targeting formula has not been
extensively applied to other safety net programs (other than the PATH) as intended, it has
helped to improve PATH'S benefit incidence and targeting of the benefits to the poor (similar
to that of other programs). Moreover, delivering payments using government checks via post
offices has proven to be a more efficient method of reaching beneficiaries compared to
before the program. As a result, the reduction in leakage and better process efficiency in
delivering benefits has kept PATH program costs on target.

4.13 Administrative costs have also remained low at 10 percent (target 15 percent), in line
with the Food Stamp Program (9 percent), and much lower than costs in the other two
previous transfer programs. Over the project period, the increase in the share of project costs
that went directly to grants (92 percent in 2009) suggeststhat overheads were reduced as the
project matured. Rate of return analysis was used in making design decisions on whether to
cap the educational grant to three children per family. It was shown that the return was
almost twice as high with no cap on the number of children per family.

4.14 Based on the increased efficiency in terms of beneficiary targeting, program
implementation and overall administration of social safety nets, as well as the containment of
costs, efficiency is rated as substantial. Compared to the social assistance system in Jamaica
prior to the project, efficiency was increased. However, efficiency could have been higher if
the targeting and consolidation aims of the projects had also been applied to other non-core
social safety net activities as intended before the introduction of free universal schooling and
health care. Moreover, the hold up in Bank disbursement in the early years of the projects,
caused by the Bank's external audit requirement and which resulted in the government
having to seek funds elsewhere to maintain the program, induced some unnecessary costs for
the government.

Risk to Development Outcome
4.15 The risk to development outcome of the SSNP is rated moderate. Political support for
the program is strong and implementation of the PATH continues to be refined. However,
                                                      22


financial resources for sustaining outcomes are uncertain and the economic downturn has
started to erode benefit levels.

4.16 Even after the shift in government in 2007 political support for the social safety net
reform and for the PATH program continued to be strong. Building on the reforms achieved
under the SSNP the Bank has followed up with a second investment loan which continues to
support the PATH and address pensions and employment generati~n.~'

4.17 However, there are several risks to the outcomes produced by the SSNP. The key risk
is the increasingly difficult economic and fiscal environment that threatens both the fiscal
sustainability of the program but also the real values of benefits for the poor and the capacity
of families to continue to invest in human capital.

4.18 Recently, close to 20,000 jobs were lost in Jamaica due to changing trade conditions
and the effects of the global crisis. Remittance incomes have dropped and earnings from the
tourism industry, bauxite mining, and the agriculture sector are diminishing. Further labor
market declines are expected. More and more Jamaicans are falling into poverty but financial
resources are not available to increase the coverage of social assistance. The PATH program
has thus far been effective in responding to local crises. To compensate those affected by
natural disasters the program has been able to temporarily increase benefit levels and void
conditionality requirements. Also, in response to the food price increases in 2008 government
expanded PATH coverage to 360,000 people. But CCT programs that are means tested based
on household characteristics and amenities are not well equipped for responding to the
temporary needs of new groups of non-traditionally poor who may not be eligible based on
their household data but who suddenly lose their source of income as a result of a shock.
Other types of social safety net programs, such as public works, may be more appropriate for
addressing these sources of vulnerability at the same time as giving the government the
ability to scale back benefits in times of less need.

4.19 Government discussions have been initiated on the creation of a tiered system of
social assistance with a universal tier the elderly, disabled or destitute poor who cannot
participate in the economy, a second tier for private employment insurance, another one for
government employees, and the PATH for protecting poor children. Within the conditional
part of the PATH program work is being undertaken for the possibility of removing the
conditionality on the child grants for the poorest during this time of economic hardship.

4.20 In order to sufficiently protect the poor and stimulate self-reliant economic
opportunities the social assistance system in Jamaica needs to develop mechanisms for
protecting incomes and jobs and alignment with long-term economic growth strategies. The
"second generation reforms" and the links to labor markets under the Social Protection
Project is an important move towards achieving these objectives. But the PATH is only a
component of the overall social assistance system in Jamaica and it remains challenging to

   The new Social Protection Project aims at implementing "second generation reforms" including fine-tuning
the targeting system and benefit levels (especially for secondary school children); linking adult members of
PATH households with labor market initiatives; and addressing some youth-at-risk issues.
                                                    23


address the needs for the non-chronic poor not captured by the PATH. For example, the
National Insurance Scheme does not adequately cover workers in the large informal sector.38

4.21 Moreover, the program has not been able to increase benefits sufficiently enough to
compensate for the economic downturn. As poor people lose income earnings the real benefit
levels have been eroded. For some of the extreme poor who depend on the additional support
from the PATH the economic crisis has made it difficult to continue to comply with the
education and health requirements. As a result, benefits may be pulled from those who need
it the most. Moreover, with the move to increased universality, part of the PATH package
(school and health fee waivers) is no longer only targeted to the poor. Hence, the impact of
the scoring formula and the BIS supported by the Bank has been reduced.

4.22 With the continuing high debt and severe difficulties in tax collection it is not certain
whether the government can keep funding the program without the assistance of the World
Bank or other donors. In February 20 10 Jamaica signed a stand-by arrangement with the
IMF, and the World Bank and IDB have agreed to provide budget support. Social
expenditures are not formally protected under these arrangements but it is the hope that they
will not be reduced. Without specific support for the social assistance sector from a major
donor, it may be difficult for the government to maintain PATH coverage and benefits at
current levels.

Bank Performance
4.23 On the whole, Bank performance is rated moderately satisfactory. Quality at entry
was less than ideal but many of the weaknesses were improved during supervision.

QUALITY ENTRY
      AT

4.24 The Quality at Entry of the project was moderately unsatisfactory. The Bank had the
technical capacity and expertise to prepare the project but important preparation and
implementation arrangements were lacking which caused subsequent delays.

4.25 The entry point for Bank lending to social safety net reform in Jamaica was based on
numerous studies funded by the Policy and Human Resources Development Fund grants and
by the IDB. The existing inefficiencies were well known and the Bank was familiar also with
the JSLC systems and data availability for monitoring program implementation. With the
Bank's advice and guidance, the government was encouraged to take action on its strategy
for social safety net reform.

4.26 However, during IEG's mission Jamaican authorities and other development partners
expressed some frustration with the Bank for taking too much of a cookie cutter/prescriptive
approach to developing social safety nets. A CCT addresses many of the needs but more
attention could have been paid, already at the design stage, to the links between
unemployment and poverty as well as to how to develop a safety net system that can be
scaled up in times of crisis and scaled down when needs are less.

38Consistent with the new emerging development priorities the Bank is preparing two projects on employment
creation and skills building and economic growth.
                                            24


4.27 The Bank had significant experience with financing CCTs in many countries,
particularly in Eastern Europe and Latin America. In Jamaica the Bank is praised for its
technical knowledge and innovation. The Bank's inputs for policy formulation were effective
and broad stakeholder consultation and non-partisan participation was undertaken to gather
support for the reform agenda and PATH program development. The Bank also drew on
senior experts on project design and development of the operational manual. The Bank took a
pragmatic approach to intervention and favored carrying out first generation reforms with
room for second generation improvements at a later stage. This strategy was consistent with
government priorities. During preparation the Bank and the IDB worked together effectively.
The Bank's inputs were well integrated into the coordinated donor package in the social
sector. For instance, preparation missions were joint between the Bank and IDB.

4.28 But at the time of appraisal, the state of readiness of the project was not ideal. This
was the first time a CCT program was implemented directly by a ministry. The results
framework was not fully developed and the implementation arrangements in the MLSS were
far from set. Entrusting the MLSS with the overall project management and opting not to use
a project implementation unit was the right decision in the long run. But the Bank should
have assured that the necessary systems and staffing were in place in the MLSS before
rolling out the program. Although the Bank undertook the necessary procurement and
financial management assessments, many items were not satisfied at effectiveness. There was
no procurement plan and the lack of knowledge of MIS and financial management in the
ministry caused hold-ups in implementation and contributed directly to the two project
extensions.

4.29 Despite the Bank's experience with CCT programs in other countries, the Bank was
not familiar with operational requirements for cash transfers. The capacity of the health
system to absorb the increase in required health visits was overestimated (although the
recommended number of visits per year per child was set by the Ministry of Health itself).
Also, the strict external audit requirement, which came about just before approval, was a
poor design choice from the Bank's side. Bank disbursements were on hold for the two first
years of implementation until the MLSS had prepared terms of reference, hired a firm, and
carried out the first audits. In the mean time, the government had to borrow funds in the
market to finance the grants. The disbursement delays slowed implementation and reduced
efficiency. In setting conditionality for investment loans the Bank needs to provide the
required systems and capacity up front so as not to negatively affect implementation.

QUALITY SUPERVISION
      OF

4.30 Bank supervision was satisfactory. The Bank significantly helped strengthen the
capacity and systems in the MLSS to carry out the PATH program. Most of the gaps in
design and implementation readiness were addressed during supervision.

4.3 1 Some of the design weaknesses were cleared up during the first years of
implementation but some initial delays continued to hamper the project throughout.
Indicators and targets to measure achievement of the development objective were fine-tuned
after project effectiveness. Moreover, the Bank extensively helped strengthen the
administrative systems within the MLSS to carry out the program. Especially the
procurement, financial management and internal audit functions have been improved based
on Bank support.
                                                  25


    4.32 After it was shown that the external audit requirementsimposed by the Bank did not
    add value to the country's own audit processes the Bank helped build up the internal control
    mechanisms. For example, the Bank asked the internal audit staff to deepen its field based
    controls with more household visits and focus groups wIth beneficiaries. Also, the appeal
    process was strengthened so as to ensure transparency of targeting and eligibility selection
    and to ensure that the transfers reached those intended. The Bank also helped provide
    software for systematizing the audit plan and reporting. Staff in the MLSS was pleased with
    the responsiveness and technical expertise of Bank supervision on procurement, auditing, and
    financial management.

    4.33 Throughout the project the dialogue between the Bank, the PIOJ and the MLSS was
    continuous. Supervision missions were frequent and the balance was adequate between
    strengthening internal processes; furthering the reform agenda; and delivering payments to
    beneficiaries. However, the Bank could have acted sooner and amended the loan agreement
    earlier to prevent the disbursement delays that resulted from the external audit requirement.

    4.34 The Bank was also instrumental in ensuring rigorous monitoring and evaluation
    implementation. The impact evaluation was contracted and undertaken early in the project
    cycle and the findings helped focus project management towards development results.
    Finally, the constant focus on the part of the Bank on maintaining meaningful benefit levels
    was successful in guaranteeing that benefits were not eroded and that the government kept to
    its commitment to provide adequate support to the poor and vulnerable even during times of
    extreme fiscal crunch.

    4.35 Overall, without the assistance of the Bank, which funded 45 percent of the child
    assistance grants, the PATH could not have provided the level of benefits to the wide number
    of people that it did and continues to do. During the project Jamaica tapped the Bank for both
    financial as well as technical assistance. The Government of Jamaica views the Bank's
    technical and innovative leadership as its main contribution and something that other
    development partners cannot bring to the table in the area of social safety nets. But as
    capacity of the government has been continuously strengthened while the fiscal stance
    remains fragile, the government may draw relatively more on the financial assistance of the
    Bank in the future.

    Borrower Performance
    4.36 Borrower performance is rated satisfactory. Both government and implementing
    agency performed satisfactorily.

    PERFORMANCE OF THE GOVERNMENT

`
    4.37 Overall, government performance is rated satisfactory. Policy decisions for reform
    and the financial commitment to social safety net reform and to the project have been
    unwavering.

    4.3 8 From initial inception through implementation the government was strongly
    committed to social safety net reform and the development of the PATH program. With the
    PIOJ in the lead and broad representation via the inter-ministerial steering committee the
    Policy Matrix was developed. There was buy-in from both sides of the political spectrum and
                                                     26


from NGOs and other relevant groups. The government adopted a comprehensive approach
to CCTs3' and depoliticized social assistance.

4.39 Given the political neutrality of the PIOJ and the continuity of staffing in the
government there was scope for taking a long term strategic approach to social assistance
reform in Jamaica and for implementing it in a staggered fashion. The government's agenda
included merging the income transfer programs, improving targeting of all social safety nets,
developing a cash grant system, and strengthening early childhood development outcomes,
including for example via school feeding programs. With the staggered approach the SSNP
succeeded in the full merger of two of the three transfer programs (see paragraph 3.1 for
more detail).

4.40 The financial commitment to the program also remained strong throughout
implementation. The government fully funded the pilot, and ensured that beneficiaries could
receive their grants when the disbursements from the Bank were on hold. Moreover, the
government maintained its commitment to increasing benefit levels over time. Even during
severe financial hardship in 2005/06 the government provided additional funds for raising
benefits from JM$400 to JM$530 to keep up with inflation. It should be noted that IDB's
policy loan likely contributed to the government's unwavering financial support to PATH.

4.41 Toward the end of the project the government made a decision to expand the
coverage to 360,000 beneficiaries; part of the process of scaling up the program's success.
However, with the new political party in place there has been a slight change to the aim of
increased targeting. Although the BIS was intended to be applied by other safety net
programs, the move towards universally free access to health care and education has caused
some of the rationalization envisioned with the BIS to be washed out and targeting
weakened. It will be important for authorities to maintain focus on the long term vision of the
reform and consider potential trade-offs in targeting and efficiency gains when altering the
larger social safety net agenda. The government has not yet repealed the 1886 Poor Relief
Act, nor has it approved the National Assistance Act. Therefore, some administrative
duplication still remains as the Outdoor Poor Relief program is still not fully merged into
PATH.

PERFORMANCE OF THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCY

4.42 Implementing agency performance was satisfactory. Although not set up to manage
and implement the program at the start, the MLSS has constantly been strengthened and is
now equipped to do so.

4.43 The Public Assistance Division in the MLSS was the implementing agency of the
project. This was the first time a CCT program was implemented through a ministry directly.
The systems in place in the MLSS for carrying out the PATH program were not adequate at
the time of effectiveness. For instance, no computerized financial management system was in
place, the MIS was basic, and parish office capacity was especially poor. Instead of hiring
new technically qualified staff to run the program the ministry opted for using already
established staff. This approach led to several initial delays.

39 ThePATH program covered children, pregnant and lactating mothers and the elderly, disabled and destitute.
Other CCT programs in Latin America have focused only on children.
                                                       27


    4.44 On the other hand, the long term vision and constant operational strengthening has
    provided consistency and ownership of the program objectives and processes within the
    MLSS. For instance in procurement, when the current procurement manager came into place,
    compliance with government and Bank, procedures improved. Except for the severe delay
    with the procurement for the MIS, procurement procedures were satisfactory for the
    remainder of the project. With the help of the PIOJ and the Bank the MLSS developed strong
    relationships with the Ministries of Health and Education for applying and monitoring the
    conditionalities.

    4.45 Over time the implementing agency was significantly strengthened. At closing, staff
    and systems were in place to operate a program of PATH'S magnitude. In general, capacity is
    still fragile in Jamaica however.


    5. National Community Development Project -
    Description
    5.1    At the request of the government and in response to the strong negative developments
    in 2001, the Bank approved the US$29.7 million National Community Development Project
    (NCDP). The US$15 million loan complemented the Bank's US$75 million Emergency
    Economic Rehabilitation Loan (EERL). The NCDP was approved on May 30,2002 and
    became effective April 8,2003. After one extension the NCDP closed on June 30,2008.

    Objectives and Design
    OBJECTIVES

5.2     The development objective of the NCDP was to "a)provide basic services and
temporary employment opportunities to low-income communities in Jamaica; and b) promote
greater social and community development in Jamaica, especially among the poor" (World
                In . ~ ~
Bank ~ O O ~ C )this sense, the project had a basic services/employment generation
objective as well as a social development objective.

DESIGN
5.3     Table 8 describes the project components and lists the key indicators mapped to each
of the component^.^^ The NCDP was designed as a follow-on to previous Bank support to
JSIF. Overall design was not altered during implementation but in response to the devastation
~                              ~   ~~~




40The PAD phrases the development objective as "a) help communities in the most affected areas by providing
basic services and temporary employment opportunities, and b) assist the Government of Jamaica in its current
effort to promote greater social and community development, especially for the poor." The "most affected
areas" were areas of the country most affected by the effects of violence and lingering post 9/11 impact on
tourism flows. For evaluation purposes, the wording of the objective in the PAD and in the loan agreement are
consistent.
41Annex Table B2 lays out the f i l l set of outcome and output indicators of achievement as well as the
institutional reforms and strengthening to be undertaken during the project (including targets and baselines
when available).

caused by Hurricane Ivan in 2004, a reprioritization of funds occurred to finance the
rebuilding of 100 damaged schools.

5.4      To address the weaknesses of JSIF's operations (listed in the first chapter) and to
improve on outcomes generated by the previous Bank project the NCDP sought to take a
stronger social focus and improve on maintenance and operations of completed assets.42On
paper, JSIF maintained its temporary "project-like" status as an implementer of donor
projects in areas where line ministries were not able to deliver. But with the planned
institutional changes JSIF started to shift from a pure emergency response system to a more
permanent mechanism for providing social infrastructure based on multi-year predictable
investments. The NCDP delineated the following components, indicators and objectives as
shown in Table 8.

5.5      Types of subprojects: The project was to finance three types of subprojects: a) basic
infrastructure; b) social facilities; and c) social services. Basic infrastructure included water
and sanitation distribution, storage and connections; street, road, path, walkway and bridge
bottlenecks; and minor drainage systems. Social facilities included a range of structures that
are used to provide services in the communities such as health clinics, day-care centers,
community centers, homes for children, elderly and disabled, training facilities, public
sanitary facilities, and parks and recreation amenities. The types of works carried out were
generally repairs, renovation, expansion, or installation of small and basic infrastructure
works necessary for improving service quality. Social service subprojects concerned
initiatives for job placement and guidance, conflict resolution and drug-abuse counseling,
parenting and family education, skills training and assistance for disabled groups.

5.6     Depoliticized and targeted to poor communities: The NCDP aimed at improving the
targeting and project selection cycle from the earlier JSIF procedures and providing more
flexibility and transparency to the system. Previously, JSIF had favored relatively high cost
projects and communities that could financially contribute the stipulated five percent of
costs. NCDP used a weighting system whereby smaller subprojects would receive higher
weights and rankings. Also, more weight would be placed on projects with low-skilled labor
needs and projects favoring strong community participation. Eligible communities were
located in quartile 4 areas (the lowest income quartile) of the national poverty map or were
communities in other quartile areas but with Poverty Index scores below a certain cut-off.
JSIF and SDC jointly developed the Poverty Index based on socio-economic characteristics
of the community. Accounting for community needs by using a poverty map and a weighting
system was intended to remove some of the political sensitivities that are deep rooted in
Jamaica.




42 The EU also provided funding for institutional analysis and assessment of JSIF operations as well as the
performance and suitability of the MIS. The lessons from these studies fed into project design.

5.7     Labor-intensive works;Although there was no direct mandate for NCDP subprojects
to generate employment, using labor intensive methods and hiring local workers was
encouraged by JSIF and viewed as necessary for community ownership and sustained facility
use and care. NCDP therefore had as one of its objectives to create temporary employment
opportunities and earnings in an effort to help bring incomes to the communities and expose
the local population to construction work.

5.8      Demand driven: The NCDP sought to empower communities to identify and
prioritize needs and investments; build skills to manage investment resources; and strengthen
the collective community for dialogue and consensus building. Communities were asked to
                                              30


contribute at least 5 percent of subproject costs. JSIF would work with local communities
through SDC, Community Based Organizations (CBOs), and social workers. Community
Based Contracting (CBC) was a new procurement option for increasing community
participation in project implementation, and maintenance and operation, and to boost the
sustainability of development outcomes.

5.9     Strengthening of operation and maintenance: JSIF operated with a mandate to
transfer the assets produced to line ministries upon completion. The ministries were
responsible for maintenance of the assets and for monitoring their use, although communities
were also provided training on maintenance and operations. The evaluation of previous JSIF
projects showed that operations and maintenance of completed assets was weak. The NCDP
sought to train communities in operations and maintenance, with the help of SDC, and build
community interest and capacity in maintaining the infrastructure once completed.

           ARRANGEMENTS
IMPLEMENTATION

5.10 The Bank team was tasked to create a fast-track approach without forming any new
implementing agency. JSIF was chosen as the vehicle for implementing the project based on
their strong track record. Funds were channeled to JSIF via the Ministry of Finance.
Communities, in turn, applied to JSIF for funding of subprojects. To prevent future build up
of a backlog of subproject applications and to reduce the dependency and permanence of
JSIF, the government was to streamline the roles and responsibilities of JSIF and all other
actors (such as ministries, and parish and local authorities).

5.1 1 Risks andfiscal constraints: The main project risks at effectiveness were: the lack of
formal arrangements with contractors for using labor-intensive methods; the lack of
agreement on the roles and responsibilities of SDC in generating, implementing, and
maintaining subprojects; and concerns over the necessary cooperation between JSIF and line
ministries. Moreover, despite strong government commitment to JSIF and to protection and
promotion of poor communities, macro-fiscal constraints left no room for cost overruns.

Implementation
5.12 Project implementation began in 2003 and continued for just over five years. In
parallel to starting the subcontract process for traditional JSIF funded projects, updates were
made to the operations manual. The new criteria for project selection were applied to the
JSIF backlog of projects using the newly developed weights and the existing PIOJ poverty
map. School updating and expansion were the most commonly requested type of subprojects.

5.13 Hurricane Ivan response; When Hurricane Ivan devastated areas of the island in the
fall of 2004 implementation suffered delays. Although the project was not restructured,
efforts were made in NCDP to rebuild 100 schools in affected areas as identified by the
Ministry of Education. Other subprojects in the pipeline were put on hold and had to wait for
approval. The appraisal process was slow and the pipeline of projects remained long. To ease
implementation in the damaged communities, counterpart contributions were waived and
approval, procurement, and contracting mechanisms were expedited. At completion, 95
subprojects (34 percent of the total) were Hurricane Ivan school rehabilitation projects,
which tended to be of smaller scale and lower costs than other subprojects.
                                                       31


5.14 Community-based contracting delays and difJiculties: CBC subprojects took some
time to get started due to lengthy discussions with SDC. Eventually JSIF and SDC reached
an agreement, the CBC pilot took place (funded by the European Union), and communities
were provided training on the CBC processes involved. In total, 58 CBC proposals for
funding were delivered through SDC but most were rejected based on poor quality and lack
of adherence to the agreed criteria on sustainability and poverty focus. Also, many SDC
projects were disqualified since they did not secure appropriate land acquisition. The
arrangement between JSIF and SDC remained difficult throughout the project as the
objectives of the two organizations were not fully consistent.

5.15 Procurement delays: In 2007, a nation-wide cement shortage and preparations for the
Cricket World Cup slowed construction. In reviewing the procurement procedures it was also
noticed that the same contactor kept winning contracts time and time again. The auditor
general was involved in investigating the case but as sanctions against civil servants in
Jamaica is a complicated and long process legal actions were never taken.

COSTS, DISBURSEMENT FIDUCIARY
                 AND        MANAGEMENT

5.16 Total project costs were appraised at US$29.65 million in the PAD (Table 9). Actual
technical assistance and administration costs were much lower than estimated due to cost-
sharing between to a larger number of JSIF funders. Hence, around US$6million of NCDP
funds were available for subprojects. In response to Hurricane Ivan, the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) provided US$5 million in co-financing to
compensate for the loss of counterpart funding. At closing, community contributions
averaged 12 percent43totaling US$2.95 million, three times higher than expected.

5.17 CBC sub-contracting: In order for community organizations to handle contracting
they needed to be registered as legal entities (Benevolent Societies). Once registered, JSIF
signed a finance agreement with the community. CBC contracts had to be less than
us$100,000.

Environmental Management Framework to comply with Government of Jamaica laws. In
2004, JSIF was certified through IS0 14001-the highest international environmental standard.

Monitoring & Evaluation
5.19 Rigorous monitoring and evaluation procedures were not used in the project. One
summative evaluation was undertaken assessing project outputs and some outcomes.
Therefore, M&E quality is rated modest.

M&E DESIGN

5.20 At the start of the project JSIF did not have an internal monitoring and evaluation
unit. Building on the results of the end-of-project assessment from the earlier phase,
indicators on the achievement of the two project objectives were established. But most of the
project indicators were output oriented and did not measure whether the infrastructure was
used for its intended purposes (for example if school expansions led to increased enrollment)
or led to development outcomes.44Furthermore, few baselines and targets were established.
The JSIF MIS would be used to monitor progress on the basic services objective, but the MIS
was not designed to collect and report on performance indicators linked to project objectives.
For instance, there was no baseline or target available for creating temporary employment
even though it was an explicit objective of the project. Periodic evaluation surveys would
monitor progress on the NCDP social objective (World Bank 2002b). A summative
                                                                               ~a
evaluation including a) a process evaluation; b) an impact e ~ a l u a t i o n c)~ ;qualitative
beneficiary assessment; and d) an assessment of infrastructure engineering quality, was to
assess achievement of both of the objectives. The design of the project monitoring and
evaluation was modest.

M&E IMPLEMENTATION

5.21 The JSIF MIS served as the subproject record book and its reports were standardized
across all JSIF projects. But Bank supervision missions noted that the MIS provided
unreliable reports. In 2006 the MIS system was replaced with a more modern system-the
Fund Manager. To compensate for the weaknesses of the MIS, JSIF project managers
collected data manually, based on subproject documentation, and kept track of cost and
completion data in an Excel spreadsheet. Data on the number of employment opportunities or
man-hours created by the project was not systematically collected or monitored.

5.22 The impact evaluation assessed NCDP subprojects in 20 communities using stratified
random sampling. Because of the severe delays in contracting the impact evaluation, there
was no time to establish a baseline in the selected communities. Eight neighboring
communities that had benefited from other projects served as a control group. The choice of
comparison communities did not control for self selection of particularly eager and able
communities into the project and, therefore, the impact evaluation cannot be considered
particularly rigorous.

5.23 Moreover, the summative evaluation did not address all of the social development
indicators. The process evaluation and the engineering evaluation components both suffered
from very small sample sizes.46Much of the performance monitoring was carried out by the
Bank by systematically undertaking site visits and documenting subproject outputs, use and
community organization. During the January 2006 mission, 48 site visits were undertaken.
Overall the Bank team visited 40 percent of all sites. JSIF did not conduct follow-up
assessments of subprojects after completion as required in the operations manual and in the
PAD. Implementation of monitoring and evaluation was modest.

M&E UTILIZATION
5.24 Because of the poor MIS reports and late availability of any evaluation data, the
results of the evaluation were not utilized for making changes or improvements to the NCDP.
However, the report now exists electronically and higher level JSIF staff is familiar with its
findings. Nevertheless, the MIS reports tracked the outputs necessary for taking action in
instances where implementation lagged behind schedule. Utilization of monitoring and
evaluation was modest.47


6. National Community Development Project -
Achievement of objectives.
6.1     Assessing whether the project has achieved its two development objectives amounts
to assessing whether the project was well targeted, to what extent it increased access and
quality of basic services, whether it helped generate employment and to what extent it
promoted social and community development among the poor4*.Statistics in this section are
mainly drawn from JSIF data and from the summative evaluation. Information gathered from
the infrastructure assessment and IEG site visits is also used. Annex Table B2 lists the
achievement of project outcomes, outputs and institutional strengthening indicators.

Objective 1. Providing basic services and temporary employment
opportunities to low-income communities in Jamaica. Rating: Substantial
6.2     The NCDP project was generally well targeted to low-income areas and communities
affected by Hurricane Ivan. At completion, 276 subprojects were completes of which 59
percent were in quartile 4 areas (Table lo), well above the general guidelines of 40 percent

46Only four subprojects were studied in the process evaluation components and seven subprojects were visited
for quality of infrastructure engineering assessments.
47
   However, lessons learned from the evaluation have helped the design of the current Bank supported Inner
Cities Basic Services Project (ICBSP) and the Rural Economic Development Infrastructure project (REDI). For
instance, the continuous challenges with maintenance and the experience with CBC have led to a more broad,
active and sustained JSIF involvement in selected communities. At the time of the IEG mission visit, 15 months
after project closing, JSIF was providing NCDP communities with maintenance training and disaster
management training as a component under the Bank's Hurricane Dean Emergency Recovery and Disaster
Management Loan.
48 The project aimed at increasing community ownership and participation in development projects and to build
the interest and capacity in communities for maintaining the infrastructure creating.

and better than the earlier project ( 37 percent). This is despite the fact that 34 percent of
subprojects were Hurricane Ivan reconstruction projects which to a large extent also included
non-poor areas. All in all, IEG estimates that the project reached 144,00049residents in poor
communities (no baseline or target available).

6.3     The assets produced were constructed to good quality and were being used for their
intendedpur oses. At closing, 27650subprojects were financed, with an average cost of
US$86,000. J:Annex Table C4 lists the type of infrastructure created. The infrastructure
evaluation showed that all seven projects inspected had high construction quality compared
to six assets in neighboring control communities but showed no difference in quality of
construction between contracting type (CBC or t r a d i t i ~ n a l )NCDP projects compared
                                                                     .~~
favorably in construction quality to controls projects. Of the 48 sites visited during the
January 2006 Bank mission, 97 percent were being used as intended.53

6.4    NCDP increased access to and quality of basic services in Jamaica. The number of
children attending school in the beneficiary communities increased but not more than in

some subprojects.
50The number presented on completed subprojects is slightly lower than what was presented in the ICR and

reach the implementation stage.

52
  It should be noted that the number of projects inspected by the infrastructure evaluation in each construction
category was too small for drawing any generalizations. It is not clear whether statistical tests for the difference
between treatment and control groups was undertaken in the impact evaluation.
53 All (four) of the schools visited by IEG were used. Classrooms, kitchens and toilets facilities constructed by
NCDP were also in use. The fifth site visited by IEG was a sports complex and regular usage was difficult to
verify. The CBO representative explained that the grass field was being used for football tournaments between
communities.
54IEG site visits confirmed that there was increased access to schooling in two basic schools and one special
needs school visited. In the fourth school visited classroom capacity increased as a result of the project but the
number of students in the school has since dwindled due to community hardship and migration.

newhehabilitated schools visited (only 5 sites) had more room and better suited buildings
than what was previously described to exist. School principals also expressed satisfaction
with improvements in environmental cleanliness and security around the schools. To some
extent learning outcomes may also have improved but evidence is very weak. Sixty percent
of focus group survey respondents of NCDP schools compared to 48 percent in control
communities noted improvements in learning outcomes.

6.5     The impact evaluation also showed an increased availability of health care facilities
since the project and also a small increase in the use of health facilities, especially among
women and pregnant women. Of the total, 75 percent of respondents in NCDP communities
and 65 percent in control communities noted that availability of health centers had increased
after the new infrastructure improvements. There is no information available to assess
whether health status has improved in NCDP communities as a result of the project.

6.6     Road projects had, according to the impact evaluation, the greatest impact compared
to control communities. Ninety-eight percent of respondents were satisfied with the road
quality compared to 19 percent in comparison communities. In particular, they found road
safety to be higher, travel time reduced, and economic activity increased as a result of the
NCDP subproject. Based on respondent perception, there was no indication that transport
costs had been reduced. Ninety-three percent of NCDP respondents compared to thirty
percent in the control group thought that the improved roads had increased their quality of
life.

6.7     But there are concerns about the upkeep of basic services mainly due to the lack of
maintenance training. Maintenance training undertaken in cooperation with SDC was not
undertaken as extensively as planned. This was confirmed by the beneficiary assessment and
by JSIF staff. Only 3 1 communities of the 276 have prepared and implemented community
maintenance plans (the target was 100 percent). During Bank team visits, only 27 percent of
sites had ongoing maintenance activities. However, at the time of the IEG mission JSIF
maintenance training in communities was ongoing as a component of the Hurricane Dean
Emergency Rehabilitation Loan.

6.8     Although the 48 site visits conducted by the Bank team did not observe any major
maintenance issues, the technical consultants that undertook the infrastructure evaluation
concluded that maintenance was a serious issue in the majority of the seven sites inspected.
Engineers found signs of deterioration of the infrastructure as a result o f a lack of
maintenance. However, compared to control communities in the evaluation, actual
maintenance of NCDP sites appeared favorable. Seventy-two percent of NCDP beneficiaries
state that infrastructure and equipment is being maintained by communities compared to only
42 percent in control communities. This was confirmed by the engineer visits. Community
interest in maintenance is also higher in NCDP communities (86 percent compared to 60
percent in controls). IEG visits observed clean and functioning schools (although one school
was very over crowded). School kitchens, classrooms, facilities, and yards were clean and
appeared safe. In sum, evidence on the upkeep of the infrastructure is mixed. The mixed
evidence indicates that the project was not fully successful in strengthening its maintenance
activities.

6.9   Some temporary employment was generated. According to the Bank's
Implementation Completion Report (ICR) 15,420 person months of unskilled temporary
                                                     36


employment was generated in the subprojects. The borrower's ICR reports that 3,855
temporary employment opportunities were created. Neither the summative evaluation nor
IEG could verify the number of temporary jobs nor the number of man-hours created. Data
were not available in any JSIF records reviewed by IEG. Although this was part of the
development objective of the project and an important aspect for assisting poor communities,
the lack of baselines, targets and reliable data makes it difficult to determine whether the
project substantially achieved its objective of creating temporary employment. The failure of
the project to establish formal arrangements with contractors for using labor intensive
methods may have hampered employment creation.55

6.10 Employment opportunities were a common motivation for communities to engage
with JSIF. The temporary jobs and incremental income brought to communities were often                          .
seen as the main benefit of subprojects. In the beneficiary assessment 52 percent of NCDP
respondents thought that temporary jobs had been created in the community, although there
was no significant difference compared to control communities. JSIF and SDC staff, as well
as community members, explained to IEG that laborers were paid less than the standard pay
rate for the job. The difference between the minimum wage and the actual wage earned by
the worker in the community was viewed as community in kind contribution to the project.
This helped reduce project costs and the extra income was appreciated by workers. However,
the cost sharing approach limited the income generation opportunities of subprojects. This
tradeoff (reducing project costs vs. providing income earnings) is a common feature of social
investment fund projects.

6.1 1 On balance, objective 1 of the NCDP is rated substantial. Well targeted and good
quality basic services were created. The assets increased access of the poor communities to
services. Although the rigor of the impact evaluation was lacking, the evidence suggests that
the services produced by NCDP may have been of higher quality than services produced by
other agencies. This substantial achievement was not without weaknesses, however.
Maintenance of the services is rather limited, mainly due to the lack of maintenance training.
Some temporary employment opportunities were created although it is not known exactly
how many.

Objective 2. Promote greater social and community development in
Jamaica, especially among the poor. Rating: Modest
6.12 Community Based Contracting (CBC) was used to a larger extent than anticipated.
The NCDP as well as the Poverty Reduction Project (funded by the European Union)
provided JSIF with its first experience with CBC. The use of community contracting was
supposed to encourage more community ownership, and better ensure that assets are used
after completion. In total, only 52 communities were trained on the use of CBC but 61 (22
percent) of subprojects under NCDP used community contracting (Table 11). Around US$4

55
  Only in some instances did subprojects lead to longer term employment. An important labor market issue in
Jamaica is the difficulty, experienced by workers, in obtaining the necessary certification required for full
employment. In a few cases NCDP workers benefitted from training related to the job which helped them obtain
their certification. On the national level the employment created by the project was insignificant, however,
highly valued by individual community members.

million of project finds (27 percent) were used for community contracting, higher than the
targeted 20 percent despite the hurricane response restructuring. CBC remains a type of
contracting used in JSIF.

6.13 Despite the use of community contracting, the wide community participation
envisaged in the project partly failed due to the breakdown in the JSIF-SDC relationship.
According to JSIF's manual one criteria used for selection is that the project should be
ranked either as first or second priority by the community. The aim of the cooperation with
SDC was to increase the number of projects financed by JSIF after being identified in
Community Development Plans (CDPs). This objective was not achieved. Although SDC
delivered 173 CDPs, only 15 subprojects were generated in this manner.

6.14 There was limited community participation i n decision making regarding subproject
identification and design but more broad basedparticipation in construction. An earlier
evaluation in another JSIF project showed that JSIF subprojects were not necessarily those
that were preferred by the majority of the population (Rao and Ibafiez 2003). Instead the
decision on what subproject the community would take on was driven by a small group of
networked community members. In NCDP the degree of participation of the larger
community was, in the majority of cases, limited to providing labor during construction
(Oxford Policy Management 2008). It was felt that the most capable and networked members
and the members most closely linked to the asset (for instance a parent-teacher group in the
case of schools) took the initiative on requesting JSIF finding. In the beneficiary assessment,
65 percent of respondents in NCDP communities with CBC school projects indicated that
they were not informed about the project. Another 18 percent were told about the project but
were not asked about their views. Only in roads projects did community members indicate
that the community's views influenced the project (Oxford Policy Management 2008).
Overall, 64 percent of respondents both in NCDP and control projects felt that they had either
not been informed or informed but not consulted on the project. Hence, to an extent, the elite
capture noticed in earlier JSIF operations remained under NCDP. Although there was limited
community participation phase of subprojects, there was more participation in construction
(Oxford Policy Management 2008). In NCDP communities 73 percent of survey respondents
thought that poor people were the main beneficiaries of the asset compared to 44 percent in
control communities.

6.15 However, communities were strengthened and became able to manage new projects
outside of NCDP and generate complementary funding. According to JSIF social
development staff the necessary condition that Community Based Organizations (CBOs)
needed to register as Benevolent Societies in order to be awarded community contracts
helped communities take their own initiatives. Although only 33 Benevolent Societies were
                                                              38


created, this process empowered groups by giving them greater responsibility and
accountability. Even though no data were presented to IEG, JSIF noted that because of the
use of local labor, some communities were also able to save funds that could be applied to
other efforts. In order to finance maintenance work or afford necessary supplies and
materials, active community groups organized fund raising events. As a result, community
financial contributions exceeded expectations and reached 12 percent on average in all of
NCDP and 19 percent for community contracted projects.
6.16 All in all, the project had some positive impacts on the social development of the poor
in beneficiary communities but not to the extent the project had hoped for. Several of the
social outcome indicators in Annex Table B2 were achieved. However, their achievement is
not considered adequate evidence of the achievement of the social objective. The social
objective was difficult to meet as the concept of common goods and shared responsibilities is
not well rooted in Jamaican communities. In sum, notwithstanding the extensive use of
community contracting and the significant contribution of community funds, there is still
only limited evidence of participation and social development in terms of joint decision
making and development planning in communities. Therefore the achievement of this
objective is rated modest.


7. National Community Development Project - Ratings
Outcome
7.1     Based on the substantial relevance and efficiency and modest efficacy the overall
project outcome rating is moderately satisfactory (Table 12).
7.2     Relevance is rated substantial because of the substantial relevance of objectives and
modest relevance of design. Overall, the project objectives were consistent with country and
Bank strategies and the design approach was adequate for achieving the first project
objective. Using JSIF as the implementation vehicle was an appropriate design choice for
reaching the objectives. But shortcomings involved insufficient focus on productive use and
maintenance of assets and weak implementation arrangements such as for ensuring labor
intensive works and employment creation as well as the partnership with SDC for enhancing
social development.

7.3     Relevance of objectives. The NCDP's objective spoke to the country's priority (part
of the 1997 development agenda) of protecting the poor and ensuring inclusion and was
aligned with the Medium-Term Economic and Social Policy Framework 2004-07. The
framework emphasized increasing access to social and economic opportunities for the poor
and enhanced social harmony. The social sector strategy prioritized upgrading the social
infrastructure and stimulating productive growth in poor areas affected by the 2001 crisis.
Moreover, the underlying National Poverty Eradication Program (1997) emphasized using
community-based interventions undertaken in partnership with NGOs and the private sector
(World Bank 2002b). The objectives of the NCDP were consistent with parts of the
government strategy, mainly in terms of upgrading social infrastructure in underserved areas
and encouraging better community cohesion. But in order to contribute to economic growth
and mitigate the effects of the slow-down in the tourism industry and other sectors in decline
the project would have needed a stronger income and employment generation objective
beyond the temporary employment created during infrastructure construction. Although the
project did not disqualify economic infrastructure from its list of eligible subproject types,
the demand-driven nature of the project (as well as the Ivan restructuring) was more tailored
to social infrastructure such as schools and health centers.

7.4     The NCDP's objectives were consistent with the Bank's strategy. Although not
planned under the 2000 CAS, the NCDP came about together with the EERL (approved in
December 2001) which was meant to provide budget support during the crisis so as to protect
social spending and funds to restore public infrastructure. The NCDP was the corresponding
micro response to rehabilitate and upgrade the long neglected social services infrastructure,
especially in poor areas, and help alleviate tensions in communities and to protect tourism
incomes. In the next CAS (2005, period 2006-09) the Bank's focus was set on accelerating
inclusive economic growth; improving human development; and preventing and reducing
crime. Provision of basic services for the poor through participatory processes remained a
priority. Employment creation and skills updating became a priority in Jamaica in the most
current CAS.

7.5     Based on the alignment with the government's priority and Bank's emphasis on
upgrading public infrastructure and reducing crime, the relevance of the project objectives is
rated substantial. Relevance of objectives could have been higher if the project had also
aimed at creating incomes and sustainable employment opportunities in poor communities
affected by the economic downturn.

7.6     Relevance of design. The approach of using JSIF as the implementation vehicle was
warranted based on JSIFs solid capacity and support from both political camps. JSIF had
proven to be an effective agency through which rural development goals and community-
driven social infrastructure updates could be undertaken. JSIF had the capacity and mandate
to deliver social infrastructure to underserved communities. Also, the demand-driven nature
of JSIF was highly consistent with the focus on building greater community cohesion for
reducing conflict and political tension.

7.7    However, the temporary set up of social investment funds, such as JSIF, is infamous
for weak attention to sustainability of the services created and for placing high priority on
building infrastructure rather than on longer term productive use of assets (Rawlings et al.
2003). Moreover, continuously channeling donor resources through a semi-autonomous
implementation unit such as a social investment fund does not help build the internal capacity
                                               40


of the government's service delivering agencies whose role it is to provide public
infrastructure in the first place.

7.8      The project's technical design was conducive to meeting the development objective
albeit not without weaknesses. The attention on strengthening sustainability of asset creation
was reflected in the increased resources that the project provided for maintenance activities
and the close collaboration with communities using community contracting and development
planning for nurturing ownership and participation. Moreover, the design of the project
proved flexible to respond to emergency needs caused by the hurricane in 2004. In a country
that is prone to natural disasters, fitting this flexibility under the project objectives was
appropriate. Finally, the demand-driven nature of the project selection was appropriate
considering the political polarization in Jamaica which is pervasive down to the community
and even street level. Evaluating applications based on the predetermined poverty map and
Poverty Index removed any political conflicts over the selection of target areas.

7.9     On the other hand, the envisioned partnership with SDC was not thoroughly based on
mutual agreement and common goals. The subsequent breakdown in the partnership was a
direct result of incomplete agreements at the design stage. The social outcomes of the project
were therefore not fully achieved. Moreover, the new procurement option under CBC catered
mainly to communities that already had the capacity and will to undertake participatory
projects and did not always allocate resources in the areas with the greatest needs. Finally,
given the objective of creating temporary employment in poor communities, the project did
not put in place mechanisms for ensuring labor intensive contracting and the number of jobs
created and the income they generated should have been closely monitored.

7.10 The results framework was mediocre. Indicators for monitoring the achievement of
the two project objectives were established but lacked baselines and adequate targets and did
not include adequate indicators for intermediate outcomes.

7.1 1 Based on the appropriate choice of using JSIF as the implementer but weaknesses in
the design for ensuring job creation, sustainable use of outputs, a working partnership with
SDC, as well as the mediocre M&E arrangements, relevance of design is rated modest.

EFFICACY
7.12 Efficacy is rated modest on balance. The first development objective was
substantially achieved, however not without weaknesses. The second objective was modestly
achieved. Around half of the outcomes, outputs and institutional objectives were considered
achieved although indicators were vague and without baselines and targets. Although the first
objective was considered the main objective of the project and rated as substantial, the
modest overall efficacy rating is justified due to the fact that the project did not fully achieve
two of the main parts of its development objective-creating temporary employment and
promoting greater social and community development.

7.13 Under NCDP, JSIF's focus on serving poor and underserved groups of the population
and financing small-scale projects was strengthened. Greater community financing was also
achieved. More than 90 percent of respondents to the beneficiary survey stated that they were
satisfied with the subprojects and the majority indicated that their community was as better
place to live after the project. But the project suffered some significant shortcomings
                                                     41


including poor maintenance arrangements, lack of attention to the objective of creating
employment, and lower than anticipated community participation and social outcomes.

7.14 While the counterfactual evidence is not rigorous, Jamaica's experience as described
above suggests that strengthening basic social services through JSIF likely generated better
outcomes in the short run than implementing a similar project through the ministries.
Moreover, the large scale basic service provision which targeted underserved communities
could likely not have been undertaken without support from an external development partner.

EFFICIENCY

7.15 Efficiency is rated substantial. Both administrative and operational costs of
subprojects were contained, execution speed was partially improved, and output quality and
use were adequate. Social investment funds are widely credited for being able to deliver
services more efficiently than government ministries. In Jamaica, JSIF filled the gap in
providing social infrastructure to those communities that the government was not able to
reach.

7.16 Administrative costs and costs for institutional strengthening of the project were
relatively low (18 percent) and close to international norms for social investment fund
overheads (Oxford Policy Management 2008; IDB 1998; Rawlings et al. 2003). Even though
the introduction of community contracting raised workloads for JSIF staff, overhead and
technical assistance costs at 18 percent were much lower than predicted in the PAD (38
percent). The fixed costs could be spread over a large pool of funders supporting similar
projects so that a larger share of NCDP funds were devoted to subprojects.

7.17 The process evaluation claims that subproject construction costs were below the
market rate in Jamaica and, even though cost over-runs were common, they were low
compared to industry standards in Jamaica (Oxford Policy Management 2008).56Community
cost-sharing (12 percent) was a large contributor to the containment of subproject costs. On
the other hand, as the project aimed at creating employment opportunities there were
tradeoffs between community contributions (in terms of providing free labor) and generating
income opportunities for community members. Also, some communities involved in
community contracting stated that with community control of the contracting they could take
advantage of local discounts on goods, and achieve better value for money.

7.18 Compared to the speed of execution of other social investment funds in the Latin
America and Caribbean Region the NCDP implementation time-lines were similar (source:
Rawlings et al. 2003). On average, the approval phase was 39 weeks, close to the target of 37
weeks and much faster than in the earlier Bank-supported JSIF project (Table 13). Ivan
projects were much faster in the approval phase (around 2-6 weeks) compared to traditional
projects (67 weeks). Similarly, implementation of Ivan projects was quick (around 34 weeks)
while traditional projects went on for 124 weeks on average. Compared to the earlier Bank
project NCDP improved in the preparation phase but was slower in implementation. External
events such as hurricanes and the 2006 cement shortage affected completion times.



56   What defines industry standards is not clear.

  75 maximum as per the Operations Manual.

Risk to Development Outcome
7.19 The risk to development outcome of the NCDP is rated moderate. As evidenced by
many other social investment funds (Rawlings et al. 2003) sustainability of outcomes was a
weak area of the project.

7.20 With regards to outcomes at the community level, risks are moderate. The main risks
to development outcomes are the uncertainty about continued use and maintenance of the
infrastructure created. Because of JSIF's mandate to transfer resources back to the line
ministries after completion attention to sustained outcomes, albeit,being heightened in this
project, is relatively weak. Line ministries are constantly plagued by insufficient resources
and lack capacity to tend to the disadvantaged communities. No community self assessment
or organized ex-post periodic JSIF site visits have been undertaken to ensure that resources
are used and maintained as planned. The agreed cooperation with SDC on maintenance
training and to serve as a watch dog in communities has not materialized.

7.21 On the contrary, at the time of evaluation, maintenance is being strengthened. JSIF is
currently undertaking operations and maintenance training in NCDP communities under the
Hurricane Dean Emergency Rehabilitation Loan. Also, the schools that were rehabilitated
after Hurricane Ivan were constructed in a manner more resistant to natural disasters boding
well for the sustainability of resources in high risk communities.

7.22 With the deepening of the economic crisis and more and more communities losing
employment and income in Jamaica there is a risk that the utilization.of project-created assets
in poor areas will dwindle.

7.23 At the institutional level risks are low. JSIF continues to operate efficiently. JSIF
operations have been strengthened especially in terms of CBC as an option for subproject
implementation. Government and donor support to JSIF remains strong. However, JSIF is
highly dependent on donor financing. A stronger national. strategy for building the capacity
and leveraging internal resources for social infrastructure seems warranted.

Bank Performance
7.24 On the whole, Bank performance is rated moderately satisfactory. This is based on
some significant weaknesses in quality at entry but satisfactory supervision.
                                              43


QUALITY ENTRY
      AT

7.25 Quality at Entry was moderately satisfactory. The Bank already had a strong
relationship with JSIF based on previous engagement. The design of NCDP was based on
lessons from the earlier phase and strongly consistent with government priorities. The Bank
is widely credited by the government and JSIF for bringing innovative ideas to the project
and for its strong technical assistance. The Bank brought experience with community
contracting from other countries to JSIF, organized a workshop on the subject, and conducted
two study tours for JSIF staff to Malawi, Romania and Moldova to learn about community-
based contracting.

7.26 However, the project had several significant design deficiencies. The M&E system
did not record project outputs and progress on project objectives against targets and baselines
from the start. The Bank did not provide adequate assistance in establishing and carrying out
sufficient monitoring and evaluation and establishing a comprehensive MIS. Despite being
recognized as a risk, there was no assessment undertaken of the technical capacity and
objectives of SDC for fulfilling its critical role in the project, nor was there a memorandum
of understanding between JSIF and SDC prior to appraisal. The breakdown in the
relationship between the two organizations directly contributed to the less than sufficient
achievement of the social development objective. Also, the transfer of operation and
maintenance of assets to line ministries was not explicitly arranged including scheduled
follow-up for verifying sustained outcomes. Finally, the Bank should have paid much more
attention to the safety net objective of the project-to provide temporary employment in poor
communities-given that the project was a response to the economic shocks of 200 1.
Although implemented more or less during the same time frame, there was no explicit
coordinated effort between the SSNP and the NCDP in the way that the Bank strategically
addressed social safety net issues in Jamaica.

QUALITY SUPERVISION
      OF

7.27 Bank supervision was satisfactory. The project had three task team leaders although
one was in place during most of the implementation phase. To compensate for the lack in
JSIF's monitoring and evaluation procedures the visiting missions conducted a large share of
site visits and collected data on project quality and use and community social development.
Bank supervision, which included several technical experts; was especially strong in
procurement and financial management as testified in aides-memoire and by JSIF staff. The
regular supervision visits also involved discussions with many other stakeholders and key
informants such as community organizations, NGOs, SDC, Ministry of Finance and the
National Contracts Commission. The Bank also provided flexible and quick support to the
project to meet the new needs in the wake of Hurricane Ivan although assistance from the
Bank on MIS strengthening and training on CBC was lacking.

7.28 Weaknesses in Bank supervision were minor and included a somewhat excessive
focus on disbursements and outputs and relatively little attention to intermediate and
sustainable outcomes. Moreover, the Bank team could have pushed to establish better
baselines and outcome targets at an early stage of the project to ensure a more rigorous and
timely evaluation. In the end, the project performance assessment relied heavily on the
summative evaluation which was of questionable quality and did not, to a large extent, assess
the social development or employment creation objective.

Borrower Performance
7.29 Borrower performance is rated satisfactory overall. Both government and
implementing agency performance were satisfactory.

PERFORMANCE OF THE GOVERNMENT

7.30 Overall, government performance is rated satisfactory. Despite the tight fiscal stance,
government support to JSIF and to NCDP was strong and remains strong after the change of
government in 2007. When counterpart funds were not available following Hurricane Ivan in
2004, sufficient financing was arranged via OPEC so as to limit implementation abruptions
to respond in the disaster areas. On the other hand, both JSIF and SDC expressed to IEG that
the consultation process at the planning stages of the project (before project objectives were
delegated to JSIF) could have involved more stakeholders. It was suggested that insufficient
consultation at the early preparation phase may have contributed to the difficulties in the
cooperation between JSIF and SDC.

PERFORMANCE OF THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCY

7.3 1 Implementing agency performance was satisfactory. Much of the success of the
NCDP can be credited to the strong performance of JSIF. JSIF still operating as a temporary
agency and consistently and diligently follows national procurement and contracting
requirements. It has set up transparent processes for selecting communities and subprojects
and rewarding contracts. Staff turnover has plagued JSIF mainly due to their good
performance. Internal monitoring and evaluation arrangements such as performance
monitoring in the MIS and more regular follow-up site visits including assessments of
intermediate outcomes should have been arranged to feed into periodic evaluations.

7.32 With the introduction of community contracting, staff workload increased but
commitment to carry out the project objectives remained strong. The experiences with CBC
have been a learning-by-doing process for JSIF and in-house capacity has grown and is being
used in other projects.


8. Conclusions and Lessons
8.1     This PPAR has reviewed the Jamaica Social Safety Net Project (SSNP) and National
Community Development Project (iVCDP), Both investment projects were classified under
the social safety net theme in the World Bank, although they were not included under a
coordinated effort to support Jamaica's social protection efforts. The SSNP aimed to provide
better and more cost-effective social assistance to the poor. The NCDP complemented a
Bank emergency rehabilitation loan and aimed at; a) providing basic services and temporary
employment in low-income communities; and b) promoting greater social and community
development among the poor.

8.2     Bank lending to Jamaica since 2000 in the area of social protection has focused on
protecting chronically poor individuals as well as poor and disaster-affected communities. At
the household level the most vulnerable families and elderly are assisted by cash transfers
                                               45


and support for school lunches and fees. Tying the support to regular school attendance and
health check-ups has raised the ability of poor families to invest in human capital. Moreover,
at the community level, neglected localities have benefitted from upgrades to the social and
economic infrastructure and a temporary injection of jobs during construction.

8.3     The projects have proven to be flexible in dealing with local emergencies. Both the
SSNP and the NCDP were able to quickly re-channel resources in the wake of Hurricane
Ivan. On the other hand, social assistance in Jamaica needs to pay more attention to
productive activities since poverty is strongly linked with unemployment. In particular, many
young men and women are unequipped for obtaining a job. Those who succeed in the
educational system often find opportunities outside the country. With the economic
downturn, more and more Jamaicans are losing their sources of income. Rural communities
see factories and mines close. Poverty is urbanizing at a fast rate, spurring violence and
crime.

8.4      In the future, social safety net programs in Jamaica could link to labor market
initiatives. Programs such as PATH provide effective protection to those who cannot
participate in the market (for example the elderly and children) but a stronger effort needs to
be made to train and connect youth school drop outs and working age adults to employment
and incomes. An effective safety net system should strive, given the island's dependence on
tourism and foreign income and the regular damage made by force majeure, to respond to
economic and natural shocks at the same as protecting the chronically poor. As 'fiscal room is
minimal, it will be important to put in place a safety net system that can be scaled up in times
of crisis and scaled down in more stable times.

Lessons
       The SSNP demonstrated that conditional cash transfer programs, such as PATH, can
       be useful tools for protecting the poor after localized shocks. PATH was able to
       quickly double benefit levels and waive compliance requirements in communities
       seriously affected by Hurricane Ivan, but only to those already participating in the
       program.
       Monitoring and evaluation in conditional cash transfer programs should pay more
       attention to the objective ofprotecting the chronically poor and vulnerable. Six of the
       eight SSNP performance indicators reflected human development outcomes. No
       indicators measured the extent to which social assistance benefits effectively reached
       the poor.
       Compliance requirements should be set with attention to supply side constraints (in
       health), the level of impact that could be expected on outcomes (in education), and
       any costs incurred in conditioning beneJits. Even though the Ministry of Health
       advised on the number of health visits required per child, the SSNP still failed to fully
       consider the limited capacity of the health system to absorb the demand for health
       care. Similarly, school attendance rates, at least at the primary level, were already
       high in Jamaica and significant impacts from the project due to the education
       conditionality were small. Any impacts on behavioral changes also need to be viewed
       in relation to costs incurred for monitoring compliance rates.

Social Investment Funds, such as JSIF, can be useful for dealing with emergencies
and for experimenting with new approaches. The NCDP proved flexible in
addressing the urgent need caused by Hurricane Ivan and for helping communities
gain experience with community contracting. However, uncertainties about a fund?s
longevity may create ambiguity about responsibilities for continuing activities and
sustaining the benefits.
The delivery of infrastructure through Social Investment Funds needs to be
accompanied by measures that ensure the effective use, operation, and maintenance
ofassets. When using a Social Investment Fund to help provide community chosen
investments quickly, it is also important to explicitly delineate the responsibilities for
operating and maintaining the social infrastructure and to ensure that the capacity for
service provision and infrastructure maintenance is built.

Annex A. Social safety nets and social services in Jamaica
prior to 2000
Prior to the social safety net reform of 2000, the evolution of a social assistance system in
Jamaica reflected ad hoc political priorities without much coordination or long-term
planning. The main part of the pre-reform safety net system was introduced in the 1980s,
when general kerosene subsidies were removed. Kerosene subsidies had been highly
regressive, benefitting gas companies rather than the poor. The social assistance system
consisted of about 20 overlapping, poorly targeted, and uncoordinated programs aimed at the
poor and vulnerable. There were three income support programs, four school-based
programs, two pharmaceutical programs, housing programs, feeding programs, labor market
programs, and various community-based programs including a social investment fund.
Benefits were low and the program provided no productive incentives for the poor to adopt
strategies for escaping poverty, such as by investing in human capital or gaining training and
employment.

INCOME TRANSFER PROGRAMS

Three non-contributory income transfer programs existed in Jamaica prior to the 2000
reform. Together they represented about 0.3 percent of GDP in 1998/99 (Annex Table Al).
The main one, the Food Stamp Program, was put in place in order to protect poor users of
kerosene from increased prices. Food stamps were provided to poor children 0-6 years old,
the elderly, the incapacitated, pregnant and lactating women, and otherwise impoverished
single-person households. In 1998, roughly 10 percent of the population was registered to
receive food stamps. The fiscal cost of the food stamp program in 1998/99 was estimated at
JM$395 million (0.2 percent of GDP or almost two-thirds of the cost of income transfers
overall). Of this, about 75 percent went to food stamps, a small part to kerosene subsidies,
and around 10 percent to administrative expenses (Blank et al. 2000). Benefits were low
(US$2 per month) and not related to income levels. They were considered to have a very
small impact on poverty. The program was self-targeted for children and pregnant and
lactating women, for other groups it was means tested.

The other two income transfer programs-the Outdoor Poor Relief Program and the Economic
and Social Assistance Program-provided benefits to the elderly and disabled. The Outdoor
Poor Relief Program was established under the Poor Relief Act of 1886 and provided in-kind
and cash benefits. It was run by the Ministry of Local Government and Community
Development (MLGCD) through parish councils. Blank et al. (2000) estimate that as much
as 69 percent of the costs of the Outdoor Poor Relief Program went to administration
(includes counseling costs and some administrative costs for Indoor Poor Relief). The
Economic and Social Assistance Program aimed at providing assistance to the elderly poor
and to the disabled poor who are not eligible for private insurance or the National Insurance
Scheme (NIS). By targeting the elderly and incapacitated, the program was thought to
complement the NIS pension system and to enhance the safety net aspect of the pension
system for the poor. The Economic and Social Assistance Program includes two components:
(i) Old Age and Incapacity allowances for the elderly and incapacitated, and (ii) one-off
grants payable in special circumstances to those in need ("rehabilitation grants,"
"compassionate grants" and "emergency relief '). Administrative expenditures for this
program were also high (Blank et al. 2000). Both the Outdoor Poor Relief and the Economic

and Social Assistance programs were means tested although there was no specific threshold
and eligibility was based on home visits by social workers. Frequently interest groups sent
lists of people they wanted to be considered (Kock 2001).

The pre-reform non-contributory social safety net system in Jamaica had a multitude of
issues hampering its effectiveness:

        0   Fragmentedprograms and lack of consolidated eligibility criteria. To receive
            adequate benefits some participants had to take part in multiple programs. Others
            participated in one but not in others for which they may have qualified. For example,
            88 percent of Economic and Social Assistance beneficiaries and 29 percent of Poor
            Relief beneficiaries also received food stamp benefits (Blank et al. 2000; Blank,
            2000). Institutionally the system was also fragmented across various ministries.
        0   Poor coverage and targeting with large errors both of exclusion and inclusion. Some
            programs were not targeted at all while some included non-poor in the group of
            beneficiaries while simultaneously excluding poor who were found non-eligible. For
            instance, of the Food Stamp Program beneficiaries only 36 percent were in the
            poorest quintile.
        0   Low beneJt levels. The benefits provided by many programs were too low to
            adequately protect the poor and vulnerable. Low benefits may also not sufficiently
            encourage desired behavior change such as sending children to school or consuming
            more nutritious foods.
        0   High administrative overheads. The overlap and duplication of safety nets created
            high costs both to program administration and to beneficiaries.

LABOR
    MARKET PROGRAMS

The largest employment generation program was Lift Up Jamaica, a short-term public works
program targeted to youth-at-risk. The program, launched in 1999, operated mainly in
congested urban areas and selected rural towns was funded by several public sector
enterprises, and periodically started and stopped. Projects were proposed by communities and
approved by a selection committee. Communities decided how to distribute available
employment opportunities. Lift Up Jamaica benefited around 5,000 people yearly by creating
temporary employment. At the time of writing, Lift Up Jamaica was no longer active.

A second program, the HEART Trust organization, is Jamaica's official vocational training
program; it prepares youth and adults for employment in the labor market. At the end of the
training program participants receive their skill-specific certificate which qualifies workers
for jobs in the formal sector. However, linking vocational training graduates to employment
has proven to be difficult. Labor market programs in Jamaica continue to be heavily
politicized.

COMMUNITY-BASED PROGRAMS

In addition to Lift Up Jamaica, the country had two other main community-based social
safety net programs. No longer active, the Social and Economic Support Program (SESP)
provided funds to communities for infrastructure projects as well as individual benefits, such
as school materials, housing, and entrepreneurial activity support. The program was
administered through Members of Parliament, and distribution of benefits was fraught with
political interference.

The Jamaica Social Investment Fund (JSIF), which continues to operate today, was
established by the government in the mid-1 990s in preparing the development agenda. It was
set up to undertake small-scale projects and to respond to the needs of the most underserved
groups island-wide (World Bank 2002b). JSIF's operations are largely community-driven.
Communities may apply for funding for projects and JSIF acts as a financial intermediary.
JSIF relies on support from a multitude of donors such as the World Bank, the European
Union and OPEC. JSIF had been successful in reaching the targeted poor communities and
getting them to express their preference for initiatives. The fund has also shown good
performance in improving living conditions in beneficiary communities.

Since its inception several weaknesses have plagued JSIF (World Bank 2002b) and most of
them also apply to the NCDP period:

       JSIF's role is unclear. Initially JSIF was set up as a four-year temporary project, but
       as local government and parishes have not been able to meet regular demand for
       social infrastructure, JSIF has taken on a larger more permanent role in furnishing
       social infrastructure to communities.
       Problems assuring appropriate quality, operations, and maintenance. Completed
       JSIF projects have not met high quality standards in the past. Moreover, there have
       been difficulties in ensuring operations and maintenance of projects after works are
       completed.

Unevenparticipation process. Wealthier and more politically-savvy community
groups have participated more in decision-making and implementation than poor
communities with low capacity.
