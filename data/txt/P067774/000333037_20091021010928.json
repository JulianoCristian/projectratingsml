Jamaica were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was low or\n            negligible, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: ensuring implementation\n            readiness conditions prior to negotiations lead to a more\n            effective and timely physical and financial execution cycle.\n            The delays in physical and financial implementation\n            experienced by this project, especially in the period\n            February 2002 to September 2003, could have been mitigated\n            had the Bank team and management ensured appropriate\n            implementation readiness conditions at the time of\n            appraisal, especially with respect to compliance by the\n            Ministry of Labor and Social Security (MLSS) of the\n            procurement-related observations made prior to appraisal.\n            Continuous and sustained social marketing is a necessary,\n            although not sufficient, tool to make conditional cash\n            transfer schemes such as the Program of Advancement through\n            Health and Education (PATH) effective in attaining the\n            envisaged behavioral changes expected from the beneficiaries\n            and to reach larger segments of the poor. Accordingly,\n            Borrowers interested in implementing conditional cash\n            transfer schemes in their countries need to ensure the\n            financial and technical resources to continuously launch and\n            target intensive social marketing campaigns. Sporadic\n            dissemination campaigns are not effective or efficient. An\n            appropriate logical framework is needed to inform the\n            Borrower and Bank management about progress towards\n            achieving the expected project developmental objectives. The\n            project development objectives (PDOs) could have been\n            expressed in a more appropriate way to reflect the thrust of\n            this operation, which was about improving human capital\n            accumulation through increased school attendance and use of\n            preventive health services among poor children, by improving\n            coverage, targeting and adequacy of the PATH."}, "docdt": "2009-09-17T00:00:00Z"}
