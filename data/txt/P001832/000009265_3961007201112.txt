MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT: Project Completion Report on Mauritania
Small Scale Irrigation Project (Credit 1571-MAU)
Attached is the Project Completion Report on Mauritania-Small Scale Irrigation
Project (Credit 1571-MAU) prepared by the Africa Regional Office. Part II was prepared by the
Borrower. The project was cofinanced by IFAD.
Only about one percent of the land area of Mauritania is cultivable and the
productivity of this area is limited by the aridity of the climate. The objective of the project was
to support an expansion of crop production (particularly of rice) through the development of
about 75 small irrigation perimeters, along the north bank of the Senegal River. These
perimeters, each of 20-25 hectares, are supplied with water by pumping from the river. They
were to be developed in collaboration with local communities, who would assist in their
construction, under the supervision of SONADER, the major rural development agency. The
communities were then to be responsible for their operation. Some 60 perimeters were
constructed, largely by SONADER itself. Local participation in site selection, design and
construction appears to have been minimal. At project closing about 28 percent of the area
developed was not being used, and the area cropped was less than 60 percent of that projected at
appraisal. The re-estimated ERR for the project is negative, and the project outcome is rated as
unsatisfactory. Institutional development is rated as negligible and sustainability as uncertain.
The completion report provides an adequate account of project implementation. No
audit is planned.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA
SMALL SCALE IRRIGATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 1571-MAU)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Small Scale Irrigation Project in
Mauritania, for which Credit 1571-MAU in the amount of SDR 7.7 million (US$ 7.5 million at
the current exchange rate) was approved on March 26, 1985. The IDA Credit became effective
on January 17, 1986. The Credit was closed on June 30, 1993, as originally anticipated. There
were no postponements of the closing date. The actual disbursements of the Credit amounted to
SDR 5.7 million (US$ 7.5 million at the withdrawal dates exchange rate) and the undisbursed
balance of SDR 2.0 million was canceled. The project was cofinanced by IFAD to the amount of
US$ 3.5 million. Government contributed US$ 0.7 million.
The PCR was prepared by the Agricultural Operations Division, Sahel Department, Africa
Region. The Borrower provided Part II of the report. The PCR was sent to the cofinanciers and
their comments have been incorporated.
The PCR is based on the Staff Appraisal Report, The President's Report, the Credit
Agreement as well as on supervision, Borrowers' and Cofinancieres reports and correspondence
contained in the Bank's project files.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA
SMALL SCALE IRRIGATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 1571-MAU)
Evaluation Summary
Background
i.    More than half Mauritania's population of 2.1 million depends on agriculture and animal
husbandry. Yet its agricultural resource base is extremely narrow. Less than 1% of its land, all
along the Senegal River, receives sufficient rainfall for rainfed crop cultivation. However, the
construction of the Manantali Dam regulating the Senegal River, has created a rather considerable
irrigation potential, estimated at 135,000 ha. Only about 15,000 ha of this is presently under
cultivation.
ii.    Reduced rainfall and declining flood recessions have put pressure on the strip of irrigable
agricultural land along the Senegal River, resulting in social and ethnic tensions. Rapid population
growth (2.9% p.a.) and recurrent droughts have caused massive migration to the towns of
Nouakchott and Nouadhibou. In response to this situation, a major expansion of irrigation was
begun in the early 1980s, with the intensification of agriculture seen as the best, perhaps the only,
practical response. The Small Scale Irrigation Project was part of this response. Prior to 1980,
there was little irrigation. The difficulties the project encountered must, therefore, be seen against
the background of the unfamiliarity of the traditional farning population, Government and donors
with irrigated agriculture in Mauritania.
Project Obiective and Design
iii.   The project's objective was to increase the country's food producing capacity and to
provide an additional income base to the rural population. It would develop 1570 ha in 75
perimeters of 20-25 ha each. Irrigation would be by pumping from the Senegal River. The project
would also provide pumping equipment, farm inputs, staff and technical assistance, miscellaneous
materials and equipment and operating costs. Total costs was estimated at US$ 11.3 million, of
which IDA would finance US$ 7.5 million, IFAD US$ 3.5 million and Government US$ 0.3
million.
iv.   The project would be implemented by Mauritania's rural development agency,
SONADER, and beneficiary farmers. SONADER would supervise construction, either by the
farmers themselves or (in cases where earth moving beyond farmers' capacity was required) by
private contractors. Farmers would organize themselves in farmers groups for each perimeter and
each farmer would receive about 0.5 ha. SONADER would provide assistance in group formation



iv
and would subsequently monitor and assist them. SONADER would furthermore provide
pumping and other equipment, inputs and extension services.
Implementation
v.    There was a delay of almost three years between appraisal (April/May 1982) and Board
presentation (March 1985). The credit agreement was signed in May 1985 and the credit became
effective in January 1986 after two extensions. The reasons for the effectiveness delays were slow
compliance with the IFAD conditions of effectiveness and delays in the ratification of the project
agreement and the opening of the special account.
vi.    Soon after effectiveness, Government requested and IDA agreed that the civil works
scheduled to be performed by contractors would instead be done by SONADER under force
account. SONADER had difficulty following the pace of construction envisaged by the project.
Most supervision missions reported delays and shortfalls. Several also noted insufficient extension
services in newly constructed perimeters. One mission noted inadequate quality of work.
vii.   The biggest implementation obstacle was posed by the behavior of farmers. They were
reluctant to work on perimeter construction and maintenance. Several farmers groups abandoned
perimeters for no apparent reason. Cropping patterns were erratic. Farmers groups often did not
function satisfactorily. And many farmers were unable or unwilling to make cash outlays for
inputs and maintenance. As a result, output from project perimeters was far less than expected.
viii.  Extension services were inadequate and while better services may not have fundamentally
altered the problem, they might have provided a better insight into the nature of the problem. The
same is true for monitoring and evaluation. None was included in the project and none was done.
An added problem was that at the height of the project (1989-1991), there were border hostilities
between Senegal and Mauritania, which limited access to the project area and hampered
supervision and extension activities.
ix.    Because of the persistence of the problems, IDA requested Government to suspend
further new construction and to focus on increasing the productivity of the existing parameters. In
response, SONADER conducted a study to deterrmine the causes of poor farmers motivation. The
results are given in para. 20 of the main report. It also engaged in the rehabilitation of parameters
that had fallen into disuse because of lack of maintenance and inadequate initial construction.
x.    All in all, the exact nature of the problem and ways to overcome it are not yet entirely
clear. The problem is unlikely to be caused by the technical and economic fundamentals of small
scale irrigation in Mauritania. Privately funded and managed perimeters are generally doing well,
whereas publicly financed small holder managed ones do not.



v
Project Results
xi.    With respect to area, actual construction of new perimeters amounted to 1221 ha out of a
target of 1570 ha (77%). Had new construction continued during the two remaining project years
after suspension, the target might well be achieved. In addition to the new perimeters, SONADER
has engaged in the rehabilitation to some degree of 639 ha, not anticipated at appraisal. Finally,
farmers did less and SONADER more than anticipated of new construction. Overall, construction
activity in quantity has been satisfactory, although quality could in some cases have been better.
xii.   Costs - In terms of dollars, there was a US$ 400,000 cost overrun, which was financed by
Government. Total project cost was, therefore, US$ 11.7 million. Since less acreage was
constructed for more money the cost per ha was higher than the appraisal estimate (US$ 9580 vs.
US$ 7200). Because of the depreciation of the dollar, there were savings in SDR terms of SDR
2.0 million, which were canceled at the closing date.
xiii.   With regard to production. project output was much less than expected, because of the
smaller area developed, the number of perimeters abandoned and the lower cropping intensity on
those that remained under production. On some perimeters, satisfactory rice yields (4-5 m.t./ha)
have been achieved (appraisal estimate 4.5 m.t./ha). Maize yields were considerably lower than
expected (1.8-2.6 m.t./ha vs. 3.8 m.t./ha). The expected cultivation of peas never took place.
Instead, several farmers groups cultivated sorghum, a practice not envisaged at appraisal.
Rate of Return
xiv.   The recalculated economic rate of return (ERR) is a negative -5.7% as compared with an
ERR of 25% estimated at appraisal. For some individual perimeters the ERR is marginally
positive as, for example, for the Sounoutou El Veth perimeter (+5.7%) and the Sagne Dieri
perimeter (+1.5%).
Project Sustainability
xv.   It is uncertain whether and for how long the project perimeters will be maintained and
kept in production. Under circumstances prevailing during project implementation, prospects are
not good. However, conditions are changing in Mauritania. First, the structure of the agricultural
sector is changing. There is increasing deregulation and liberalization and the private sector is
likely to improve marketing and producer price responsiveness. Secondly, population growth
continues to put pressure on agricultural resources. Land suitable for rainfed and recession
agriculture has all been taken up and the only other available resource is irrigable land. It is,
therefore, not excluded that there will eventually be a renewed interest on the part of small
farmers for project perimeters.
xvi. However, at this stage the project must be considered not successful. Whatever the cause
of this failure may be, it is unlikely to be the economic or technical factors underlying small scale



vi
irrigation in Mauritania. Privately funded and managed irrigation perimeters are generally doing
well, whereas publicly funded schemes worked by small holders are not.
Lessons Learned
xvii.  There are four important lessons to be learned from the project: These are:
(a)   The importance of social and socio-economic factors cannot be overrated. If the success
of a project is dependent on behavioral changes of the target group, it should be verified whether
these can indeed be counted upon. A behavioral change cannot be achieved through a top down
command structure, but must be build upon a participating approval of farmers and other
interested parties. A more thorough investigation of the first perimeters that had already been
constructed might have alerted IDA to problems ahead. It would also have been possible to
gradually phase in the project or to start with a pilot scheme.
(b)   Preference should be given to demand driven projects. In this project, the perimeter sites
were pre-selected at appraisal and Government took the initiative to propose them to farners.
Organization and cropping pattern were pre-determined. Farmers had no voice in site selection or
perimeter layout. If there were aspects of the deal they did not like, they had hardly an
opportunity to express them. Chances of success would have been greater if the project had
developed and equipped perimeters at the request of farmers' groups. That would have provided
assurances that the site location and soils were agreeable to the farmers and that the group would
be harmonious.
(c)   If there is a long delay between appraisal and Board presentation, the assumptions
underlying the project must be reexamined. In this project, almost three years had elapsed and
there was bound to be new information regarding the performance of small scale smallholder-run
irrigation schemes. This was not included in the project. Moreover, the role of SONADER had
meanwhile changed. In such cases a reappraisal mission would have been required under Bank
rules.
(d)   Pervasive changes in project design should only be made after careful consideration. In
this case, the question whether civil works should be done by SONADER by force account or by
private contractor would have benefited from greater scrutiny by Bank staff. By readily acceding
to the SONADER request, the project incurred delays, higher costs and probably lower quality.

SMALL SCALE IRRIGATION PROJECT

PART I: PROJECT REVIEW FROM THE BANK'S PERSPECTIVE
A. Project Identity
Project Name:            Small Scale Irrigation Project
Credit No.:              1571-MAU
RVP Unit:                Africa Region
Country:                 Mauritania
Sector:                  Agriculture
B. Project Background
1.    Mauritania's population is 2.1 million. The modem sector is dominated by mining and
fishing. About 200,000 families, at least half the population, are engaged in agriculture and animal
husbandry, including some 22,000 in irrigated agriculture.
2.    The agricultural resource base of Mauritania is extremely narrow, with less than 1% of the
land receiving sufficient rainfall to support rainfed agriculture. Animal husbandry is still the
dominant rural activity accounting for some 85% of rural sector GDP (about five times that of
agriculture and 19% of total GDP). Crop production is concentrated along the southern border on
the right Bank of the Senegal River, where rainfall is highest. About 17% of land area has rainfall
over 150mm.
3.    The most serious problem facing Mauritania is that of recurrent droughts. There were
prolonged periods of inadequate rainfall during 1968-1973 and 1983-1985. The adverse climatic
conditions, coupled with high population growth (2.9% p.a.) have combined to produce severe
environmental stress leading to deforestation, soil erosion, overgrazing of pastures and
deterioration of urban facilities.
4.    Reduced rainfall and declining flood recessions have put pressure on the strip of irrigable
agricultural land along the Senegal River, resulting in social and ethnic tensions. There has been
massive migration to the towns of Nouakchott and Nouadhibou. In response to this situation, a
major expansion of irrigation was begun in the early 1980s, with the intensification of agriculture
seen as the best, perhaps the only, practical response. The Small Scale Irrigation Project was part
of this response. Prior to 1980, there was little irrigation. The problems encountered by the



2
project must, therefore, be seen against the background of the newness of irrigation in the area for
farmers, Government and donors alike.
5.    Irrigated agriculture has grown rapidly during the past decade from only about 2,000 ha in
1980 to some 24,000 ha at present, although only 15,000 ha is currently actually under
production. Mauritania's irrigation potential has increased with the construction of the Manantali
Dam upstream on a Senegal River tributary in Mali. It is estimated that the potential irrigable area
is now 135,000. Until the late 1970s, Mauritania was self-sufficient in cereals and milk and was an
exporter of meat. Since then, agricultural output has failed to keep pace with population growth
and the country has become increasingly dependent on food imports, particularly food aid.
C. Project Objectives and Description
6.    The project's objective was to increase the country's capability to produce food and
provide an income base for the rural population.
7.    The project included:
(a)   development of 75 small irrigation perimeters (20-25 ha) totaling 1,570 ha through
pumping from the Senegal River;
(b)   provision of 75 pumping sets for these perimeters, plus 20 additional stand-by sets;
(c)    provision of farm inputs;
(d)   provision of vehicles, topographic and office equipment;
(e)   construction of housing and work facilities at Gouraye;
(f)    provision of technical assistance to SONADER for supervision of construction of
small perimeters (two experienced irrigation engineers);
(g)   provision of technical assistance to project beneficiaries in the form of agricultural
extension (two Mauritanian professionals), organization and management of
cooperatives (two Mauritanian professionals) and pump maintenance and repair
service (four Mauritanian mechanics); and
(h)   financing of operating costs related to the above activities.
8.    Project works would be completed in three years and supporting services to farmers
would be provided for two years after construction. Full project development would take five
years.



3
9.    The project would finance the construction of two types of perimeters. Each perimeter
would be an independent unit of at least 20 ha served by a pumping set. TypeA perimeters would
be constructed entirely by the beneficiaries themselves, who would contribute 4,500 days of work
per perimeter. SONADER's role would be to design the perimeter layout, supervise construction,
do minor cement works at the stilling basin and install the pump set and accessories. Type B
perimeters would be built on more difficult_sites, where earth moving beyond beneficiaries
capabilities would be required. Such works would be undertaken by contractor, under supervision
of SONADER, but Type B perimeters would otherwise be the same as Type A.
D. Project Design and Organization
10.   The project envisaged two principal players. Firsts Government would onlend the credit
proceeds to SONADER, the National Rural Development Agency, which would execute the
project. SONADER would supervise the construction of the perimeters by the farmers themselves
for Type A perimeters and by contractors for Type B works. It would provide inputs and
equipment, organize extension services, assure pump maintenance and supervise perimeter
construction. SONADER would be strengthened with equipment, technical assistance and
housing for the additional staff.
11.  In 1984, a year before the project's Board approval, SONADER had been reorganized.
Previously, it had been entrusted with planning and design of rural development projects,
execution of works by force account, the operation and maintenance of projects and the provision
of supporting services (farming equipment, extension, credit, input distribution, and marketing). It
was felt that this was excessive and Government and donors agreed that SONADER would no
longer be responsible for direct project implementation. Maintenance of pumps, supply of inputs,
agricultural credit and marketing activities would be transferred to the private sector or existing
banks, which would deal directly with the cooperative groups concerned within each project.
12.   However, there was no other entity that could take over the tasks so far performed by
SONADER. The private sector was insufficiently developed to absorb its functions, particularly in
remote areas. Therefore, SONADER resumed project executions, in particular for the Small Scale
Irrigation Project.
13.   The second important group of players would be the farmers themselves. They would
organize themselves in groups and be responsible for perimeter and equipment maintenance,
input acquisition, credit repayments, collecting charges and overall management. Each perimeter
would have its own group. Specialized extension agents of SONADER would help in group
formation and would subsequently assist and monitor them.



4
E. Project Implementation
Project Origin and Duration
14.   The project was identified in 1980 and appraised in 1982. The credit was approved by the
Board on March 26, 1985 and became effective on January 17, 1986. The closing date was not
extended and the credit closed as anticipated on June 30, 1993.
Cofinancing
15.   The project was cofinanced by IFAD for an amount of US$ 3.5 million. Relations with the
cofinancier were excellent throughout the project period. Government would finance US$ 0.3
million, but there was a cost overrun of US$ 0.4 million, which it funded so that its actual
contribution amounted to US$ 0.7 million. Relations with Government have also been excellent
during the project. It has been most cooperative in solving technical problems.
Project Modification
16.   The project had envisaged construction of Type B perimeters by private contractors. In
December 1986, SONADER requested that it be permitted to construct Type B perimeters by
force account. IDA agreed to this. As reason for its request, SONADER stated that foreign firms
were not interested in small contracts in remote locations. However, there is no evidence that
attempts to attract firms were ever made. In particular, no invitations to bid were issued.
Technical Implementation
17.   SONADER had difficulty following the construction pace envisaged in the SAR. Most
supervision missions complained about delays and shortfalls in the construction of new
perimeters. Several supervision missions also complained about the lack of extension services in
newly constructed perimeters. One mission noted insufficient quality of work.
Farmers' Role and Motivation
18.   The most important obstacle to a successful project implementation was, perhaps, farmers'
behavior. They did not react as anticipated. Problems manifested themselves as follows:
(a)   farmers were reluctant to work on perimeter construction or maintenance, a
situation that prevailed also elsewhere in the valley;
(b)   several farmers' groups abandoned perimeters for no apparent reasons;
(c)   cropping patterns were often erratic and did not give the impression that
perimeters were regularly and steadily being worked by the same group of people;



5
(d)   there were many farmers' groups that did not function satisfactorily; and
(e)   farmers were apparently insufficiently willing or able to make cash outlays for
inputs and maintenance.
The result was that production from project perimeters fell far short of what it should have been.
19.   One factor possibly contributed to the adverse farmers' behavior and donors' inability to
understand it. This was the inadequacy of extension services for project perimeters. Another
contributory factor may have been the absence of monitoring and evaluation. None was
anticipated by the project and none was done. Had there been monitoring and evaluation and
more extension services, problems might have been better understood, especially on the monetary
income side.
20.   Perplexed by farmers' behavior, IDA asked SONADER to conduct a socio-economic
study of the project's target group. The study was conducted by three SONADER staff members,
a sociologist, an irrigation engineer and an agronomist. Its report was issued in April 1991. It
mentions the following factors as causes of lack of farmers' motivation:
(a)   For the farmers, small irrigation perimeters bear the stigma of the drought calamity
of the 1970s. They seemed to accept them at the time because of necessity but
small scale irrigation is not appealing to them because of the cost involved;
(b)   Farmers are insufficiently implicated in the project. They are badly prepared and
often only told at the moment SONADER starts work;
(c)   Farmers consider the perimeter not their property, but that of Government. They
think SONADER wants to make profit on their backs by requiring them to pay
charges and repay credit; and
(d)   There is a lot of fatalism among farmers. This makes farmers think that everything
is determined by destiny, which they cannot change. It may cause them not to
express themselves when projects are proposed and not to take action in case of
technical problems or other setbacks.
The report also suggests that in some cases soil insufficiencies may be involved. The study does
not contain a farm model analysis and it does, therefore, shed no new light on the monetary aspect
of the problem. An important factor may also be farmers' preference for rainfed agriculture, which
is easier and does not require cash outlays.
21.   Whatever the cause of farmers' conduct, it is unlikely to be the underlying economic or
technical factors. Privately funded and managed irrigation perimeters are generally doing well,
whereas publicly funded schemes worked by small holders are not.

Project Reorientation
22.   Confronted by a continued lack of farmers' motivation, IDA requested SONADER in
October 1990 to suspend construction of new perimeters and to focus on the productivity of the
already constructed ones. New construction was suspended and was not taken up again under the
project. Instead, SONADER undertook the rehabilitation of project perimeters that had
deteriorated because of initial construction inadequacies and lack of maintenance.
Border Hostilities
23.   In April 1989, border hostilities erupted between Mauritania and Senegal. This limited
access to the river and to the project perimeters and affected supervision and extension as well as
construction and rehabilitation activities. The tension relaxed in 1991.
F. Project Results
24.   The project has not reached the appraisal targets, in particular regarding:
(a)   the total area developed;
(b)   the unit development cost and
(c)   production and yields.
Developed Areas
25.   The following table gives the areas to be developed as envisaged at appraisal and the areas
actually developed as well as those that were subsequently rehabilitated (in ha).

The table shows that:
(a)   Overall, the target for new developments were reached for about three-fourths.
Part of the reason is the suspension of new perimeter construction in 1990, which
prevented SONADER to complete the program. Moreover, SONADER has
engaged in a large program of rehabilitation works, which were not foreseen.
Finally, the shift from Type A to Type B perimeters caused more work (see point
(c)). In terms of total construction activity, therefore, project performance was
better than indicated by the new construction statistics alone and should be
considered satisfactory;
(b)   The shortfall in new constructions was entirely in Gouraye for two reasons. First,
the Gouraye region is more isolated than the Kaedi area. Movement of equipment,
staff and other resources to that area proved more demanding than anticipated.
Secondly, before construction could begin in the Gouraye area, a workshop had to
be established and a construction brigade forrned. This caused the Gouraye
program to run behind from the beginning;
(c)   There was a shift from the cheaper Type A perimeters to Type B perimeters,
because it proved difficult to find farmers willing to do the development works



8
themselves (see para. 18). This was particularly true in the Kaedi area. This caused
additional construction work for SONADER, which was not included in the
original targets; and
(d)   A large part of the Type B developments (62%) had to be rehabilitated after only a
short period of use. This was to a large extent due to lack of maintenance on the
part of farmers. Inadequate initial construction may, in some cases, have been a
contributory factor.
Costs
26.   In terms of US dollars, the amount anticipated in the SAR (US$ 11.3 million) was fully
used. Moreover, there was a US$ 400,000 cost overrun, financed by Government, so that total
project cost amounted to US$ 11.7 million. Since for a higher amount less acreage was
developed, unit costs estimates were exceeded. The estimated average development cost for Type
A and B perimeters is not given separately in the appraisal documents. The average for both type
developments in current prices was US$ 11.3 million/I570 ha equals US$ 7200 per ha. Given the
isolated locations, this was a reasonable figure. However, actual development costs in US dollars
in current prices were 28% higher than anticipated, namely US$ 9580 per ha (US$ 11.7
mnillion/1221 ha), which is still within the admissible range for the area.
27.   At the time the credit agreement was signed, the US dollar was at its strongest and the
conversion rate of the estimated project cost into SDRs was SDR1 = US$0.96. Since then the US
dollar has gradually depreciated against the SDR to a level of about SDRI = US$1.40 in 1992/93.
As a result, the required amount of dollars could be obtained with less SDRs, resulting in savings
in SDR terms of SDR 2.0 million, which were canceled at the closing date.
Production and Yields
28.   There are few production data available. The SAR does not provide incremental
production estimates, although they must have been at the base of the economic analysis.
However, it is clear that incremental output must be considerably below those expected at
appraisal. Not only is the developed area less than anticipated at appraisal, but a significant
portion of this was abandoned subsequent to development as shown by the following figures (in
ha):
Total developed      Abandoned         In prod. in 1993
Gouraye                   411 ha              34 ha             377 ha
Kaedi                     810 ha             309 ha             501 ha
Total                    1221 ha             343 ha             878 ha
Overall, 28% of developed areas was abandoned and in 1993 only 56% of the area anticipated at
appraisal was under production. Most of this was in the Kaedi area.

29.   Data for 26 individual perimeters showed the following for 1993:
Rice: Ten perimeters cultivated rice in the rainy season of which 9 had yields between 4 to 5
tons per ha. None cultivated rice during the dry season.
Maize: Only 3 perimeters cultivated maize during the rainy season with yields from 1 to 2 tons per
ha. 14 Cultivated maize during the dry season with of 1.8 to 2.6 tons per ha.
Sorghum: 14 Cultivated sorghum during the rainy season with yields of 0.7 to 1.9 tons per ha.
None cultivated sorghum during the dry season.
The appraisal report gives expected yields for rice, maize and peas. The cultivation of peas did not
materialize as anticipated at appraisal. On the other hand, cultivation of sorghum under irrigation
was not anticipated at appraisal, but does take place. The expected yield for rice (paddy) was 4.5
tons per ha and the realized yields compare favorably with the expectations. The expected yield
for maize was 3.8 tons per ha and the realized yields were significantly lower.
Individual Perimeters
30.   In spite of the overall outcome of the project, one positive aspect must be mentioned. On
the basis of data provided by SONADER for individual perimeters, it would seem that some that
were regularly under production were justified and had marginally positive results (see para. 31).
However, the unit development costs given for these individual perimeters are much lower than
those for the project as a whole, because only directly attributable costs and no overhead were
taken into account. Nevertheless, it may seem to indicate that the development of small scale
irrigation schemes along the Senegal River in Mauritania can be worthwhile if the socio-economic
conditions are right and terrain development is done efficiently at minimal costs.
G. Economic Analysis
31.   The results of the analysis are given in table 6 and show a recalculated economic rate of
return (ERR) of -5.7%, as compared with an estimated ERR of 25% at appraisal. This scenario
assumes complete withdrawal of SONADER from the perimeters, but includes adequate
allowances for maintenance and input acquisition as well as the imputed value of family farm
labor. All project indicators point to a negative ERR and this outcome seems plausible. Reducing
the imputed value of family farm labor and of maintenance and on-farm costs makes the ERR rise,
but under no plausible set of assumptions does the project show a positive ERR.
32.   An ERR has also been calculated for two individual perimeters (see para. 29). The ERR
for the Sounoutou El Veth perimeter is a positive 5.7% and that for the Sagne Dieri perimeter a
positive 1,5%. This is not very high, but it might, nevertheless, suggest that, with an optimal
design, efficient construction and dedicated farmers, small scale irrigation on small holder run
perimeters in Mauritania could be feasible and justified.



10
H. Project Sustainability
33.   It is uncertain whether and for how long the perimeters will be maintained and kept in
production. Under conditions that prevailed during project implementation, it would seem that
prospects in that regard are not good. However, conditions in Mauritania are changing.
34.   On the macro-economic side, Government is aware of the need of deregulation and
liberalization. In particular, the UM has been devalued making domestic agricultural products
relatively cheaper. In the framework of the IDA Agricultural Sector Adjustment Credit, the
agricultural sector has been largely deregulated and liberalized. This applies especially to
marketing, pricing and processing. Moreover, SONADER is being reorganized to concentrate
exclusively on rural development planning and project implementation. Finally, rapid population
growth is exercising pressure on food prices and land.
3 5.   It may take some time for all the above factors to combine and create a renewed demand
for the project perimeters. Price incentives will have to sink in and the private sector may need
time to develop sufficiently to take the place of SONADER. Population growth will eventually
make the farming community reconsider the project perimeters again. In summary, there is a real
possibility that project perimeters in the future may be more intensively used than they are at
present and that the project may as yet live up to its expectations.
I. Bank Performance
Appraisal
36.   The appraisal team did not recognize the socio-economic constraints to which the project
was subjected. There had been questions at the SAR yellow cover review about the structure and
organization of farmers' groups. It would later appear that this was only one aspect of a larger set
of social factors that would impede project implementation (see paras. 18-21).
37.   There was a long period of 3 years between appraisal and Board presentation. There was
no updating mission and new data and changes in conditions were not fully incorporated in the
report. This was particularly true for the role and functions assigned to SONADER (see paras.
10-12).
Supervision
38.   Supervision averaged 5.1 staff weeks per year. During the first 3 years supervision was
more intense at almost 9 staff weeks per year but subsequently slowed down to average only
about 4 staff weeks during the following three years. However these years coincided with the
period of border hostilities, which limited access to the project area and hampered supervision.



11
J. Borrower Performance
39.   Government complied with all aspects of the Credit Agreement. It funded cost overruns to
the amount of US$ 400,000. Relations between Government and IDA were excellent during the
entire project period.
40.   The weaknesses in SONADER's performance have been described in para. 17. Apart from
these technical shortcomings, relations between IDA and SONADER have been good.
K. Lessons Learned
41.   There are four important lessons to be learned from the project. These are:
(a)   The importance of social and socio-economic factors cannot be overrated. If the
success of a project is dependent on behavioral changes of the target group, it
should be verified whether these can indeed be counted upon. A behavioral change
cannot be achieved through a top down command structure, but must be build
upon a participating approval of farmers and other interested parties. A more
thorough investigation of the first perimeters that had already been constructed
might have alerted IDA. It would also have been possible to gradually phase in the
project or to start with a pilot scheme.
(b)   Preference should be given to demand driven projects. In this project, the
perimeter sites were pre-selected at appraisal and Government took the initiative
to propose them to farmers. Organization and cropping pattern were pre-
determined. Farmers had no voice in site selection or perimeter layout. If there
were aspects of the deal they did not like, they had hardly an opportunity to
express them. Chances of success would have been greater if the project had
developed and equipped perimeters at the request of farmers' groups. That would
have provided assurances that the site location and soils were agreeable to the
farmers and that the group would be harmonious.
(c)   If there is a long delay between appraisal and Board presentation, the assumptions
underlying the project must be reexamined. In this project, almost three years had
elapsed and there was bound to be new information regarding the performance of
small scale smallholder-run irrigation schemes. This was not included in the
project. Moreover, the role of SONADER had meanwhile changed. In such cases a
reappraisal mission would have been required under Bank rules.
(d)   Pervasive changes in project design should only be made after careful
consideration. In this case, the question whether civil works should be done by
SONADER by force account or by private contractor would have benefited from



12
greater scrutiny by Bank staff. By readily acceding to the SONADER request, the
project incurred delays, higher costs and probably lower quality.



13
PART 1I: EVALUATION FROM BORROWER'S STANDPOINT
General
42.   Several parties were involved in the execution of the project and contributed in differing
degrees:
IDA/IFAD: the joint IDA/IFAD financing for the project (IDA credit 1571 and IFAD loan No.
169) was executed appropriately, the disbursements as a whole being made in accordance with the
different project items. The amendment to the credit agreement went into effect when it was
needed for continuation of the project activities up to June 30, 1993.
The Mauritanian State: The State released the counterpart funds regularly included in its budget
and necessary for paying the local project personnel.
National agency (SONADER): SONADER's contribution as executing agency for the project
was delivered overall as planned notwithstanding the multiple constraints it was operating under
and still is. We would note, however, that the difficulties complicating provision of this
contribution included the very considerable mobility of the national personnel (several changes of
project managers at Kaedi and Gouraye), which did not work to the advantage of the stability and
continuity necessary for effective execution of the project.
Beneficiary populations: the participation of the populations considered beneficiaries at the start
and end of the project was limited to its execution. They should be involved more in the
preparation phase as well as execution with a view to greater sustainability of the developments.
Project impact
43.   In terms of the parameters initially set by the project for evaluating its impact on the
population's income, it could appear that the actual results fall short of what was expected on the
basis of the production and annual average income per farmer from the project and the number of
farmers who have benefited from this income, compared with those initially allotted plots in the
perimeters set up.
44.   However, some distinctions need to be made in this overall assessment. The fact is that
although this income is below what was expected it is nevertheless significant in that:
-     depending on the particular case, this income can serve to cover all or part of the
food needs of a household, taken as a production and consumption unit of seven persons on
average, or to provide a surplus usable for meeting nonfood needs (medical costs, clothing,
equipment, etc.);



14
-     the beneficiaries of these modest incomes are considered well-off compared with
the large proportion of working-age adults in the village with no productive employment;
-     with this income the farmers concerned are in a better position than other job-
seekers in their category, i.e. unskilled labor, who are either unable to find work or else receive a
very inadequate wage (between UM 200 and UM 300/day).
45.   The project should therefore be consolidated to render it viable and justify considering its
extension in order to increase the incomes of the farmers presently working in it and to foster
incorporation of new farmers, while also making a return to the land attractive for rural people
who are currently living in urban areas without employment.
Project sustainabilitv
46.   It is true that a review of the perimeters reveals some characteristic deficiencies that have
led to some perimeters being abandoned, low cropping intensities and modest yields, due
apparently to a combination of factors, the main ones being:
-     inadequate design and execution
-     deficient extension
-     an unfavorable institutional environment (agricultural credit, marketing, etc.)
-     insufficient protection of irrigated plots against straying livestock
-     lack of motivation on the part of certain farmers
-     frequent breakdowns of pumping systems.
47.   However, the contribution made by these irrigated plots to family budgets must be bome
in mind. While in some cases the income generated can be considered negligible, for the majority
this income forms their main resource for meeting their basic needs.
48.   There are in the project area some families that are artificially well-off on account of
remittances received from family members who have emigrated to Mauritanian or foreign urban
centers. However, this income is rarely invested in development projects, but is more often used
for prestige expenditures (family ceremonies, additions to homes, etc.) than for funding
development of the local population.
49.   Moreover, in view of the increasingly difficult national and international economic
situation, it is not unlikely that these remittances from elsewhere will decline. In other words, in
the medium or long term irrigation-type agricultural development projects are likely to be the
primary sources of paid employment, not just for the local people but also for Mauritanians
currently living abroad who might be prompted to return for these reasons and for others beyond
the scope of this report.



15
50.   It would be advisable to study all the problems preventing the proper functioning of the
perimeters at present and to consider a certain number of steps to ensure their sustainability, in
particular:
-      consolidation of the existing developed areas;
-      creation of other developments in the future with a view to increasing average
farm size;
-      continuation and intensification of the efforts already undertaken to set up proper
training and a competent extension service;
-      formulation of a functional training program for group leaders;
-      reorganization of the institutional environment upstream and downstream of
production (agricultural credit, marketing, etc.).

Excluding Contingencies for delay in implementation
Comment
The exchange rates US$:SDR:UM have changed substantially between appraisal and project implementation period.
(see above)
To take into account the devaluation of UM which took place after appraisal but before negotiations, and the decrease of
the USS value as compared to SDR, a special contingency US$2 million has been added to the estimated SAR cost table
(at the green cover stage). The summary SAR cost table above does not take into account this contingency.
The actual project cost, if expressed in UM was some 44% higher than estimated. The special contingency reduces the cost
overrun to 23%. If the cost is expressed in USS, the cost overrun amounts to 34%, but disappears entirely if the contingency is adde
If the cost is expressed in SDR, the actual cost was slightly lower than estimated (1 %) and if the special contingency is added
the actual cost was some 20% lower than estimated.
