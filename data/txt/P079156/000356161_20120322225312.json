Project for Indonesia were as follows: outcomes\n            were satisfactory; risk to development outcome was moderate;\n            Bank performance was moderately satisfactory and borrower\n            performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned includes: a popular and politically robust series of\n            projects with demonstrated success in rural poverty\n            reduction and improved governance has not only survived\n            major political change but has also led to its adoption by\n            government as a massive national program. A project that has\n            been shown to be responsive to local needs can lead to a\n            substantial increase in local government contributions from\n            their own budgetary sources. The Bank's responsiveness\n            and flexibility can be crucial to 'save a project'\n            during a period of legal and political uncertainty. This\n            project readily addressed the huge needs through a\n            re-allocation and an additional development objective. The\n            project was implemented without major financial management\n            problems, with all project audits being clean and only minor\n            issues being raised."}, "docdt": "2011-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
