The\n            Project was approved by the Executive Directors on June\n            26,2003. Indonesia's Ministry of Finance has now\n            requested that the Bank reduce the size of the total\n            Loan/Credit package from US$249.8 million to US$91 .0\n            million. The request is triggered by their overall debt\n            management strategy, and because the national\n            decentralization law package is currently undergoing\n            internal review. The amendment will not result in any\n            changes to the original objectives of the project as\n            approved by the Board, to any specific implementation\n            arrangements, or to the safeguards provisions. The Ministry\n            of Home Affairs would remain the responsible agency for\n            Project execution."}, "docdt": "2004-05-11T00:00:00Z"}
