                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR is prepared as part of the Implementation Support Mission which took place from April 28 - May 9, 2014 and included both World Bank, representatives from Australian
                         Government, Unicef, UNESCO and World Food Program. The Mission jointly reviewed the implementation progress since the September 2013 mission, and provided
                         recommendations that would enable the Program Development Objective (PDO) to be fully achieved by the August 31, 2014 Closing Date.

                         OVERALL STATUS: The Program continues to make significant implementation progress toward the Closing Date of August 31, 2014. The level of commitment to the Program by
                         the MoES, ECU and all IUs remains high and efforts are continued to be made to ensure a closer working relationship to speed up Program implementation. The ECU has been

                         speed up activities during the final year of implementation. The ECU and the IUs continue to explore ways to work together to solve daily issues and to closely monitor and document
                         progress during the last phase of implementation. The quality of the progress report has been significantly improved. The report is well organized, documenting achievements,
                         challenges, lessons learned and future planned activities for each sub-component. This will help facilitate the preparation of the Implementation Completion Report.

                         Over the past six months, disbursement averaged USD 1.0 million per month. As of April 30, 2014, the disbursements from two sources of funds stood at: EFA-FTI-CF: US$ 25.9
                         million or 86.33 percent of the total Grant; and AusAID TF: AUD 18.92 million or 93.41percent of the Grant. MoES will remain attentive about sustaining these expenditure levels in
                         order for program targets to be met.

                         With the CBC activities covering 56 remote target districts, the numerous training activities undertaken, and the innovative nature of the National School Meals Program, the
                         Community-Based School Readiness Program (Playgroup) and the Mobile Teacher Program, the EFA-FTI Program is making satisfactory progress toward the last phase of
                         implementation. School construction will be completed before the Closing Date, with firm plans for water and latrines to be fully provided by UNICEF’s WASH program.

                         The Program has made good progress on all the quality inputs and all activities are expected to be completed prior to the August 31, 2014 closing date. In preparation for the ICR, the
                         ECU, with support from an international consultant, in conducting an assessment of five activities supported under the quality component of the program. The five activities are: (i)
                         VEDC training; (ii) mobile teacher pilot program; (iii) CBSRP pilot program; (iv) school principal training; and (v) pre-primary 9+2 teacher training. The findings from the assessment
                         are expected to be disseminated in May 2014. In addition, in the final four months of the project the ECU and IUs will monitor the remaining activities to ensure the completion. In
                         addition, the ECU and IUs will make sure that the remaining project funds are monitored to ensure maximum use by project closing.

                         Despite commendable accomplishments above, challenges remain, particularly in the area of financial management, which is rated as “moderately satisfactory.” Although there has
                         been improvement over the past six months, there are continuing issues relating to the current financial arrangements and practices that do not facilitate effective Program
                         implementation.
