        ADDITIONAL FINANCING TO THE SECOND EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT
        PROJECT ("EDPII-AF")- CREDIT NO. C3886-LA, GRANT NO. Ho84o-LA AND
        GRANT NO. H541-LA


        We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the Education for All Fast Track
        Initiative Program ("EFA-FTI P")- TF097384 and AusAID-TF099625 and Additional Financing
        to the Second Education Development Project ("EDPII -AF")-Credit No. C3886-LA, Grant No.
        H084o-LA and Grant No. H541-LA ("the Project") funded by International Development
        Association ("IDA"), Government of Aush·alia, and Catalytic Fund, which comprise the statement
        of receipts and disbursements and statement of fund balance as at and for the year then ended 30
        September 2014 (Project closure period), and a summmy of significant accounting policies and
        other explanatoty information. The financial statements have been prepared by management of
        the Project in accordance with the accounting policies described in Note 2 to the financial
        statements.


        Management's responsibility for the financial statements

        Management is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the
        accounting policies described in Note 2 to the financial statements and for such internal control
        as management determines necessmy to enable the preparation of the financial statements that
        are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.


        Auditor's responsibility

        Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based on our audit. We
        conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Those standards
        reqnire that we comply with ethical reqnirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain
        reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material
        misstatement.

        An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and
        disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's
        jndgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial
        statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor
        considers internal control relevant to the Project's preparation of the financial statements in order
        to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
        expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Projects' internal conh·ol. An audit also includes
I !
        evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used made by management, as well as
        evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

        We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
        basis for our audit opinion.

                                                                           .
