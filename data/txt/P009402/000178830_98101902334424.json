financing\n            permanent structures and improvement of earthworks to\n            complement various earthworks schemes constructed under the\n            Food-For-Work-Program. It would include the provision of\n            equipment and vehicles for project implementation as well as\n            consultants to assist the Water Development Board (WDB) in\n            the selection, planning, design and supervision of\n            sub-projects. The project would, in the sub-project areas,\n            result in significant increases in annual foodgrain (mainly\n            paddy) production ranging from 35% to 53% over current\n            levels. While incremental increases in net farm incomes\n            would vary by sub-project and among individual farmers, net\n            farm incomes would in general, increase by 50% to 100%. The\n            project would increase employment opportunities in the rural\n            areas, primarily through changes in land use, and increase\n            in cropping intensity and an improvement in crop yields."}, "docdt": "1979-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
