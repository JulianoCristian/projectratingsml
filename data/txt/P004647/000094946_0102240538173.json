Project\n            sustainability, although debated for a long period, is\n            adjudged to be likely. Both the World Bank and Borrower\n            performances are rated satisfactory. Lessons learned include\n            the following: DSM programs should be designed with the\n            consideration of local cultural realities to ensure high\n            consumer acceptance and participation and to achieve\n            meaningful impacts. Mechanisms for transferring competency\n            and skills should be carefully assessed to determine\n            appropriate use of consultants, and consider short as well\n            as longer term assignments to maximize effectiveness.\n            Project designs should carefully consider the need for\n            independent evaluation, and if needed, develop suitable\n            contractual and reporting arrangements from the start. DSM\n            facilities should be linked with financing facilities to\n            ensure that utility efforts, largely in the industrial and\n            commercial sectors, can be followed up with meaningful\n            investments. Where multiple government energy efficiency\n            programs including DSM exist, linkages should be developed\n            to improve coordination and minimize potential overlaps. DSM\n            reform programs should ensure sustainability, taking into\n            account proposed institutional structures, pricing reforms,\n            regulation and oversight, incentive and funding schemes, and\n            established customer relationships. Well-designed, extensive\n            DSM marketing can help programs achieve significant savings\n            impacts at relatively low cost."}, "docdt": "2000-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
