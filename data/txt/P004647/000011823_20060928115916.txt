                                Energy Conservation Promotion Fund


   The ECF was established in 1995 under the Energy Conservation Promotion Act, based on revenues
   from domestic sales of gasoline, diesel, kerosene, and fuel oil. The ECF has an average annual income
   of 2 billion baht ($50 million) and a current balance of approximately $25 million. Government agen-
   cies, state enterprises (including EGAT), educational institutions, and nonprofit organizations may
   apply for funding.


   The ECF operates under the authority of the Minister and the high-level National Energy Policy Coun-
   cil. The fund is managed by the ECF Committee and chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister. While
   in the past this fund has been a source of revenues for programs and subsidies, the government's new
   direction favors offering tax incentives to end users rather than providing direct subsidies and grants
   from government.


   Administrative responsibility for the ECF is changing, and these changes may have a significant impact
   on future DSMO programs. As of 2005, the ECF Committee delegated its operating authority to the ECF
   Administration Committee. This Committee will review and decide on funding requests greater than 50
   million baht (approximately $1.31 million). EPPO will plan the use of ECF funds and set priorities.
