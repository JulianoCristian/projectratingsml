Marbek Resource Consultants conducted the study\n            in association with Global Change strategies International.\n            The field mission to Bangkok took place January 17-28, 2005.\n            The TPEEE Project was approved in 1993 and took place from\n            1993 to 2000. The project, national in scope, consisted of a\n            five-year demand-side management (DSM) plan. It was\n            implemented by the Demand-Side Management Office (DSMO) of\n            EGAT. Lessons learned : Consumer awareness, consumer and\n            investor knowledge and confidence in energy efficiency\n            products is a key objective for an effective DSM program.\n            Capacity building, in order to build capacity, it may be\n            helpful to begin with programs that do not require extensive\n            cooperation with other agencies to be successful. DSMO\n            programs proved to be less effective when they depended on\n            the cooperation of other agencies. Program design, a program\n            should be designed in a way that allows \"early\n            wins\" that then lead to expanded programs. Commercial\n            markets, ESCO (Energy Services Company) models must be\n            developed to suit the local or national business culture. It\n            helps to experiment with different ESCO models (financial,\n            technical) and then to build on lessons learned in the\n            particular jurisdiction and economic environment.\n            Sustainability, voluntary programs are useful as a necessary\n            step toward the development of minimum standards. This is\n            relevant to both low and high incremental cost products. To\n            sustain energy efficiency achievements, however, mandatory\n            standards may be required. Finally, along with internal\n            planning, it is important to have an external, third-party\n            monitor and an evaluation process/ agency involved on a\n            regular basis. This leads to credible data and confidence in\n            the reported results of the programs."}, "docdt": "2006-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
