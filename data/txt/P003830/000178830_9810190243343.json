and operation and maintenance capabilities.\n            The proposed project is the second to focus on building up\n            the capacity of the Provincial Irrigation Services (PRIS)\n            and project actions include institutional strengthening of\n            eight PRIS; strengthening of the Ministry of\n            Agriculture's services for land development and water\n            management extension; a three-year time slice of the\n            Government of Indonesia's (GOI's) Fourth National\n            Five-Year Development Plan (Repelita IV) in the eight\n            provinces for the program for the design and construction of\n            small-scale irrigation schemes, design for 5,000 ha and\n            construction of 34,000 ha of irrigation works at full\n            development; a three-year time slice of the design and\n            construction program for medium-scale irrigation schemes to\n            serve 45,000 ha for design and 26,200 ha of irrigation works\n            at full development; and consulting services for training."}, "docdt": "1983-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
