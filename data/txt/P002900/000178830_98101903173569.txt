INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMET ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF UGANDA
FOR A SMALLHOLDER TOBACCO PROJECT
1.         I submit the following report and recommendation on a
proposed Development Credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent
to US$4 million to the Republic of Uganda to assist in financing a Small-
holder Tobacco Project and technical assistance required for preparing
further agricultural projects.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.         The Government of Uganda submitted an agricultural credit
project to the Association in March 1968. An appraisal in October 1968
showed that the project, which envisaged credit for a range of crops
and concentrated heavily on short term credit requirements, was not
suitable for IDA financing as it stood. After discussions with the
Government on the need, at least in an initial phase, to focus on more
limited objectives, a tobacco development project was prepared with
the Association's assistance. That project was appraised in August 1969
and is the subject of this report.
3.         Negotiations were held in Washington from March 9 to 13, 1970.
Uganda was represented by Mr. C. H. M. Barlow, Permanent Secretary,
Ministry of Marketing and Cooperatives, Mr. A.Ocaya, Commissioner of
Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, I/r. M. Okai, Ministry of Agri-
culture and Forestry, Mr. C. 0. Nyeko, Ministry of Marketing and Coop-
eratives and Mr. V. W. K. Nyakabwa, Principal State Attorney.
4.         The proposed Credit would be the sixth IDA credit to Uganda
and the third for agriculture. Before independence Uganda received a
Bank loan of $8.4 million for power development, which was guaranteed
by the United Kingdom. The following is a summary statement of Bank
loans and IDA credits to Uganda as of May 31, 1970.

1/ Guaranteed by the United Kingdom
Disbursement  of the Fducation Credit (No. 101 UG) was  delayed in the
first instance by changes in design details of school buildings. Con-
struction is now going ahead satisfactorily, but procurement of furniture
and equipment has been slow. The matter is expected to be resolved
shortly. The Smallholder Tea project financed under Credit No. 109 UG
began more slowly than was expected, but performance under the Credit
is improving. The principal problem is the timely provision of adequate
processing facilities, which are to be financed outside the Credit, and
of supporting transportation and housing facilities for extension staff.
The Association is following both problems closely. The combined effect
of lower costs and higher tea prices than were assumed in appraisal is
likely to lead to a substantial undisbursed balance in the credit account.
The Government may request that the balance be applied to the cost of
extending the project to cover one additional planting season. The
performance of the Government and the Consultants under the Roads Credit
(No. 108 UG) has been satisfactory, but the contractors are behind schedule
and the closing date has had to be extended. Progress of the Beef Ranching
and Second Highways projects (Credits No. 130 and 164 UG) is satisfactory.
5.        In addition to the lending set out in paragraph 4, the Bank
had, as at Nay 31, 1970 made four loans for common services in East
Africa, three of them for railways and harbors and one for telecommunica-
tions. All of these loans are guaranteed jointly and severally by Kenya,
Tanzania and Uganda; the United Kingdom is also guarantor of the first
loan for railways. A loan of $42.4 million for railways, and a loan of

$10.4 million for telecommunications, both guaranteed by Kenya, Tanzania
and Uganda jointly and severally, were signed on May 25, 1970 but are
not yet effective. The following is a summary statement of effective
Bank loans for East African Community projects as of IvIay 31, 1970:

6.        IFC has made one investment in Uganda, in Nulco Textiles Limited
in 1964. The investment totalled US$3.51 million equivalent of which
$2.8 million was loan and $0.64 million was equity with $70,000 as a
standby commitment.  As of iay 31, 1970 $3.4 million had been disbursed.
7.        Later in this fiscal year I expect to recommend a second education
project in Uganda, which would emphasize technical and agricultural educa-
tion.

PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED CREDIT
8.        BORROIER:            The Republic of Uganda.
PURPOSE:             To help finance tobacco production, storage
and marketing facilities; technical assistance
for preparation of further agricultural
projects.
AMOUNT:              US$4 million equivalent in various currencies.
AMORTIZATION:        In 50 years, including a ten-year period
of grace, through semiannual installments
of one-half of one percent from September 15,
1980 through March 15, 1990 and of one and
one-half percent from September 15, 1990
through March 15, 2020.
SERVICE CHARGE:      3/4 of one percent per annum.
ESTIMATED ECONOMIC
RETURN:            21 percent per annum.
PART III - THE PROJECT
9.        A report entitled 'Uganda - Appraisal of the Smallholder Tobacco
Project" (PA33a) is attached.
10.       The proposed project consists of the construction of tobacco
curing barns by growers; the construction of baling centers, tobacco
stores and office facilities, and the establishment of fuel-wood planta-
tions by the regional Unions of Cooperative Tobacco Societies and by
their constituent primary societies; the construction and equipment of
additional storage facilities by the Produce Marketing Board; the provision
of a revolving fund to finance, through the Cooperative Unions, seasonal
production inputs required by new growers; and the retention of consultants
by the Government to prepare possible further agricultural projects.
11.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$7.26 million,
of which about US$2.6 million (about 36%) would be in foreign exchange.
The proposed credit would finance 55% of the total project cost, including
about $1.4 million equivalent of local currency costs (see paragraph 22 below).
12.       The project would be administered by a Project Director under
the overall guidance of a Project Committee. The Project Committee would
be made up of senior representatives of the ministries and agencies concerned



with various aspects of the project. This administrative mechanism
is similar to the one established for the Beef Ranching Project (Credit
No. 130 UG) and takes account of the existing structure of tobacco coop-
erative societies, marketing arrangements and independently operated
processing facilities already established. Considerable importance is
attached to the Project Director, and the Government of Uganda and the
Association have already agreed on the person who will be appointed to
this position if the proposed credit is approved.
13.       The proceeds of the proposed credit would be channelled largely
through the existing regional Unions of Cooperative Tobacco Societies,
in part in the form of loans for the construction of facilities by the
Unions and the Societies, and in part for on-lending to individual tobacco
growers for the construction of barns and for seasonal inputs; the balance
of the proceeds would be applied by the Produce Marketing Board (PMB)
to the construction and equipment of storage facilities, and by the
Government itself to the costs of agricultural extension services,
research and technical assistance. That part of the proceeds of the
credit which is to be passed on in the form of loans would be repaid
to the Government over periods up to 14 years with interest at 8 percent
per annum payable by the ultimate borrowers (12 percent per annum in
case of seasonal production loans).
14.       The proposed project would not only benefit 6,000 new growers
of tobacco but also existing growers. The project is expected almost
to double the quantity of flue cured tobacco produced in Uganda both by
an expansion of acreage and improved productivity. The bulk of the
increased production would be exported and w-fould augment the country's
foreign exchange earnings by about $2.8 million per annum. The economic
rate of return of farm investment in the project, based on current
estimates of tobacco prices, would be about 21 percent if the largely
family labor which would be employed were costed at the going farm wage
rate (or 27 percent assuming a zero shadow wage for such labor).
15.       Tobacco storage equipment, vehicles and bulk-purchased con-
struction materials, fertilizers and insecticides would be procured by
international competitive bidding. Tenders for construction of stores
and houses would be let locally, since the size of individual contracts
would be too small to attract international bids. Local procurement of
goods and services would be in accordance with the Government's procedures
for such procurement, which permit sufficient internal competition.
16.       To broaden the range of agricultural projects likely to be
suitable for external financing, it is also proposed to provide funds
under this Credit for the retention of consultants who would review a
short list of possible agricultural projects and would then prepare in
detail those considered by the Association and the Government to be the
most promising.

PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUIENTS AiD AUTHORITY
17.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Association
and the Republic of Uganda, the recommendation of the Committee provided
for in Article V, Section l(d),of the Articles of Agreement and the text
of a Resolution approving the proposed development credit are being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
18.       The provisions of the draft Development Credit Agreement
generally conform to the pattern established for Bank and Association
agricultural projects.
PART V - THF ECONOiwY
19.       A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Ugandalt (AE-2) was distributed to the Executive Directors on June 24, 1969
(R69-145). An up-dated statement of Basic Data is annexed.
20.       During the two years 1967-68 the growth of Uganda's economy
slowed down owing to lower output of coffee and cotton, the two major
crops. This was largely the result of adverse weather, although in the
case of cotton the shortfall may be partly attributed to the discontinua-
tion in 1966 of the policy of subsidizing the producer price. The
importance of coffee and cotton in the economy is such that, despite the
rapid strides made by other crops such as tea, sugar and tobacco, a sub-
stantial increase in the output of manufacturing,and satisfactory growth
of the other sectors with the exception of commerce, the gross domestic
product increased during 1967-68 at the rate of only 3.4 percent a year.
21.       In 1969, however, there was a considerable improvement.   Favorable
weather towards the end of 1968 was responsible for a substantial increase
in the output of coffee and cotton. Coffee production was more than twice
the output of the previous year, while cotton output increased by nearly
20 percent. There was a further increase in the output of tea, sugar and
tobacco. These developments, combined with a steady growth in the output
of the other sectors, led to an estimated increase in GDP in real terms
of over 12 percent in 1969. In addition to the substantial increase in
the output of various crops there have been increases in the average
price for coffee (following the frost in Brazil) and for tea (as a result
of lower exports from India). These favorable developments may well
extend through 1970; the outlook for coffee is expected to remain good
until about 1973/74.
22.       Uganda's Second Five-Year Plan began on July 1, 1966, and is
now nearing the end of its fourth year. The Plan got off to a slow start,
but there is now evidence of some improvement. Central Government



- 7 -
development expenditure rose from Sh. 230 million in 1966/67 to Sh. 340
million in 1968/69 and it is likely to be even higher in 1969/70. However,
while Uganda's ability to prepare and execute projects has improved, it
is facing increasing difficulties in financing the program, and in par-
ticular in financing local expenditures. Although the major proportion
of development expenditure during the Plan will be financed from domestic
resources, mainly recurrent budget surpluses and borrowing, the total
volume of investment will substantially exceed domestic savings so that
development needs to be assisted by a sustained capital infloaw from abroad.
The foreign exchange component of public sector projects included in the
Plan which are likely to attract external financing falls substantially
short of the capital inflow required from abroad. In these special cir-
cumstances, and recognizing the importance of the proposed project, I
consider that the financing of local expenditure which is proposed for
this project is justifiable.
23.       In May this year the Government announced its intention to
acquire up to 60 percent shareholding in all banks, insurance, oil, bus,
and major manufacturing companies, and in agricultural estates. Repre-
sentatives of the Bank and IFC who visited Uganda recently to discuss this
new policy report that the Government desires to settle the question of
compensation as amicably and as speedily as possible, largely by nego-
tiating with each company on an individual basis, and has already started
consultations with some of them. In view of this, I do not consider that
the recent measures in Uganda should deter action on the proposed credit.
I shall, however, follow the development in this respect closely and shall
present to the Executive Directors further proposals for lending to Uganda
only if satisfactory progress can be observed in making arrangements for
compensating those affected by the recent measures.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
24.       I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VII - RECOMMEDATION
25.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Development Credit.
