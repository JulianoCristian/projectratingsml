I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country and sector background

1.1.1. Bhutan is a small landlocked economy with growth driven by hydropower and donor support.
Annual per capita gross domestic product (GDP) was Nu 42, 983.6 (US$720) in 2004.

1.1.2. The public sector (the preferred employer in Bhutan) could not absorb the increasing number of
graduates and school dropouts entering the labor market every year. Private sector, considered the “engine
for growth”, played a limited role in the economy with nascent entrepreneurship and several constraints
faced by private investors. The Royal Government of Bhutan (RGOB) embarked on a two-pronged
strategy for private sector development (PSD): (i) improving the investment climate through policy and
institutional reform (ii) encouraging “niche” sectors as sources of growth and employment generation.

1.1.3. Information and communications technology (ICT) was considered one such “niche” sector. ICT
could provide areas of new business and employment opportunities for all Bhutanese through a multiplier
effect on employment generation. Bhutan was also considered as a potential Information
Technology/Information Technology Enabled Services (IT/ITES) location considering (i) Bhutan’s close
ties with India – one of the biggest country players in the offshoring of IT/ITES globally, (ii) Bhutan’s
attractiveness (stability, security, scenery) and (iii) anticipated growth of local businesses.

1.1.4. Weak financial sector was also identified as a constraint to PSD. Bhutan’s financial sector was
highly liquid with limited private investment and high interest rate spread. The payment system was
characterized by heavy use of cash and paper-based instruments which decoupled transaction costs in a
mountainous country with limited transportation infrastructure. Underdeveloped IT infrastructure and
unbalanced IT development in financial institutions constrained commercial and financial transactions.
The financial sector was at a rudimentary stage of electronic-payment services.

Rationale for Bank assistance

1.1.5. RGOB approached the World Bank to assist its strategy of private sector-led economic growth. One
pillar of the Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS 2006-2009) was “promoting private sector
development and employment”. The Bank’s value-added in the proposed project was based on:
(i) its global experience in the ICT sector, including in development of IT Parks, and in financial sector
     development, which allowed the Bank to share best practices from other countries and projects
(ii) its ability to catalyze interest from international players through its involvement in the project, which
     could facilitate the development of the proposed IT Park
(iii) its complementary operations in supporting Bhutan’s private sector such as the Development Policy
     Grant dialogue in the area of investment climate and PSD growth.

1.1.6. The project responded to the priorities highlighted in the RGOB’s Ninth Five-Year Development
Plan (2002-2008), and the Bhutan CAS: “creating employment opportunities through PSD”.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators




                                                      1
1.2.1. The objective of the project was to increase productive employment in Bhutan through the
following intermediate results: promotion of enterprise development in the IT and ITES sector, enhanced
IT skills, and improved access to finance.

Key indicators

1.2.2. The PDO outcome indicator as stated in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) was “Cumulative
job creation in the IT/ITES Sector supported by the project” with an end target of 700.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators

1.3.1. The PDO remained unchanged throughout the project. The scope of the PDO outcome indicator
was revised to “Cumulative job creation in the IT/ITES Sector in the IT Park and related activities”
following a Level 2 restructuring of the project in December 2010. This was because the Mid-Term
Review (MTR) mission showed that the project had generated jobs across sectors directly as a result of
training supported through the project. The target values remained unchanged.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

1.4.1 The PAD did not explicitly define the beneficiaries. Based on the outcome indicators, it is
inferred that the main beneficiaries include: firms, especially tenants and incubatees of the IT Park;
IT/ITES sector employees; IT/ITES students; banks; and users of ATMs. Also the overall economy would
benefit from financial infrastructure development and policy reforms.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

1.5.1 The project had three components: (i) Development of IT/ITES Sector; (ii) Development of
IT/ITES Skills Program; (iii) Strengthening the Financial Sector through IT use.

1.5.2  Table 1 provides a descriptive summary of the original components and activities, intermediate
outcome (IO) indicators, and a breakdown of the costs. See Table 2 in Annex 2 for further details.

1.6 Revised Components

2010 Restructuring:
1.6.1. Following a restructuring request by RGOB in December 2010 (after the MTR mission),
component 3 was restructured to accommodate the financial inclusion agenda under the project. Nu
29.8m (US$ 500,000) of available component 3 funds was reallocated to fund two new activities:
(i) Upgrading of the IT infrastructure of the Royal Securities Exchange of Bhutan Limited (RSEBL);
(ii) Financial inclusion to support the Royal Monetary Authority (RMA) in providing an enabling
regulatory framework and promoting financial literacy (see Table 2 in Annex 2).

1.6.2. The following activities were implemented outside the project: (i) technical assistance to develop a
financial sector IT development strategic plan, co-funded by the International Finance Corporation (IFC),
was completed in January 2009; (ii) inter-bank electronic fund transfer clearing system (EFTCS), was
implemented separately with bilateral assistance from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

1.6.3. Though the overall grant allocation remained unchanged, Nu. 17.9m (US$300,000) was reallocated
from component 3 to component 1 to contribute to funding the Nu 26.9m (US$450,000) undergrounding
of one kilometer of a high voltage (HV) overhead transmission line over the IT Park. The power line was
identified as a hazard. Also, rerouting was necessary as the power line passed by the edge of the IT
building, and rerouting helped comply with Bhutanese regulations that do not allow residential or
commercial buildings in an 18-meter wide right of way below the lines.

1.6.4. IO indicators of component 3 were revised as follows: (i) “Number of financial transactions by
using ATMs per year” was changed to “Number of financial transactions by using ATMs at Bank of
Bhutan per year”; (ii) “Value of financial transactions by using ATMs per year” and “Volume of fund
transfer transactions among banks channeled through the EFT system per year” were removed because

                                                       3
national payment system was implemented outside the project with RBI ; (iii) Two new IO indicators
were introduced: “Percentage of district coverage for financial literacy campaign” and “Percentage
automation of stock exchange trading, settlement, and delivery with straight through processing”.

2012 Closing Date Extension:
1.6.5. In June 2012, the project extended its closing date to complete the undergrounding of the HV
transmission line. Initially planned to be completed by May 2012, it suffered delays due to technical and
coordination challenges.1 The implementation of some activities (e.g. Financial Literacy Program)
benefited from closing date extension. In addition, using project and foreign exchange savings, 2 RGOB
expanded its incentive programs to first mover tenants of the IT Park. Cofunding support for PSD-related
activities of the National ICT Master Plan also benefitted from the extension.

1.7 Other significant changes

1.7.1. Changes in component 3 and a request from RGOB to simplify implementation arrangements led to
the following institutional modifications: (i) Removal of three covenants of the Financing Agreement
related to the financial sector IT task force, the IT technical working group, and the IT task force on IT
skills development; (ii) Change in the staff composition of the implementation agency of component 3.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

2.1.1. At design, the Bank team drew lessons from the CAS evaluation report of 2005. IFC-SEDF (South
Asia Enterprise Development Facility) also contributed to design by financing two feasibility studies: (i)
Industrial Estates and (ii) IT Park and Distance Learning Centers.

2.1.2. Project components were designed to facilitate the achievement of the development objective of
increasing productive employment. The proposed interventions were complementary and maximized
synergies. Component 2 focused on development of skills (in collaboration with international and private
organizations) to ensure availability of a stream of trained IT manpower as a pre-requisite for the success
and sustainability of the proposed IT Park. The design team proposed the development of the IT Park
under component 1 (despite cautionary assessments in the IT Park and Distance Learning Centers’
feasibility study) because it was aligned with national priorities, emerged from stakeholder consultations,
took into account international experiences with IT Parks, and aimed at approaching IT/ITES sector
development in a dynamic and flexible manner thereby leading to increased efficiencies in other domestic
industries. Also component 3 was designed to solve the operational inefficiencies that hampered PSD in
the country through ICT development in the financial sector. In a nutshell, project activities targeted both
the supply side (through components 2 and 3) and the demand side (through component 1).

2.1.3. The design team undertook a thorough risk assessment. The PAD rated risks to project success as
substantial. Skills gap was identified as a moderate risk at design stage. During implementation, the
Ministry of Labor and Human Resources (MOLHR) stepped in to provide employees with the specialized
training required by private firms (including tenants).3 Another risk identified in the PAD was internet

1
   This was the first undergrounding undertaken by Bhutan Power Corporation (BPC). BPC faced challenges in meeting
international safety and safeguard measures. In addition an unforeseen landslide in early 2012 required the construction of a
retaining wall and adversely impacted the timelines. Parallel road expansion works financed by RGOB also impacted the works.
2
  In June 2012, project’s savings were about Nu. 26m (US$ 437,865). Savings from exchange rate differentials were about Nu.
17m (US$284,322).
3
   Initial industry assessments (with Genpact and Infosys) revealed that few students had the skills needed in the IT/ITES sector.
The first occupant of the IT Park stopped its operations in November 2012 due to factors that included skills gaps of employees.

                                                                4
connectivity infrastructure not being up to international standards. Domestic and international competition
was expected to bring down connectivity costs and RGOB committed to bearing the differential cost
between the leased line rates for IT Park tenants and prevailing regional rates through the “Letter of
Sector Policy” in April 2007. Though this demonstrated RGOB’s commitment to the success of the
project, it did not solve the underlying issue. Internet connectivity to date remains a risk to the long term
success of the project. Today RGOB is providing subsidies to the IT Park occupants (see Annex 2, Box
3), for an initial period of 3 years, and concerted efforts to reduce connectivity costs continue. 4

2.1.4. Apart from the connectivity issue, mitigating measures identified at design stage helped overcome
most challenges faced during implementation:
(i) The potential failure to attract reputable IT infrastructure developers to Bhutan (evaluated as high risk).
Indeed, during implementation, only one eligible bid from a private developer (Thimphu Tech Park Ltd –
TTPL) was received for the IT Park. Mitigating actions proposed at design stage, such as IT promotion
activities led by RGOB and allotment of appropriate land, helped seal the deal with the private developer;
(ii) The cross sectorial nature of the project, and the unsatisfactory IT system upgrade and usage leading
to operational inefficiency in financial institutions, were considered as moderate risks though they did not
materialize. The various task forces, coordination committees and investment promotion activities that
involved several government agencies and stakeholders mitigated these risks. They helped attract
stakeholders’ interests and obtain their commitment to project success.

2.2 Implementation

2.2.1. Project implementation was rated satisfactory since effectiveness, except for a one time downgrade
to moderately satisfactory due to a disbursement lag in June 2011. Components did not progress at the
same speed due to (largely unanticipated) implementation and institutional challenges.

The global financial crisis affected the outlook for component 1
2.2.2. The 2008 financial crisis adversely affected private participation in infrastructure and enclave
projects globally. Several potential investors became reluctant to participate in the tender for the IT Park.
Nonetheless, the IT/ITES investment promotion activities led to successful contract signing with TTPL.

2.2.3. Despite signing MOUs to locate in Bhutan in 2009 and 2011, as a second wave of global economic
slowdown affected IT firms in 2011, Genpact and Wipro put in abeyance their plans to locate in Bhutan.
They were losing voice based business to the Philippines and existing clients were reducing their IT
spending. This led to inventory of unutilized spaces in these firms’ offshore facilities and their employees
were being laid off. In this scenario, they became less enthusiastic to expand into Bhutan.

Internet connectivity adversely impacted results of component 1
2.2.4. Internet connectivity issues (lack of redundancy of the communications networks and high
bandwidth prices) led a large foreign investor to decide against starting operations in Bhutan. RGOB
deployed efforts throughout the project to reduce connectivity prices and increase quality (see Annex 2,
Box 2). But even after start of operations in 2012, quality of connectivity has continued to affect
occupants of the IT Park. Shaun Communication (the first occupant) temporarily stopped its operations in
the IT Park and later changed its telecom operator due to quality issues. By project’s closing date, prices
have reduced significantly in 2013 but are still not at par with the region. RGOB pays the price difference
to IT Park occupants.


4
  Telecom subsidy was provided for an initial 3 years in 2011 but this timeline commenced when IT park occupants started
operations in 2012-13. According to RGOB, the draft telecom and broadband policy could lead to further liberalization of the
sector; and the third international gateway (currently underway) will improve telecom infrastructure and provide redundancy.

                                                             5
Innovative skills development partnerships for component 2
2.2.5. Component 2 accelerated after a program manager was appointed in August 2008. Implementation
revealed that Royal University of Bhutan (RUB) alone might not be the natural champion for the
employment program, especially since MOLHR had been given this mandate following the 2008
elections. After an agreement signed in October 2009 between RUB and MOLHR, implementation of the
employment programs under the project - Graduate Training Program (GTP) and Employment Training
Program (ETP) - progressed well. The inclusion of MOLHR as an implementation agency proved
judicious, as the pool of Class X and Class XII (high school graduates) unemployed Bhutanese turned out
to be even bigger than tertiary educated graduates.

MTR triggered a level-2 restructuring with change in scope of component 3
2.2.6. The Level 2 restructuring proved instrumental to project’s successes. The beneficiaries of the
training were absorbed by various sectors of the economy and by ITES companies outside Bhutan. 5 The
supply side was built up while the demand side was affected by the delayed construction of the IT Park.
The restructuring ensured that the project achieved its development objective by appropriately capturing
all jobs generated through the project whether in the IT/ITES sector or in other sectors.

Closing date extension
2.2.7. Completion of the IT Park took more time than expected mainly because of:
(i) Delays in the undergrounding of the HV (66kV) power lines (see paragraph 1.6.5). As a result some
advances earmarked for this activity remained unused and triggered audit qualifications in 2011/2012.6
(ii) Operational challenges. Additional infrastructure services (water supply requirements and access road
expansion) were required. In addition, investment climate challenges (access to construction materials,
labor, specialized skills, construction machinery), force majeure events (exceptionally difficult ground
conditions and inclement weather) and project management challenges 7 led the private developer to
request an extension for the completion of construction from September 2011 to April 2012.

2.2.8. Due to these implementation delays, the project’s closing date was extended from June 2012 to
June 2013. Several activities benefitted from this change in closing date (see paragraph 1.6.5).

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

2.3.1. The PDO Outcome Indicator aimed to measure evidence of employment generation in the
IT/ITES sector through the project and was clearly linked to the PDO. 8 After MTR, it was appropriately
revised to include jobs across sectors, which were created directly as a result of the project’s training




5
  There were some clear linkages that worked well between project components, e.g. the investment promotion activities of
component 1 generated the industry linkage programs with Infosys, Genpact and Wipro of component 2. Towards the end of the
project, employment incentive program of component 2 was offered as an incentive for future IT Park tenants (see Annex 2).
6
  All related outstanding payments were eventually settled before June 2013.
7
  Because of the need to import all material, actual costs of construction were higher than India by about 50 percent. Labor issues
included difficulty to obtain labor permits, labor unrest, thefts, vandalism, delays of transportation of material due to road
conditions, weather and strikes, delays in clearance of material and equipment for imports, vendor refusals to supply equipment.
Difficult terrain, inclement weather conditions, unfavorable geological conditions, led to midway redesign of construction. All
these challenges reportedly created cost overruns for the private partner of 25 percent against initial budget.
8
  The initial PDO Outcome Indicator had two definitions in the PAD: (i) the key performance indicator and results framework
defined the job creation in the IT/ITES sector supported by the project without restriction to the IT Park; (ii) the arrangements for
results monitoring in PAD Annex 3 restricted the measure to cumulative job creation in the IT/ITES sector in the IT Park. The
task team clarified that the latter was an oversight, and the task team and the Government always used the former definition.

                                                                 6
programs: “Cumulative job creation in the IT/ITES Sector in the IT Park and related activities”. 9 Despite
the broadened scope of the PDO outcome indicator, the end-target of 700 jobs remained unchanged (see
paragraph 1.3.1). The revised PDO outcome indicator was achieved before the IT Park was completed.

2.3.2. All three components were interrelated to achieve the PDO (see paragraph 2.1.2) and had
defined outputs with a set of specific IO indicators related to each component. Each IO indicator had
baseline values and quantitative targets established. Most IO indicators were clearly defined.10

2.3.3. Most IO indicators were directly linked to the achievement of the PDO outcome indicator of
employment generation. The three IO indicators of component 1 stimulated the demand side through
investment leads; firm incubation; and IT park occupancy. The IO indicators of component 2 and
component 3 promoted the supply side. In component 2, competency assessments and conversion rate
from training to employment monitored the efficiency of the training provided and adequacy of skills
developed for employment. The IO indicators of component 3 were less directly linked to employment
generation; nonetheless increased ATM transactions and automation of the stock exchange indicated
improved efficiency of financial infrastructure for private sector operations; while higher financial
literacy captured improved awareness and capability to efficiently use the financial sector for PSD.

    2.3.4. The Project Implementation Agency (PIA) had dedicated full-time staff responsible for M&E.
    Data was regularly collected from the various Implementation Agencies (IAs) including RUB, MOLHR
    and RMA. All IAs coordinated well on M&E. The implementation support missions conducted regular
    M&E of the results and intermediate indicators.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Social and Environment

2.4.1. The project was classified as a Category B project at appraisal. The safeguard policy on
Environmental Assessment (OP/BP/GP 4.01) was triggered. Nonetheless, unlike the typical process
followed in OP 4.01, the Environmental Assessment (EA) and Environmental Management Plan (EMP)
for the IT Park was expected to be completed after Board approval of the project when the private
developer would be selected and the layout and design of the IT Park infrastructure would be completed.

2.4.2. In compliance with this exceptional decision relating to the application of OP/BP/GP 4.01, a
comprehensive EA and EMP was prepared by the private developer and approved by the National
Environment Commission of Bhutan and the Bank in late 2009. The EA confirmed that negative
environmental and social impacts of the IT facility were to be very small, and such impacts would
largely be limited to the construction phase of the IT Park. The EMP defined measures to reduce and
manage potential construction and operational phase related impacts through noise and traffic
management, labor management, solid waste and soil erosion management, management of occupation
health and safety related impacts. Implementation of EMP was adequately monitored during the project.

2.4.3. At MTR, with the undergrounding of the 66kV HV transmission line, the project’s safeguards
category remained Category B. New enabling works were not expected to cause significant

9
  The PDO indicator was measured by counting all new jobs created as a result of project’s activities and which would not have
been created otherwise. For jobs created through the training programs and recruitment drives, employment was tracked within 6
months post-training and changes such as attrition/mobility in employment were not tracked.
10
   The IO indicator on “Number of companies successfully incubated in the IT Park” was initially misinterpreted to represent the
number of incubatees graduating from the IT Park’s incubation center. The IO indicator actually represented the number of
incubatees in the incubation center of the IT Park and this clarification was provided during implementation support missions.

                                                               7
environmental or social impacts. The EMP for the undergrounding specified actions for management of
environmental impacts. Its implementation was adequately monitored during the construction period by
the National Environment Commission and Bank missions.

2.4.4. The project performance on environmental and social safeguards is rated Satisfactory. The project
adequately complied with OP/BP/GP 4.01 and safeguard policies of RGOB. RGOB’s EA policies were
compatible with OP/BP/GP 4.0 and satisfactorily applied international standards.

Procurement

2.4.5. Most of the issues and risks concerning the procurement component for implementation of the
project were assessed at the time of appraisal and the complex procurement issues covering the IT Park,
under a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model, was planned to be closely monitored during
implementation. The procurement capacity assessment at appraisal concluded that the knowledge gap of
the dedicated project staff responsible for procurement was small and could be bridged by training.

2.4.6. The procurement procedure complied with Bank’s Procurement and Consultant Guidelines. No
major procurement issues occurred during project implementation. Procurement post reviews did not
highlight any major deviations from agreed procedures for the project. Procurements were conducted in a
timely manner except for undergrounding of HV transmission line, which was slightly delayed by BPC.

2.4.7. The procurement capacity and PIA performance was Satisfactory throughout the project. Record
Keeping/Filing of procurement records was identified as an area that needed to be strengthened.

Financial management

2.4.8. The Financial Management (FM) performance was Satisfactory throughout the project.

2.4.9. Designated Account advances based on six months expenditure forecast provided required funds
for the project. The funds from the Designated Account were distributed to various implementing
agencies to incur expenditure for their respective activities.

2.4.10. The involvement of several IAs occasionally posed challenge in obtaining project information and
resolving open items. The PIA ultimately satisfactorily resolved all FM issues. The submission of the
quarterly IUFRs was mostly on time. Currently there are no overdue audit reports under the project. The
next audit report for the financial year 2012-13 will become due on December 31, 2013.

2.4.11. Use of country financial management systems worked well. As the country’s public FM systems
are being strengthened (through Bank support and others), the FM capacity is also improving.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

2.5.1. RGOB set up several continuity arrangements for each component of the project to ensure
sustainability of project activities: (i) the PIA was embedded in Ministry of Information and
Communications (MOIC) as the PSD Section under Department of Information Technology & Telecom
(DITT); (ii) new courses developed under the project (academic skills, analytical skills, entrepreneurship)
were mainstreamed and institutionalized by RUB within the college system; (iii) the Human Resource
Development Division of MOLHR took forward the skills development initiatives under the project as a
part of MOLHR’s skills development program 11 in sectors such as ICT, health, arts and craft, and

11
     The programs are now “placement oriented” rather than “training oriented”.

                                                                 8
hospitality; (iv) recruitment drives under the project were carried out by the Department of Employment
of MOLHR; (v) Financial Inclusion Policy and financial literacy implementation were assigned to three
RMA staff under the Financial Regulation and Supervision Department; (vi) automation of RSEBL and
of Bank of Bhutan (BOB) operations is mainstreamed within RSEBL and BOB respectively.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

3.1.1. With the economy still reliant on the hydropower sector and donor grants, PSD remains a priority
in Bhutan’s Eleventh Five Year Plan (11FYP) for 2013-2018. As part of its focus on green accelerated
economic development, the 11FYP aims to diversify the economy to non-hydro sectors for import-
substitution and export promotion, and create employment opportunities in particular for the youth.

3.1.2. The project’s objectives were relevant at inception and remain relevant today. The 11FYP
highlights RGOB’s focus on resolving underemployment and quality of employment. Youth
unemployment was estimated as 7.3 percent in 2012 and RGOB’s target is to reduce it to 2.5 percent in
2018. The PDO is also well related to the current (FY 2011-14) Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). The
PSD project responds to the country’s development objectives of (i) leveraging private sector
participation for strategic infrastructure and (ii) improved efficiency of and access to financial services.
Hence the relevance of objectives, design, and implementation is High.

3.1.3. The components of the project remain relevant to the country’s development priorities today.
Availability of a stream of trained IT manpower is critical to develop communication infrastructure in
Bhutan. Use of IT for enhanced financial sector efficiency and financial inclusion are important
considering RGOB’s concern to provide access to finance to some sectors through priority sector lending.
The newly elected Prime Minister appears committed to the IT Park. His first business visit was to
Hyderabad where he met officials of Infosys and Microsoft to discuss possibilities of collaboration and
where he emphasized the value that Bhutan offers to global IT companies’ critical operations.12

Choice of ICT sector:
3.1.4. At design stage, ICT and more particularly the ITES sector was selected as focus area due to its
potential for employment, innovations, higher learning elasticities, and positive externalities. This was a
joint decision made by RGOB, the Bank and other stakeholders, and took into account feasibility studies.

3.1.5. The project’s focus on PSD and ITES sector was in hindsight a step in the right direction with
RGOB’s commitment to enhance the use of ICT, including mobile technology, to reduce bureaucratic
processes and turn-around-time for public service delivery. The project also piloted innovations relevant
to non-ICT sectors (e.g. PPPs, private sector-led training and employment, incubation center).

3.1.6. Today the ICT sector is prominently mentioned in the 11FYP in developing the communications
infrastructure, including fiber optic network, national data center, and government intranet system. The
Economic Development Policy (2010) identified ICT as a priority: “The transformation of the traditional
Bhutanese society into a knowledge based society and the development of high end service industry shall
be enabled by ICT. In so doing, the Royal Government shall endeavor to make Bhutan an attractive
destination for FDI in R&D, data processing and high end BPOs through a highly skilled talent pool.”




12
     See media coverage at: http://www.kuenselonline.com/bhutan-is-open-to-business-pm/

                                                               9
3.1.7. To achieve its full job creation potential, the ICT sector requires good internet connectivity and
availability of a critical mass of technically qualified talent pool, which remain two areas for
improvement as evidenced during project implementation.

Inclusion of Financial Sector Component:
3.1.8. The financial sector activities under component 3 were included in a project titled “Private Sector
Development” whose objective is productive employment. A strong financial sector is essential to
improve the “horizontal” investment climate, which benefits all private sector firms, and in turn supports
productive employment. Also, it is common in small land-locked country projects (and small IDA
envelopes) to combine private sector and financial sector activities into one project, thus reducing the
transaction cost to the country. Given these aspects, inclusion of financial sector component in the project
is deemed appropriate. Through this component, the financial sector payment infrastructure was
modernized to service increased number of transactions, stock market efficiency increased, and draft
regulations on access to finance provided regulatory framework to fund private sector investments.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

3.2.1. The PDO was to increase productive employment in Bhutan through the following intermediate
results: promotion of enterprise development in the IT and ITES sector, enhanced IT skills, and improved
access to finance. The PDO was largely achieved and its efficacy rating is High. Through the training and
infrastructure provided under the project, 1,015 value added jobs (exceeding the target of 700) were
created for young Bhutanese, of which 205 (20 percent) were located in the IT Park as of September
2013. On a national scale, this represents almost 15 percent of the total unemployed in Bhutan in 2012,
and almost 21 percent of the unemployed who attended a school or institute in 2007 (at the start of the
project). 13 Most of those employed were between 19 to 24 years old, with equal representation between
young men and women from across Bhutan’s 20 districts, and the jobs created by the project represent 29
percent of total youth unemployment. 14

3.2.2. Expectation mismatch: There was some negative press about the project in the media during the
latter stages of project implementation; 15 even though the project’s outcome indicator and all intermediate
outcome targets (except one related to IT Park occupancy) were met or exceeded. IT promotional
activities (roadshows) carried out under the project set high expectations of IT Park, which (being the
visible infrastructure part of the project) was incorrectly equated to being the whole project. The
roadshows highlighted Bhutan as an emerging ICT destination and MOUs were signed between global IT
companies and RGOB; however, external factors (including the global economic slowdown) made these
IT companies revisit their plans to locate in the IT Park as (anchor) tenants. This created unmet
expectations reflected in the press.

3.2.3. The achievements of the intermediate outcomes directly affected the PDO as they were designed
to lead to creation of productive employment (see paragraph 2.3.3). They were as follows:

(i) Development of the IT/ITES sector in Bhutan through attracting IT/ITES firms in the IT Park, and
increase in the private investment in the IT/ITES sector. This intermediate objective was partially
achieved as of closing date. The IT Park is the first economic zone in Bhutan built with public/private
investments and fully operated by the private sector. As of September 2013, it hosts one international
tenant occupying 25 percent of the commercial space of the Park and employing 170 young Bhutanese of
whom 57 percent are women. 75 percent of the space of the Park remains empty though advanced

   Total jobs facilitated through the project represents 59 percent of unemployed youth (age 15 to 24) in urban areas in 2012.
15
   For instance, there were occasional media references to the IT Park as being a “white elephant”.

                                                                10
discussions are ongoing with potential tenants. Among them is Shaun Communication, currently renting
out space in the BITC for its 27 employees, which has committed to occupy 25 percent of the commercial
space through signature of a tenancy contract in early 2013. The IT Park also hosts the first incubation
center in Bhutan to promote micro and small enterprise development/innovation through the Bhutan
Innovation and Technology Center (BITC). Three ventures out of thirteen (five physical, eight virtual)
have graduated from BITC; not all are in the IT/ITES sector as BITC targets a larger set of entrepreneurs.
BITC also has a shared technology center and a datacenter currently hosting three local clients.

(ii) Availability of a stream of trained IT manpower to support the development of the IT/ITES Sector.
This intermediate objective was achieved. The project pioneered private sector-relevant skills
development programs leading to the creation of new jobs. These training and employment programs
directly undertaken by potential investors who paid part of the training costs, decreased the cost to RGOB
of employment generation and allowed skills development customized to industry needs. 873 new jobs
(of whom 428 male and 445 female) were created following the training of 1372 Bhutanese under the
programs and this cost RGOB around Nu 65.7k (US$1,100) per job, which is reportedly four times below
regional averages (see Annex 2). This successful model is now being replicated by MOLHR to implement
training programs in other sectors. In addition, the investment promotion activities of the project
generated interest from global IT/ITES industry players beyond the IT Park. The industry linkage
program and recruitment drives pioneered with Infosys, Genpact and Wipro led to the employment of
more than 100 Bhutanese, and was initiated as a result of the promotional activities aimed at attracting
Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) into Bhutan. RUB also embedded three core curriculum courses
(analytical and technical skills, language enhancement, and entrepreneurship development) at all its 10
colleges, which were provided under the project and designed in consultation with global ITES firms. In
addition, distance learning facilities were provided with the establishment of the Virtual Learning
Environment (VLE) at RUB colleges, providing a richer learning environment for students and also
benefitting lecturers. The set-up of the project’s video conferencing (VC) centers in 5 locations saved
costs and time for staff who would otherwise travel for a week to attend a day’s meeting in Thimphu.

(iii) Gradual growth in IT use by the financial sector to achieve greater efficiency. This intermediate
objective was achieved. The co-financing of financial infrastructure under the Project, combined with the
liberalization of the financial sector, led to an increase in ATM transactions at BOB - which holds about
46 percent of banks ‘assets in 2013 - from 200,000 ATM transactions in 2009 to about 1,360,000 ATM
transactions in 2012. With the IT system upgrade of BOB, BOB’s procedures were modernized and
positioned BOB to fully benefit from the EFTCS. The installation of the Core Banking Solution (CBS) by
the BOB reduced the maximum waiting time for BOB’s clients by 90 percent.16 A next step for further
modernization of the financial infrastructure in Bhutan is to increase the efficiency of the Bhutan financial
switch (launched after the EFTCS) and improve its integration with the global system.

(iv) Upgrading of the IT infrastructure of the stock exchange RSEBL. This intermediate objective was
achieved. RSEBL IT system was launched in April 2012. It has completely integrated six systems which
helped significantly reduce time to process shares, benefiting brokers and investors. Automation led to a
marked increase in transactions in the secondary market for all listed companies (currently numbering 21)
within a month. Automation of the stock exchange improved risk management, market surveillance,
transparency, system robustness, interest from brokers and number of trading days.

(v) Financial inclusion: This intermediate objective was achieved. Increasing awareness, promoting
financial literacy and providing an enabling regulatory framework are building blocks to improve access
to finance and ultimately support entrepreneurship and PSD. The project supported the drafting of the
Financial Inclusion Policy (FIP), and of accompanying regulations (microfinance, e-money) which were

                                                               11
enriched by two outreach missions to Philippines and Kenya in 2012. It contributed to a national financial
literacy campaign using innovative channels (radio and TV) (see Annex 2).

3.3 Efficiency

3.3.1. The PAD included a financial and economic analysis which identified the project’s money inflows
and outflows to and from RGOB (not the private sector developer) for component 1 (IT Park) only. This
analysis indicated that though the project was not financially viable, it was economically viable to
generate employment and increase net exports, yielding an economic net present value (NPV) of US$30.6
million with an economic internal rate of return (IRR) of 125.2% for a period spanning 20 years.

3.3.2. The economic and financial analysis done at design stage has been updated. The analysis was
carried out for the IT Park from the perspective of RGOB + TTPL combined. To facilitate a like-to-like
comparison with the PAD, the updated analysis also looks at just RGOB.

3.3.3. The updated financial analysis based on a discount rate of 10% over 20 years indicates that the IT
Park generates a financial IRR of -0.60% for RGOB + TTPL (and -8.28% for just RGOB) (original PAD
estimated +6.76%). The updated economic analysis indicates that the IT Park yields an economic NPV of
$39.7 million with an economic IRR of 35.20% for RGOB + TTPL (and an economic NPV of US$16.8
million with an economic IRR of 32.43% for just RGOB). This reinforces the conclusion that the project
is economically viable to generate employment and increase net exports.

3.3.4. In conclusion, while the IT Park is marginally financially unattractive at present capacity utilization
rates, it has upside potential should tenancy improve. Also, the project is economically viable as
confirmed by positive economic cost benefit analysis (see Annex 3). Hence the efficacy rating is High.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

3.4.1. The project has achieved its intended outcomes and exceeded most of its targets. Over 1,000 jobs
were created, new infrastructure for the IT/ITES sector was built, IT skills corresponding to business
needs were developed, financial infrastructure was modernized, and financial inclusion was promoted
through the development of the regulatory environment.

3.4.2. The remaining challenges beyond closing date relate to the IT Park which represents one part of
component 1. This component was hit by implementation challenges including external factors (see
section 2.2). Key remaining issues include weak internet connectivity and occupancy in the recently
completed IT Park. There is also a lack of critical mass of technically qualified talent pool due to limited
scale up potential, small size of workforce, skills mismatches, and high labor costs in Bhutan. Several of
these were identified as potential risks at design stage.

3.4.3. In balance, the overall project is rated Satisfactory. This is based on the following:

On the demand side of the PDO
(i) The efforts and progress towards reaching full occupancy of the IT Park, the only IO indicator not met
by closing date. Contractually, the timeline for TTPL to fill up the IT Park is within three years of start of
operations, which is in line with industry standards in economic zones globally. Because of unexpected
delays in the construction of the IT Park, this timeline extends until 2015 (i.e. beyond project’s closing
date). At present occupancy rate (25 percent), the IT Park may still be able to achieve 100 percent
occupancy in line with the contract. Higher IT Park occupancy will increase project’s viability as

                                                      12
demonstrated in the economic analysis. In addition the socio economic impact assessment (SEIA)
estimates several anticipated positive impacts for the community (see Annex 5). The efforts to fill the IT
Park are continuing, targeting also medium-sized ITES firms. Tenancy deals with domestic firms are also
under discussion and if they materialize they would provide a more sustainable mix of tenants to the IT
Park - since domestic firms are expected to be less exposed to global turmoil in the industry.

(ii) The commitment and support from RGOB and several stakeholders: RGOB remains committed to the
project as evidenced consistently throughout the project and even after its closing date. RGOB’s financial
contribution leveraged significant investment from the private sector, notably for the IT Park, with Nu
300m (US$5m) investment from TTPL. The IT association has also expressed full support to the IT Park.

(iii) The efforts and progress in resolving connectivity issues: RGOB continues efforts to provide
connectivity at par with the region, while providing subsidies to IT Park occupants in the meantime. As of
June 2013, prices of international bandwidth have fallen by 70 percent, due to negotiations (largely
triggered by the project) between Bhutanese and Indian telecom operators. The second international
connectivity gateway at the Indian border, in Gelephu, was completed in April 2011.

(iv) The success of BITC and its potential for further growth: BITC has considerable growth potential in a
country where 57 percent of industries were classified as cottage in 2011. 17 Following the considerable
interest generated by the microwork workshop provided under the project, BITC expects to incubate a
number of future microwork entrepreneurs in its premises or virtually. Over time, BITC intends to
become a hub of entrepreneurship and innovation in Bhutan (see Annex 2).

On the supply side of the PDO
(v) The skills developed under the project that would be useful for an IT/ITES firm but also for any
business in Bhutan (local or foreign): Even though scale remains a challenge in Bhutan, the majority of
youth that benefitted from the project’s trainings expressed that they gained significant professional skills
- beyond IT skills - with the trainings. These included communication, analytical and presentation skills;
and their confidence and self-esteem have also considerably improved (see Annex 5).These youth trained
through public private partnerships included tertiary as well as class X and XII graduates.

On the overarching outcomes of the project and its positive spillovers
(vi) The project generated several positive spillovers as detailed in the next section.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

3.5.1. As noted in the PAD, the impact of the ICT sector is gender-sensitive. As of September 2013, 1372
secondary education (class X and class XII) graduates were trained, of whom 52 percent were female. 873
candidates – of whom 50 percent were female – obtained a job in ITES companies and in various sectors
of the Bhutanese economy (see Annex 2). Most Bhutanese employed with support from the project are
between 19 and 24 years old and come from across Bhutan’s 20 districts.

3.5.2. A socio economic impact assessment (SEIA) was carried out in two phases during project
implementation, in accordance with the Financing Agreement. For the impact assessment a survey of a
sample of respondents from each beneficiary category was conducted. A summary of the social
development impacts of the project is provided in section 3.6 and in Annex 5.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

3.5.3. The broader mandate of the project (beyond the PDO) was to develop the country’s private sector.18
The project has contributed to this higher level objective in several ways:

(i) Trigger for policy reforms: Several investment climate reforms were triggered by the IT Park tender
process and by the project including: (i) amended FDI policy, (ii) economic development policy, (iii)
draft PPP policy, (iv) draft telecom policy, (v) draft FIP and related regulations on access to finance (such
as e-money issuers regulation, and deposit taking microfinance institutions regulations), (vi) National ICT
masterplan and related regulations on ICT. The fast-tracking of the clearances and the establishment of
the single window agency for the IT Park also started to instill the one stop shop culture to improve
business environment. These reforms in business environment would help alleviate some reported
negative perceptions of foreign investors in Bhutan notably on distance, scale, and talent pool.

(ii) Capacity building in PPPs: As the first PPP in Bhutan, the IT Park helped develop in-country
capacity on PPP arrangements. It also provided several lessons learned such as on the use of the tendering
documentation and process, which would be useful for similar projects, such as the RGOB’s forthcoming
Education City project. This first experience has enhanced RGOB’s experience in attracting private
investments (both foreign and local) in serviced land and strategic infrastructure projects in Bhutan.

(iii) New private sector-led training models: The training provided by MOLHR was the first to directly
link academia and business in Bhutan. It has changed the strategic direction of vocational training adopted
by RGOB in other sectors (e.g. tourism, construction).

(iv) Capacity development of local IT private sector (including local IT training firms) (see Annex 2, Box
4): Consultations with local firms and the chamber of commerce throughout the project helped build
private sector capacity. Domestic firms were encouraged to form joint-ventures with foreign bidders. 19
Feedback from the IT private sector association (BICTTA) on their non-participation as IT Park tenants
included the high rental costs and their requests to obtain the special incentives which only export-
oriented tenants in the IT Park receive. BICTTA was however encouraged to evolve to play a similar role
to that played by the Indian IT association in the meteoric development of the Indian IT/ITES industry.

(v) Coordination mechanism between Government, private sector and academia: The project initiated and
sustained national and international relationships between Government, private sector and academia.
Bhutanese government agencies and private sector participated in the project with external companies
(such as Infosys and Genpact) and the University of Colombo in Sri Lanka (for the VLE). Coordination
between government agencies was seamless during the project (see paragraph 5.2.2).

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

3.5.4. The implementation of the project generated several positive spillovers in the ICT sector. The
project kick started the “ICT mindset” among Bhutanese firms and entrepreneurs. It helped change
Bhutanese mindsets towards FDI, through demonstration. Investment promotion and skills development
programs highlighted Bhutan’s value proposition as an IT services investment location including its
“green” brand name, reliable/low cost access to power, stable environment, English language skills of
Bhutanese graduates and low attrition rates of Bhutanese manpower.

18
   Although this cannot be attributed solely to the project, the number of industrial establishments in the private sector has
increased in absolute value from 26,261 in 2007 to 34,692 in 2011. Source: RGOB Statistical Yearbook of Bhutan, 2012
19
   Out of 7474 firms, only 22 were joint-ventures between foreigners and Bhutanese (2010 Establishment Census by MOLHR).

                                                             14
3.5.5. In addition, new concepts in employment creation are being explored through the project’s
activities. These include the entrepreneurship training program, BITC, and microwork. Self-employment
and entrepreneurship are now increasingly considered as viable alternatives to public sector jobs.


3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

3.6.1. Under the SEIA, a survey using a structured questionnaire to collect mostly quantitative data was
conducted with a sample of respondents from each beneficiary category. Semi-structured questionnaires
and open-ended discussions with the key stakeholders were also conducted.

3.6.2. Key results of the beneficiaries’ survey finalized in June 2013 along with a summary of the key
socio economic benefits and impacts of the project are provided in Annex 5. The SEIA also pointed out
that some impacts will take time to emerge since activities have just been completed. It anticipated
several positive impacts for the community in the future.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

4.1. Risks to the PDO outcome indicator are moderate. A number of factors are expected to contribute to
consolidating and furthering the gains achieved under the project. Most notably RGOB’s commitment to
youth employment and its continued support to PSD, communication infrastructure and the IT Park as
highlighted in the 11FYP. These factors should help maintain and grow the new levels of productive
employment created under the project.

4.2. Because the IT Park accounts for about 48 percent of original project’s costs and is the visible
infrastructure part of the project, success of the project is frequently linked to success of the IT Park.
Filling up the remaining empty space and retaining the two occupants of the IT Park would be crucial for
the long term success of the project. 20 An exit by either would send a negative signal to prospective
tenants and IT/ITES investors, and could also influence the PPP models playing out in Bhutan.
(i) Scan Café: the first tenant of the IT Park operates in the image editing segment and intends to
progressively move its Bangalore operations to Bhutan.
(ii) Shaun Communication: operates in the voice Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) segment. It did
not benefit from support for building its fit outs, and has indicated its difficulty in making the additional
investments needed to move over to the commercial space of the IT Park. This remains a concern.

4.3. One challenge that continues to affect the IT Park is the internet connectivity issue (see paragraph
2.2.4). This could jeopardize current tenancy deals in both IT Park commercial space and BITC.
Negotiations are underway to identify a long term solution for pricing (such as opening the market for
foreign investments and partnerships with an Indian operator at the border).

4.4. Under the PPP model, TTPL has a contractual obligation to fill the IT Park within three years of IT
park’s operations (see paragraph 3.4.3). Some tenancy deals appear to be in the pipeline with domestic
firms. Attracting more firms to BITC and making it financially viable is another objective. Nonetheless,
all actors’ financial positions have weakened due to overruns in cost and time. An objective of TTPL now

20
   Neither occupant agreed to a lock-in period on their lease period in their initial tenancy contracts signed in early 2013.
Nonetheless, as per the FDI policy, FDI companies are constrained to a lock in period of 3 years.


                                                            15
appears to reach a cash flow breakeven position while also servicing its debt. A clear risk to avoid is for
RGOB to be left running the IT Park, as this could signal failure of Bhutan’s first PPP experiment.
Enforcement of the contractual obligations of TTPL could mitigate this risk.

4.5. For component 3 (automation of stock exchange), sustainability might be an issue as this initiative
would need to secure funding in order to operate (see Annex 2).
5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

5.1.1. The project was designed after several rounds of discussions with RGOB dating back to the 2002
Private Sector Survey. The feasibility studies financed by IFC through SEDF, as well as the lessons
learned from earlier operations, were essential for the design of the project. The design team also held
several consultations with RGOB and other stakeholders (including the private sector) during preparation.

5.1.2. In line with RGOB’s priority to solve youth unemployment and promote the private sector as the
“engine for growth”, ICT and in particular IT/ITES emerged as the “niche” sector that would generate
maximum employment in landlocked Bhutan.

5.1.3. Despite the minor shortcomings mentioned elsewhere (see sections 2.1, 2.2.2 and 2.2.4), the need
for relevant IT infrastructure, IT skills and modernized financial infrastructure was well established at
design stage. Hence the “Satisfactory” rating for the overall project quality at entry.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

5.1.4. The World Bank team included experienced staff with expertise in relevant areas, including in
developing IT Parks in other countries; ICT; PPP; and financial sector development. There was also
adequate continuity in the World Bank project team, with a core team member being part of the project
from design to closing date. The TTL changed once, soon after effectiveness.

 5.1.5. The World Bank team conducted regular supervision of the project through: (a) regular supervision
missions from Washington and Delhi; (b) an MTR in 2010; and (c) monthly conference calls between the
PIA, IAs and the World Bank. These calls, set up early in project implementation, were used to resolve
outstanding issues, monitor and assist implementation. They have proven an effective project monitoring
tool and their effectiveness was commended by both RGOB and Bank management.

5.1.6. The World Bank team provided support to the PIA and IAs through the project life. Based on
feedback from RGOB, the team was very responsive and the quality of support provided by the team was
above RGOB’s expectations. The team proactively leveraged other parts of the World Bank Group
throughout the project; including (e.g.) from Global Information and Communication Technologies
(GICT) unit for ICT regulation issues and from the payment unit and financial literacy experts for
component 3. The team also ensured that local private firms were involved through the project.
Implementation support missions always met with the IT association and the chamber of commerce and
also provided advice as solicited which at times went beyond the project’s scope.


                                                    16
5.1.7. Nonetheless, given the lack of experience of RGOB in areas like IT Parks, PPP projects, and
contracting with global investors and tenants, the team could have explored creative ways to do more in:
(i) encouraging transfer of skills and technology from foreign firms to local firms and staff through
activities like networking and training, and (ii) advising the government on a conservative media strategy
so as to better manage the expectations of the public. Some of these activities could have been undertaken
through complementary technical assistance or in coordination with other donors (including IFC).

5.1.8. The team provided timely responses (with occasional delays) to approval requests, e.g. during the
organization of the roadshows and outreach missions which involved several bookings to be made in
advance and required at the same time clearances from several agencies including the Bank. The Aide-
Memoires and Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRs) provide detailed recommendations on
measures to accelerate and improve project implementation. Ratings are well substantiated in all ISRs for
all components. This is endorsed by the IEG “Quality Assessment of ISRs” published in 2013, which
assessed the project and concluded: “The Aide Memoire and the ISRs reflect very well organized and
focused supervision, excellent reporting, and above all, a proactive approach towards challenging
aspects of the operation (…) Reporting is very candid, showing which are the challenges despite the
excellent performance of the project, and the actions that are being pursued to overcome them.”

5.1.9. RGOB’s requests for restructuring and project extension were processed on time and largely
contributed to the project’s successes. Final disbursement ratio was estimated at 99.15 percent. Hence the
“Satisfactory” rating for the overall project quality of supervision.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

5.1.10. The project was well prepared and included a cost benefit analysis for the IT Park. It responded to
the country’s request and benefitted from strong commitment from RGOB. The design was based on
feasibility studies, lessons learnt from earlier operations and active participation from various
stakeholders. More concrete actions to mitigate the connectivity issue could have been provided at design
stage. Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is therefore rated Satisfactory. The team provided
sound advice and implementation support to the counterparts throughout the life of the project,
performing beyond expectations as expressed in client feedback. There was proactive identification of
opportunities and issues facilitated by the monthly conference calls between the team and all IAs.
Reporting was also of excellent quality. Quality of supervision is therefore rated Satisfactory. The overall
rating of Bank Performance is rated Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.1. The performance of RGOB is rated Satisfactory. Even though the project was the first experience of
RGOB in PPP, clean governance, commitment and enthusiasm compensated for any shortcomings.
RGOB provided strong support during the project appraisal and design stages, offered incentives to
stimulate demand, and proactively introduced supportive reforms from project’s effectiveness and
throughout the project cycle (see Annex 2, Box1).

5.2.2. The project was given considerable importance by the RGOB ministries and agencies in charge of
its implementation. Collaboration between ministries during the project was notable. As a result, several

                                                    17
key policy reforms were undertaken and cross-ministerial issues such as land were addressed in a timely
manner. The Ministry of Finance provided timely support for necessary disbursements under the project.

5.2.3. As accurately assessed at appraisal stage, the project required a large number of processes to be
expedited. Committees were formed to ensure rapid processes. The Empowered Task force (ETF) was
established in 2009 via a Cabinet directive to resolve any road blocks for smooth implementation of the
project. The ETF was crucial in resolving issues including those on the ancillary facilities such as delayed
provision of power. Larger issues were raised at the Cabinet and this occurred three times during project
implementation for: decision on land lease duration, tax holiday, and keeping provision for the cost
sharing of training programs. The Program Steering Committee (PSC), established in 2007, met regularly
with the PIA to give necessary policy guidance, review progress and assess performance. An Advisory
Council was set up in 2008 and was instrumental in guiding the IT Park PPP as well as other sector PPPs.

5.2.4. IEG “Quality Assessment of ISRs” in February 2013 concluded: “(…) It also reflects very strong
commitment on the side of the Government, which is evidenced not only by financial resources provided
for the project, but also on proactivity in terms of addressing challenging issues (…)”.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.5. The performance of MOIC/DITT is rated Satisfactory. Experience with Bank projects was low at
the start of the project. However, this issue resolved over time. The PIA actions, including IT promotion
activities and support to IT/ITES firms, were crucial for successful accomplishment of project objectives.

5.2.6. Coordination of IAs was complex. The PIA was diligent in providing high quality Quarterly
Progress Reports and organizing the monthly conference calls.

5.2.7. Some components also suffered from staffing shortages at various periods of implementation. The
RUB component picked up after the Vice Chancellor appointed a project manager. The RMA/BOB
component was managed by RMA staff instead of a dedicated project management team. Nonetheless all
outcomes of component 2 and component 3 were achieved and IO targets were exceeded.

5.2.8. The PIA suffered from lack of business analysis expertise at the start of the project but later
benefited from the support of the Bank team and the consultants hired by the project. External
communications to the media could have also been handled more proactively (see paragraph 3.2.2).

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.9. The overall performance of the Borrower is rated Satisfactory. This is based on RGOB strong
commitment to the project as evidenced since the beginning of the project and on the considerable efforts

6. Lessons Learned

6.1. Project Design
6.1.1. Evidence based policy making:



                                                    18
 - A fine distinction needs to be drawn between “picking winners” by government, and identifying
“promising strategic bets” based on extensive input from the private sector and experiences of comparable
countries. Robust feasibility studies can support such decisions.
- Equally important is how this decision is implemented: is there room for flexibility and mid-course
corrections? This project “picked” the IT/ITES sector. However, there was flexibility inbuilt in the
design: today, a mix of firms (domestic and international, small and medium-sized, voice and data based)
occupies the IT Park, as well as some non-ICT startups (in the BITC). Similarly, many of the graduates of
the training programs have found employment in non-ICT sectors. Such flexibility has helped create a
more level playing field and has encouraged the participation of larger sections of Bhutan’s private sector.
Given that IT/ITES remains a priority services sector for RGOB even today, it can be concluded that
flexible implementation played a major role in validating this “choice” of sector.
- Availability of a strong fact base is important at design stage, both as a baseline and to measure impact.
For example in component 3, supply-side and demand-side evidence on access to finance across Bhutan
were collected through two surveys (quantitative and qualitative) for the elaboration of the draft FIP.

6.1.2. Taking “baby steps” first: In a situation of limited experience and training, it could be claimed that
major physical works warrant less focus until the “software” (e.g. conducive policy frameworks, strong
investment climate, innovation mindset and skills) is more in place. An interim step could include
creating a virtual center based on training rather than a physical structure.

6.1.3. “Small is beautiful”: Successful achievement of project objectives does not always require
considerable funding. Simple projects designed with few components requiring adequate amounts of
funding can be as, if not more, successful than larger sized and overly ambitious projects.

6.1.4. Measuring impacts: As impacts often take time to materialize, a system to track the progress of
medium-term impacts of the project’s activities should be put in place during the design stage. For
instance, the SEIA did not benefit from baseline data, which in turn did not allow robust impact
evaluation analysis. Another example of results that could have been better assessed is regarding the RUB
component; even though employment of RUB university graduates cannot be solely attributed to specific
courses and modules, going forward it would be interesting to explore ways to measure the impacts of
these new curricula in students’ overall performance at RUB and their subsequent career success.

6.2. Project Implementation
6.2.1. Effective project coordination is critical: especially when several government agencies are
involved. High level committees can be helpful to solve roadblocks along implementation while at the
same time a leading agency must take clear ownership for overall progress.

6.2.2. Marketing efforts and importance of managing expectations: with prospective investors as well as
the media and the public. While IT promotional activities were useful to showcase Bhutan as an
investment destination, awareness campaigns targeting the public (e.g. on the time required for strategic
infrastructure to show impact) are often a good way to build the right expectations. A coordinated focus
on external relations and communications is important.

6.2.3. Creating short-term market distortions could sometimes be beneficial in the long term: A good
example of this is provided by RGOB’s incentives and subsidies to the private sector developer and
occupants. Such actions could be deemed essential to build up a new industry from scratch. However,
unlike the “infant industry” approach of traditional industrial policies, care should be taken to phase out
such market distortions and ensure crowding-in of private sector in a level playing field.




                                                     19
6.2.4. World Bank implementation support: Regular planned communications, through the monthly
conference calls between the Bank team and all IAs, were instrumental for implementation progress. This
could be considered as “best practice” in implementation support.

6.3. Public Private Partnerships
6.3.1. In order to successfully implement PPP projects, adequate capacity of the government is important
to negotiate PPP arrangements and fully benefit from the PPP. World Bank’s project preparation
advances can be used to help build borrower capacity even before the project starts. Going forward, PPP
guidance notes could be provided to borrowers and task teams for both design and implementation.

6.3.2. Domestic private sector capacity often needs further strengthening to allow local firms to also
participate in PPP deals in lieu of, or in active partnership with, foreign private sector.

6.3.3. A lesson from the various joint –ventures and partnerships between foreign firms and local firms is
the need to ensure full inclusion and active participation of all partners, better commitment and equal risk
sharing, transfer of knowledge and local capacity building, especially in countries where local capacity is
a priori weak and such partnerships are relatively uncommon.

6.3.4. In countries where domestic private sector capacity is weak, infrastructure is basic, and PPPs are at
a pioneer stage, the government’s financial contribution is often higher than planned (for instance in
providing public infrastructure, and offering incentives to investors). This is particularly valid in the case
of the IT/ITES sector and international PPPs (including IT Parks), to mitigate new location costs and risks
to investors. PPP ventures could be economically viable but might be financially unattractive from the
government’s point of view. Based on the experience of other IT Parks and zones globally (e.g.
Cyberabad technology hub in Hyderabad), such initial investments at start-up phase are essential for
future success. On a related note, the government should enter at its own peril if it relies on the private
sector to provide the key missing links (such as major ancillary infrastructure or public works).

6.4. Skills development and Employment
6.4.1. In countries like Bhutan where skills mismatches and quality of employment-ready manpower are
areas of concern, the shift from government training to private sector-led training might be a sensible
approach. In addition, considering the number of secondary graduates employed through the project,
governments could target both tertiary graduates and secondary graduates in their employment and
training programs – as the latter can also develop skills that respond to firms’ needs.

6.5. Building an international country brand
6.5.1. Bhutan’s value proposition as an investment destination includes its “green” brand name, reliable
and low cost access to power, political stability, and low attrition rate. Bhutan could meet medium-sized
ICT companies’ needs and in particular creative BPO as Bhutanese relate to western cultures naturally,
which is an essential requirement for IT/ITES and sub-sectors like Creative Process Outsourcing.

Box 1- IT Park: the First Public Private Partnership (PPP) in Bhutan
Following continuous efforts post the global financial crisis, the International Competitive Bidding process to secure
a private investor to Design, Build, Finance, Own, Operate and Transfer (DBFOOT) an IT park in Bhutan attracted
one bidder (non-participation of Bhutanese private sector appeared to come from lack of capacity). This was a joint
venture between the Singapore subsidiary of Assetz Property Group Pte Ltd, a global Special Economic Zone
developer (74 percent), and Bhutan's national holding company: DHI Ltd, a domestic equity partner (26 percent).
The first PPP in Bhutan was signed between the MOIC/DITT and TTPL on 4 September 2009. Government
contribution leveraged about Nu 300m (US$5m) from TTPL. RGOB commitment to the IT Park PPP included:
(i) The signing of the “Letter of ICT sector policy for the Bhutan PSD project” in 2007 in an attempt to solve the
competitive issue related to connectivity costs
(ii) The approval by the Cabinet in 2008 of the incentives for the IT Park developer and ICT companies registering
in Bhutan including among others: (a) tax holidays of 15 years to the IT Park developer and 10 years to IT/ITES
businesses operating within the IT Park and exporting 80 percent of their products/services; (b) Exemption of
custom’s duty on imported capital goods; (c) 100 percent foreign equity participation allowed to the IT Park
developer and IT/ITES companies in the Park
(iii) The Cabinet’s approval in 2008 of the extension of the land lease terms for the IT Park to 30 years with two
automatic renewals (and the complex transfer of the ownership of the land between ministries). This decision
provided a total of 90 years lease term, in line with international standards, and was instrumental in attracting FDI in
the IT Park. It also set a precedent for reforming the Land Act to facilitate FDI in any sector
(iv) The Government contribution of US$2 million for the IT Park, legally committed to the private sector investor
in September 2009 to ensure a fixed annual revenue stream for the private developer. It was provided as a lease-in
for RGOB of the 10,000sft shared space of the IT Park for 90 years.
(v) The provision of ancillary facilities, including strategic infrastructure investments into the park (such as roads,
power supply, sewage and water treatment) as per PAD and additional counterpart funding (road expansion)
(vi) Incentive programs for first mover tenants
(vii) Additional contributions to the PPP from outside the project such as the financing of IT park commercial
space’s warm shell and subsidies for connectivity costs and training support
(viii) Active participation in the promotion efforts. On numerous occasions, delegations were led by the Honorable
Minister and Secretary MOIC and on one occasion by the Honorable Prime Minister
(ix) Project management supervision through MOIC, MOLHR, RUB and RMA

Box 2 -Internet connectivity during project implementation
Around the period of the global financial crisis, lack of redundancy of the communications networks and high
bandwidth prices led a large foreign investor to decide against starting operations in Bhutan. The project team
recommended agreeing on a reasonable cost plus pricing of wholesale tariffs by BPC at par with international
standards. The project team also liaised with the GICT group of the World Bank to provide technical assistance to
the RGOB for strengthening telecom regulation and competition in these price negotiations. In June 2009, the ICT
and the Bhutan InfoComm and Media Authority (BICMA) issued a new tariff order placing a price cap on wholesale
bandwidth tariffs. The tariff order by BICMA had, however, been pending as Bhutan is landlocked and BICMA has
no jurisdiction over the international tariffs charged by Indian operators near the border. Only high level discussions
between RGOB and the government of India to secure a negotiated price from Indian operators to Bhutanese
operators would allow a revised international tariff order, which would benefit the IT Park, the private sector at large
and the whole country. RGOB was in discussion with the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India and the
Government of India-owned provider to reduce costing at the international gateway. On the redundancy issue,
RGOB held negotiations with the parties concerned to pursue a completely independent fiber link through Cox’s
Bazaar in Bangladesh to Gelephu (Bhutan) via Tripura (India). In addition, there were expectations that as the
volumes in the IT Park and the rest of the country would increase (when the Park occupancy crosses the 500 seat
mark estimated by RGOB) volume based pricing would also have ultimately a positive effect on bandwidth pricing.
Success in these negotiations would release the RGOB from its commitment to bear the differential rates with the
region as per the 2007 Letter of ICT Sector Policy.

Box 3- International occupants of the IT Park
Tenancy agreements were signed in late 2012 and early 2013 with two international firms.

Scan Café is a US based company working on digitizing, editing, repairing photos and videos using software. Scan
Cafe piloted its operations in Bhutan in the BITC in end- 2012 while the IT Park was being completed (with warm
shell and later on with fit outs). Scan Café is now occupying 25 percent of the commercial space of the IT Park and
benefitted from both RGOB additional incentive programs.

Shaun Communication is a voice-based BPO mainly doing market research and survey for the UK market. Shaun
communications started their operations in 2012. It is part of GB Solz, a company into web development
technologies, mobile application development and others. Shaun Communication was the first firm to start
operations in the IT Park with 90 people in August 2012 before stopping operations in November 2012 and
considerably scaling down. Among the reasons for scaling down were connectivity issues, lack of talent pool with
the required communication skills and transportation challenges for their night shifts. Shaun did not meet the criteria
to benefit from the incentive programs of the project but MOLHR is supporting part of the training costs of its
employees through a scheme. With this additional training support from MOLHR, Shaun resumed operations in
February 2013 with 27 staff and changed its Internet Service Provider. Even though Shaun Communication signed a
tenancy contract for 10,000 sqf in February 2013 and committed to move to the commercial space of the IT Park by
May 2013, Shaun is still operating from the BITC as of September 2013.


Box 4 - Impact of the project on local companies
Local companies had complained about the lack of access to markets in the context of a small domestic market.
Through roadshows, domestic IT firms were taken to India to network and get exposure to Indian entrepreneurs and
to other locations. Prior to the GTP, Genpact supported part of the training of local IT training firms. The ETP also
supported five private local firms including Link2Support, Athang, GDM, BBS and Bhutan Center of Excellence
(BCE). BBS is currently employing those that were trained by MOLHR program as was expected. In addition,
Athang and GDM are currently employing full operational production units in animation. GDM won a national
award on animation which was undertaken by the candidates of ETP. Athang which became the local partner of the
first tenant (Scan Café), and which was also an active member of BICTTA since 2006, has grown with the training
contract it obtained with MOLHR. Athang recruited several people that it trained. Athang is also now participating
in national bids such as the bid for the National Land Commission land registration electronic system. In fact by the
end of the project the number of local IT companies (including IT training firms) registered in the IT association has
reportedly increased to about 90 companies (from 50 companies in 2011). While this increase in number of firms
cannot be solely attributed to the project, the BICTTA believes that the fate of the IT industry is tied to the IT Park.
Other domestic private sector was also involved during the pre-construction stage of the IT Park. Evidence from the
SEIA reports that contract works amounting to at least around Nu 20 million (US$355k) were taken up by local
contractors for the IT Park.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Introduction

1. The economic analysis in the original PAD has been updated based on the following two principles:
     i.   Principle of consistency: where applicable, the same facts and assumptions have been
          retained from the original PAD, in order to facilitate a like-to-like comparison;
    ii.   Principle of conservatism: where applicable, assumptions have been made to neither over-
          report nor under-report the true outcomes.

2. The updated analysis has been carried out from the perspective of RGOB + TTPL combined (to
   provide a more complete picture of the project). Since the original PAD carried out this analysis from
   the lens of RGOB only, a second economic analysis is presented here from the point of view of
   RGOB only (to facilitate a like-to-like comparison with the PAD).

Assumptions

3. The following assumptions converge with the original PAD:
       i.  Component 1 focus: Economic analysis has been undertaken only for the IT Park;
      ii.  Exchange rate: is assumed same as the original PAD (US$1 = Nu 43.01) except for revenue
           projections starting 2013 where the exchange rate used is US$1 = Nu 60;
    iii.   Financial benefits: remain the same: (i) rental of incubation center; (ii) rental of shared
           technology center; (iii) rental of data center; and (iv) tax revenues generated from the IT
           Park. Caveat: both 100% rentals, as well as RGOB’s share of rentals (i.e. DHI’s share of
           26%) are presented here (original PAD considered full 100%);
     iv.   Financial costs: the following categories remain the same: (i) provision of the land as an
           equity contribution; (ii) cost of leasing-in space; (iii) ancillary infrastructure including water,
           power, internet connectivity; (iv) primary infrastructure including shared technology center;
           (v) incubation center; and (vi) labor cost;
      v.   Economic benefits: remain the same: (i) employment generation inside the IT Park; (ii)
           employment generation outside the IT park; and (iii) net increase in exports;
     vi.   Constant prices: All the data in the financial projections are based on constant prices. Impact
           of inflation has not been taken into consideration in the projections;
    vii.   Time horizon: The analysis is undertaken for a time horizon of 20 years. Caveat:
           development period and operation period have been changed from original PAD to reflect
           actual progress;
   viii.   Discount rate: In the analysis, discount rate has been set at 10%, the interest rate at which the
           government can borrow from local commercial banks for 20 years;
     ix.   Depreciation: Fixed assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over the 40 year
           period;
      x.   Land: Provision of the land as an equity contribution is also considered a capital expenditure
           to be amortized over 40 years;
     xi.   Dividend to the government: While the government provides the land for the IT Park as an
           equity contribution, the analysis assumes that the government will not receive dividend
           income (which is true so far);
    xii.   Tax revenues: Tax revenues generated through the IT Park include sales tax, income tax from
           labor employed in the IT Park and the supplier industries, and corporate tax on the industries
           in the IT Park. As in the PAD, tax revenues are assumed to be US$0.04 per US$1.00 value of
           total production;
   xiii.   Tax exemption and relief: It is assumed that taxes are exempted for initial 3 years and
           reduced by 50% for the following 3 years;
                                                     32
    xiv.    Revenue generation per person: The original PAD used the NASSCOM-McKinsey Report
            (2002) to estimate revenue generation per seat in the business process outsourcing (BPO)
            services sector in India at between US$17,000 - US$24,000. As in the PAD, revenue
            generation per person in the IT Park in Bhutan is assumed to be US$17,000;
    xv.     Employment generation outside the Park: The original PAD used empirical studies to show
            that each new position in the BPO/IT industries’ generates 3 further jobs in the rest of the
            economy. This multiplier has been used in the ICR as well;
    xvi.    Net increase in exports: It is assumed that 80% of the total production will target export
            markets. The value of net increase in export excludes the value of imported materials, labor
            cost and other operational expenses;
   xvii.    Production capacity: Total value of production at full capacity is maintained;
  xviii.    Exports: Ratio of export to total production is maintained;
    xix.    Imports: Average ratio of imported material and other expenses is maintained;

4. The following assumptions diverge from the original PAD:
      i.   Financial costs: the following categories are now included under capital investment: (i)
           development of ancillary infrastructure including undergrounding of high voltage power line,
           sewage treatment plant; and (ii) development of primary infrastructure including data center
           and fit-out support to tenants;
     ii.   TTPL investment: Following the principle of conservatism, TTPL’s total investment of
           US$5.9 million has been accounted in the first two years of operation (10% in year 1 and
           90% in year 2), while in reality this will be spread out over more years;
    iii.   Production: Value of production (actual and forecasted) tracks total rentals per year (actual
           and forecasted);
    iv.    Rentals: Total per year (based on actual numbers) of which 26% share accrues to the RGOB
           through DHI’s equity share in the IT Park;
     v.    Speed to full capacity: The original PAD assumed that on average the IT Park will have an
           average capacity utilization of 25% each year, consequently reaching full capacity in the
           fourth year after commencing production. The ICR documents actual capacity utilization
           until the present, and then tracks value of production;

5. The following numbers are based on actual values and converge with the original PAD:
      i.   Equity contribution of the RGOB: in the form of provision of 5 acres of land;
     ii.   Total area: of leasing-in space;
    iii.   Employment generation inside the Park: An area of approximately 50,000 SFT is developed
           for the building spaces with a space for one person being about 50 SFT. Considering
           corridors and common facilities, the IT Park can generate 700 jobs at full capacity;
    iv.    Annual salaries: of IT Park jobs (tenants, management and staff) as well as non-IT Park jobs
           are maintained since these are in line with actual estimates based on the ICR team’s field
           interviews.

6. The following numbers are based on actual values and diverge from the original PAD:
      i.   Cost of leasing-in space: this is now incurred upfront in year 3;
     ii.   Costs of primary infrastructure: capital investment for shared technology center, data center,
           incubation center, fit-out support to tenants;
    iii.   Costs of ancillary infrastructure: capital investment for water, power, internet connectivity,
           undergrounding of high voltage power line, sewage treatment plant, access road to site;
    iv.    Taxes: Actual values till date of 2%, 3% and 5% taxes paid as applicable by the IT Park and
           BITC till date have been included in the ICR calculations;
     v.    Staffing: Numbers of senior and junior staff are based on actuals till date.

Summary of results

7. Financial analysis: The analysis, which is based on a discount rate of 10%, indicates that the IT Park
   generates a financial IRR of -0.60% for both RGOB + TTPL, and -8.28% for just RGOB (original
   PAD estimated +6.76%).

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

In compliance with the Financing Agreement of the project, a SEIA was commissioned. The objectives
were to identify and measure the socio-economic benefits and impacts of the project.

The SEIA was done primarily using a structured questionnaire administered on a sample of purposively
selected respondent groups. The sample for the survey was selected in close consultation and agreement
with the PIA. Four categories of end-beneficiaries were interviewed: (i) local communities in the vicinity
of the IT Park; (ii) people who were trained under RUB and MOLHR training programs including those
employed, a small sample of unemployed, lecturers and trainers from private training institutes; (iii) Bank
of Bhutan customers; and (iv) general public (business persons, villagers) from 6 districts to assess the
impact of the FLP. In total, 174 respondents who underwent training responded to the questionnaires
used in the survey in 2012 and 20 respondents in 2013. In addition, 60 customers of BOB, 50 participants
of the FLP of RMA and from the institutes under RUB, 30 students using VLE, 10 System Administrators
and 28 lecturers involved in the Global Skill Enhancement courses, VLE and EDP were also interviewed
in 2012.

In a competitive process, RGOB recruited an individual consultant to undertake the SEIA.

The impact evaluation constructed outcome indicators, and available “impact” indicators, that went
beyond the intermediate outcome indicators of the project. They were suggested to DITT and to
stakeholders and agreed on by all stakeholders before data collection. They were used as the basis for
formulating questions. The SEIA of the project was carried out in two phases – in mid-2012 and mid-
2013.

The Key Socio-economic Benefits and Impacts of the project as reported in the SEIA in June 2013 and a
summary of the results of the SEIA are reported below. Table 4 summarizes selected results of the
survey finalized in June 2013. Note that the SEIA figures provided below are as of June 2013 while the
ICR figures are as of the end of the grace period.

Key Socio-economic Benefits and Impacts

1. Promotion of enterprise development in the IT/ITES sector

(i) For the first time in Bhutan, with the implementation of the TTP under the project using the PPP and
FDI mechanisms has been executed. The exercise with many valuable experiences and lessons learned
provides precedence to similar projects in the country.
(ii) The Bhutan Innovation and Technology Center, a center of excellence for incubation of small
businesses has been instrumental in incubating thirteen new businesses. The three who have graduated
have started operations and have created further employment. The shared technology center and data
center is also part of the BITC and Data center is currently hosting 3 local clients.
(iii) Due to the project, Bhutan is now firmly on the map as an option offering conditions for IT
investments such as its “green” brand, low cost access to power, stable political environment and high
English language skills of its graduates.
(iv) The project initiated and sustained national and international relationships between Government,
private sector and academia. This was evident in the coming together of Bhutanese agencies participating
in the project and external companies such as Infosys and Genpact in India and University of Colombo in
Sri Lanka.



                                                    38
2. Enhanced IT skills

(i) Cumulative job creation in the IT/ITES sector. As of early June 2012, 1,372 secondary education
(Class XII) graduates and college graduates had been trained and 778 candidates employed (389 male and
389 female) in global ITES companies1 and in various sectors of the Bhutanese economy. By June 2013,
the numbers employed increased to 964. Most Bhutanese employed with support from the project are
between 19 and 24 years old, with equal representation between young men and women from across
Bhutan’s 20 districts. The cost to the government per job created under the Project is estimated in the
range of Nu.65.7k.(US$ 1,100), which is highly satisfactory as per regional and global standards.

(ii) Of the total 451 trained under the ETP, 303 were employed of which 64% found jobs in BPOs, 12%
in hospitality, 7% each in government and trading and smaller percentages in assorted professions such in
education, media and 7 corporations. Similarly from among those 320 persons trained under the GTP, 192
were employed of which trading took in 25%, BPOs employed 23%, education employed 19%, the civil
service took in 12% and the rest in professions such as media, hospitality, finance and some were self-
employed. This shows that the trainings have enhanced employability to the extent that people have found
jobs beyond the IT sector.

(iii) Given that the number of jobs created by 2013 is 964 for youth in the age range between 18 to 24
years by 2013 and if the total number of unemployed in Bhutan in 2012 was 6,904 and the number of
youth in the age range 19-24 years comprised 3,476, the project has therefore contributed to addressing
14% of the overall unemployed in 2012. Moreover, the project contributed to reducing youth
unemployment by 28%.

(iv) Ninety percent of respondents gained more usable knowledge and skills while 66% said that they
gained more self-confidence. These seem to be the two most important social impacts, besides securing a
job for a livelihood experienced by respondents as a direct effect of the training and the job they have
been able to secure after the training.

(v) Seventy eight percent of students trained successfully have been employed by private sector. The
private sector-led skills development programs have been highly successful, both in terms of percentage
of trainees employed (74%) and cost per job created. Fifty five percent students cleared the ITES industry
competency assessment.

(vi) For trainees from the business development trainings, they have increased profit margins in their
businesses, reinvested in their business. As a direct outcome of the training, one person could expand the
current business by investing more money, 3 could expand their business by investing more equipment, 7
introduced a better accounting system, 5 could more effectively market their products and services and 1
could establish new clients and suppliers. Those trained have been able to effect changes in their
businesses and to grow by improving organizational capacity as well as generating additional incomes for
disposal, reinvestment in businesses and deposits in bank for future investments. Therefore, the training
has contributed to enhancing the knowledge and skills, which are the important attributes of social capital.

(vii) Income for local construction contractors/sub-contractors, at least contract works amounting to
around Nu. 20 m (US$340k) taken up by local contractors.




                                                    39
3. Improved access to finance

(i) Huge increase in ATM transactions which has led to reduction in visits to banks and waiting time at
banks has been reduced by 90%. Time save has been used by customers for various productive and social
activities.

(ii) Enhanced awareness of financial products and processes to access them from the nation-wide
dissemination campaign done last year and the public awareness program through the media currently
being initiated.
(iii) Owing to automation of the RSEBL there has been a marked increase in transactions for all listed
companies indicating a rapidly growing use of the system even within a month of operation of the new
automated system.

4. Other Anticipated Impacts

(i) At least 40% of the employment at TTP will be created for Bhutanese citizens: There will also be
substantial indirect job creation in engineering, gardening, catering and cleaning services. Owing to the
large number of expatriates working at the TTP, indirect income earning opportunities for the local
community will also proliferate such as transportation, residential rentals, housekeeping, grocery and
other supplies to name a few. It is expected that the ratio of expatriates to local employees will be around
1:4 in the first five years and 1:6 thereafter.

(ii) Increased Opportunities for local residents for income generation: Most people living near the TTP
reported that they had either set up small shops, started business, constructed houses for rental. Many
residents have started constructing buildings in anticipation of an adequate customer base for residential
units.

(iii) Positive Community Perception: All respondents said they were proud to have the TTP located in
their neighborhood. The reasons mentioned are: better outlook now where slums used to exist; easy
access to needs due to the town; easy availability of jobs and proximity; easy availability of jobs for
children; better income for the whole community; more products can be sold to the people; rapid
development will take place; students from the near-by schools can be absorbed here and they can now
run a business. While many of these reasons can be seen as anticipation of economic incentives for the
community, others are convenience to residents from better amenities being available in expectation of
urban development being triggered by the TTP.

(iv) Changes in community demographics: The number of people living in the neighborhood is bound to
increase from year-to-year. This is because while some will relocate to live near the TTP for convenience
of working at the Park, others would re-locate with their businesses further increasing the population in
the area. This could lead to increase in congestion of housing and people in the area.

Socio-economic impact assessment

It is evident that some impacts will take time to emerge since activities have just been completed, or in a
few cases such as the Financial Literacy through the media is still ongoing.

Construction of the Tech Park has offset changes in the local economy in Wangchutaba such as increase
in construction of buildings and land prices.

Among those trained under the project and employed, though people earn less owing to the short duration
in employment, youth still have secured a means of livelihood and possess skills thereby enhancing their

                                                    40
confidence and self-esteem. Business persons and trainers from private training institutes trained have
used the knowledge and skills from the training to improve their business and generate income for their
business units.

Customers of the Bank of Bhutan using ATMs have cut down visit to banks and now spend much less
time than before on bank transactions.
Participants in dzongkhags attending the financial outreach programs are much more aware than before
on financial products and services but are yet to produce economic outcomes.

Many youth trained under the project have secured employment and a means of livelihood. Integration of
courses in curricula has not only introduced an element of sustainability but students are made ready for
the job market essential to enhance their employability.

Use of IT for the VLE in colleges has added a new dimension to learning ensuring “anytime, anywhere”
learning for students and teachers facilitating the courses.

The financial strengthening component encompassing the upgrading the BOB CBS has had immense
benefits to customers throughout the country providing convenience and saving time for users through
introduction of ATMs and SMS and on-line banking.

The financial literacy and outreach program has created the necessary awareness but economic outcomes
are anticipated over time.

The automation of the RSEBL will permit trading of shares from any part of the country with
connectivity and the FIP will have far-reaching impacts for rural Bhutanese in future.

                                        Scan Café in the period between October 2012 and June 2013 employed 125 Bhutanese youth and two
                                        Indian nationals while Shaun Communication employed 16 youth and two Indian nationals.
Enhanced income for local construction Work in developing the TTP was taken up by people from India. However, the management also
contractors/sub-contractors             outsourced some of the work to local contractors. It is reported that contract works amounting to around
                                        Nu. 20 m (US$340k) was sub-contracted to local contractors.
Enhanced income for TTPL and for The TTP earned Nu. 1,714,755 (US$28,723.1) from leasing space in BITC in June 2013.
companies leasing space                 As of June 2013, Shaun Communication and Scan Café invested approximately Nu. 9.8 m and Nu. 3.7 m
                                        (US$ 164,2k and US$ 62k) respectively. On the income side Shaun Communication expects to make Nu.

                                        not available.
Enhanced income for utility service In June 2013, the TTP expenses for a year amounted to Nu. 5,660,400 (US$94,814.9). A proportion of this

Enhanced income for National employees In 2013, employees working at TTP earned between Nu. 6,000 (US$100.5) (Scan Café) to Nu. 8,000
of companies based in TTP               (US$134) per month (Shaun Communication) as startup pay. The salary of some staff in Shaun
                                        Communication however has gone up to Nu. 14,000 (US$234.5). These companies also indicated that
                                        bonus packages were also offered to staff based on their performance.
Enhanced income of community members Community members living around the TTP did not earn any income directly from the TTP but it was
living near TTP by source               noted in mid-2012 that a few obtained rental income from leasing housing units to people working at the
                                        TTP. In Bhutan for every direct job created, 1.2 more indirect jobs will be generated so it is expected that
                                        jobs in the TTP will have multiplier effects.

Enhanced incomes and employment as a Since construction on the TTP commenced many residents have started constructing buildings in
result of TTP                           anticipation of an adequate customer base for residential units.

                                                                         42
                                            The price of land in the locality also escalated. The median land prices per decimal before the construction
                                            were Nu. 200,000 (US$3,550.1) while soon after the TTP construction started, land prices escalated and
                                            now the median price quoted per decimal is Nu. 475,000 (US$ 7,956.5). This is an increase by 138%.
                                            TTP has been in operation for a relatively short period of time so impacts are not so obvious yet. Only a
                                            few expected any employment in the TTP for their children if they could not continue for further studies
                                            after they were trained in IT.
Reduction in number of interest groups      So far there has not been any news or information from any source opposing the TTP. This implies that
                                            there is general societal acceptance to the facility. All those interviewed had positive feedback on the TTP.

                                            can now run a business.
Development of IT Skills
Enhanced earnings of trained employees Median salary received by trainees now employed was Nu. 8,000 (US$134) in June 2013. The median
per month as compared to before training expenditure per month was Nu. 6,000 (US$100.5) while the median amount saved was Nu. 875
and employment.                              (US$14.66).
                                             Entry level salaries offered by the tenants were lower and roughly half of civil service salaries in
                                             comparable professions. In June 2013, the entry pay for youth working at Scan Café at the TTP was fixed
                                             at Nu. 6,000 (US$100.5) per month. and Nu. 8,000 (US$134) a month at Shaun Communication. These

                                             The job obtained after training secured their livelihood, by providing them a regular salary, enabled some
                                             of them to contribute to the family income and to pay their rents. Most mentioned it increased their
                                             financial autonomy.
Trainers from Bhutanese Private Training Institutes
Enhanced business opportunities after the Trainers have been able to apply the knowledge to their work as 7 out of 8 respondents conducted similar
training                                     courses for their institutes on their return.
Enhanced employee satisfaction and self- As a direct outcome of the training, all respondents said that they gained more knowledge and skills and
esteem                                       also self-confidence.

Enhanced performance of System According to the System Administrators, the VLE system established in the Colleges makes it possible for
Administrators (Virtual Learning System students to learn from anywhere by accessing materials uploaded to the system, interacting in the Forum,
(VLE) and Course Management System submitting assignments and exams on-line and getting feedback from Faculty on-line too. Having VLE
(CMS)                                        along with face-to-face class room teaching occasionally is cost effective for teachers and students.
Trained lecturers in Virtual Learning Lecturers trained in VLE personally benefited as they post quizzes, announcements, assignments on-line,
System (VLE) and Course Management which can be easily accessed by students. It has instituted a culture of self-directed learning and
System (CMS) quoting benefits of the independence as students must submit assignments by the deadline. Students became more time conscious,
training and system                          improved their computing skills and lecturer-student interaction increased online. Use of VLE system cut
                                             down paper use and saved a lot of time for assignments, lecturer feedback, group discussions and
                                             evaluation of assignments. Students also are more active online than they would be in the classroom. The
                                             use of multi-media has made teaching and learning interesting.
Enhanced experience of trainees that have Students seem to do well in the anonymity offered by VLE. Grades are posted by Lecturers on the website
completed      the    distance       course which serves as a notice board for students. Students share views on studies in the discussion forums. They
(convenience, learning difficulties, limited communicate among themselves but also with the Lecturer on a real-time basis. The VLE cut down the
face-to-face contact)                        risks of cheating as students submit assignments that are tutor-marked.
Training of businesspersons for improvement of businesses and growth
Cumulative increase in income of Those trained have been able to effect changes in their businesses, grow by improving organizational
businesses employing trainees                capacity as well as generating additional incomes for disposal, reinvestment in businesses and deposits in
                                             bank for future investments. Of 11 respondents, 9 mentioned that their profit margins were higher than
                                             before, 4 of them reinvested in the business, 1 deposited the money in the bank and 4 spent the money.
Enhanced employee satisfaction and self- Most respondents felt that trainers were competent and that the course was relevant to their business. Most
esteem                                       also could apply the learning from their course to their business.
Training of Class XII school leavers and graduates
                                             174 respondents were contacted for interviews of which half were Class XII graduates, 44% with Bachelor
                                             degrees and 6 persons were post-graduate. Among them, 44% studied commerce, 28% studied Arts and
                                             about 12% studied science and IT.
                                             Over half of trainees ranked the trainers mostly as “very good” and 60% mentioned that the course was
                                             “highly relevant” of which 83% could apply the knowledge and skills in their work.
                                             More than half of the trainees who found jobs were trained in BPO operations. Two were trained in
                                             animation and one in IT. The training played a significant role in securing their jobs according to them.
                                             They found the training very useful as they acquired communication skills and confidence. The training
                                             also gave them good exposure, knowledge, new skills.

                                                                           44
                                           A small sample of unemployed who were interview mentioned the tough competition in the job market.
                                           Some also mentioned low salaries or dissatisfaction with their previous jobs. The number of jobs they
                                           applied for after their training ranged from 2 to a maximum of 16 jobs. Some of the jobs were in banks,
                                           hydropower projects, newspapers, IT jobs, government, private companies, corporations and travel
                                           agencies. Some also applied for fieldwork such as household surveys.
                                           The type of temporary jobs taken up till now by the youth are designing birthday cards, tour guides, cell
                                           phone operation, supervisors, photo editors in IT park and also supervisors of construction projects.
IT system up-gradation in the Bank of Bhutan
Reduced time against increased money For indicative purposes if a day’s national wage is Nu. 160 (US$2.68) for 8 hours work, the 3.5 hours wait
value in lieu of bank visit                before using CBS is Nu. 70 (US$1.17) worth in monetary terms. Time reduction from 3.5 hours to 20
                                           minutes wait with the CBS (see above) translates to a reduction from Nu. 70 (US$ 1.17) to Nu. 6 (US$0.1).
                                           So, assuming that 50,000 persons across the country use the services in 1 day, Nu. 3,170,000
                                           (US$53,099.3) is saved in a day and in a month of 25 working days, the savings goes up to Nu. 79,250,000
                                           (US$ 1.3m).
Waiting time at banks before and after – If we take 3.5 hours as the maximum waiting time before the CBS and 20 minutes after introduction of
money value for time savings               CBS and use of services, the waiting time has therefore been reduced by 90%.
                                           People living in the border areas also mentioned the added advantage of being able to withdraw Indian
                                           currency in the border towns. People said that they did not have to carry lots of cash, at the risk of theft or
                                           loss, and could conveniently withdraw money from ATMs in the dzongkhags while travelling. Some
                                           respondents also felt that using ATM forced them to save.
Creation of awareness on financial aspects (financial literacy)
Enhancement of awareness about bank’s Most participants stated that the presentation of the various loan schemes, interest rates, procedures to
services and products;                     apply and other terms and conditions was useful. Many also indicated that government policies vis-à-vis
                                           financial lending, policy and regulations on soiled and counterfeit currency were useful. The various
                                           insurance schemes were also good information for people to understand to insure lives and property for
                                           future security.
                                           Under the school education program, sensitization was done in a few schools in Thimphu with banks. This
                                           induced BNB to start the “piggy-bank saving scheme” for school children.
                                           The survey carried out in June 2013 in 6 districts revealed that although radio programs were being aired in
                                           Kuzoo FM in Dzongkha and through the Etho Metho Local TV channel, the survey team which visited the
                                           districts of Trongsa, Wangdue, Punakha, Thimphu, Paro and Chukha could not identify people who had
                                           heard or watched these on radio and TV respectively largely because youth listen to Kuzoo radio and music
                                           is preferred over other programs. Even those listening to Dzongkha programs on Kuzoo prefer the music
                                           program. Cable TV operators have only local reach. The transmission of financial awareness and literacy
                                           over the Bhutan Broadcasting System will have substantial impact in creating awareness.
Increase in number of persons reacting Several people interviewed applied for group loans and received quick service. Several other people also
after the awareness sessions               applied for loans to build houses or to invest in businesses after the campaign and fulfilled their credit
                                           needs. Many noted that they can now identify counterfeit notes and this is useful for their businesses.

                                                                            45
                                            Participants who attended the meeting sessions in the Dzongkhags could not understand all that was
                                            discussed. Many forgot what was discussed. Also, a few mentioned that they didn’t speak and understand
                                            the language the presentations were made in. A few mentioned since they were cramped in the venue,
                                            presentations made were not always audible.
RSEB automation
Increase in number of shares traded after   There was a marked increase in transactions for all listed companies indicating a rapidly growing use of the
automation                                  system even within a month of operation of the new automated system. Volume of shares traded before
                                            automation was 19,343 and it increased to 741,382 by the end of 2012. This also represents a 97% increase
                                            from the volume of shares traded in 2011 of 375,652. The value of the shares traded since automation
                                            increased by 65%. However, the capacity of the system is still underutilized. This is mainly because there
                                            are limitations on the supply-side as more companies need to enlist in the stock exchange to divest.
                                            Nonetheless, market capitalization for the listed 20 companies has also increased by 42% as compared to
                                            the interim period of 2011.
Reduced time to process shares              Time spent to process the shares after automation has been reduced from 2 months to a month. 39 persons
                                            have been issued on-line terminals for access to trade shares online but only 3 were reported to be active.
                                            Automation increased the number of technicians and IT staff working at the RSEBL to manage the
                                            systems. It has also led to higher efficiency in work processes.
                                            Some emerging preliminary impacts observed on a day-to-day basis were as follows:
                                            (i) The primary effect of the depository system is easy and efficient dissemination of securities reports to
                                            investors. It keeps track of every trading movement, replacing the previous manual mode
                                            (ii) Brokers are more comfortable with the new brokerage system, which allows them to maintain both
                                            security account and the trading account of an investor. Access to the online trading facility is facilitated.
                                            (iii) The Clearing system now provides the edge to carry out settlement within the exact settlement date.
                                            The system has somehow instigated brokerage firms and the RSEBL to initiate a settlement bank, which
                                            helps the settlement process as per the designated timeline.
                                            (iv) The RSEBL has also increased the trading day to three times a week and has moved from spot trading
                                            to the continuous trading system. Investors have now the platform to trade for long duration and also the
                                            facility to determine price in pre-open session. Trade is now visible throughout Bhutan.
                                            (v) The IPO system provides an edge to carry out the initial public offering as per international standards.
                                            The system provides facility of both fixed price and book building methodologies. Tracking of investors
                                            and subscription is automated and this will increase efficiency and transparency.
                                            (vi) Investors will now have a dedicated and permanent securities account to record their securities.
                                            Automation of the RSEB has made share trading easier for citizens and is expected to further develop the
                                            capital market.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

The RGOB sent its draft implementation completion results report (31 pages) to the World Bank on
October 11, 2013. A summary of RGOB ICR was also received from RGOB on November 15, 2013 (18
pages) and is shortened below:


The Royal Government of Bhutan (RGOB) received a grant from the World Bank for implementation of
the Private Sector Development (PSD) Project focused on some of the key enablers that will help enhance
Bhutan’s ICT competitiveness and position the country as a regional ICT hub. The PSD Project, in
particular, supported development of IT/ITES sector, using an integrated approach that includes:
(i) establishment of the IT Park and related infrastructure and IT promotion services (ii) Development of
IT/ITES skills and (iii) improved access to finance.

During the preparation of the project, Bhutan was in the process of transitioning into a democratic
constitutional monarchy. The project took into account the country’s need and the development and use of
the IT/ITES sector was felt to be an effective tool to enhance good governance; and generate employment
through the growth of private sector and IT/ITES industries. The Government showed its commitment by
prioritizing ICT and the project was identified as a national flagship project. The promotion of IT
investment will benefit Bhutan’s industrial development by locating globally experienced IT companies
in Bhutan and setting high industry standards for local companies.

Component 1
The development of IT Park was undertaken in a PPP model. The obligation of private partner was to
develop an IT park infrastructure in a DBFOOT model and generate 700 jobs by May 2015. The
operation of BITC was contracted to TTPL under management contract for 5 years.

For the successful design and implementation of the project, coordination with different government
agencies and with the private sector is a key imperative. Towards this end, this sub-component supported
MOIC to establish an IT/ITES Promotion & Program Implementation Agency (PIA). The PIA promoted
and facilitated the development of IT/ITES industry in Bhutan and coordinated and supported the
implementing agencies (project components).

Through this project, advisory council was formed comprising of CEO of MNCs who advised RGOB on
the ICT development in Bhutan; a private sector focus group where communication line was created
between government and private sector; and an empowered task force who assisted and supported in fast
tracking and resolving issues.

Component 2
Development of IT-ITES skills program at the following three levels:

i) Generic Skills for the IT/ITES Sector;
Through this component, 1015 Bhutanese has been provided productive employment. 1372 secondary
and tertiary graduates were trained under the project from all districts of Bhutan. Due to the delayed
completion of the IT Park, candidates were employed in various sectors of the economy, including
education, trade, hospitality and self-employment.

The cost to the Government is 4 times below regional averages, thanks to private sector participation. The
Project supported the launch by MOLHR of several programs described below. Under the local programs,
firms were responsible for mobilizing candidates and required to employ at least 50% of the trained
individuals, while being provided a larger matching grant for higher employment rates:

                                                   49
1) a graduate training program (GTP): A total of 320 graduates have completed training under GTP out
of which 192 (60%) are employed in the private sector.
2) an employment training program (ETP): A total of 451 candidates have completed a 6 months to 1
year training in animation, medical transcription, graphic design and call center training, out of which 303
(67%) have been employed.
3) Industry Linkage Training and Employment Programs: A total of 194 graduates have been employed
outside Bhutan by BPO giants Wipro, Genpact and Infosys.
4) Employment incentive program (EIP): A total of 170 candidates have been employed as of date.
5) Global skills enhancement program: In collaboration with Infosys, analytical and Academic module
was developed and is introduced in the colleges under RUB.

ii) Distance learning facilities/CMS for IT Skills development;
With the implementation of VLE, capacities of the colleges were also built through this project for
effective delivery of e-learning. Beside video conferencing facilities in 4 colleges were also provided for
facilitating distance learning initiatives.

iii) IT Entrepreneurship Development Program.
This sub component established entrepreneurship development center in 5 colleges under RUB. The EDC
coordinators and faculty were trained besides providing capacity building for 26 local entrepreneurs.

Component 3
Strengthening the financial sector through IT use, comprising the following activities:

i) IT system up-gradation in the Bank of Bhutan (BOB);
Networking for Core Banking Solution (CBS) was the sole activity supported with IDA funding on
implementation of CBS in BOB. The entire hardware and software component including capacity
building were funded by BOB. Project funds have contributed to the rapid modernization of BOB’s
procedures and positioned BOB to benefit from the inter-bank Electronic Fund Transfer and Clearing
System (EFTCS).

ii) Developing a Financial sector IT development strategic plan
The TA to develop a financial sector IT development strategic plan was implemented by RMA. Following
the completion of the ‘Financial sector IT development strategic plan’ commissioned by RMA with
Project and IFC support, RMA started implementation of the EFTCS with support from RBI.

iii) Establishing the Inter-bank Electronic Fund Transfer Clearing System (EFTCS) at the RMA

iv) Up gradation of the IT infrastructure of the Royal Stock Exchange of Bhutan
The upgradation facilitated the Bhutanese to use the services of the RSEBL in terms of trading, clearing
and depository of securities through the use of friendly IT system which was nonexistent before. Doing so
not only developed the capital market but also ensured transparency, disclosure and efficient functioning
of the system.

v) Financial Inclusion Policy and financial literacy program
Under this component financial inclusion policy has been drafted to improve financial services
penetration and inclusive growth. The Literacy program was conducted in all 20 Dzongkhags.

Project Restructuring
1. During the Mid Term Review, it was understood that the Project facilitated jobs creation in IT/IES
sector and other value added sectors of the economy. The scope of the outcome indicator was expanded to


                                                    50
include the cumulative job creation in the IT/ITES sector, as initially planned, as well as jobs created in
other sectors directly as a result of training supported through the Project.

2. The component 3 under RMA, “establishment of an inter-bank electronic fund transfer clearing system
(EFTCS - Component)” was being implemented separately from the project after securing bilateral
assistance from the Reserve Bank of India. Hence, Component 3c was replaced with two new sub-
components, as below:
i) New Component 3c. Upgradation of the IT infrastructure of the Royal Security Exchange of Bhutan
ii) Financial Inclusion and Financial Literacy

Results Indicators
The Project Development Objective was to generate “Cumulative job creation in the IT/ITES Sector in
the IT Park and related activities” with target as 700. By the project closure, the target was exceeded and
achieved 1015 job creation in IT/ITES and related activities.

a. Component One:
1. The indicator on “Cumulative leads generated for new investments in the IT Park with target as 200”
was achieved and exceeded to create 255 leads.
2. The indicator on the “number of companies successfully incubated in the IT Park” with target of 5 was
measured as number of companies incubating at the IT Park. Since the Bhutan Innovation and
Technology Center was operational from 1st May 2012, over a short period of time 3 incubatees out of 13
have graduated and are operating successfully in the market.
3. The indicator on “Percentage of lettable space leased out” was achieved to 50% against target of
100%. Since the 2 international occupants have signed the tenancy agreement. However one occupant is
yet to move into the commercial space and hence the ICR agreed to reduce the space leased to 25%.
Prospects for filling the remaining space are promising, as Bhutanese companies as well as international
companies have expressed interest in locating at TTP. RGOB has mitigated this risk in several ways:
(i) contractually, TTPL has an obligation to host at least 700 employees in the Park by May 2015,
(ii) RGOB has been helping to build a pipeline of prospective domestic and international tenants in the IT
Park, (iii) RGOB has worked on providing an enabling investment climate for tenants.

b. Component Two:
1. Per cent of students clearing ITES industry competency assessment that is widely recognized with
target as 35%
This indicator was based on the competency assessment carried out by Infosys , Wipro and Genpact after
providing the training. This indicator is based on the number of candidates successfully passed the
assessment and was offered employment by the companies. By June 2013, the target of 35% was
achieved and exceeded to achieve 56%.
2. Per cent of students trained are successfully employed by the private sector with target as 50%
This indicator is related to the number of Bhutanese that were trained under the project and is employed
as of date irrespective of employed in or outside Bhutan and trained by national or international
companies. The target has been achieved and exceeded to achieve 63.63%. A total of 1372 were trained
and as of date a total of 1015 has been employed in IT/ITES sector.

c. Component Three:
1. Number of financial transactions by using ATMs at BOB per year with the target as 900,000
The target of 900,000 was achieved and exceeded to achieve transaction of 1,418,494.
2. Percentage of district coverage for financial literacy campaign with target as 100%
The main objective of FLC was to educate the Bhutanese especially the under banked and unbanked on
current and future financial services that will enable them to be financially disciplined.


                                                    51
The target was 100% achieved and in addition RMA is considering programs through better innovative
ideas targeting groups especially the youth and farmers.
3. Percentage automation of stock exchange trading, settlement, and delivery with straight through
processing with target as 100%
The integrated system now allows online trading and generates more accurate and real time information -
a leap from the manual system established more than two decades ago. It was 100 % completed with
users even from USA. Also the number of shareholders in the RSEBL has increased and as of December
2012 it was 48,077 against 12,852 in 2008 and market capitalization is Nu. 17.63 billion.

Extension of Project Closing Date
The project closing date of 30 June 2012 was extended to 30 June 2013 due to delay in completion of the
undergrounding of high voltage power line at IT Park implemented by Bhutan Power Corporation. The
delay did not impact any change in the PDO and performance indicators.

1.The implementation of the project was kept in line with the Government’s priorities and strategy. The
Project maintained its relevance throughout implementation by expanding the development objective and
the key outcome indicators (restructuring, Dec 2010) in line with the Government’s emerging strategies.
2.Resources were reallocated in a timely fashion to address the government’s emerging priorities like the
support for undergrounding of the High voltage power line , development of the national ICT master plan
that directly contributed towards the ICT industry development beside building the in-house capacity,
implementing matching grant program and employment incentive program for attracting first anchor
tenant and support for implementing microwork that has the potential for huge employment and
contribution to GDP.
3.The project implementation triggered investment climate reforms like FDI policy 2010, EDP 2010
including fiscal incentives for the IT Park and ICT industry, revision of Information Communication and
Media Act, formation of Single Window Agency for FDI investment, and trigger for development of
telecom policy.
4. High telecom tariff is an issue. Through the project, the telecom tariff reduction has taken place from as
high as 300% for 50 mbps to almost 80% reduction compared to the region by project closure.
5. The successful implementation of PPP model using DBFOOT model had triggered usage of similar
model for other projects, international level collaboration, innovative private sector led skills development
programs leading to jobs, testing Bhutan’s value propositions as an investment destination and new IT
and financial infrastructure like establishment of 2nd international telecom gateway.

Assessment of Risks
The risk that the developments outcomes will not be sustainable is low for the following reasons:
1) The youths employed through this project are already working and have not only enhanced their
   employability skills but has also gained experience that most of them will find jobs or can start their
   own business given the environment that has been created.
2) The risk of losing commercial international tenants is also low since government has prioritized
   private sector development and creation of conducive environment. Hence in the 11th FYP, to further
   support private sector development, an ICT industry development roadmap will be implemented , for
   the first time e-gov master plan has been developed that will project the domestic market for the
   industry that will be implemented in the 11th FYP, an ICT advisory panel has been proposed where
   private sector is part of the design and implementation of not only the projects but also guiding the
   government in terms of talent pool requirement (addressing the gap between the demand and supply
   in the market)
3) Promotion of microwork. Government is creating this environment for youth to take up microwork
   that will provide employment and earnings in foreign currency.
4) Telecom Policy will be in place to address the telecom tariff issue.


                                                     52
Bank Performance
The preparation of the project had included adequate consultations and analytical work and was done in
the context of the Government’s and the Bank’s strategy. The supervision from the Bank was excellent
hence the project had a smooth implementation.
Though there has been time when the response has been delayed from the Bank while seeking approvals
to carry out activities but it did not have major impact since the delays has always been useful to complete
all due diligences required from both the side.

Borrower Performance
1. RGOB was fully supportive of this project and had prioritized this project as a national flagship
    project. The commitment was there from the highest level of the government.
2. All the agencies were very supportive and forthcoming during the implementation.
3. PIA and IAs had a very strong dedicated team and unlike the trend of high attrition of civil servants,
    this project team from civil service was in the project till the end.
4. Sustainability of the project activity has been fully addressed by integrating with the agencies plans
    and has not been taken as a onetime project.
