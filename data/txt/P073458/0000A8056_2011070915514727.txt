                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project has completed four years of implementation, and is scheduled to be closed on June 30, 2012 (with an implementation end date on December 31, 2011). Project
                         implementation has been satisfactory since effectiveness, as noted in various past mission Aide Memoires, without any risks to meet its development objective. The project has been
                         given considerable due importance by the government agencies in charge of its implementation; some innovations have already been replicated by these agencies in other sectors.
                         The eight implementation support mission, completed in March 2011, indicates that the PDO continue to be relevant and achievable. The project has achieved, and in some cases,
                         exceeded its targets, which confirms a satisfactory progress towards achieving the development objectives.
