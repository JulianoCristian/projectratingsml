                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project has been under implementation for four years and is scheduled to close on June 30, 2012. Project implementation has been satisfactory since effectiveness, except for a
                         one time downgrade to moderately satisfactory due to a disbursement lag in June 2011, which has now been resolved. The project has been given considerable due importance by
                         the ministries and agencies of the Royal Government of Bhutan in charge of its implementation, within their portfolio. The ninth implementation support mission, completed in
                         November 2011, indicates that the PDO continue to be relevant and achievable. The project has achieved, and in some cases, exceeded its targets, which confirms a satisfactory
                         progress towards achieving the development objectives.
