                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project has been under implementation for five years and was scheduled to close on June 30, 2012. A closing date extension of one year was granted in June 2012 to allow the
                         Bhutan Power Corporation (BPC) to complete (under component 1) the undergrounding of a high voltage transmission line that runs over the park building. The undergrounding
                         works were delayed due to technical and coordination challenges. Overall project implementation has been satisfactory since effectiveness as a result of the considerable attention
                         and due importance given to the project by the implementing agencies. The assessment of the tenth implementation support mission, completed in June 2012, is that the PDO
                         continues to be relevant. The project has achieved, and in some cases, exceeded its targets, which confirms satisfactory progress towards achievement of the project’s development
                         objectives.
