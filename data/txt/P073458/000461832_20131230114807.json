"Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The Private Sector Development Project\n            for Bhutan had an overall satisfactory outcome, with the\n            performances of both the Bank and the borrower being deemed\n            satisfactory as well. The project development objective\n            indicator as well as most of the intermediate outcome\n            indicators were achieved fully and exceeded the target\n            value, while one intermediate outcome indicator was achieved\n            partially. The efficacy of the project is given a high\n            rating. Significant lessons learned during the\n            implementation of the project include: 1) the importance of\n            evidence based policy making; 2) simple projects designed\n            with few components requiring adequate amounts of funding\n            can be as, if not more, successful than larger sized and\n            overly ambitious projects; 3) a system to track the progress\n            of medium-term impacts of the project's activities\n            should be put in place during the design stage; 4) effective\n            project coordination is critical; 5) creating short-term\n            market distortions could sometimes be beneficial in the long\n            term; 6) domestic private sector capacity often needs\n            further strengthening to allow local firms to also\n            participate; and 7) the shift from government training to\n            private sector-led training might be beneficial in countries\n            like Bhutan."}, "docdt": "2013-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
