BHUTAN PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT (PSD) PROJECT 
 
RESTRUCTURING PAPER 
A. Summary 
 
The proposed restructuring reflects the Kingdom of Bhutan’s request to revise the scope of the 
financial sector component (Component 3: Strengthening the Financial Sector through IT use) 
and reallocate some of Component 3’s funds to Component 1 (Development of the IT/ITES 
Sector), while leaving the overall Grant Allocation unchanged (see Annex 1). Project 
Development Objectives, disbursement, financial management and procurement arrangements, 
safeguards, the closing date and implementation schedule remain unchanged. 
B. Project 
Status 
 
The Bhutan PSD Project is making progress towards achieving the project development 
objective (PDO). It is currently rated as Satisfactory in terms of both progress toward the Project 
Development Objective and Implementation Progress. A Midterm Review (MTR) mission 
conducted in October-November 2010 and Interim Status Report approved in November 2010 
concluded the following: 
 
Project Performance.
 The project has completed about three years of implementation, and is 
scheduled to be closed on June 30, 2012. Project implementation has been satisfactory since 
effectiveness. The project has been given considerable due importance by the Ministries and 
institutions in charge of its implementation. 
Relevance and Achievement of Project Development Objective (PDO).
 TheMTR assessment was 
that the PDO, “number of jobs created in the IT/ITES sector”, continues to be relevant and 
achievable.  The project has achieved, and in some cases, exceeded its mid-term review targets, 
which confirms a satisfactory progress towards achieving the development objectives. Progress 
against the outcome indicator is slightly under the initial target: 133 Bhutanese graduates had 
been hired through the project as of the Midterm Review (MTR), against an initial target of 175 
at the end of the third year of implementation. The MTR however projected that the targets of 
350 jobs and 700 jobs by the end of the fourth and fifth year of implementation would be 
attained.   
Relevance of Project Design.
 As per the MTR assessment, the institutional and implementation 
arrangements; social and environment safeguards arrangements,  M&E and reporting; funds flow 
and; disbursement methods are all relevant and do not require any changes. The design of the 
component 3 led to an anticipated slow disbursement curve, while effective commitments under 
the project show a good implementation progress. The proposed level-two restructuring is 
required due to the reallocation of project funds between components and the revised scope of 
the financial sector development component as explained in Section C.  
Page  7

Implementation of Component 2, Development of IT Skills Development Program. 
While the 
Royal University of Bhutan (RUB) remains the implementation agency of Component 2, the 
component is now jointly implemented by RUB and the Ministry of Labour and Human 
Resources (MOLHR). 
Since training of the out of school and college youth certificate programs is 
within the mandate of the MOLHR, and to avoid duplication of resources and effort, RUB and MOLHR 
signed a Memorandum of Understanding in October 2009, establishing that the generic skills 
development of Component 2 would be implemented by the MOLHR. Fiduciary arrangements of the 
project have remained unchanged and are routed through the RUB, therefore this project remains 
implemented by RUB from a fiduciary perspective.  
 
Grant Covenants.
 
The project is in compliance with all grant covenants included in the 
Financing Agreement.  
Compliance with Environmental and Social Safeguards.
 
This is a category B project due to the 
triggering of the Environmental Assessment OP/BP/GP 4.01.
 
The Environmental Assessment 
(EA) and Environmental Management Plan (EMP) were completed and disclosed to the public 
by the Royal Government of Bhutan (RGOB)  on 25 February, 2010. 
The Project’s safeguards 
category remains B under the proposed changes.
 
New enabling works due to the inclusion of the 
undergrounding of a high voltage transmission line above the IT Park, under Component 1 (see 
Section C), are not expected to cause environmental or social impacts and are expected to be 
below ground and along existing rights of way. Before work on the under-grounding of the HV 
transmission lines commences, a baseline environmental and social assessment, consultations 
with IT Park neighbors and development of a suitable Environmental and Social Management 
Plan will be conducted. 
 
C. Proposed 
Changes 
 
·
Project Components
 
Component 1 and 3, Strengthening the Financial Sector through IT Use, would be revised as 
described below. Component 2 remains unchanged. Annex 2 displays the proposed revised costs 
by components and activities. 
1. 
Component 1. Development of IT/ITES Sector ($5.30m). 
The scope of
 
Component 1 
remains unchanged. A reallocation of $300,000 from Component 3 to Component 1 has been 
requested. The reallocation would contribute to funding the $450,000 undergrounding of a high 
voltage transmission line over the IT Park has been requested. The difference in funds will be 
matched within Component 1. No safeguards are being triggered by the funding of the 
undergrounding. 
2. 
Component 2. Development of an IT Skills Program ($2.00m). 
Unchanged 
3. 
Component 3. Strengthening the Financial Sector through IT Use ($.7m and $3.11m in 
counterpart funds). 
The modernization of BoB through an IT system program (Component 3a) 
remains unchanged and is nearing completion. The TA to develop a Financial sector IT 
development strategic plan (Component 3b) is completed. The establishment of an inter-bank 
electronic fund transfer clearing system (EFTCS - Component 3c) is being implemented 
separately from the project after bilateral assistance from the Reserve Bank of India was secured 
earlier this year. As such, Component 3c would be replaced with two new sub-components, 
described below. The Ministry of Finance has formally requested the re-allocation of USD 
Page  8
8
500,000 of available Component 3 funds initially allocated to the EFTCS to the following 
priority activities. RMA’s counterpart funding of $450,000 remains unchanged.  
New Component 3c. Upgradation of the IT infrastructure of the Royal Security Exchange of 
Bhutan
(estimated cost: USD 253,000)  
The estimated project completion date for upgrading the IT infrastructure of the Royal Security 
Exchange is 
30
th
 June 2012, within the project implementation period.  Recent Initial Public 
Offerings (IPOs) have resulted in a large increase in the number of shareholders, from 17,654 in 
2009 to 41,734 as of September 2010. This number is likely to increase as the new banking 
licenses are requiring banks to divest up to 30% of their assets. There are serious process and 
internal control weaknesses in RSEBL’s current systems. The technology investment for capital 
market development to manage risk is linked to the third area of the PDO, namely “strengthening 
the financial sector through the deployment of technology”.  
 
New Component 3d. Financial inclusion
(estimated cost: USD 247,000).  
RMA has requested support from the project in  (i) assisting in the establishment and drafting of 
the Financial Inclusion Policy (FIP); (ii) creating an enabling regulatory and supervisory 
framework for MFIs and branchless banking; (iii) organizing an outreach mission in selected 
neighboring countries to meet with regulators and practitioners;  (iv) promoting financial literacy 
throughout the country through workshops, education, and the media; and (v) providing training 
to RMA supervisors and other stakeholders on microfinance and financial inclusion.  The 
estimated cost of these activities is USD 247,000. The planned activities directly support 
improved access to finance as per the Project Development Objective. Completion date of all 
activities is within the project implementation period. 
 
·
Results Monitoring Arrangements
 
Outcome Indicator
.
The MTR concluded that the Project has generated jobs across sectors. It is 
therefore proposed to modify the scope of the outcome indicator to include the cumulative job 
creation in the IT/ITES sector, as initially planned, as well as jobs created in other sectors 
directly as a result of training supported through the Project. The Project Outcome indicator 
“Cumulative job creation in the IT/ITES Sector in the IT Park” would now read “Cumulative job 
creation in the IT/ITES Sector in the IT Park 
and related activities
”. The target values would 
remain unchanged. 
Output indicators. 
1. 
Component 1 Output indicators. Indicators and targets remain unchanged. 
2. 
Component 2 Output indicators. Indicators and targets remain unchanged. 
3. 
Component 3 Output indicators. Component 3 output indicators would be revised to 
account for the new scope of the financial sector component. Component 3a’s output indicator 
“Number of financial transactions by using ATMs per year” would now focus on Bank of 
Bhutan’s transactions only and now read “Number of financial transactions by using ATMs 
at
BoB
per year”. The following two other indicators would be removed, since the implementation 
of a national payment systems is now conducted outside the Project: 
·
Value of financial transactions by using ATMs per year 
Page  9
9
·
Volume of fund transfer transactions among banks channeled through the EFT system per 
year 
They would be replaced with the following output indicators, for which baselines were 
established during the October 2010 Mid-term Review (see Annex 3): 
·
Percentage of district coverage for financial literacy campaign 
·
Percentage automation of stock exchange trading, settlement, and delivery with straight 
through processing 
Key Performance Indicators.
 Key performance indicators would be modified accordingly. 
“Volume of fund transfer transactions among banks channeled through the EFT system per year” 
would be removed, while “Number of financial transactions by using ATMs per year” would 
focus on BoB transactions. 
·
Increased job creation in the IT/ITES sector supported by the project; 
·
Number of companies successfully incubated in the IT Park; 
·
Percent of students trained are successfully employed by the private sector; 
·
Number of financial transactions by using ATMs 
at
BoB
per year 
 
·
Institutional Arrangements 
 
Project Covenants.
 Due to changes in the scope of the financial sector component, it is proposed 
that the operation of the Financial Sector IT Task Force and IT Technical Working Group are 
removed as a covenant under the Financing Agreement. While these two committees have been 
active, the Mission and RGOB agreed that the implementation of revised project activities does 
not warrant their inclusion as covenant. In addition, it is proposed to remove the covenant 
requiring that the Task Force on IT Skills Development is maintained at all times of 
implementation. It is preferable to merge this Task Force – currently active - under the Program 
Steering Committee, since the members of this Task Force are also members of the PSC. 
 
While no changes in institutional structure are proposed, the composition of Project 
Implementation staff of the RMA has changed (See Annex 4). RMA is the Implementation 
Agency for Component 3 since it has primary responsibility for ensuring the development of a 
sound financial system.  The staffing of the RMA Implementation team has been revised to 
reflect the change in the component’s scope. The team consists of eight RMA staff: a Project 
Director (Director Financial Regulation and Supervision Department, (FRSD)), the former 
Project Director of the previous RMA sub-component ; a Project Manager (FRSD); two IT 
technical staff, one procurement officer, one finance officer, one Project Coordinator and one 
project secretary. The team will be responsible for overall project implementation and 
coordination with related organizations with regard to the RSEBL and financial inclusion sub-
components, under the project PIA.  The newly appointed Project Director, RMA’s Director of 
Financial Regulation and Supervision Department was the initial Project Director at Project 
effectiveness until a new team was appointed in June 2009. Private-public stakeholder 
committees and working groups 
1
have been established to guide overall policy formulation and 
1
Financial Inclusion Executive Committee and Working Group and the Capital Market Working Group.

implementation of the FIP and capital market IT projects, and RMA will work closely with these 
committees.  
 
·
Financing and reallocation 
 
Counterpart funding. 
Counterpart funding has increased from an initial amount of USD 2.43m to 
USD 4.78m, as a result of an increased investment from the Bank of Bhutan on the 
implementation of their Core Banking Solution (Component 3a).
