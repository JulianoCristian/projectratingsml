                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project has been under implementation for six years and is scheduled to close on June 30, 2013 following a closing date extension of one year. Progress against the project
                         development objective (PDO) has been exceeded. While the IT Park is the visible infrastructure part, the main outcome of the PSD Project is the now 1,109 young Bhutanese with
                         value-added jobs (exceeding the target of 700), trained and employed thanks to a private sector-led model. This represents almost a quarter of the total unemployed Bhutanese with
                         a school diploma when the Project started in 2007. Other achievements include:
                         (1) First economic zone fully operated by private sector and with public/private investments, with two international tenants signed in 2013.
                         (2) Investment climate reforms triggered by IT Park tender preparation (amended foreign direct investment (FDI) policy, economic development policy, draft public private partnership
                         policy)
                         (3) New industry standards/technology transfer brought by FDI investor
                         (4) Micro and small enterprise development/innovation through the Bhutan Innovation and Tech Center (BITC), from which 3 ventures out of 13 have already graduated (5 located in
                         BITC, 8 virtual)
