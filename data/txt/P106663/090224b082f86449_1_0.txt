Project Development Objectives

 Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
 The project development objective is to improve the efficiency of the paved municipal road network. Efficiency will be improved as a result of
 improvements to the institutional framework used by the Borrower in four key areas to deliver adequate transport conditions to users (planning,
 environmental licensing, participation of private sector, and execution), combined with improvements in the condition of the paved municipal road
 network.


 Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project Objective?

               PMS has been partially developed but has not been in operation yet. A first PMS had been purchased in late 2000 but was never
               operational due to high level of complexity. A more pragmatic approach was undertaken during the Project execution with an in-house
               robust system. The DER successfully installed the database system of the road inventory and geo-references of state and municipal road
               network. A technical assistance to add a management module to this system to conclude the PMS, is underway. The PMS is however not
               operational to date.
