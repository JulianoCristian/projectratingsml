                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective is to improve the efficiency of the paved municipal road network. Efficiency will be improved as a result of improvements to the
                         institutional framework used by the Borrower in four key areas to deliver adequate transport conditions to users (planning, environmental licensing, participation of
                         private sector, and execution), combined with improvements in the condition of the paved municipal road network.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?
