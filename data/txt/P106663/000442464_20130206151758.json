The\n            allocation is necessary for following reasons: (i)\n            optimizing the use of the proceeds of the parent loan by\n            distributing the unallocated amount between works,\n            non-consultant services and consultant services in support\n            to the state program of rehabilitation of municipal paved\n            roads; and (ii) goods, non-consultant services, training and\n            consultant services to support institutional strengthening\n            activities mainly to the one of the beneficiary entities,\n            the State Secretariat of Transport.
