A. STRATEGIC CONTEXTAND RATIONALE

1. Countryandsector issues
The short-term strategy o fthe Lula government, centered on maintaining fiscal discipline while
swiftly addressing the reductiono f extreme poverty andinequality, is havingresults. Some
indicators are the dramatic decrease incountry risk factors, lowered inflation, and improved
business conditions to foster economic growth and employment. At the same time, the PT-led
government has a long-term commitment to achieving sustainable development objectives:
gaining approval for long overdue reforms inthe pension andtax systems, creating a framework
for universal access to social and infrastructure services, and reversing acute degradation o f
environmental quality. Inline with its fiscal discipline, the Federal Government has asked the
Bank to provide direct lending assistance to credit-worthy municipalities since they are
responsible for providing most local services and for enforcing environmental quality standards.

Inmost Braziliancities, there are stilllargedifferences inservice quality acrossincome levels and
geographical regions. It is estimated that between 30 to 50 percent o f the poorest segments o f the
urban population lack adequate access to services of good quality or have no services at all. On
average less than 15 percent o fwastewater is treated, and about 70 percent o f collected solid waste
is dumpedwithout adequate sanitary and environmental controls. This situation translates into
persistently badhealth indicators inthe poorest 70 percent o f the population andimplicit poor
quality ofurbanlife, especially for the poor.

Integrated approaches to the interrelatedproblems o furbanpoverty, environmental degradation
and better quality o f life have enhanced the benefits o f a wide range o f development interventions.
These include a social consensus onpolicies for urbandevelopment andmunicipal development,
rehabilitation o f slums and degraded areas, efficient expansion and operation o f local services, and
a comprehensive framework for water andland management.

2. Rationalefor Bankinvolvement

Municipal Strutegy. Brazil's public sector is highly decentralized: states and municipalities
account for about 40 percent o f all public sector revenues and expenditures o f about R$480 billion
(about US$160 billion), representing 24 percent of gross investment. A large part o f social
expenditures are also financed by municipalities: 31percent of primary and secondary education,
20 percent o f health and 82 percent o f housing and urban expenditures. Municipal management
has improved significantly in recent years, largely as a result o f federal measures to control
inflation in 1995 and the passing o f the Federal Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL) in2000. In2001,
68.5 percent o f municipalities had surpluses, against only 13 percent in 1995. Despite these
results, municipalities still face enormous challenges: rapid and often unplanned urbanexpansion,
with consequent increases inpoverty, deterioration inquality o f life and degraded environmental
quality. According to the Bank-financed Water and Sanitation Sector Modemization Program
(PMSS), Brazil needs to invest some R$170 billion only to meet the goal o f universal access to
water supply and sanitation services by 2020. However, assessments carried out by the federal
institutions increases the amount needed to US$385 billion, when complementary investments
mainly on drainage and population resettlement are included into the equation. The current
investment level is about a tenth o f this figure. This demonstrates the huge financing gap to




                                                                                                      7

address the unmet demand for urban environment investments and basic service provision at the
municipal level.

Since the Constitution o f 1988, municipalities have found issues such as poverty reduction, basic
services provision and environmental rehabilitationlaid squarely at the local level. There i s strong
evidence and increasing social recognition o f the linkages among these issues: problems stemming
from uncontrolled urbandevelopment, illegal occupation andpollution o f urbanwatersheds,
flooding o f low-lying areas unsuitable for housing development, landslides on slums located on
unstable hillsides, anduncollected anduntreated garbage affect the urbanpoor more acutely than
anyother segment o fthe population.

To date, the regulations o fthe FiscalResponsibility Law have constrained municipal accessto
public sources o f financing for investments. The National Monetary Council's policies have also
limitedmunicipalities from obtaining financing from sources such as CAIXA andBNDES and
from municipal finds such as SOMMA inthe State o fMinas Gerais. A Central Bank resolution
issued inNovember 2002 limits the financing allowed to all Brazilian municipalities to R$200
million. As a result, CAIXA and BNDES had a backlog o f financing applications for the public
sector totaling some R$5.3 billion inDecember 2003. The highmarket rate for long-term loans in
Brazil (about 18 percent) has also preventedmunicipalities from borrowing from private banks.

Withinthis context, the GOBhas asked the Bank to providepolicy and lending support to
municipalities like Betim to pilot a new approach to the government's sustainable development
objective ofreducingpoverty and improvingquality o f life andenvironmental quality ina fiscally
responsible framework. Giventhe size o fBrazil's financing gap andthe limitedresources that can
be allocated byinternational development agencies, the Bankhas responded with support to a
municipal lending strategy which involves wholesale, direct financing, pooling, guarantees, and
TA to municipalities where replicable models canbe developedincities o fvaryingsizes (small,
medium, large and metropolitan regions). Buildingupon its cross-sectoral expertise, the Bank's
emergingmunicipal strategy inBrazil differs from most domestic financing programs, which tend
to be sector-oriented, and do not generally respond to these multi-sectoral urbanpriorities and
challenges at the municipal level.

To meet the existing unfinishedmunicipal reform agenda, municipalities still seek assistance in
the financing o f investments and inthe improvement o ftheir capacity to effectively address
challenges inbothpolicy andmanagement more broadly, and inintegrated service provision more
specifically. It is plausible that loans to municipalities o f about US$700 million per year for
investments and technical assistance to bringbest practices to municipal and environmental
management, combined with a fiture program o f guarantees from intemational financing agencies
like the Bank, the IDB, and the JBIC, will be instrumental inleveragingthe internal funds needed
to close the financing gap for urbanenvironment investments, basic service provision andpoverty
reduction at the municipal level.

Betim Strategy.Betim, an industrial city within the Belo Horizonte Metropolitan Area (RMBH) in
the state o fMinas Gerais, will be a pilot case for direct and pooled lending to municipalities while
providing inputs for a broadmunicipal strategy for poverty- quality o f life -basic service provision
and environment-focused investments. Itwill also inform the development o f a template o f




                                                                                                     8

methodologies that can be applied ina wholesaling approach implementedinpartnership with
Brazilian financial anddevelopment institutions.

Betim i s an excellent case for this pilot experience since, like other Brazilian municipalities within
metropolitan areas, it has witnessed rapid, unplannedurbanexpansion, with highsocial inequality
andpoor settlements concentrated on its periphery. With a HumanDevelopment Index o f 0.775,
Betim ranks 1.187thamong Brazil's 5.600 municipalities o fBrazil, and 138thamong Minas
Gerais's 853 municipalities, inspite o fbeing the second ranked municipality inthe state interms
o f state revenue andtax collection. This sharp contrast reflects a reality faced bymostperipheral
cities o fmetropolitan areas o f attracting rural migrants andthe poorest residents o f the capital to
nearby cities insearch o fjobs andmore affordable services. This process, however, has not been
followed bythe necessary public goods and services to address the needs o f such population.
From 1991-2000, Betim grew by 6.5 percent per year, representing the highest intra-regional
migration (27.6% o f the total) inMinas Gerais inthe last two decades, compared to 1.2percent in
Belo Horizonte and2.4 percent inthe RMBH.Today, almost all o f its population o f 320,000 lives
inthe municipality's urbancore. In2000,29 percent ofthe populationwas considered livingin
poverty and45 percent o f the families had an income o f less than three times the minimumwage,
or about R$720, equivalent to US$1.6 per day for a family o f 5. About 20 percent o f the total
population receives cash financial assistance from federal andmunicipal social safety net
programs.

The Betim River is a tributary o f an important regional river, the Paraopeba, andone o f its main
pollution sources. The Paraopebariver decontamination is a critical goal for the State Water
Management Policy and the Regional River Basin Committee due to two mainreasons: (i)            the
river downstream impact on cities o f about 150,000 inhabitants; and (ii)    the river importance as
one the tributaries o f the S b Francisco River, which i s a regional reference. Inaddition, the
Municipalityo f Betim shares with the neighboring Municipality o f Contagem ,the reservoir
"Varzea das Flores", which responds for 20% ofthe water supply to the metropolitan region o f
Belo Horizonte. The protection o fthis reservoir is critical for the metropolitan region.

Inlinewiththat, another keyelement inthe rationale for theproject isthe interventionofthe
FederalPublic Ministry inMay 2000, which legally bound the municipality to meet its
environmental obligation concerningthe discharge o f raw wastewater into the municipality's river
or face large fees andpenaltiesuntilthose obligations are fulfilled. This action was the result o f
intense mobilizationbycivil society requiring the state and municipal governments to meet
environmental goals. This is becoming an increasing popular mechanism to force municipalities to
be accountable for their environmental obligations. The legal suit was settled through an
agreement reached between the Public Ministry on one side andthe Municipality o f Betimand
COPASA (the State water utility) on the other. The agreement requires that by 2005, all
wastewater discharged into the city's rivers be treated. Betim has incorporated the lessons from
the Public Ministry suit and the subsequent settlement into its strategy for improving urban
environmental quality andreducingpoverty.

Despite its highincidence o f poverty and environmental degradation, Betimhas pursued sound
governance with different parties ingovernment for the past 12 years consistently supporting long-
term development and a reform agenda that have resultedinstrong fiscal performance. This
performance was initially supported bythe Bank-financed state municipal development project


                                                                                                      9

(SOMMA), o f which the municipality o f Betimwas one o f the few best-practice examples in
financial management. Within the framework o f its long-term development vision, Betimhas
developed innovativepolicies andtechnical tools that are aheado f most municipalities inMinas
Gerais. For instance, a new policy approach to collection o f local ISS tax helped to legalize about
700 small andmedium-size businesses inthe last two years. Technical units inthe municipality
developed a powerful GIS tool that provides integrated information to the municipal secretariats,
including a cadastre base for local taxes, and even information on health andpublic services at the
household level. There is also a transparent, intemet-based procurement system with all
administrative processes on-line for fullpublic disclosure.

Betimhas also substantial current net revenue. Although its large low-incomepopulation
generates low local tax receipts, the concentration of industries inits territory brings sizeable
intergovernmental ICMS transfers (R$260 millionin2002). Since 1970, FIAT andPetrobras have
made substantial investments inBetim, together generating about 60 percent o f the municipality's
fiscal revenue. Betimcan meet FRLrequirements andmaintain a reasonable debt profile over the
next few years due to the size of the proposedWorld Bank loan and the conditions pertaining to it,
Betim's comfortable financial situation, and its considerable capacity for indebtedness and
repayment. This statement i s confirmedby the financial and fiscal analyses carried out duringthe
project preparationpresented inAnnex 10.

Considering that one o f the overall objectives o f the Bank's newmunicipal strategy is to help
move creditworthy municipalities, inthe medium to longterm, towards accessing market sources
o f capital, Betim offers the Bank a representative andtimely opportunity to demonstrate and learn
from the pursuit o f such a goal inBrazil.

3. Higher-level objectives to which the project contributes
The Betimproject will contribute to the achievement o f Goal 7 ofthe MDGs-namely increasing
the number o f people with access to improved sanitation. Itwill address key elements o fthe
CAS'S sustainability pillar, such as increasing access to basic services associated with
improvement o f quality o f life, environmental rehabilitation andprotection through participatory
mechanisms to develop institutional capacity. It will also be aligned to activities that promote
issues highlightedunder the equity andcompetitiveness pillars at the municipal level, including
promoting basic services to the poor and other activities o f social inclusion while increasing
Betim's attractiveness for residential and economic activities and increase its strategic role inthe
metropolitan economy, respectively.

ProjectBackground
Unregulated occupation o f floodplains and steep slopes bypoor households over the last three
decades has hinderedBetim from extendingits basic infrastructure city-wide, andhas kept it from
implementing comprehensive interventions to address water quality. Wastewater produced bythe
BetimRiver basin's 230,000 inhabitants is discharged untreated into the Betim River andits
tributaries, significantly worsening public health, the urbanenvironment, and the quality of life for
Betiminhabitants, especially the poor, and for downstream populations. Unregulatedoccupation
has also increased silting o f rivers anddrainage systems andhas reducedretention time in
watersheds, causing increasingly serious floods, which primarilyaffect economic activity inthe
city generally, and affect living conditions inlow-income neighborhoodsbordering rivers and
 channels inparticular. Floods have a serious impact on the city's main roads and cause congestion,
economic loss from material damage, and disruption o f economic flows.

US$ 12million equivalent insewerage andwater treatment investments will be provided by the
 state water company (COPASA), under an agreement signed betweenthis company andthe
municipality, as an essential part o fproject activities. Basedon updated information from the
Bank-finaced W&S project PMSS 11, COPASA is among the most efficient state water companies
 inBrazil. This company provides services to apopulationof 13millionin560municipalities of
Minas Gerais. Inurban areas, its water service coverage achieve 97 percent o fthe total population,
while the national average i s 90.4 percent. However its wastewater treatment raking is well below
the national average, only 27.7 percent compared to 67.2 percent. To reduce this gap, COPASA
has invested some US$100million per year (78,3 percent own resources) over the past decade,
two thirds o f this amount on sanitation services. Simultaneously, COPASA has managed to
maintain the W&S services costs level below the national average, R$l.17 per m3 comparedto
R$1.40.

The legal agreement regulating this transfer was signed on December 19,2003, bythe State o f
Minas Gerais the Municipalityo f Betim. Prior to the signing, the Bankreviewed and found the
draft agreement acceptable to ensure the commitment o f COPASA to provide the requiredproject
counter part funds. According to the agreement, COPASA should transfer to the Municipality the
equivalent o f up to US$500,000 beginning inFebruary 2004, to complement ongoing municipal
investments, which are counterpart investments o f the Bank-financed operation.


                                                                                                   11

As described inSection A.2, as a result o f a legal suit by civil society groups andthe Ministe`rio
Pdblico, the Municipality o f BetimandCOPASA ( as the concessionaire o fthe water and
sanitation services) have undertaken to treat all wastewater discharged into Betim's rivers by
2005, under penalty o fheavy fines. The Bank project focuses on the BetimRiver basin where 70
percent o f the municipality's population lives, and thus is decisive inhelpingBetim and COPASA
to comply with this agreement. Inaddition, the project will enhance the municipality's
institutional capacity to improve policies andregulation andtherefore increase the sustainability o f
urban, social, andenvironmental services.

Other important issues:

Integration within the BHMR: Although Betim has achieved an economic strategic position within
the RMBHas defined by the 1974's RMBHMaster Plan, substantial improvement inintegrating
municipal and metropolitan policies and actions is still needed. A critical part o f this strategy for
transforming Betim into the second metropolitan city was by concentrating very large economic
investments inthe municipality through FIAT andPetrobrhs, and a large cluster o f smaller
industries and service companies associated with these industries supplychain, A second goal, of
making Betim more attractive to highincome residents andpromoting investment on local
commerce and services, has been less successful. The project expects to fillpart o f this gap by
providing support to be preparationofMunicipal Strategic Development Plan aligned with the
process of development o f a new Metropolitan Plan, which will be supported by Cities Alliance.
Also by implementing planningandregulatorymechanisms to further expand the industrial base
inasustainable way andbycreatingeconomic andquality oflife conditions to attract academic
andresearch institutions inareas where Betim is competitive. Finally, by enhancing the city's
institutional capacity and its quality o f life through the provision o f effective socio-economic and
environmental services.

Capacityfor formulating and implementingpolicies. This front constitutes an enormous challenge
for municipalities inBrazil, andthe challenge is even greater for those municipalities inperipheral
areas o f metropolitan regions. A critical aspect o f this challenge concerns the provision o f efficient
urban and environmental services inunregulated settlements located infragile environmental
areas. The Municipalityo f Betimhas been implementing its long-term development vision ina
way that local advantages andmetropolitan opportunities play a key role. With project support in
technical assistance and investments, Betim expects to reach a higher level o f institutional and
physical capital that will give the municipality a better strategic advantage within the RMBH.

Alignment to state developmentpolicy . Inspite o fbeing the thirdrankedstate inBrazil interms o f
GDP, with a HumanDevelopment Index o f0.779, Minas Gerais ranks 1lth Brazil's 27  among
states. The improvement o f the state's IDHis the maingoal o f the current state government. The
project offers a timely contribution to pursue such a goal. Inaddition, the project i s aligned and i s
expected to contribute to the implementation and achievement o f its the state government's
policies on Fiscal Efficiency Gains and Delivery Improvement at municipal level.

Environmental institutional capacity. Local capacity for mainstreamingenvironmental regulation
andcontrol is another key areathat affects urbanmunicipalities, mainlythose inmetropolitan
areas. Urbanenvironmental degradation has adversely affected decisions on investment in


                                                                                                       12

economic activities and inhousing. Betim is responding by improving its institutional capacity for
regulating environmental issues, including looking to extend the environmental licensing mandate
it holds from the state environmental agency to reduce the transactional costs o finvestinginthe
municipality. Secondly, the Municipality seeks to improve the qualityo f life andthe environment
inorderto promoteamoresustainable development.

Regional river basin management. The Betimriver i s one ofthe maincontamination sources o f
the Paraopeba river, which is a tributary o fthe SBo Francisco River. The "Varzea das Flores"
reservoir is shared bythe Municipality of Betimand the Municipality of Contagem. The project
activities will prevent the pollution o f the ParaopebaRiver. Inaddition the project has already
leverage actions from COPASA to execute the investments neededto prevent the discharge o f
waste water into the Varzea das Flores reservoir. This will be achieved through an agreement
signed inDecember 19,2003 by COPASA and the Municipality o f Contagem. The total
investment amounts to US$40 million, o fwhich US$28 million correspond to COPASA and
US$12 million to the Municipality o f Contagem.

Social development. Betim devotes 64 percent o f its municipalbudgetto social services (health,
education, andsocial assistance), and about 20 percent o fthe populationbenefits from federal and
municipal cash transfer programs for poverty reduction. However, the efficiency andquality o f
these programs need improvement, especially inameliorating targeting, reducing duplication o f
coverage andimproving their impact upon the poor. The project will provide technical assistance
to enhance institutional capacity incoordinating, implementing, managing, monitoring and
evaluating both social development and social safety net programs inthe municipality.

ComponentI:MunicipalPoliciesandInstitutionalCapacityStrengthening
Component Iwill focus on strengthening policies, finance andmanagement capacities o f the
Betim Municipality inkey thematic areas.




                                                                                                 13

1.Governance andplanning. The project includes assistanceinrefining and implementing the
long-tenn development vision of the Municipality. The project will help Betim apply state-of-the-
art approaches to prepare a MunicipalStrategic Development Plan, including: policy options
analysis andcost implications, proposals for altemative development goals relatedto fiscal
performance, methodologies for stakeholder impact evaluation and consensus building, indicators
and evaluation criteria for impact of policy actions, and detailedmonitoring o f financial
performance. The planwill be drawn up ina participatory framework, with consultation o f
stakeholders including those with limited opportunities to express their voices, like children, the
elderly, and the destitute. Specifically, the project will help update the UrbanMaster Plan and
review major institutional, financial, and territorial planning issues to be discussed inthe context
o fthe RMBH.

2. Local serviceprovision: The project will help strengthen municipal policies, regulation, and
management capacity for a broadrange o f local basic services through:
a. An assessment ofpolicies and managementcapacity: Policy, regulation andmanagement
arrangements will be assessedto assist Betim inestablishing an appropriate institutional and legal
framework for efficient delivery o f local services. This assessment will: assess andmonitor the
metropolitan region's impact on local services; foster dialogue on improving efficiency with
surrounding municipalities; identify altemative deliverymodels; andmeasure efficiency o f current
service delivery models and their associated costs, subsidies, andtariffs.
b. Thecreation of an information systemfor institutional andpublic control. This system will help
strengthen the Municipality's capacity to fulfill regulatory responsibility for local service
provision and will enhance governance by givingpublic access to information on expected and
achieved quality of local services. To develop this system the project will assess current quality o f
services, determine their contractually required quality, promote user consultations, and establish
service benchmarks.
c. Thecreation of a basic infrastructure cadastre. A cadastre o fbasic infrastructure will
complement the existingmunicipal geographically referenced management database. The
additional information, mainly on macro andmicro drainage, will be used indeveloping a
Drainage Management Plan. This plan is intum a key element o f the UrbanMaster Plan and the
Environmental Management Plan.

3. Environmental Management. The project will strengthen the Municipal Secretariat o f
Environment's institutional andtechnical capacity through:
a. Environmental policies, regulation, and management. A MunicipalEnvironmental Management
Planwill be developed inline with the Municipal Strategic Development Plan, addressing issues
such as policy instruments; financing mechanisms; administrative procedures; an environmental
database; transparency and public participation; and monitoring and evaluationmechanisms. In
addition, this activity will aim to strengthen the Secretariat o f Environment's technical capacity to
execute its licensingmandate conferred on it by the state environmental agency.
b. Waterresources management and water quality monitoring. The project will helpBetim
strengthen Minas Gerais' water resources policies and institutional systems through the Paraopeba
River Basin Committee, which is responsible for monitoring and enforcing water quality standards
for the BetimRiver. The project will complement the Committee's technical capacity through
specific assistance to update its hydro geological and geo-technical database; expand its cadastre
o fwater users and pollutiondischarge; develop decision-making models for water withdrawal and




                                                                                                     14

discharge, and map landuse and aptitude. This systemwill bethe basis for the development and
implementation ofproject tools to monitor water quality.
c. Monitoring the quality of industrial efluent discharge into water resources bodies: the project
will support the effort of the MunicipalEnvironmental Secretariat incontrollingthe quality of
water bodies through improving this agency capacity of monitoringand enforcing industrial
compliance with environmental regulation
d.Environmental Education Program: An environmental educationprogramwill bedeveloped
and implementedto increasethe population's awarenesso f local environmental vulnerabilities and
of measuresto safeguardthat environment.

Component11: Social Inclusion
Component I1will finance short-, medium- and long-term initiatives to improve living conditions
for poor andvulnerable families. It will also strengthenmunicipal social policies andprograms
through:

1.Resettlefamilies living in risk-prone areas. A comprehensiveresettlementprogramaims to
improve the livingconditions of 820 poor families now living on floodplains. The program
provides for a socially sound compensatorypolicy; resettlement innearbyhousingwith basic
infrastructure inan establishedcommunity; legal and social assistanceduringthe resettlement
process; and support for income generation. Annex 11summarizesthe resettlement program.

2. Supportforphysical improvements inpoor communities. Theproject will buildon `kit reboco, '
an existing municipal grants program for criticalhome repair, which entails a collaborative
approachbetweenthe Municipality and communities inwhich the former suppliesthe material
andthe latter executesthe home upgradeswith assistancefrom the municipal social team.

3. Strengthen municipal social policies andprograms. The project will strengthenthe Municipal
Social Assistance Secretariat's (SEMAS) policies andprograms through three keylines o f actions:
(a) a series o f studies and institutionalenhancement activities o f SEMAS, including: (i) a risk and
vulnerability assessment; (ii)  impact evaluation o f social policies andprograms; (iii)institutional
capacity assessment; and (iv) civil society andbusiness sector assessment; (b) financial support to
the physicalimprovements on the SEMAregionaloffices, including the social promotioninitiative
 `SalZodo Encontro ';and (c) evaluatethe federal social safety net programs that make cash
transfers to reducepoverty inBetim (BolsaFamilia), specifically their targeting criteria, gaps in
coverage, duplication with municipal cashtransfer programs, allocation transparency and
consistency, localmanagement, and databaseefficiency, aiming at (i)      informingthe Bolsa Familia
program by gauging their impact on the poor inBetim; and(ii)       identifyingthe linkages and
complementarities betweenthese short-term assistanceprograms and SEMAS' long-term social
development actions.

4. Lessonslearnedand reflectedinthe projectdesign

Urban lending in Brazil. The Bank has been supportingmunicipal development through lending
andother work since the 1970s. The first generationo furbanprojects focusedon sites and
services, slumupgrading, and metropolitan infrastructure. After passage of the 1988 Brazilian
constitution, the Bank's urban programs shifted to improving municipal managerial and fiscal
efficiency. This second generation o furbanprojects was supported byMunicipalDevelopment
Funds (MDFs) with the objective that participatingmunicipalities would eventually `graduate' and


                                                                                               16

start borrowing fi-om the capital market. An OperationalEvaluation Department assessment found
that the MDFshada significant impact on the ability o fparticipating municipalities to improve
their institutionalmanagementcapacity.

TheBrown Environmental Agenda (BEA): The Bank has financed state andmunicipalprojects
over a number o f decadesinBrazilwith the dual objective o freversing the lack ofbasic urban
services ando fcombating the resulting negative impacts on the urbanenvironment andon quality
o f life for city inhabitants. Traditionally, theseprojects were restricted to specific sectors. A first
generation o fUrbanWater Quality andPollutionControl (PQA) projects, implemented inthe
1 9 9 0demonstrated the importance o f adopting integrated andmulti-sectoral approachesto the
          ~ ~
problemo furbanpoverty associatedwith water quality andpollution control inthe urbanriver
basin setting. One key intervention o fthe PQAs was the urbanizationo f slums andthe
improvement o firregular settlements that are major contributors to the domestic pollutiono furban
water bodies, These projects providedkey lessons such as the importance of: (i)       developing sound
legal andinstitutional agreementsto promote appropriate relationships betweenstate and
municipal govemments inorder to enhanceproject implementation stability andminimize the
impact o fpolitical changes at the differentlevels; (ii) regional andmetropolitan issues
                                                          tackling
when addressingthe BEA at the locallevel; (iii)     implementingeffective subsidies mechanismsto
ensure good service quality and financial sustainability; and (iv) planningandimplementing basic
service provisioninan integrated mannerindensely populated andhighrisk areas, especially
those along river courseswhere the poor invariablysettle, inorder to improve the living
conditions ofmost vulnerable communities while reducing urbanwater pollution.

Social Inclusion. Recent experience andanalysis indicate that together with conventional poverty
reductionprograms, special measuresareneededto include most excluded populations. Important
aspects o f suchmeasures are: (i)    the geographical targeting o f areas, the so-called `pockets o f
poverty', that havenot beenreachedby conventional programs andprovided with basic services
becausethey are inareas o fhighenvironmental risk (flooding, landslides, etc) and are occupied by
families with no regularized landtitles; (ii)   ensuringthat populations such aswomen, youth, racial
andethic minoritiesare systematically includedinsuchprograms andhave equalaccess to
services andopportunities; and(iii)     ensuring that institutionalmechanisms are put inplace for
recognizing the citizenship rights o fpoorpopulations, includingtheir access to information andto
participate actively inthe design, implementation and evaluation o f development programs
targetedto them. A major outcome o f such inclusive social policieshasbeento increaseboththe
humanandsocial capital aswell as theeconomic opportunities ofpoorpopulations.

Urban Environmental Management. Theproject will also drawnuponthe lessonsfiom the
ColombiaUrbanEnvironmentalProject which one o fthe primaryobjectives was to support the
improvement o f environmental managementcapacity inthe country's urbanareas. Amongst the
lessonslearnt providedare: (i)    result andimpact indicators should be establishedupfiont for
effective managerial decision-making; (ii)     the availabilitynot only o fresourcesbut also o fthe
leadership andtechnical capacity o fthe executing agency are key to achieve expectedresults; (iii)
periodic consultative mechanisms with clients are critical to evaluate impacts andprovide a
channel for broader discussion on environmental priorities; (iv) an adequate documentation center
withininstitutions and a related dissemination planis importantto createaninstitutionalmemory
while makingfulluse o foutputs generated.

5. Alternatives consideredand reasonsfor rejection
Financing arrangements.The BDMG(SOMMA Project) andCAIXA showed keeninterest inco-
financingthe project but claimed that BACENresolutions severelylimitedpublic sector access to
their funds. Inparticular, Resolution 3049 o f28 November 2003 imposes extremely tight
constraints on funding for municipal governments.

Phased i~p~ementationthe large investmentprogram. Giventhe cost and complexities of
                           of
rehabilitatingthe BetimRiverbasin, the Municipality consideredthe alternative to undertake this
interventionincrementally over a longer periodoftime. Withthe Bank's financial andtechnical
support, the Municipality decided for anintegrated approachto financing a comprehensive
investmentprogramwhile addressinginstitutionalandpolicy strengthening, includingimproved
public sector management o f social programs, local serviceprovision andenvironmental
enforcement. This approachis feasible giventhe healthy finances o fthe municipality andit will
allow social and economic benefits to accrue soonerwithin the context o f a sustainable
development framework. Furthermore, it is unlikelythat the Ministerio Publicowould have
acceptedthe phasedapproach.

Phased construction of wastetreatmentplant. For the construction o fthe plant, two alternatives
were considered: to buildthe entire plantto meet the needs o fthe populationin2020, or to build
halfo fthe plant to meet the needso fthe population in2010. The project adoptedthe second
alternative since it offered lower present value o f economic costs. Inaddition, experience from
other projects showedthat the technical parametersadopted, such asper capita water
consumption, tended to overestimatethe capacity o f equipment required, whichcouldmeanthat
part o fthe investment would lie idle.

C. IMPLEMENTATION

1. Partnershiparrangements
The project does not entailpartnershiparrangementswithother international financingagencies,

2. Institutionalandimplementationarrangements
The project willbe executedbythe Municipality o fBetim. The BetimPlanning Secretariat will be
responsible for coordination, through aUGPcomprisingan executive coordinator andthree
specific coordinators for procurement, finance, and institutionalstrengthening. These coordinators
will bemunicipal officials secondedto the UGP.To reinforce thisbody, the project willhire a
team o fconsultants experienced inBank-financed operations. The Municipalitychose this option
becausetraining its own officials inBankprocedures would be aprolonged processthat would run
the risk of falling short o fthe required standard andwould serve no usefulpurpose for the
Municipality after the conclusion o fthe project. The team o fconsultants includes an executive
coordinator to mitigate changesinthe UGP's compositionwhenthe municipaladministration
changes. The UGP will coordinate activities o f the four project executing agencies: the
Secretariatso fEnvironment, Social Assistance, Housing, andCivil Works and Public Services, as
shown inAnnex 6.

COPASA's role. This agency will fundthe sewerageandwastewater investments estimated for the
project. COPASA funds will be transferred to Betim to contract the work, through an agreement
already signed andineffect. A representative from COPASA will participate inthe UGPto


                                                                                                18

closely monitor compliance with this agreement. COPASA will continue to executeprograms
such as industrialeffluent control and financingof sewerageconnections. After investments have
ended, COPASA will continue to provide water supply services as determinedbythe concession
contract.

Capacity of munj c ~ a l i t yimplementation. Assessments o fprocurement and financial management
found no major capacity constraints. Assessment ofprocurement capacity risk found that the
Municipality i s experienced inimplementing projects with features similar to those o fthis project
andis consistent inthe application ofrules for procurement for goods andservicesunder Law
8666193.The risk associatedwith the lack o f experienceinBank-financedprocurement will be
removedbytraining and support from a full-timeprocurement specialist and financial
management.

3. Monitoring and evaluationof outcomeslresults
Datafor the project's outcome andresults indicators will come from five sources. Quarterly and
annual project managementreports will be generatedbythe project's management information
system, which will integrate physicaloutputs andfinancial project information. The project
managementunitwill carry out special surveys. The ParaopebaWater Resources Committee,
supportedbythe project, will prepare special water quality monitoringsystem reports. Finally,
beneficiaries will be surveyed at time zero, midterm review and at project closure.

4. Sustainability
Theborrower commitment to this project is extremely high.The Municipality o fBetimhas taken
several steps to that end. Itmaintained, over several years, rigorous control ofmunicipalfinances
to sustain a highlevelo fdebt andinvestment capacity. It obtained formal approval from the
municipal legislative body for the project's technical and financial proposals. Furthermore, the
Municipalityi s financing projectpreparation activities since the requestedPHRDhasnotbeen
received becausethe project was not listedinthe 2000 CAS.

Regarding existing contracts, the Municipality's ongoing civil works contracts amounting to US$
14M are part o f the project intervention. Both the procurement process (following Law 8666) and
the civil works execution, have been assessed by the Bank. The Bank project team counts these
contract amounts as project counterpart funds.

~ u n j c ~elections and stakeholders consultation. Municipal elections will take place in2004.
             a l
Whenthe Bankproject teammet withthe mainopposition candidate, she affirmedthe project's
importance and assuredthe team that, should she win, she would start or ensure continuityto the
project immediately on taking office. Project preparation also involved consultation with
representativesof large and small industries present inBetim. FIAT andPetrobvcis,who have
made significant investments intheir 30 years inBetim, disclosedtheir plans for further
investment: FIAT will invest US$3 billionover the nextthree years, andPetrobrcis will invest an
averageof US$lOO millionper year inmaintenance and improvements.

Low connection rate to the seweragesystem. InBetim, 98 percent ofthe populationhas accessto
high-qualitywater supply. Seweragecoverage i s available to about 80 percent ofthe population,
butthe connection rateis only70percent, althoughthis is not low comparedto other areas. As
low connectionrates are generally a challenge to projects ofthis kind, the proposed


                                                                                                  19

implementation includes three mainresponsesinsupport to: COPASA's program o f financing
sewerage connections for low income households (24 monthly installments o f about US$1each,
carried out bytheir owntrained personnel to avoid faulty connections); sanitary education and
Betim's `kit reboco 'program o f grants to intra-householdconnection for the very poor.

Poor sewerageand solid waste collection system. Deficient operation ofthe sewerage systemis a
commonproblem for projects aimingto improve quality o f life andwater quality. The project
includes activities to improve efficiency o fthis system, modeled on programs such as "Caqa
Esgoto." The project will reroute garbage trucks, promote useo fthe system through the
environmental education program, andimprove street cleaning to mitigate runoff.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

1. Economic and financial
A complete economic cost benefit analysiswas conducted to determine the viability ofthe
proposedproject. The analysis demonstratesthe overallviability o f the project ando f its
individualcomponents. To determine the net incremental costs andbenefits, two scenarioswere


                                                                                               20

constructed, one with the project and one without. On the basis o f these scenarios, the net
incremental financial benefits andcosts o f the proposed investment program were assessedand
then adjusted for the impact o f taxes, subsidies, and extemalities to arrive at the economic flow o f
costs andbenefits. These cash flows were discounted at a rate o f 12percent, an estimated proxy o f
Brazil's opportunity cost o f capital. Costs include capital costs, operation and maintenance,
rehabilitation, resettlement, environmental mitigation, and contingencies. Economic benefits from
improved sanitation (sewerage connections, sewerage mains, and waste treatment plant), urban
drainage, andparks were estimated usingthe Contingent Valuation Method; benefits from the
urbanroads subcomponent were estimated usingthe HighwayDesign andMaintenance Standard
Model. Finally, comprehensive risk and sensitivity analyses tested the two scenarios and
confirmed the robustness o f the results.

The calculation o f the project's overall viability considered all project components (ineconomic
prices) as investments inmunicipal policies and institutional strengthening. Social inclusion and
project management components are considered as bases for service sustainability, ultimately
expressed inimproved access to urban services inBetim.Although these components' economic
benefits were not included, the project i s clearly feasible; a conservative estimate o f its economic
net present value (ENPV) is US$11.5 million; o f its Economic Internal Rate o f Retum (ERR),
20%. The Municipal Infrastructure andUrbanEnvironmental Rehabilitation component, which
accounts for 70% o f total project costs, was assessedindetail. Analyzed independently, this
component is clearly viable, with an ENPV o fUS$20.5 million and an EIRR o f 28%.

Giventhe importance o fthe project to the Municipality o fBetim's finances, and inthe absence o f
a revenue-eamingentity, the financial analysis assessedthe project's fiscal impact. Betim's fiscal
situation was projectedfor 2004-2014 as a base case from which sensitivity and risk analyses were
conducted, with assumptions based on the Municipality's performance to date. The analysis shows
that the Municipality is financially viable and able to assume the proposed loan. All the indicators
are well below recommendedceilings. Inaddition, free cash flow from operations reaches 20% o f
IRR,with aNPVo fUS$ 5.5 million, discounted by 12%.

The financial risk and sensitivity analyses also confirm the robustness o f Betim's finances. All
debt indicators are below the established ceilings, with probability greater than 77%. Personnel
costs are below the 60% established inthe Fiscal Responsibility Law, with a probability o f 78%,
and intemal cash generation i s higher than 30% inevery year, with a probability o f 54%. When all
riskvariables are analyzed simultaneouslyinadynamic world, the most important variables for
Betim are the ICMS and personnel costs. ICMS, although not under the control o f the
Municipality, i s not likely to decrease to a level that would pose a risk. Personnel costs are under
the Municipality's control and would put financial viability at risk ifthey were to increase by
12%. Therefore Betimmust watch these costs carefully and take steps to improve labor
productivity andmanagement efficiency while minimizingpolitical interference. Ifpersonnel
costs were to decrease by 2%, the municipality would save the equivalent of a month o ftax
revenue.

Betim's consolidated debt accounts for 17%o fnet revenues, a level well below the FRLceiling o f
120% o fnet revenues. The US$24M loan requestedby the municipality would increase the
consolidated debt to about 29%.

2. Technical
The project is technically sound. Detailed engineering studies havebeen carried out by qualified
consultants and the FederalUniversity o fMinas Gerais since 1994. These studies were conducted
as part of the longterm development plans o fthe municipalityand o f the regional water utility,
COPASA.

Water quality o f the Betim andParaopeba river basins, from the city o f Betimuntilthe Tres
Marias reservoir, have been modeled using a Qual2E. The modeling compared several treatment
alternatives, including complete reliance inthe self purification capacity o fthe rivers, and several
incremental levels o ftreatment inorder to achieve the water quality standard prescribedbythe
state environmental agency (FEAM). The models demonstrated that secondary treatment was
requiredto achieve the receiving body standard (IQA=3). It is important to mention that
municipalities andcities downstream the confluence o f the Betim andParaopeba andbefore the
Tres Marias reservoir have a combined population larger than 100,000. Inaddition, an economic
analysis was conducted to decide on the size, the level o f decentralizationo ftreatment and the
optimal construction phasingto meet peak demand inyear 2025. As a result, one large plant (part
o f the project) with a final capacity o f lM3/S(Central Plant) serving the core o fthe city (an
equivalent population o f 300,000), will be buildintwo phases. Seven other small plants with a
combined capacity o f about 100 Ips, serving different draining basins, are also considered inthe
plan. Three o f them have been already build, one is under construction and three more are
currently beenbid. These seven plants have been financed directly by COPASA andthey are not
included into the scope o f the project financedby the Bank. Large water quality management
systems, such as those o f Petrobras andFIAT, are satisfactory and are subject o f a close
monitoringby the state environment agency (FEAM) according to their operational license.

Detailed flood and drainage engineering has been preparedby the municipality with support of the
FederalUniversity o fMinas Gerais. It includes flooding models for runoff frequencies o f 2 to
1000years. Altematives to increase the flow capacity o f existing channels, retentionpondsto
reduce peak flows, andzoning alternatives were considered for technical, social and economic
feasibility. Floods with a frequency o f 50 years have been adopted for densely urbanized areas,
following standard practicedinBrazil and elsewhere. The engineering studies recommendedthe
construction o f five retentionponds inthe Riacho Areias basin, with a combined capacityto
storage 1,700,000 M 3 o f flood water. These retention systems inthe Riacho Areias basinwill
reduce peak flows to minimize expansion o f the channel which is a considerablymore expensive
alternative. The combination o f the retentionponds andthe own channel flow capacity will allow
to manage floods with 25 years frequency inthe Riacho Areias basin which has a lower
population density. The integratedwatershed operation o f the Betim basin, including adequate
operational practices inthe upstream Vargen das Flores reservoir, andthe Riacho Areias basin
system will allow to handle peak flows o f 50 years frequency (about 390 M3/S) inthe more dense
area o fthe municipality. The integrated analysis i s expected to significantly reduce the damages
andeconomic losseso fthe past few years due to flooding. Additionally, inthe case ofponds
located near urbanareas, its capacity was increased to allow for a safety factor o f flows with a
frequency o f 1,000 years.

Drainage works have been designed inan integrated approach together with sewage collectors,
resettlement o fpopulation living inflood-prone areas, zoning o f the flood plain, andconstruction
o fparallel roads and bike ways. This integrated approachwill reduce the cost associated to


                                                                                                    22

congestion andthe time spent intransportation by the beneficiary population. It is also expected
to reduce construction costs anddisturbances to the neighboring populationbecause o freductions
inconstruction time.

3. Fiduciary
Boththe financial management andprocurement capacity have been assessedand are filed with
the project documents.
The financial management assessment found that the project met Bankrequirements. The
assessment proposedthe use o f a financial management report andratedthe financial management
risk moderate to substantial. The assessment found no major risks requiring special
recommendationsor actions. An action plan has beenprepared.
The procurement capacity assessment found that the Municipality has implementedprojects
similar to this one, and it has consistently applied rules for procurement o f goods and services,
adhering to Law 8666/93. The risk associatedwith the lack of experience indealing with Bank-
financed procurement would be removed bytraining and support from a full-time procurement
specialist. The project is rated an average risk regardingprocurement.

4. Social
The project will address several social issues. The proposedresettlement from risk-prone areas
will increase social capital. The project will offer technical assistanceinenhancing municipal
social programs andinevaluating the impact o f federal cash transfer programs at the local level. It
will use beneficiary assessmentsto orient decisionmaking.

Key stakeholders will participate at several levels inthe project. Resettlement activities have
already entailed several consultations and have defined a participatory methodology to be
followed throughout implementation. Eachproject component will have activities to encourage
community participation -- for example, information and consultation sessions with communities,
media campaigns, andworkshops to promote appropriate use andcontrol o f public space.

5. Environmental
A comprehensive Environmental Assessment (EA) was made, including aResettlement Action
Plan, according to the Bank Safeguard Policies (see Annex 11). The EA evaluates existing
conditions, identifies potential direct andindirect environmental impacts, and proposes measures
to mitigate negative impacts and to enhance positive impacts. The Environmental Management
Plan summarizes these measures along with their associated costs, responsibilities, and schedule.
A public consultationwas carriedout anddocumented following the disclosureprocedures
recommendedby the Bank's environmental policy. The EA results andrecommendedmeasures
are incorporated inthe EMPandinto project components. Several consultationswere carried out
inpreparingthe project. Inaddition, aspartofthe environmental licensingprocess, the
environmental secretary andthe municipal environmental council consulted several times with
civil society organizations. These consultationswere coveredbynewspapers and radio, project
documentationwas made available at the municipal environmental secretariat, and safeguard
studies were made available at the InfoShop on January 30,2004

As part o f its objectives and design, the project has a strong environmental emphasis. Itwill
strengthen the institutional capacity o f SEMEIA, including the capacity o f the Paraopeba regional


                                                                                                   23

river basin committee. The project will assist the Municipality inreviewingenvironmentalpolicies
andregulations. Bydrawing up an updated and comprehensive Environmental Management Plan
incorrelation with the MunicipalMaster Plan, the project will improvenaturalresource
management. The project investments will strongly reduce or mitigate social and environmental
vulnerabilities, including natural disasters such as flooding and landslides. It will also protect
public health and the quality o f life andthe immediate environment o f households bypreventing
contact with untreated wastewater.

The Natural Habitats Policy is triggered because the project will rehabilitate andprotect water
resources, including degraded riparian vegetation under the category of natural habitats. The
project will rehabilitate degraded riparianvegetation andextend the area with appropriate
vegetation, including urbanparks that will also protect vulnerable environmental sites.

The Dams Safety Policy is triggeredbecause a reservoir to supplywater to the metropolitanregion
o fBelo Horizonte lies withinthe Municipality o f Betim, but outside the project intervention area.
Most o f the reservoir lies ina neighboring municipality, andthe use o f its water is managed by
COPASA. The two municipalities have master plans andlanduse laws to protect this reservoir.
The managementbody includes representatives o fthe two municipalities, andoperational
procedures including monthly decision meetings..

6. Policy Exceptions andReadiness
The project does not require any exception from Bank policies. Inaddition, the project meets the
regional criteria for readiness for implementation as set forth inthe procurement and financial
management assessments. The agreement between COPASA and the Municipalityhas been
reviewedbythe Bank and complies with the project's objectives and arrangements for
implementation.

                       Annex 1:CountryandSector or ProgramBackground
                    BRAZIL: IntegratedMunicipalProject           - BetimMunicipality

Brazil today has enormous potential. It also faces huge challenges. After the "Brazilian miracle" o f
the 1960s and 1970s, the 1980s and 1990sproduced disappointingly low growth with persistently
highinequality. Despite low growth, however, the last decadesaw substantial advances inthe
reform agenda, including remarkable achievements inkey social indicators and inprice
stabilization and fiscal strengthening since the 1994 RealPlan. Economic advances were
consolidated from 1998 onward-in         a period that included the 1999 currency crisis and other
external and domestic shocks-through        responsible fiscal management (underpinned by Brazil's
landmark Fiscal Responsibility Law), which brought risingprimary fiscal surpluses, and the
introduction o f exchange rate flexibility under an inflation targeting framework.

The reformprogress o f the last eight years i s a strong basis on which to build. Within a short time
the new government has demonstrated remarkable commitment to sound macroeconomic
management and social progress. Ifit can manage external vulnerabilities and catalyze domestic
support for reforms, Brazil seems to bepoised to achieve far-reaching improvements inthe
welfare o f its citizens, inparticular the poorest. The success o f these efforts will be the objective
o f deepening Bank Group assistanceandpolicy dialogue under this CAS.

President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was elected inOctober 2002 on a platform that emphasized
increased social equity and faster growth. Buildingon the successes o fthe previous
administration, the turnaround infiscal and monetary management, and substantial social
improvements, the new government's dual focus is to maintainmacro-stability while achieving
more equitable growth and more rapid social progress. The new government has committed itself
to tight fiscal policy, inflation targeting, and the honoring o f debt contracts. Ithas also committed
itself to far-reaching improvements inpeople's welfare-evidenced        byseveral highpriority social
initiatives, including efforts to eradicate hunger (Fome Zero), to create youth employment
(Primeiro Emprego) and to unifysocial transfer programs for greater effectiveness inreducing
poverty (Bolsa Familia).

The government recognizes that neither higher sustainable growth nor lasting social progress i s
possible without deep reforms. It has quickly established credibility bymaking prudent
macroeconomic choices and devoting early emphasis to key structural measures such as social
security reform. Successful pursuit o f reforms would enable Brazil to improve its access to
international markets, reduce its external vulnerability, and improve prospects for sustainable
growth and social progress. The government also recognizes that without the necessary domestic
support, an opportunity to introduce lasting changes inBrazil-benefiting        current and future
generations-may      be lost.

Several recent government actions - establishment o f the Council for Economic and Social
Development (to discuss reforms with civil society), meetings o f the President with Brazil's 27
state governors, and the participatory preparation o f the four-year Multiyear Plan (Plano
Plurianual, or PPA) -represent promising initiatives for galvanizing the political and social
support needed for reforms. While party affiliations and alliances are typically weak inBrazil, the
prospect o freforms has increased over the course o f the year as the government has substantially
expanded its support base inCongress.


                                                                                                       25

1.1 Sustainabilityissues

Brazil's long-term goals to achieve greater sustainability include enhanced andmore equitable
access to urbanandrural basic services such as water supply and sanitation, better water quality
andwater resource management, more sustainable landmanagement, protection o fnatural
resources, and greater social inclusion. The growing number o furbanpoor depend more than other
groups onpublic services to protect and enhance their assets. Manyurban poor are not served by
water and sanitation sources; many spend hours onpublic transportation to get to and from work.
Water and air pollution, along with their health consequences, are predominantly urbanproblems,
and they affect the poor most. And inperipheral urban areas many poor people do not have secure
property rights to their land andhousing, severely curtailing their ability to participate incredit
markets and even some labor markets. Urbanhousing and landmarkets do not function equitably,
largely because o f lack o f adequate land andthe infrastructureto serve that land. Law and order is
a fundamentalpublic good o fobvious relevance inurbanareas. All o fthese concerns interact with
the continued growth o f informal settlements (some 350,000 newcomers arrive inS"aoPaul0 alone
each year), which strains local governments' capacity.

With urbangrowth comes demand for housing, water supply, sanitation, drainage, wastewater
pollution control, solid waste management, and urban transport. The government has
demonstrated its focus on urbanpolicy through the creation of a new Ministry o f Cities. Among
the priorities, reforming local master planning, subdivision regulations, buildingcodes, andzoning
ordinances would improve land use and increase the supply of landfor low-income housingto
arrest the growth o f informal settlements. Local upgradingprograms would put more emphasis on
tenure andregistration (MDG7).Federal housingprograms mightbecome matching grant
schemes for states andmunicipalities and include nongovernmentalorganizations (NGOs) for
urbanupgrading. Public transport systems, another assetimportant to the poor, contribute to the
value o f landandhousing assetswhen markets are functioning well.

Water supply and sanitation services are the responsibility o f states andmunicipalities, though
several federal programs support the sub national governments. Access i s uneven. The poor are
least likely to have adequate service, with a largepart o f the unservedpopulation living insmall
municipalities, peri-urban areas, andfuvelus. Very little collected wastewater is treated, adding to
health hazards and environmental degradation, especially inurban areas. Although utility tariffs
are generally adequate, halfthe state utilities require fiscal support to meet operational deficits. If
utilitymanagershadthe incentives andautonomy to improve efficiency, the gains couldbe
allocated to better service coverage and quality for the poor. Services could also be improved with
a clearer legal and regulatory framework, andtariff and bulk water pricing reforms to promote
conservation and efficiency. Growing urbanization i s straining the capacity o f the sector to expand
services: duringthe 1990sthe number o f new connections barely exceeded the number o f new
urbanhouseholds.

An integrated approachto water pollutioncontrol andurbanupgrading can enhance the benefitsof
a wide range o f interventions. Poor households are more willing to contribute to the costs o f
sewerage and other urban services ifthey have some security o f tenure. The healthbenefits o f
effective solid waste management and drainage complement those o fwater supply and sanitation
andare essential to urbanwater pollutioncontrol. Integratedapproaches to water pollutionand


                                                                                                      26

urban upgrading depend on cooperation among a variety o f actors and revitalization o f effective
metropolitan governance. Successful urbanwater control projects inthe states o f Minas Gerais,
Parani, and Sao Paulo have shown the effectiveness o f anintegrated, metropolitan approach,
which directly involves the affectedmunicipalities.

1.3 Fiscal and governanceissues

An additional challenge facing Brazil incoming years is to improve the quality o fpublic
expenditures and the efficiency and impact of government programs withinthe tight fiscal
constraints expected for the foreseeable future. Evidence suggests that although Brazil's public
sector spends a relatively highshare o f its GDP, these expenditures are often poorlytargeted and
inefficiently executed. Brazilhas yet to develop a robust system o fprogram and expenditure
monitoring and evaluation, andpublic sector management is still largely rule-boundrather than
performance oriented. While the federal government made significant progress by initiating annual
evaluations for its Multiyear Plan (PPA), there i s still ample scope for strengthening this new
system by improvingthe monitoring and evaluationmethodologies usedandinstitutionalizing
them within a coherent government-wide system. With a more effective monitoring andevaluation
system, the contribution o f the PPA to allocational efficiency couldbe enhanced.

Financial management andprocurement at the federal level and insome states are effective in
ensuring internal control functions. Butthey could also do more to facilitate efficient, results-
oriented management o f public resources (such as through greater budget reallocation flexibility
andmore use o f e-procurement). Efficient financial control andprocurement systems could
improve the quality o f public expenditure management, andthe government i s considering further
modernizationo fprocurement functions.

Strengthening incentives and capacity for effective policy planning, management, and service
delivery i s also an important objective at the subnational level, where they are often lacking. In
addition, a number o f states are still grapplingwith the first-order challenge o f setting their fiscal
houses inorder. Carefully designed administrative reforms at the state level would be a necessary
condition for substantially improvingthe efficiency o f spending andthe effectiveness o f service
delivery. Manymunicipalities need to strengthen their fiscal management capacities to comply
with the Law o fFiscalResponsibility andto develop arrangements for the provision o f apackage
o fbasic urban services.

Brazil's public sector institutions andtheir governance fare well inregional comparisons. Brazil's
bureaucracy is competent inseveral key areas. But capacities are uneven across sectors and levels
of government, and overall public administrations are not geared toward efficiency and results.
Cumbersome bureaucracies are obstacles to efficient social service delivery and a business-
friendly investment climate. As a result, the quality o f governance inBrazil i s still perceived to lag
behind that o f OECD countries and the region's best performers. Brazilhas worked to improve the
quality o fpolicy implementation. Measures such as the National DebureaucratizationProgram and
a variety o f e-government initiatives are intended to streamline cumbersome bureaucratic
processes and make public administrationmore agile and predictable. These andother
administrative modernization measures should be balancedwith the robust internal control
regimes that Brazil has developedto control corruption andother forms o f misuse o fpublic
resources and abuse o fpublic authority. Through a consultative process, the federal government is


                                                                                                       27

developing a planfor systemic reforms o f the state to upgrade the quality o fpublic sector
institutions and management.

One o fthe most notable changes introduced bythe new government is amore transparent and
inclusive approach to government decision-making--key to completingBrazil's transition from a
clientelistic to a modem, democratic government. This approach builds on successful local
experiences, from participatorybudgetingto involvement o f community associations and local
councils inbudget andpolicy decisions. Through better access to information, the approach can
also help buildtransparency and fight corruption. It is now being scaled up at the federal and state
levels ina variety o f forms.

2. Higher-level Objectives

The 2003-2007 Country Assistance Strategy for Brazilpursues three higher-level objectives: a)
achieving greater equity through investments inhumanand social capital; b) increasing
sustainability through a focus on natural capital and local services; and c) improving economic
competitiveness via investment and greater productivity. These pillars are based on a foundation
of a stable economic environment and effective governance.

3.1 Sustainability pillar

A primaryelement o fthe sustainabilitypillaro fthe CAS is support for increased access to basic
services inrural andurban areas. Inurbanareas, inthe context o f an integratedurban strategy, the
Bank could continue to selectively support urbantransport, buildingon ongoing support to metro
systems inlarge cities which have contributed to poverty reductionby increasingthe access o f the
poor "trapped" inurbanperipheries to affordable transport. Water supply and sanitationwill be
complementedby further support for urban services through a number o fvehicles at both federal
and state level. Support at the federal level would focus onpolicies andprogram design; support
at the state and local level would focus on integrated approaches to service delivery inthe context
o f broader local or regional development strategies.

At the local level, the Bank is developing a municipaVurbanstrategy incollaborationwith the IDB
that will guide support to large metropolitan regions, medium-size cities, and small towns, where
the need for basic services i s most critically felt. The Bank could support a series o f operations for
medium-size cities (startingwith Betim) aimed at an integratedmix o ftechnical assistance and
investments to enhance local management capacity andimprove services andnatural resource
management. Especially at the local level, the Bank would continue to support participatory
mechanisms, for example, to determine investment priorities. Capacity buildingat the local level
is also a priority, to be supported through WBI, GDLN, andother approaches, including with
partners.

                          Annex 4: DetailedProjectDescription
             BRAZIL: IntegratedMunicipalProject          - BetimMunicipality

ComponentI:MunicipalPoliciesandInstitutionalCapacityEnhancement

Component Iwill focus on strengthening policies andmanagement capacity o f the Betim
Municipality inkey thematic areas: govemance, fiscal management, andurban
development planning; local basic services management; environmental and water
resources policies andmanagement. These are inline with the Municipality's main goal
o f ensuring the sustainability o f investments to improve local urban social and
environmental quality through improved govemance andinstitutional capacity. To
achieve the foregoing, this component encompassesthree sub-components and activities:

1. Governance and Planning Strengthening: The project will support the development o f
a Municipal Strategic Development Planby helping Betim apply cutting-edge
approaches, methodologies, andtools for the definition of its longterm development
goals and the means to achieve them within a participatory framework and aligned with a
public investment program support. A broad update o f the UrbanMaster Plan is included.
These activities will concern reviewing major institutional, financial and territory
planningissues such as: apublic expenditure review; fiscal and financial management;
the policies and regulation affecting property tax; cadastre and tax collection; territorial
management; irregular settlements; basic services provision, access to landand services;
social development; environmental management; civic involvement inpolicy making;
transparency; accountability andinformation-sharing mechanisms andoperational tools.
The development o f these issues will also provide key support to the Municipality when
participating inthe elaborationo f anupdatedMaster Development Plano f the
Metropolitan Region o f Belo Horizonte that i s expected to be prepared inthe near future
(the existing was prepared in 1974, bythe federal government). Specific policy papers
will beprepared to assist policymakers onthe options and implications o f altemative
scenarios, They include analysis o f issues, such as onpublic expenditure reviews; fiscal
andfinancial management; propertytax policy andlandregulation; cadastre andtax
collection; economic instruments for territorial and environmental management;
regularizationo f illegal settlements; cost-effective programs to foster access to land and
basic services; social development, including monitoring o f SUS cadastre and
applications for broader policy formulation; payment for environmental services;
consensus buildingfor policymaking; improved transparency; accountability; and
information-sharingmechanisms inselected areas o f municipal government.

2. Local services management:The project will help strengthen municipalpolicies,
regulation, and management capacity for a broad range o f local basic services delivery
such as water and sanitation; transportation; solid waste collection and disposal; street
cleaning; parks and green areas; public lightning; cemetery; municipal guard. This
support will consist o fthree principal activities:

    a. Policies and management capacity assessment: Policy, regulation and management
        arrangements will be assessedinorder to assist the municipality inestablishing an



                                                                                            33

        appropriate institutional and legal framework for the delivery of efficient local
        services. This assessment will include issues such as: clarifying the Constitutional
        share o fresponsibilities divided betweencentral and sub-national governments
        for local services delivery; discussing the impacts o fthe metropolitan region;
        fostering the dialogue with surroundingmunicipalities; identifying alternative
        delivery models; measuring efficiency o f current service delivery models; quality
        o f services; costs; subsidies, tariffs. This activity also addressesthe development
        o f operationmeasures for the open air flooding regulationbasins.

   b. Development of a local services information systemfor institutional andpublic
        control: The projectwill support the development o f an information system that
        will meet a twofold objective: (i) strengthen the Municipality's capacity to
                                              to
        enforce its regulatory responsibility for local services provision; and (ii)  to
        enhance governance through providing access to the population - intheir capacity
        as local services users -to information regardingthe expected and achieved levels
        o f quality o f local services. This activity includes: assessingthe levels o f services
        quality currently being delivered; identifying the levels o f services quality
        contractually required; users' consultation events; establishing benchmarks for
        levels o f services quality. This activity embraces defining operational procedures
        for implementing the information system covering for example: hardware;
        software; maintenance procedures and costs; institutional responsibilities;
        professional skills needed for operating the systems andtraining;

    c. Basic infrastructure cadastre. A municipal technical cadastre inbasic
        infrastructure and services will be established, mainly with respect to macro and
        micro drainage. This will support the development and hrther implementation o f
        a drainage management system which constitutes an important element o f both
        the UrbanMaster Plan andthe Environmental Master Plan. These technical data
        will complement the municipal geographically-referenced management database,
        which is already broad.

3. Environmental Management Strengthening: The institutional and technical capacity o f
the Municipal Environment Secretariat will be strengthened to increase the efficiency and
effectiveness o f its regulatory andmanagement functions through:

    a.    Development of environmental policies, regulation and management capacity:
        A Municipal Management Environmental Planwill be developedinlinewith the
        Municipal Strategic Development Plan. The Planwill address policy instruments;
        financing mechanisms; administrative procedures; environmental database;
        transparency andpublic participation; andmonitoring and evaluation
        mechanisms. It will also address key institutional issues such as development o f
        the Environmental Secretariat's capacity to assumelicensing responsibility over
        the larger interventions inthe municipal territory as well as proposing efficient
        and self-sustained management alternatives for the three urbanparks and for the
        riparianvegetationrestoration supported bythe project. Specifically, the
        institutional capacity effort will develop anurbanenvironmental management



                                                                                               34

       policy and management plans for environmentally protected areas; continue
       capacity trainings; andprepare environmental manuals and guidelines;

   b. Strengthening water resources management and water quality monitoring: The
       structure and operational requirements for implementing the geographically
       referencedmanagement system developed by the Paraopeba River Basin
       Committee will be completed. This will include: expandingthe geologic and geo-
       technical database; mapping land use and aptitude; extending the cadastre o f
       water users andpollution discharge; the development o f decision models for
       water withdrawal and discharge. This system will form the project tools for
       monitoring the Betim River's water quality. This component complements the
       municipal environmental monitoring system. Inaddition this activity will target
       the strengthening o fmunicipal capacity for controlling industrial contamination, a
       responsibility shared with the state environmental agency.

   c. Monitoring the quality of industrial effluent discharge into water resources bodies:
       the project will support the effort of the Municipal Environmental Secretariat in
       controlling the quality o fwater bodies through improving this agency capacity o f
       monitoring and enforcing industrial compliance with environmental regulation.

   d. Implementation of environmental education and social communicationprograms.
       An environmental education program will increase the population's awarenesso f
       local environmental vulnerabilities and actions for environmental protection. a
       social communication program will disseminate information about the project
       implementation and create a communication channel between the project and the
       communities.

Component11: Social Inclusion
Component I1comprise three interrelated actions: (i)   assisting families livinginrisk-
prone areas; (ii)
                supporting housing improvement for poor communities, and (iii)
strengthening municipal level social policies andprograms.

1.Assistingfamilies in risk-prone areas. The project will support three lines o f action:

    a. The resettlement o f families living inrisk-prone areas, eg. exposure to landslides,
       flooding and direct exposure to raw sewerage. The project resettlement policy
       offers two compensatory altematives at no financial cost to the family: housing in
       a formal settlement with basic services andclose to the original area, or cash
       compensation calculated via a social index, enabling families to buyreplacement
       housing at their discretion. A total o f some 820 families living inunregulated
       areas are expected to be assistedby one o f the two resettlement alternatives.
       Those families will also be entitled to social compensation because, ingeneral,
       their incomelevelisvery low. Dependingonthe property's legal status, the legal
       expropriation or the cash compensation mechanism will apply to 323 vacant
       urban lots also located ininappropriate areas.




                                                                                         35

     b. Strengthening the social and legalmunicipalteam to provide comprehensive
        juridical and social support for families offered the resettlement choices. This
        assistance will be available duringthe entire resettlement process. The activity
        will also monitor andevaluate the impact o fresettlement andwill strengthen
        institutions implementingresettlement.

     c. The acquisition o f two areas for buildingresettlement housing.

2. Supportfor improvements inpoor communities: The project will buildon `kit reboco, '
an existing municipal grants program for critical home repair. The program entails a
collaborative approach betweenthe local government andthe community inwhich the
former supplies the material andthe latter executes the home upgrades with assistance
from the municipal social team.

3. Strengtheningsocial policies andprograms: The project will support the strengthening
o f the Social Assistance Secretariat (SEMAS) through three key lines o f action:

     a. A series o f studies andinstitutional enhancement activities o f SEMAS, including:
        (i)riskandvulnerabilityassessmenttoidentifythosepopulationgroupsmost
            a
        affectedby social exclusion andpoverty; (ii)    impact evaluationo f social policies
        and programs to gauge their effectiveness, potential constraints, andopportunities
        to enhance social development; (iii)  institutional capacity assessment to gauge
        local government's capacity to respondto these needs; and (iv) civil society and
        business sector assessmentto judge the effectiveness o f actions undertaken
        outside framework o f local governments.;

     b. Investments to physically improve regional SEMAS buildingswhere
        decentralized social promotion and social safety-net programs are housed,
        including the `Sal60doEncontro ' initiative, through which the Municipality
        complements its social promotion actions assisting approximately one thousand
        people each day. This entity assists poor people o f different ages, including young
        children, teenagers, seniors and also disable individuals, offering them effective
        participation incultural activities and professional training.

     c. Impact evaluation o f federal, state and municipal governments social safety-net
        programs. These programs are accomplished through fiscal transfers designed to
        alleviate poverty inthe short-term by cash support for poor families (bolsa
        familia, bolsa escola, cesta basica, vale-gas). By assessingthese funds allocation
        criteria, coverage gaps, duplication andhorizontal inequities, allocation
        transparency and consistency, local management efficiency, database efficacy and
        improvements inquality o f life, this evaluation aims: (i) inform the central
                                                                    to
        government's Bolsa Familia program by gauging their impact on the poor in
        Betim; and(ii) identify the linkages andcomplementaritiesbetweenthese
                        to
        short-term cash transfer programs and SEMAS' long-term actions.

                                                                                           36

Component I11will invest inextending and improving the basic infrastructure inthe
BetimRiver basin as well as inrehabilitatingthenatural environment, mainly the water
resources. This component will also address key issues o fbasic services: access o f the
poor to basic services, and impact o fthe sanitation system's operation and maintenance
on the rivers' water quality.

secondary roads (totaling 18km); and7,500 new sewerage connections.

2. Expanding urbanparks andgreen areas. Three urbanparks totaling 30ha will be built
along the riverbanks, andriparianvegetationwill be restored along the Betim River and
its tributaries.

The activities below, already executed by COPASA, will complement the project. During
the project execution, COPASA will continue these programs with its own technical and
financial resources. The integration o f these programs andthe project will be ensuredby
COPASA's presence inthe project UGP.

Access of thepoor to sewerage connection: COPASA will finance a program to promote
access bythe poor to sanitation connections. The program, already implementedby
COPASA inother municipalities, finances the cost o f connecting households to sewerage
works through 24 monthly installments o f approximately U S $ l per installment.

Improving sewerageoperation and maintenance eficiency: The existing sewerage
network will be repaired. This activity includes assessingirregular sewerage connections
(liga@es cruzadas) to drainage andpromoting their regularization.

Monitoring the quality of industrial effluent discharged into seweragesystem.
COPASA's quality control program will be scaled up to monitor industrial effluents
discharged into the sewerage system, andto establish mechanisms for ensuring repairs.

ComponentIV: ProjectManagement,MonitoringandEvaluation

1.Project Management Unit (UGP): The project will finance the UGPto assist the
Municipality inmanaging the project implementation as well as to ensure the
implementationo f a monitoring and evaluation system.

2. Civil workissupervision: The project will finance the consulting services contract for
supervision o f civil works.

3. Project audit.

Due to their relevance to the project implementation, this section describes below
COPASA's participation and the project flow o f funds.

COPASA
COPASA delivers water and sanitation services inBetimthrough a concession contract
(legally valid till 2012) with the Municipality. Incompliance with this contract, COPASA
will provide to the Municipality an estimated US$12 millionto carry out the sanitation
investments envisaged inthe project. This funding allocation forms part o f a large water
and sanitation investment plan that COPASA will execute in2004-05, to benefit the 300
municipalities with which it has service concessions. For project implementation:
1   COPASA will transfer to the Municipality o f Betim the sum o fUS$12 million for the
    project's estimated sewerage investments. This amount will be adjusted inaccordance
    with the final sewerage investment cost;
1   The sum o f US$12 million will be transferred to the Municipality inthe first two
    project years, and will not be tied to the sewerage works. These resources will be
    available to finance any investment included inthe project, according to the project
    implementation schedule;
1   The legal agreement between COPASA and the Municipalitywas signed on
    December 19,2003. Prior to signature, the Bankreviewed the document.

Inadditionto the funds for project investments insewerage system, COPASAwill
provide detailed engineering designs for all the sewerage works: secondary networks,
collectors, interceptors and WTP. COPASA will also supervise the sewerage works to
ensure quality and monitor sewerage works disbursements. With its own resources,
COPASA will continue to implement the programs below due to their relevance to the
project objectives.

1.Insuring access of thepoor to sewerage connections. COPASA hasmade andplans to
continue large-scale investment to expand sewerage service coverage throughout the
State o f Minas Gerais. Over the next two years, COPASA will implement an investment
plan for sewerage services alone to cost around US$750 million for the 300
municipalities inwhich it holds the concession. The lessons learned show that the
population i s critically slow inconnecting to sewerage services, which renders this type


                                                                                        41

o f investment inefficient from environmental, social and financial points o f view. To
deal with this, COPASA has developed a program covering social promotion and
financing o f the necessary connections.

2. Socialpromotion campaign. To publicize the importance o f household sewerage
connections to public health and environmentalprotection, the campaignwill include:
0    Home visits (3 to 4 visits each)
0    Community meetings focused on environmentaland sewerage issues;
     Identification o f sewerage connections inthe drainage network;
0    Tours byvehicles with public address systemto areas where network is to be
     installed;
0    Brochures to disseminate the project's objectives;
0    Talks given inschools accompanied by leaflet distribution;
0    Organizationo f written and artistic competitions inthe schools;
0    Student and community group visits to COPASA's water and sewage treatment
     stations.

3. Financing the connections. The population has had difficulty constructing the required
connections, despite their simplicity. Inaddition, they lack resources, To address these
problems, COPASA will
0    Exempt users who adhere to the system while the publicity campaign i s under way
     from paying the connection charge (at present R$180). According to the "social
     tariff' criterion, residential units o f under 44 sq meters are already exempt.
0    Buildand finance the internal connection(withinthe plots). Inneighborhoodswhich
     are less socially fragile, the user can pay for the connection, whose current cost
     averages R$144, in24 installments over two years. Inhighlysocially vulnerable
     areas, this charge will be reduced to R$72, also payable over 24 months.

4. Improving eficiency of sewerageoperation. COPASA will play an important role in
     controlling industrial pollution bymonitoring the quality o f industrial effluent
     discharged into the sewerage system. Inaddition, inthe project area, COPASA will
     strengthen the execution o f the `sewer hunt' program, which prevents river
     contamination with untreated wastewater.

COPASA will execute items (3) and (4) with its own resources. COPASA's commitment
to execute these actions i s ensured through an agreement signed on December 19,2003.

              Annex 7: FinancialManagementandDisbursementArrangements
              BRAZIL: IntegratedMunicipalProject           - BetimMunicipality
A financial management risk assessmentwas performedby aFinancialManagement
Specialist o f L C O M B r a z i l CMU. The assessment includeda review o f all financial
management and disbursement arrangements, inplace and/or to be implemented, to
evaluate the Municipality's capability to effectively execute the financial management
and monitoring o fthis Project.

The assessmentwas carried out inaccordance with OPBP 10.02 andthe Guidelines for
Assessment o f Financial Management Arrangements inWorld Bank-Financed Projects
issued by the Financial Management Sector Board on October 15,2003. The objective o f
the assessment was to determine whether the Borrower and its ImplementingAgency
have acceptable financial management arrangements, including the capability to: i)
manage and account all project proceeds, costs andtransactions, ii)produce timely,
accurate and reliable financial statements andreports, iii)safeguard Project's assets, iv)
engage independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, v) disburse Bank's funds inthe most
efficient way accordingto applicable Bank's rules andprocedures. The overall
assessment work included: a) discussions with the Agency and Borrower's financial staff,
b) assessment o fthe financial management systems inplace andto be used, c) analysis o f
the financial staff required, d) review o f fbnds flow, e) review o f internal controls, f)
review disbursement methodology, g) agree on reporting requirements, h) review internal
and external audit arrangements.

The scope o f the financial management assessment (FMA) was to determine which
additional arrangements would have to be implemented for an efficient administration for
this Project. The findings o fthe FMAwere satisfactory andit concluded that current
financial managementarrangements, andthose to be implementedas per agreed action
plan, will provide an effective control andmonitoringo fthe project. The assessment
included agreements on standards and formats o f audited financial statements and
timetable for their submission. There are no Municipalor Country issues that would
impede Bank's lending. The financial management risk associated to the Project i s rated
as moderate to substantial. The financial monitoringheporting system will have the
capacity to produce reliable information andreasonable cash forecasts so as to enable the
project to disburse based on periodic reportingmethodology (FMR).

Municipal and Country Issues. The Municipalityo fBetim has good fiscal performance,
sound governance, efficient institutional structure and strong fiduciary arrangements.
Betim has complied with all Fiscal Reponsibility Law commitments andhas no fiscal
constraints inraising its consolidated debt by this Loan. Additionally there is a good level
o f fiscal transparency bothat federal andmunicipal level. The overall conclusion o f
Brazil's CFAA i s that the Brazilian system o fpublic financial management provides
good support to the federal administration to efficiently manage their financial resources,
andthus enablingthe FederativeRepublic o fBrazilto provide a solid guarantee onthe
Loan.

Project Risk Analysis. A risk assessmentquestionnaire andmatrix were filled inon basis
o fthe observations made andare filed inthe FMA work papers. The Risk Assessment
Matrix summarizes the degree of risk of each o f the items related to the Financial
Management o f the Project.
The major risks identified are related to the Municipal and Implementing Entity
capacities, consideringthat this is the first Project to be financed bythe Bank inthis
Municipality, and considering that it will demand greatly on the current implementing
capacity ofthe Municipality. Considering all the variables (strengths andweaknesses) of
the risk assessment, the overall financial management risk associated to this Project can
berated from moderate to substantial.

The following table summarizes the weaknesses andhow these will be addressedinthe
financial management o f the Project:

As strengths for the Project, it canbe mentioned: a) the commitment ofthe Betim
Municipality to the Project, b) the Municipality has already strongpublic sector FM
arrangements inplace, c) stable fiscal situation and good governance, d) a strong and
supportive internal audit department.

Implementing Entity:A Project Preparation Unit (UPP) was created within the Planning
Secretariat and i s incharge o fpreparing all the technical, institutional, financial and
social studies to support the Project duringapproval cycle. A Project ManagementUnit
(UGP) was already formally formed withinthe PlanningSecretariat. The Treasury and
Administration Secretariats, will have a fundamental participation inthe financial
management of the Project. The financial flow, receipts, disbursements andbasic
accounting will be carried out bythe Treasury Secretariat, using the PMB's current
system - SAFCI'. The UGP will assume fullresponsibility for the Project
implementation and management, including the supervision andmonitoringo f the
physical and financial progress o f the Project.

The UGPwill have a small coordination team which will supervise anhiredteam of
specialists with experience inBank's operational policies and procedures who will
further strengthen the UGP's capacity. The following Agencies will co-implement the
Project: a) COPASA, as a financing and service provider entity for the sanitation
intervention o f the Project, b) Civil Works andPublic Services Secretariat, c) Housing
Secretariat, d) Environment Secretariat, e) Social Assistance Secretariat.

Stafing. The staff incharge to perform the financial management will be supplied by a
consulting firm to be hired, who will work with the collaboration and support from the
UGP's financial coordinator-a FMS, who will be a qualified accountant with experience
inprojects financedbyInternationalOrganizations. Thisteamwill work inclose
interface with the Municipality Finance Secretariat for all accounting, treasury (funds
flow) and administrative matters. The team already inplace inthe Finance Secretariat i s
technically qualified, with good college background and solid experience inthe public
financial sector.

Accounting Policies and Procedures, Internal Controls. PMB follows Law 4320164
accounting policies andprocedures o f the Brazilianpublic accounting system for public
Entities. The main tool for PMB's financial administrationis SAFCI, described inmore
detail below. PMBprepares annually a budget for the coming year that will include all
Project's transactions. Duringthe execution inthe following year, only expenses and
costs that were previously budgeted can be committed inSAFCI. SAFCI controls all
expenditures by spending Units, which inthe case o f this Project, is the Mayor's office.
Project's specific accounting and financial monitoring can be undertaken by SAFCI, or
byaparallel system to be acquired. A decisionwill haveto betakenby appraisal, as to
which system will be used. Project's accounting will be on a cash basis, and a specific
chart o f accounts i s being prepared for the Project, whichwill be incorporated into the
financial management system.

Project Financial Statements will be inFMRformat, to be issued quarterly. As part o f
the overall financial management arrangements, a financial management manual will be
prepared containing all financial management procedures, instructions andpolicies
orienting and defining the financial management team responsibilities.

InternalAudit. PMBhas a strong and a broadrange acting internal audit department. It i s
an independent unit within the municipal administration reporting directly to the Mayor,
It reviews all Municipaltransactions. Each andevery payment must have a prior review
andapprovalbythe InternalAudit Department. Itis a well staffed department with 9
professionals and a number o f interns. The internal audit Department can be helpful and
supportive to the external auditors.

External audit. Audit Reports will follow Bank's new audit policy and audit guidelines
issued bythe FMSB on June 30, 2003. Annual Financial statements inFMR format will
be prepared each fiscal year inaccordance with acceptable accounting standards and
audited inaccordance with acceptable auditing standards by independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank. The scope o fthe audit will be determinedby PMB inconsultation
with the Bank,based on project-specific circumstances, and audit TOR will be issued


                                                                                         46

accordingly. The auditors, indetermining the audit procedures to be followed, will take
into considerationthe findings o fthe financial management assessment, andthe internal
audit department capacity and findings. The external auditors will be selected on basis o f
their technical capability, independence and qualified staff.

The annual audit reports will be reviewedby the Bank, and a review letter will be sent to
the UGP, requesting action to resolve any issue raisedby the auditors. A copy of the
regular annual auditedFinancial Statements o f COPASA will be required, since this
Entityis one o fthe donors, andits financial stability is fundamentalto the fulland
successful implementation o f the Project.

As the Project intends to usethe report baseddisbursement methodology through FMRs,
an audit opinion will be required on the set o f FMRs for each year duringthe life o fthe
project. The following audit reports will be required, all due up to six months after closing of
fiscal year:

Monitoring, reporting, andfinancial statementswill be undertaken through the financial
management system- SAFCI- already inuse by PMB, adaptedto the Project and including
a module to issue the quarterly FMRs, or by a system to be acquired specially designed and
developed for the Project. The reports will contain data comparing plannedfigures with
actual figures and deviations, both inUS$ and R$. Eachreport will contain the figures for the
quarter, accumulated for year, accumulated for the Project. Physical Progressand
Procurement Reports will also beprepared. The Project intendsto use the report based
disbursement methodology. An specific report will beprepared containing cashforecasts for
the quarter for which the funds are beingrequestedandthe following quarter (Report 1-E).
All FMRssupporting documentation willbe filed inthe UGP, for auditors' inspection and
reviewby Bank's supervision missions.

The following Reports inFMRformats will beissued:

Information Systems. PMB has inplace a financial management system, SAFCI, designed
and developed by a software house specialized indeveloping software for public
administration Entities. This system i s already inuse by the PMB for many years with
good results. It encompasses several integrated modules by which the PMB executes and
controls budget execution-revenues and expenses, financial administration, payments,
banks accounts and accounting. It i s possible to issue by this system, all the reports that
the PMB requires for its own financial administration. With adaptations, it canbe usedto
prepare Project's FMRs.The software house provides good support to the users.

As an alternative to SAFCI, a specification for anew systemwas written upwhich
encompasses all the tools necessaryto manage, control, monitor and report on the Project,
including technical and engineeringaspects. This specification was reviewedbythe Bank
and it contains all financial managementand other features requiredfor an efficient
administration o fthe Project.

Special Account and Disbursement Arrangements. The report baseddisbursement
methodology (FMR) was proposed for this project, and therefore the Project will follow all
Bank's procedures requiredinthis type o f disbursement.A special account will be openedin
US$ with Banco do Brasil-New York. The authorized allocation will be up to six months
o f estimated disbursements.This initial deposit amount would be increasedas needed
according to the quarterly cashprojections upto the maximum o fthe authorized allocation o f
10%. The quarterly FMRs, includingthe disbursement (FMR-1-E) are subject to audit and
reviewby Bank's Missions.

                                   Annex 8: Procurement
             BRAZIL: IntegratedMunicipalProject- BetimMunicipality

This section describesthe procurement arrangements under the Brazil: BetimIntegrated
MunicipalProject with an estimated total cost of US$52.7 million, which is financed by
a Bank loan of US$24 million. Bank-financed works and goods contracts will be
procured inaccordancewith the World Bank Guidelines:Procurement under IBRD
Loans and IDA Credits, datedJanuary 1995, revised in January 1999. Bank-financed
contracts for consulting services will beprocured following the World Bank Guidelines
Selection andEmployment of Consultants by WorldBank Borrowers, datedJanuary
1997, revised in May 2002. Project activities and procurement contracts not financed by
the Bank would be procured inaccordance with the Brazilianprocurement law 8.666-93,
and amendments.

1. Procurementunderthe Project.Bank-financed procurement, to becarriedout inthe
Project's implementation period2004-2008, is organized as follows:

(a) for municipalpolicies. Three packages for consulting services, to be awarded as
QCBS and one to bebidas NCB, for services of cadastre;

(b) for social assistance: Two civilworks packages, for construction ofhouses and
rehabilitation of SEMAs and three consultant contracts, to be awarded by CQ;

(c) for municipal infrastructure: (i)One civil works contract including sewer interceptor,
paving and drainage, to be bidas ICB.(these works tentatively grouped as one package,
may be split intwo to three packages, because of timingof the involvedinvestments. (ii)
One civil works contract for the construction of a sewagetreatment plant, to bebidas
ICB. (iii) civil works package for water regulation reservoirs, to be bidas NCB. (iv)
          One
One civil works packagefor installation of parks, to be bidas NCB; and

(d) for Projectmanagementandmonitoringfour consulting contracts as follows: (i)
project management, by QCBS; (ii) supervision, by LCS; (iii) by LCS; and
                                       works                          audit,
Project evaluation and monitoring, by CQ.

NBFprocurement includes (i)civilworks contract which hasbeenalready awarded and
                                 a
underexecution for sewageinterception, pavingand drainage; (ii)     purchase of land for
housing projects and compensation for dwellers, programs for promotion of connections
to sewers and (iii) installation of an ecological park.

2. Responsibilitiesfor CarryingOut Procurement. The proposed implementation
arrangements for procurement are basedon existing capabilities o f the municipality,
within its current structure. Procurement responsibilities are sharedby three of the
municipality secretariats, as follows: (i)the Planning Secretariatpreparesplans and
provides for coordination; (ii) Administration Secretariat, through the Supplies
                                the
Division, incharge of biddingand contracting materials, equipment andpharmaceuticals;
and (iii)the Works andPublic Services Secretariat, incharge ofbidding, supervision and


                                                                                          49

administration o f civil works contracts. The municipality i s equippedwith a satisfactory
number o f qualified, seasonedtechnical staff, although lacking o fprevious experience in
Bank-financed procurement. The UGP will be responsible for overall procurement
supervision, control o f the compliance with agreed procedures and o f the time-frame.
UGPwill also be acting as the Bank's counterpart and directly responsible for reporting
to the Bank.

3. ProcurementPlan. The UGP has prepared a rather detailed Project implementation
schedule covering the implementation period 2004-2008. The plan identifies the Project
components, and their estimated cost, investment timing and sources o f financing. On the
basis o f this implementation schedule, the UGP prepared a tentative procurement plan,
which identifies biddingpackages, categories, methods o f procurement and amounts.
This plan, rather satisfactory, would be updated for appraisal.

4. ProcurementArrangements. The following table A summarizes methods and
amounts for each expenditure's category.

QCBS, LCS, or CQ.

9. The Municipality's capacity to implement Project procurement has been assessedin
September 2003. According to this assessment, the Municipality was found as
experienced inthe implementationo fproject o f similar features to those o f the Project,
andconsistent inthe application o frules for procurement for goods and services,
adhering to Law 8.666-93. Furthermore, its institutional structure regarding procurement
was found satisfactory, ifthe Action Plan summarized below is implemented.
Accordingly, the Project procurement system's risk was assessedas average.

10.Consequently with the procurement assessment, the followingthresholds would be
established: for civil works, US$5 million, for goods (no bidding for goods i s currently
planned), US$350 thousand, for consulting firms contracts, US$lOO thousand and for
individual consultant assignments, US$50 thousand. Table B summarizes the consultant
selection arrangements. The table C presented below summarizes the thresholds andprior

                               Annex 9: EconomicAnalysis
              BRAZIL: IntegratedMunicipalProject BetimMunicipality
                                                          -

A complete economic cost benefit analysis, conducted to determine the economic
viability o f the proposed project, found that the overall project andits individual
components are viable. Economic benefits were estimated andquantified only for the
investments inthe infrastructure component, butreturns on investment ininstitutional
development, community participation, social inclusion, and project management are
included inthe analyses, as they are the basis for service sustainability andultimately for
improved access to urban services inthe BetimRiver basin. Once the viability o f the
infrastructure components was determined, overall project viability was assessed,
including the economic costs o fthe other components -municipal policies and
institutional capacity strengthening, social inclusion, andproject management.

To determine the net incremental costs andbenefits, two scenarios were built, one with
the project and one without. Each scenario assessedthe net incremental financial benefits
and costs o f the proposedprograms, which were then adjusted for the impact of taxes,
subsidies, and externalities to arrive at the economic flow o f costs andbenefits. Cash
flows were discounted at a rate o f 12percent, a proxy estimate o f Brazil's opportunity
cost o f capital.

A. Economicbenefits

The project's mainbenefits are the improvement o f overall urban environmental quality
inthe municipality ofBetim, which is expectedto improvethe quality oflife inthe
municipality, especially for poor households living along the river banks; and to improve
services to the city. The project is expected to contribute to the main economic goal o f
the municipality: to attract the middle incomepopulation that currently works inBetim
but lives elsewhere inthe Metropolitan Regiono fBelo Horizonte. New middle class
residents would increase demand for labor-intensive services and thereby generate
employment for the poor and unskilled majority o f Betim's inhabitants, would improve
the urbanenvironment, and would also stimulate Betim's overall economic growth.

The specific benefits o f the project are (i)improvedwater quality inthe Betim River and
its tributaries; (ii) risk to lives andproperty due to the resettlement o f people
                    reduced
livinginrisk-prone areas; (iii) reducedrisk and loss o f life andproperty from floods
resulting from investments inmacro and micro drainage; (iv) increased access to
sewerage connections and overall improvement insanitation from investments in
collection andtreatment for Betim municipality andpart o fthe adjacent municipality o f
Contagem and ultimately improved public health and reduced morbidity; (v) improved
access to urbantransportation system due to rationalization o f street layout and street
paving, including reducedtransport costs andtravel times; (vi) increased access to
recreational activities with the financing o f ecological andcommunity parks, bringing
social benefits, especially for children and youth; (vii) increased social capital by
involvingcommunity groups inthe planningand executiono fthe project as well as the




                                                                                         54

financing o f community-driven activities; (viii) legal title to property for resettled
families; (ix) improved institutional capacity to address urbanplanningsustainably.

Estimation of economic benefits. Economic benefits from improved sanitation (sewerage
connections, sewerage mains, and waste treatment plant), urbandrainage, andparks
subcomponents were estimated through the Contingent Valuation Method. A
representative sample o f households were included inthe survey. The final Survey was
conducted taken care of having a validated questionnaire to control the relevance o f the
results. After having tested the questionnaire infocus groups, a pilot survey was
conducted before the final survey was administered to a total o f 1,400 households. The
sample size was designed to have statistically significant results.

The econometric treatment used to obtain the willingness to pay (WTP) was based on a
parametric bounded logit model,* which calculates willingness to pay based on the
relation between the probability o f a positive response to the offered value with the
selected variables and a variable relating that value and income.

     Psim = -                       where     :

     Psim = probabilit y of positive response
     A i = % of family income of the individual        "i"
     vi = value offered to the indivual     "i"

     Xi = socioecono mic variables

     /3 = coeficient s

Willingness to pay i s calculated for the value representedby the median o fthe dependent variable
given by:

     M W P  i =        A i
                       - ip , where     :
                  i + e
     MWTP      = median    o f WTP  of the   individual "i"

Thebounded logit model uses anendogenous consistency control between income and
the offered value, as the median is defined only for positive values, andthe family
income ( A i )i s used as the asymptote for the result. With this model, there is no need for
an analytic formula to obtain the standarddeviation; the confidence interval i s obtained
bybootstrapping, usingthe Monte Carlo methodto simulate the values o fwillingness to
pay estimates based on the random generation o fparameters o f the function usingthe
covariance matrix o fthe parameters. As a result a confidence interval i s obtained for
willingness to pay.

Datawere econometrically processed using the stepwise method, identifying the outlier
cases inthe residual analysis usinga confidence interval o f 95%. The selected functions
andresultingmedian willingness to pay, as well as a description ofthe subcomponents
analyzed, are summarized inthe following sections.

2. Wastewatercollection mains and treatmentplant. This component is expected to have
a positive impact on all residents o fBetim, as collecting andtreating sewerage will create
a better environment. The river and tributaries cross all parts o f the city. Conservatively,
economic benefits were considered only for households that will be connected to the
treatment plant. The plantwill serve about. 150,000 households from Betim and
Contagem, an adjacent municipality.

The median amount families are willing to pay for wastewater treatment is R$3.72 per
month (N=381; coefficient o fvariation =0.245).

3. Integrated Drainage. This component i s expected to have positive impact for about
90,000 households benefiting from macro and micro drainage works androads, and about
40,000 households benefiting from retentionponds. The subcomponents were analyzed
independently, all showing positive results, but it was decidedto treat them as an
integratedintervention to better capture the overall impact and to avoid double counting
benefits difficult to isolate. Benefits from urbanroads along the streams to be treated by
the drainage works were analyzed separately using the HighwayDesign andMaintenance
Standard Model.Results from the economic analysis o f the roads intervention will be
usedinthe final engineering designs to maximize the economic returns usingdifferent
technical options andusingpavement only when economically feasible.

C.Results
The results o fthe economic cost-benefit analysis for the four major infrastructure
components andthe overall project are presented inTable 6. With an overall economic
internal rate o freturn (EIRR) o f 28% and a net present value o f US$ 20.5 million,
investments ininfrastructure inBetim are clearly economically viable. Even after adding
investment costs o f other components for which economic benefits were not quantified,
the proposed project has an EIRR o f 20% and retums of about US$11.5 million.A
comprehensive sensitivity and risk analyses were conducted to confirm the robustness o f
the results. The sewerage connections components mostly inlow-income areashas an

D. Sensitivityandrisk analyses

The sensitivity analysis shows that results of the economic analysis are robust for the four
components analyzed, and for the overall project. The variables conveying major risks to
the project are the willingness to pay for each subcomponent; the population growth rate,
andinvestmentandoperatingcost overruns. The table shows the possibleimpact andrisk
o fthese variables.

The sensitivity analysis calculates the impact o f single variables ina static world. The
four variables were manipulateduntilthe subproject analyzedpresented no positive
impact. Inmost cases, a reduction inmaximumbenefits o f about 36% indrainage, 47%
inurbanparks, 68% intreatment plant,and96% insewerage connections wouldbe
required for the subprojects to yield no net present value. The population growth rate and
investment cost overrun have less than a 10%probability o f affecting project results.
Thus, subproject results and overall project viability are robust for all cases.

To enhance the accuracy o fthe economic analysis by incorporating the uncertainty o f the
real world, Crystal Ball software was used. This software measures the extent o fvarious
risks and their effect on the project, modeling a probability distribution for eachvariable
and the resulting outcome. Based on a Monte Carlo simulation o f 1,000 trials, the model
recalculatedthe results o fthe economic analysis by changing the major risk variables all
at the same time. According to the sensitivity analysis the variables that will have the
highest impact are the willingness to pay for drainage, urbanparks, andthe wastewater
mains and treatment plant.

                           Annex 10: FinancialandFiscalAnalysis
               BRAZIL: IntegratedMunicipalProject              - BetimMunicipality

Summary. The Betimmunicipal government displayed sound fiscal behavior from 1999
to 2003. With the exception o f 2002, Betimhad primary surpluses. As a result o f the
municipality's fiscal policies, primary financial indicators show a comfortable fiscal
situation in full compliance with the Fiscal ResponsibilityLaw (FRL). Positive primary
balances and increased fiscal revenues have reduced consolidated debt as a proportiono f
net current revenue, from 38% in 1999 to 12% in2003. Since Betim's debt indicators are
well below FRLceilings, the municipality has ample scope for further indebtedness.
Moreover, substantial current revenue accruing from significant intergovernmental
transfers, together with the low level o f indebtedness, suggest that Betimhas sufficient
capacity to meet potential debt obligations.
Transfers o f the state value-added tax (ICMS) are the major source o f Betim's municipal
revenue. Because i t i s an indirect tax, the value o f ICMS transfers closely tracks
variations inthe level o f economic activity and inthe General Price Index, which are in
turnlinkedto exchange rate fluctuations. Transfer revenue is therefore effectively
indexed to the exchange rate. Such indexation constitutes a potential guarantee for
repayment o f the municipality's external debt obligations.
The proposed World Bank loan's size and specific debt service conditions (interest rates,
amortization schedule, and grace period) and Betim's healthy fiscal situation suggest that
Betimwill continue to finance most o fits investmentexpenditures andmeet its
obligations under the Fiscal Responsibility Law.
A. Betim's Fiscal Situation,1999-2003
Betim's sound fiscal policy i s demonstrated by the generation o f substantial primary
surpluses. Table 1shows the evolution o f the municipal government's main fiscal
accounts for 1999-2003.3 In 1999, Betim generated a primary surplus o f 6.1% o f net
current revenue. In2000, a municipal election year, the surplus was 2.7%. In2001, the
administration cut capital expenditure severely, generating a surplus o f 9%. In2002, a
significant increase incurrent expenditure and the return o f capital expenditure to past
levels gave rise to fiscal expansion, reducing the primary balance to -1.4% o f net current
revenue. In2003, with increased revenues and the control o f current expenditures
primary accounts returned to a positive balance o f 0.7% o fnet current revenue.
Betim was also able to produce significant current account savings, allowing it to finance
most o f its investment expenditures and to pay its financial obligations even without
access to credit operations.




 The first two years correspond to the former municipal administration; the last three years, to the current
administration.

       Betim has had continued fiscal revenue growth. Table 2 shows that duringthe last five
       years total municipal revenues rose bymore than 25% at constant prices. Net current
       revenue - the variable used inthe calculation o fthe Fiscal Responsibility Law indicators
        to gauge municipalities' financial capacity-increased by 30% from 1999 to 2003.4
        Increased transfers andother current revenues were largely responsible for the rise in
        municipal fiscal revenue. Between 1999 and 2003, transfers from the state government
        increasedby more than 35%. This was primarily due to the constitutionally sanctioned
        transfers from the ICMS collected inthe municipality, which grew greatly. These
        transfers increased, primarily from the Fundo de ParticipapTo dos Municipios andthe
        income tax derived from municipal employees. However, other federal transfers were
        sharply cut, particularly in2002 and2003, as the result o f the Federal Government's
        fiscal adjustment. The same pattem held at the state level: constitutionally sanctioned
        transfers increased with the increase instate tax revenues, but voluntary transfers
        decreasedbecause o f the Minas Gerais state government's fiscal adjustments.

           For municipalities, the Fiscal Responsibility Law defines net current revenues as the s u m o f tax revenue,
        intergovernmental transfers, and other income (rents, services, rates, etc) minus earmarked revenues (15%
        of tax and transfers) for the funding of FUNDEF (Education Fund) and social security contributions for
        municipalemployees        .

Incontrast to theserevenue categories, the municipality's owntax revenues remained
virtually stagnant in 1999-2003. Betimrevenues from the urbanproperty tax (IPTU) and
the tax on services (ISS) -- the key municipal taxes -- declined. However, increased
collection o f other taxes compensated for this fall (see Figure 1).
This contrast accentuates the excessive dependence on "transferred" resources that
typifies not only Betimbut most Brazilian municipalities. Transfers from federal and
state governments represent almost 80% o fBetim's total revenue. For all Brazilian
municipalities such transfers represent 67%' o f total revenue, and for municipalities
similarinsize to Betimtheproportion is 70%. Because Betimgenerates 30% o fMinas
Gerais' ICMS revenue andbecause more than 20% o f the ICMS revenue collected in
Betim is transferred to the municipal government, transfers have greater weight inits
revenue structure. By increasing local tax collection, Betim will be able to enhance its
financial capacity andwill be less dependent on transfers from other levels o f
government.

Capital revenue has decreased significantly since 2001, again due to a major fiscal
adjustment throughout the entire Brazilian public sector. The National Monetary Council
imposed controls on credit normally suppliedby financial institutions to the public sector;
the CaixaEconGmicaFederal (Federal Mortgage Bank) and BNDES (National Social
and Economic Development Bank) are the major federal financial institutions and
customary sources o f credit for Brazilian municipal government^.^ As a result o f the
N M C resolutions, municipal governments' credit was severely curtailed andrevenues
&om credit operation declined. Betimwas no exception. Capital transfers from state and
federal governments remain the only source o f capital revenue, but both federal and state
governments have adhered to rigorous fiscal adjustments.
Consequently, the ratio of credit operations revenue to net current revenue fell from 3.6%
in1999to almost zero in2002 and2003. Thisratio is one ofthekeyindicators used
underthe FiscalResponsibility Law to restrict new indebtedness. InBetim, this ratio is
clearly well below the 16% ceiling established by the law and ineffect allows Betim to
contract new annual credit operations o f up to R$61 million( U S 2 0 million).
Municipal expenditures trended upward in 1999-2003, but the patternwas not consistent,
as shown inTable 3. In2000 and 2002, expenditures grew substantially and lowered
primarysurpluses comparedwith 1999and2001. In2000, the surge ininvestment
increased overall expenditure. In2002, the increase i s explained by substantial
disbursements for personnel and goods and services. In2003, current expenditures
remainedconstant.



 National Monetary Council ResolutionsNo. 2827 and No. 2920 o fMarch2001 limitbank exposure to the
public sector to 45% o f equity, a constraint particularly binding on the Caixa Econ6mica (the most
important source o f credit for municipal governments). Additionally, Resolution No. 3049 o f November
2002 restricts total borrowing to municipalities to 200 million Reais, ruling out practically all sources of
domestic finance for municipalities.


                                                                                                         65

The ratio of personnel expenditure to net current revenueincreased from 51%in 1999 to
59% in2002 but decreasedto 52% in2003. The 2002 rise inpersonnel expenditures
placed Betimvery close to the FiscalResponsibility Law's ceiling o f 60% for personnel
expenditures; krther minor increases could threaten the municipality's fiscal health.
Increasingpersonnel expenditure also undermines investment. The problem could be
exacerbated by the tough restrictions on credit operations. One o f the crucial challenges
for Betim's financial health is therefore to maintain strict control onpersonnel
expenditures.
Financial commitments (interest payments andamortizations) are not significant
municipal outlays. These have remainedvirtually level since 1999, at R$13-14 million
(2003 value) andrepresent only 4% o fmunicipal net current revenue. The Fiscal
Responsibility Law imposes a ceiling o f 11.5% o f net current revenue for financial
commitments, designed to limit credit operations. This ceiling i s not a constraint to
potential debt obligations. Betimhas substantial debt repayment capacity, because it can
increase interest payments andamortization expenditures, as shown nTable 3.

2. ConsolidatedDebt,Indebtedness,andRepaymentCapacity

TheBetimmunicipality's fiscal behavior since 1999 has significantlyreducedits
consolidated gross andnet debt. Table 4 shows that innominalterms the consolidated
debt declined byR$6.8million, or 8%, andconsolidated net debtbyR$39.9 million, or
40%.
The consolidated debt i s wholly domestic and the creditors exclusively public sector
institutions. The Caixa EconGmica Federal and the state o fMinas Gerais are the main
creditors. Floatingdebt was kept under control and financial assets increased from 2000
onwards. As apercentageofnet current revenue, consolidatednet debt declined from
38% in 1999to 12% in2003. The FiscalResponsibilityLaw establishes a ceiling of
120%; Betimclearly has ample capacity for further indebtedness.

Table 5 summarizes the Fiscal Responsibility Law indicators usedto evaluate
indebtedness and debt reimbursement capacity. Ineach category -- credit operations, debt
service, andconsolidatednet debt to net current revenue ratios -- Betim is well below the
FRL'Scei1ingsa6
Financial capacity, expressed innet current revenue as a measure o f available fiscal
resources, arises from the large mandatory ICMS transfers from the state o f Minas
Gerais. As an important industrial center, Betim generates approximately 30% o f all the
ICMS inthat state. Under revenue-sharing arrangements, 25% o fthe state's ICMS
income reverts to municipal governments; 20% is transferred to the municipality where
the ICMS was collected (origin criteria), and the remaining 5% is allocated to a fund for
distribution according to the needs o f the municipalities inthe state (redistributive
criteria). This transfer o f funds assures Betim a significant source o f revenue. Federal
mandatory transfers inaccordance with the FPM (Fundo de ParticipaGZo de Municipios)
andpersonal income tax contributions ofmunicipal employees are further significant and
secure sources o frevenue. Because mandatory intergovernmental transfers represent in
excess of 70% ofmunicipal current revenue, a largepart o f Betim's revenues are ineffect
protectedunder constitutional mandate and do not therefore depend on the tax-raising
capacity ofthe municipal government.

  The 2003 preliminary fiscal accounts indicate continuing growth of net current revenue, guaranteeing that
Betimcan satisfy the Fiscal Responsibility Law's requirements.

Again, sound fiscal behavior is inevidence. Betim's primary surpluses andpositive total
balances reducedthe debt amount andensured that all obligations imposedby the Fiscal
Responsibility Law were satisfied. As noted above, fiscal expansion in2002 ledto a
worsening o f municipal public accounts, but was quickly remedied in2003.
C.Projected Fiscal Situation, 2004-2014
Betim's fiscal situation is projected for the period 2004-2014, to assess the municipality's
capacity to repay the loan. The main assumptions, presented inTable 6, are based on the
government's current perfomance.

The projections are built under two scenarios. The first considers only the current loan
andthe IBRDloan; the second includes other loans, which arerequiredto maintain
historical level o f investments.

 3.1. FirstScenario. This scenario considers the World Bank loano fUS$24 million and
 analyzesBetim'scapacity to pay this loan and its current debt. The results arepresented inTable
 7.




                                                                                               71


As mentioned elsewhere, Betim's low indebtedness andrelatively highfinancial capacity
meanthat acquisition o fnew credit and hture debt will not affect the municipality's
financial health. Betim has over R$400 million headroom before reachingthe FRL 120%
ceiling for consolidatednet debt to net current revenue ratio (see Table 5). With the five-
year disbursement schedule, the WorldBank debt stock will reachR$ 87 million in2008,
the last year of disbursement. The IBRDdisbursements between 2004 and 2008 are well
below the ceiling, which in2003 stood at R$61 million.
Table 7 shows that, given the expected outlook for 2004-2014, debt service flows,
including World Bank debt obligations, will be well below the FRLceiling. The highest
debt service disbursements will come on stream in2009-2010, reaching4% o fprojected
net current revenue. The current level o f indebtedness is low, and the highest financial
commitments stemming from the existing debt will occur before 2009, when
reimbursement o fthe World Bank loan begins.
Betimhas substantial financial capacity interms o f the size o f its current net revenue.
Despite its low local tax receipts, the municipality benefits from sizeable
intergovernmental transfers from the federal and state governments. Inview o f the "base
o f origin" distribution arrangements o f the Minas Gerais state ICMS and the fact that
Betim is one o f the state's key industrial centers, the municipality can count on a large
and reliable source o f revenue.
At the same time, the restrictions imposedbythe tight fiscal policy adopted inthe public
sector overall have restrictedBetim's access to credit from federal financial agencies.
Combined with sound fiscal behavior, this credit rationing has kept Betim's indebtedness
low.
Insummary, theproposedWorldBank loanofUS$24.5 millionwill not markedly affect
the ability o f the Betim municipal government to fulfill its obligations under the Fiscal
Responsibility Law. The size o f the World Bank loan andthe conditions pertaining to it,
together with Betim's comfortable financial situation and its considerable indebtedness
andrepayment capacity, will ensure continuing compliance with FRLrequirements and a
reasonable debt profile over the next few years.
Scenario I1
This scenario is the base case scenario. It assumes that Betim will keep the historical
level of investment and contract additional loans. As shown inthe assumptions(Table 6) this
scenario i s a very conservative one, giventhat:
(i) Revenues do not increase with investment. It is assumed the municipality will not have a
financial benefitdirectlyrelatedwith investment. Inthe projection it is assumed that Municipaliy
Revenues increase with inflation and in some cases also with GDP. However as shown in the
economic analysis, beneficiaries are willing to pay for the improvements obtained with project
investment, such as, drainage, and parks, for which the municipality could charge and have
additional revenue. This additionalrevenue is not includedinthe projection;
(ii)RevenuesfromICMS are projectedwith inflationandGDP, whichresults ina real growth( 3
percentper year), lower thanthe real increase ofthe last 5 years (12 percentper year);
(iii)Poputationgrowth is not a variable for revenue increase inthe projection, even though it is
expected the Muncipality will have additional revenue when more people settle down there.



                                                                                            73

More houses will be built and therefore more property taxes will be billed. More people will
receive services and will pay for them. This additional income i s not considered inthe projection..
The results of the financial projection under this scenario are presented inTable 8.

To assess the financial viablility o fthe Municipality, six indicators are chosen: The first four are
established in the Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL), and the last two are chosen to monitor cash
flow availability to cover debt service and investment:
    0   debt/net current revenue with a maximum acceptable o f 120%(FRL);
    0   debt servicehet current revenue with a ceiling o f 11.5% (FRL);
    0   new debt/net current revenue which has to be less than 16% (FRL);
    0   personnel expenseshet current revenue with a top maximumo f 60% (FRL);
    0   debt service coverage, with a minimum recommended o f 1.5, measures the relation
        between the flow of funds generated internally divided by the debt service payment;
        investment coverage, with a minimumrecommended o f 30%, indicates the percentage o f
        investment financed with the cash flow from operation.

The FRL indicators are not enough to assess the financial viablilty o f the municipality given that
cash flow from operation i s not considered. The first three indicators set inthe FRL are good to
check the status o f the Municipality's debt related to revenues; the fourth indicator sets a limit on
personnel cost associated with revenue. However the municipality could comply with FRL
indicators and at the same time could present deficits. To cover this flaw, two other indicators are
included: debt service coverage, and investment coverage, which are                 used to evaluate
Municipality's availabilty o f cash to pay debt service and to cover part o f investment costs.




                                                                                                    74



Inscenario11,theMunicipality ofBetimisfinanciallyviableandableto assumetheproposed
loan. All indicators are well below the recommended ceilings. Inaddition, the cash flow from
operationreaches an IRRo f 620% o f IRRinthe 10-year period, with a NPV o fUS$755.5
million at a discount rate o f 12%. When population growth is 6.5% per year, as it has been in
Betiminthe last five years, the municipality is still financially viable with an IRRo f 14% and
NPV ofcash flow from operation o fUS$10million andthe financial indicators still show sound
results below recommendedlevels.
The financial results are particularly reassuring given this scenario is very conservative.

4. Sensitivity andRisk Analyses
A sensitivity analysis was projectedfrom the base case scenario. The analysis measuresthe impact
o f changes inone variable, keepingthe others unchanged financial risk i s measured when one
financial indicator does not comply with the recommended value inat least one year o fthe
projected period. The variables are those conveying risks to the expected outcome o fBetim's
financial situation: population growth rate, ICMS, tax revenues, federal transfers, exchange rate,
possible overruns inproject investment costs, and increases inoperating andmaintenance costs.
The impact andrisk significance o fthese variables is summarized inTable 10.

To enhance the financial analysis's accuracy, the uncertainty o f the real world is incorporatedby
using the Crystal Ball risk analysis software. This software measures the extend of various risks
and their impact on the financial situation o fthe Municipality, by modeling a probable distribution
for each risk variable and the resulting outcome. Based on a simulation o f 1,000 trials, the model
recalculates the results o f the financial projections by changing the major variables all at the same
time. The assumeddistributions o fprobabilities andtheir respective specifications for each
variable are presented inTable 11.

The financial risk analysis confirms the robustness of Betim's financial situation. Table 12
summarizes the risk analysis. All the debt indicators are below the established ceilings ineach
year of the projectedperiod, with probability higher than 82%. The personnel cost is below the
60% established inthe Fiscal Responsibility Law, with aprobability of 91%, andinvestment
coverage i s higher than 30% inevery year, with a probabilityof 45%, when the investment
coverage i s calculated as the average duringimplementation period, the probability ofbeing
higher than 30% i s 97%.

This analysis indicatesthat when all risk variables are analyzed simultaneously ina dynamic
world, the most important variables are the ICMS andpersonnel costs. Although not under
Betim's control, ICMS is not likely to decrease to the risk levels. Personnel costs are under
Betim's control andhave great significance for Betim's financial situation.

                  BRAZIL: IntegratedMunicipalProject          - BetimMunicipality
The goal o fthe BetimMunicipality Project ("the project") i s to enable the municipality o f Betim
to plan and achieve sustainable socio-environmental development, reduce poverty, improve urban
environmental conditions and enhance the city's quality o f life. Specifically, the project will
support Betim indeveloping and implementing a targeted series of integratedinfrastructure and
social service investmentsinthe Betim River Basin-the city's poorest andmost environmentally
degraded region-coupledwith broader efforts to improve municipal governance, regulatory
policy and institutional strengthening. The project's principal activities comprise: (i)municipal
infrastructure and urban environmental rehabilitation within the BetimRiver Basin, including
construction o f a netv sewage treatment plant and five open-air, flood regularizationbasins,
improvements to 15 kilometers (km) o fmacro-drainage and 18 kmof secondary roads, as well as
the restoration of and environmental protection to urbanwetlands andwatercourses through the
creation o f three urbanparks totaling 30 hectares (ha) and the restorationo fborderingriparian
vegetation; (ii) social inclusion programs, includingresettlement o f about 820 families living in
flood-prone areas and improved social policies andprograms at the municipal level; (iii)
institutional strengthening o fthe municipality's policies, finance and management capacities
related to governance and municipalplanning, including local services management, development
of improved information systems andbasic infrastructure cadastre, as well as specific activities
targeting environmental management strengthening, including development o f a Municipal
EnvironmentalManagementPlan(EMP) as a critical component o fthe UrbanMaster Plan,
support for improved water resources management andwater quality monitoring, as well as an
environmental education program.

The following annex provides information as to the Safeguard Policies triggered by the project,
safeguards-related risks and/or impacts identified through studies or assessments, the measures to
be taken to address those safeguards-related risks, andprocedures for ensuringthose measures are
achievedduringproject implementation. As indicatedbelow, the project has been designed to
comply fully with the letter and spirit o f relevant World Bank Safeguard Policies.

Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01)

The project is classified as Category A, requiring a thorough Environmental Assessment (EA). In
accordance with OP 4.01, the EAwas conducted by a team o f individual consultants, and dated
January2004. This EA evaluates with- andwithout-project scenarios, identifies potential direct
and indirect environmental impacts associated withthe project andother alternatives, develops
mechanisms and measures to avoid, minimize and/or mitigate negative impacts, andpresents an
Environmental Management Planwith specific activities, budgets and responsibilities to ensure
the implementation o fthese mitigating measures.

Inaccordance withthe Bank'sInformationDisclosurePolicy(BP 17.50), copies ofthisreport (in
Portuguese with an English-language summary) are available for public view at the office o f the
Secretary o f Environment(SEMEIA; RuaProfessor Oswaldo Franco, 55 -Centro, Betim); a copy
was also forwarded to the Bank's InfoShop on January 30,2004. The important findings and
useful recommendations from this report are reflected inproject design and summarized inthis
Annex.

                                                                                                  81

The EA found the range o fpotential environmental impacts (positive or negative) relateprimarily
to water quality, flood control and drainage, biodiversity, environmental management and strategic
planning.Onbalance, the proposedproject is expected to behighlypositive from an
environmental standpoint. It would improve environmental quality o f the urbanwetlands and
water-courses o f the BetimRiver Basin through the implementationo f sewage collection and
treatment, resettlement o f flood-prone settlements, creek restoration and urbanparks development,
improvements inwater quality related to industrialpollution through improvements inregulation,
licensing, andmonitoring, and through promoting the integrationo f environmental concerns in
long-term municipal development planning.Additionally, project-supportedtraining activities
targeting regulators, planners and decision-makers, as well as stakeholders would induce a series
o fbehavioral changes among urbanresidents, which would be expected to be environmentally
positive.

PositiveEnvironmentalImpact

Water Quality. The project would result insignificant water quality improvements to the Betim
and ParaopebaRivers through the reduction and treatment o fpollution sources, andrestorationo f
environmental services providedby riparian zones o furban streams. The project will directly
address the current lack o f wastewater collection andtreatment -which i s responsible for a
number o f critical negative urban environmental and quality-of-life impacts for Betim and
downstream populations. Specifically, the project will address the city's current critical water
quality situation through repairs to the existing sewerage network, the expansionof sewerage
services to cover all urban areas within Betim's two primary watersheds, the identification o f
illegal householdsewerage connections, and construction of a sewage treatment plant with a 500
litershecond (l/s) capacity. Inadditional to the reduction and treatment o f domestic pollution
sources, the project will target industrial and other non-domestic pollutionsources for reduction
through identification o f existing andpotential pollution sources (through the establishment o f a
cadastre), implementation o f a water quality monitoringprogram to identify the presence and
composition o f industrial pollutants, andimprovements inenvironmental regulation and licensing.
Additionally, by emphasizing the incorporation o f environmental criteria inthe design, planning
and implementationo fmunicipal development, as well as promoting environmental education
amongst residents, the project will indirectly lead to long-term improvements inwater quality.
Lastly, project activities to improve drainage, restore riparian vegetation andcreate linear
ecological parks along creek lengths will result inthe restoration o f important environmental
services provided by buffered, unpolluted, free-flowing creeks.

Flood Control and Drainage. Poor drainage and flooding withinthe Betim watershed i s the result
o f poor urbanplanningand water management, the unregulatedoccupation o f floodplain areas,
deposition o f garbage and solid waste, and deterioration o f aquatic and riparian environments, all
o f which have ledto highlevels and rates o f silt deposition. The project will address all ofthese
factors to improve flood control and drainage through a series o f targeted and coordinated
investments. The project will directly finance resettlement o f flood-prone settlements (which also
tend to be among the poorest) thereby reducing a source o f sediment while simultaneously
improvingthe quality o flife for those residents. The project will finance hydraulic improvements
through the removal o f trash throughout the lengths o f all urbancreeks, silt build-upin
constrained, urbanizedreaches, and solid waste through illegal and absent sewerage connections.
Additionally, the project will finance the construction of five flood retention basins -the


                                                                                                   82

management o f which will be linkedto that o f the Varzea das Flores Reservoir inthe upper basin
-soastoenableimprovedwatermanagementwithinthewatershed.Moreover,theprojectwill
address environmental deteriorationo f in- and near-stream environments directly, through the
support o fretainingun-urbanized creeks intheir natural state, restoringwetland vegetation along
creeks, and creating a series o f urban linear parks adjacent to streams, and indirectly, through the
promotion o f environmental criteria inlong-tenn planning andmanagement decisions,
strengthening o f environmental management capacity and environmental education campaigns to
highlightthe importance o fthese ecosystems.

UrbanEnvironmental Planning. The project will support the development o f an urban
environmental planas part o f the city's Master Plan. This planwill emphasize the improvement o f
environmental policies, regulation, andmanagement capacity through mechanisms emphasizing
policy choices, administrative procedures and financing instrumentsthat promote sustainable
environmental management andplanning. This i s anticipatedto include the updating o f aspects
such as urban planning, city and construction codes to improve all environmental and stormwater-
related issues. For example, new development will be linkedto mechanisms for protectingthe
city's natural and cultural resources. Contemplatedwithin the development o fthese instruments
will be the establishment o f sustainable financing mechanisms to ensure their long-term
maintenance. The project is expected to support the creation o f an environmental database
including legal and institutional components, infrastructure andpotential pollution source
cadastres, monitoring data and evaluation results. Project design will also addresspotentialneeded
improvements inwater resource management, such as identifying andresolving key gaps in
ongoing monitoring and regulations. Lastly, so as to promote sustainable governance, the planwill
emphasize the importance o f transparency and public participation inall decision-making,
monitoring and evaluation mechanisms.

Urban Environmental Management. The project will directly improve the environmental
management o f Betim's natural resources through support to the city's Secretariat ofthe
Environment. This support will emphasize technical capacity improvements relatedto the
Secretariat's execution o f its licensing mandate. The project will contribute to additional urban
environmental management improvements through support to the strengthening o fwater resources
management and water quality monitoring. Specifically, the project's support to the Paraopeba
River Basin Committee, both financially andinstitutionally, through modifications to state water
resource policies, will result inimproved water quality. The project will strengthen the
Committee's technical capacity by expanding its geologic and geotechnical database andcadastre
o fwater users andpollutiondischarge, through developing decisionmodels for water usage and
discharge, andthrough mapping land use andcapability. This system will serve as a basis for the
project's monitoring o f Betim River water quality. The project will also promote "greening" o f the
urbanenvironment through integrationofenvironmental considerations inurbanplanning, as
described above. This support is intended to broadenthe support for and management o f
greenways andurbangreen spaces infuture city development.

Biodiversity/Natural Habitats. The project is expected to result inimprovements to the aquatic and
riparian biodiversity within the Betim area anddownstream the Paraopeba River. The project's
emphasis on the maintenance o f natural conditions indrainage improvements, creation o furban
parks, andrestorationo f aquatic ciliar vegetation along streams will promote the restorationof
habitat for wetland andnon-wetland species alike. Bypromoting the preservationo fnatural

floodplains and drainage ways inthe upper watershed area, the project will promote the
maintenance o f existing aquatic andriparian habitats. Through the improvement o fwater quality
andremoval o f solid waste, the project will result indirect improvementsto aquatic andriparian
habitats inBetim andthe downstream Paraopeba River.The creation o f urbanparks along streams
andinother urbanareas will result inlong-term biodiversity benefitsto localplant andwildlife.
Andthe restorationofin-stream vegetationwill yield direct biodiversity benefits to aquatic and
semi-aquatic species.

Negative Environmental Impact

The project will finance a series o f infrastructure, including: 42km o f interceptors and secondary
sewerage network; one sewerage treatment plant; 15km o f macro drainage improvements; 5 open-
air, flood-retention basins; and 18kmo f secondary roads. The construction o f this infrastructure
could result insome limited environmental impacts, that would be mitigated through the
implementation o f a series o f mitigation measures included inthe project's Environmental
Management Plan (EMP) described below.

Noise, Air and Water Quality. Infrastructure construction would likelyresult inlocalized short-
term environmental impacts including dust andnoise pollution, erosion. Potential air andwater
quality impacts could result from the extraction andtransport o f dredge sediments involved in
drainage improvements. Additionally, the disposal o f dredged sediments could result inlong-term
water quality impacts ifnot well-managed. These issues would be managed through a series o f
mitigation measures described below.

Biodiversity/Natural Habitats. The construction o fproject-related infrastructure could yield
localized impacts to riverine habitats through the short-term removal o friparian vegetation. This
riparian "mata ciliar vegetation is protected under Braziliannational law. Project activities to
                      "
restore riverine vegetation (described inthe EMPbelow) will more than offset this impact.

Involuntary Resettlement. Implementationo fproject activities will result inthe resettlement o f 820
families inurban flood-prone areas and involve the acquisition o f 323 empty, privately owned
plots. The project's Resettlement Plan, done incompliance with the Bank's OP 4.12 and described
below, outlines the steps that the project will take to resettle or compensate those affectedparties.

Environmental Management Plan

The EA includes a series o f mitigation and enhancement measures designed to ensure the project
minimizes any negative impacts, and improves the positive ones. These measures, together with a
budget (inUSD),timetable and institutional responsibilities constitute the project's EMP, which is
summarized inthe following section. Many o f the activities included within the EMP are already
mainstreamed withinproject design, and do not require a separate document.

Natural Habitats Monitoring and Mitigation.($420,000plus costs includedinproject design):
While the project i s expected to result in significant positive impacts for biodiversity andnatural
habitats, short-tenn impacts to riverine habitats will result from the undertaking o f drainage
improvements. These impacts will be more than mitigated byproject interventions to rehabilitate
Betim River tributaries through eradication andtreatment o fpollution sources, resettlement o f


                                                                                                    84

populations livingwithin the floodplains, creation o furbanparks, andrestoration o f wetland
vegetation along the project waterways. Specific environmental mitigation relative to natural
habitats include the construction o fthe wastewater treatment plant to offset impacts related to the
expansion o f sewerage collection, the creation andmanagement of 30 ha o furbanparks, andthe
restorationo f riparian vegetation along ALL creeks affectedby the project. Additionally, the
project will ensure that the urbandrainage program will emphasize the selection o f alternatives
that: (i)maximize preservation, to the extent possible, o f existing water courses andmata ciliar
vegetation; (ii) adjacent spaces to create or augment linear parks to promote environmental
                 use
awareness o f residents and to buffer urban impacts to streams; and (iii) strengthen the protection
o f existingparks or protected areas to maximize the long-term sustainability o f water quality
improvements. These activities will be the responsibility o f the Project Coordinating Unit (UGP)
and the technical units.

Environmental Management System. (Costs included inproject design): The project's
environmental management system includes the development and oversight o f social and
environmental procedures related to all project works. This will be the responsibility o f the UGP
andthe technical executing agencies (Secretary o fEnvironment (SEMEIA) and Secretary o f
Works andHousing).

Environmental Construction Manual (Costs included in the works design): The project will
ensure the development o f guidelines and rules for all contractors that set forth the environmental
rules and procedures. These guidelines will be appended to all project infrastructure-related
contracts. The manual will include actions related to the environmental management and
supervision o f works, the environmental requirements for contractors, environmental planning
rules for construction and oversight o f works, including activities to minimize and mitigate
construction-related impacts. This will be the responsibility o f the UGP andcontractors.

323 owners o f undeveloped urban plots. The project has established a Resettlement Action Plan
(RAP) that offers two compensatory alternatives at no financial cost to the family or owner: (i)
replacement housing with basic services on a plot close to their current location; or (ii)        cash
compensation based on a social index sufficient for the purchase o f replacement housing at the
family's discretion, plus social compensation for poor families to assist in the move for.


                                                                                                    85

Additionally, the project will provide technical support to strengthen the social and legal
municipal capacities so as to ensure comprehensive juridical and social support i s available for
resettled families throughout the entire resettlement process. The project's monitoring and
evaluation component will also track the success o f resettlement and related institutional
strengthening. These activities will be implementedby the UGP and the Secretaries o f Works and
Housing, and Social Assistance.

Industrial and Non-Domestic Pollution Control ($500,000): The project will support industrial
andnon-domestic pollution control through fundingand overseeing the following activities.

    will be incorporated into the project's monitoring andevaluation system.
The oversight o fthese activities will be the responsibility o f SEMEIA.

Illegal Household Sewerage Connections: (Costs bome by COPASA): The project will fund the
`Caqa esgoto' program implemented by COPASA, which identifies illegal domestic wastewater
discharge. When illegal connections are identified, the homeowner will be required to properly
connect to the sewerage network. The work will be conducted by COPASA, with the costs bome
by the property owner (using a delayed payment plan) or by the municipality, inthe case where
the property owner cannot afford it. Oversight o f these activities will be the responsibility o f
COPASA.

D a m Safety ($85,000): In accordance with the Bank's OP 4.37 policy, the EA evaluated the
operational and safety procedures for the Vhrzea das Flores Reservoir located inthe upper Betim
River watershed. The project will ensure that the reservoir's operation will be coordinated with the
flood control management plans for the Betim watershed, emphasizing harmonization o f reservoir
operation with that o f the five flood-storage reservoirs built through the project. These activities
will be overseen by COPASA, the state water company, who is responsible for the management o f
the Vhrzea das Flores Reservoir and i s represented within the UGP. These activities will be part of
the works annual operational manuals, which will be submitted to the UGP. Additionally,
COPASA will submit to the UGP annual reservoir inspectionreports. Oversight o f these activities
will be the responsibility o fthe Betimmunicipality andCOPASA.

Flood-Retention Basin Operation and Safety Procedures ($60,000): The project includes the
development and hnding o f operational and safety procedures for each o f the five new flood-
retentionbasins. These procedures will include rules for individualbasins, as well as rules for their
joint operation. Technical and safety procedures for operating the basins will be funded through
Component Ia, while routine operation and safety procedures will be established and implemented
within the municipality administration structure. These activities will be the responsibility o f the
UGPandthe Secretary o f CivilDefense.


                                                                                                   86

DredgeTransportandDisposal(cost includedon drainage works): The project will include the
removal, transport and disposal o f dredged sediments originating inthe project watercourses.
These materials will be handed inaccordance with rules and procedures, consistent with licensing
requirements, established ina dredge materials manual. This manual will be developed as part o f
the project. These activities will be under the oversight o fthe UGP and SEMEIA.

Environmental Institutional Strengthening ($1,160,000): The project supports a number o f
activities aimed at strengthening environment-related municipal institutional capacity. These
activities include: (i)the development o f a municipal urban environmental plan to integrate

technical manuals and environmental procedures for all new development within the city,
including all flood control and water management development; and (iv) the implementation o f an
Environmental Database. These activities are the responsibility o f SEMEIA.

EnvironmentalMonitoring($620,000); As environmentalmonitoring is critical to the success of
a number o f project activities, the project includes environmental monitoring within several
project components. Through Component 1.3.a., the project will monitor the project's impact on
the water quality inthe Betimwatershed. Additionally, several o f the project indicators included in
the project's monitoring and evaluation element (Component 111.4) are environmental due to the
project's goals o f promoting sustainable development and improved environmental quality. These
activities are the responsibility o f the UGP and SEMEIA.

Consultation:
A public consultation was also carried out following the disclosure principles o f the OP4.01. The
key issues raised by the consultation event are summarized on the EA report. This event took
place on January 23, 2004 and was attended by representatives o f civil society organizations,
including community based and environmental organizations. The state o f Minas Gerais
government was also represented by COPASA and FEAN. Intotal some 250 participants attended
the meeting.

Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12)

The project triggers the Bank's Involuntary Resettlement policy as the project will result in the
involuntary taking o f land. In accordance with the Bank's policy, the project includes a full
Resettlement Action Plan (RAP). The following section summarizes the content o f the RAP.

                              PROJECTRESETTLEMENT IMPACT

The total number o f families to be resettled by the project i s estimated at 820. Additionally, there
are 323 privately owned, undeveloped lots whose owners the project will compensate.

Families to be resettled will be compensated for their housing andproperty. Compensation for the
empty lots will be only for that portiono f the property affected by the project. The majority o f lots
will be partially effected, allowing the current owner to keep the remaining part o fthe property.

include the implementation o fnatural disaster prevention measures, the installation of sewerage
interceptors to prevent sewerage run-offto streams, the constructiodrehabilitation o f macro-
drainage as appropriate, the creation o fnew urbanparks, the restoration andrehabilitation o f
riparianvegetation, andimprovement to secondary roads.

Consultation
As part o f the RAP preparation several consultation events took place. This consultation
comprised meeting with the community as well as with formal and informal community leaders,
as well as in-home visits. These visits were dual purpose, innature. First, they were used to collect
socio-economic data. And secondly, the interviewers had been trained to provide information
about the overall project.

Legal and Social Assistance

social assistance includes support to the families inthe new housing environment aimed at
creating the appropriate conditions for social interaction. Among others, this includes the
organization o f `condominium' rules inthe resettlement housing areas.

Grievance Mechanisms
The project will create two units for facilitating the assistance and grievance mechanisms close to
the area from where the families will be removed. This units will constitute an office and a team o f
social assistance workers. The assistance as well as the Q&A provided will be registered and
follow-up will be ensured through a monitoring system to be enforcedbythe Project Coordination
Unit.

Land Acquisition for Resettlement Housing

area after the finalization o f the cadastre will not be eligible for resettlement or compensation
through the project. Key elements of this policy include:

Selection of the Resettlement Location -The two 10haresettlement areas (each allowing for the
construction o f 250 housingunits) are located within the urban area and close to the current living
location of the families, have basic infrastructure and adequate topography, and comply with
existing local urban planning guidelines.

Housing Model: New housing will be constructed inaccordance with technical standards and
current legislation. Each 36 m2house will includetwo bedrooms, a kitchen, a bathroom, water and
sewerage connections, grease traps, etc., on a 100m2plot.

Land Titles: Resettlement housingunits will be provided with regular land titles.

Income Replacement: Other affected properties used for commercial, industrial or mixed-use
purposes, are limited and located near to the new resettlement sites. Consequently, no significant
impact on the income o f the affected families in anticipated as a result o f project activities.
However, incase o f such impact, the following compensatory measures will apply:

a. Removal Assistance: All affected families will receive removal assistance to transfer their
    movable assets amounting to R$350.00;
b. Cash compensation:

              about R$2150.00.

Social compensation: Inaddition to costs for housing, the project will fund an additional amount
for social compensation, intended to allow the families o f smallest andmost precarious dwellings
that opt for cash compensation, to have the possibility o f obtaining sufficient compensation to
regain andeven improve their livingconditions. The social compensation amount decreases as the
house value increases. The table below illustrates the social compensationmechanism:

The RAP'Sactivities to promote appropriate resettlement will be complemented by a number o f
social programs currently being executed by the Municipality o f Betim, with support from federal
and municipal funds. These programs, which focus on areas such as poverty mitigation, job
training, women's employment, and youth support, will also receive support from the project.
Linkages between these programs and the resettled families will be enhanced as most o f these
programs are executed by SEMAS, who will assist the Housing Department in executing project
resettlement activities. These joint works are regularly undertaken in all resettlement executed by
the Municipality.

InstitutionalResponsibilities
The MunicipalHousing Department, with the support o f SEMAS, will be incharge o f
implementing all project resettlement actions. The Housing Department has implemented several
resettlement operations as part o f the Municipality efforts to upgrade the city standard. Through
these operations, some 2600 families livinginhigh-risk areas have already beenresettled in
twelve housing complexes builtbythe Housing Department. Additionally, the Housing
Department i s responsible for construction o f `sites and services' solutions and slumupgrading
interventions. Support to the Housing Department and SEMAS will be providedthrough the
Project Coordination Unit who will receive appropriate technical capacity to support the
resettlement team as needed.

Monitoring
The monitoring o f resettlement will include participatory surveys at three stages: (i)   immediately
following the cadastral survey, to select a group o f affected families that would be monitored
throughout the resettlement process; (ii)   after the negotiation process, following the transfer o f
housing or payment, and; (iii)  between 6-18 months following resettlement.

                                        Annex 16: Social Analysis
                  BRAZIL: IntegratedMunicipalProject                - BetimMunicipality
This Annex briefly describes the socioeconomic context o f Betim, focusing on social programs in
the municipality.' It also highlights the challenges faced by the Municipal Social Assistance
Secretariat (SEMAS) inpromoting well targeted, coordinated, and effective social development
policy andpoverty reduction activities inBetim. The evaluation o fthose issues have been
fundamental the design o f Component 2 - Social Inclusion, presented inSectionB and Annex 4 o f
the present document. Social programs financed bythe federal andthe municipal governments in
Betimbenefit an estimated one-third o fthe population. This estimate reflects (i) extent o fthe
poverty inthe municipality, where 60% o f the population earns less than 3 SM; and (ii)              the low
local index o f humanmunicipal development (IDHM).Social programs inBetimhave been
characterized by two main types o f action: (i)   federal safety net programs through cash transfers to
complement the income o fpoor families inthe short term; and (ii)             municipal socio-economic
programs mainlypromoted by SEMAS to enhance social development inthe longterm.

SEMAS manages 38 programs either directly or inpartnership with federal, state, municipal, and
civil society organizations. These programs are complementedbythose o f a local social network
comprising 84 organizations. Children o fpre-school age are the maintarget o f 70% o fthese local
programs. (See note in Targeting,bottom o fp. 87.) Despitethese efforts, Betim's social system is
still fragmented. Project preparation identified the need to improve the efficiency andbroadenthe
impact o fboth federal social safety net programs andmunicipal social policy. Inparticular,
targeting criteria, consistency, local management and database, implementation arrangements, and
accountability need improvement.

Project preparationalso identified the need to strengthen SEMAS, as the principal andmost
visible coordinator of Betim's social policies. By strengthening SEMAS analytically, technically,
andfinancially, the BetimProject will correct disperse, fragmented andoverlapping actions and
will give direction and consistency to locally definedpriorities andstrategic goals.

1.Socioeconomic andDemographicContextinBetim

Betim's population has grown dizzyingly inthe last two decades, rising from 84,127 in 1980to
306,675 in2000. Its density increased from 243 inhabitantsKm2 in 1980to 887 inhabitantsKm2
in2000, as aresult ofdemographic growth andofthe continuousurbanizationofits territory,
which increased from 91.2% in 1980to 97.3% in2000.

Betim has grownbecause since the 1970speople havebeenleaving the city o f Belo Horizonte-
once the principal pole o fmigration inthe Minas Gerais. The saturated property market and
consequent rise o f land and housingprices has driven the poorest residents and migrantsto nearby
cities insearch o fjobs andmore affordable services. Between 1980 and 2000, Betimattracted
74,000 new residents, compared to 34,000 inBelo Horizonte, the highest intra-regional migration
(27.6% o f the total intra-regionalmigration).


2. Povertyin Betim

Two indices express the sum o f a set o f indicators for Betim's socioeconomic status: the Index o f
MunicipalHumanDevelopment (DHM)and the Index o f Social Exclusion (IES).

2.1 Index of MunicipalHumanDevelopment
The IDHMwas calculatedfor Betim, Belo Horizonte, and Contagem, the three largest andmost
economically active municipalities within the RMBH. Betim hadthe lowest IDHMamongthe
three municipalities at state and national levels, inboth 1991and 2000, with the exception o fthe
birthandthe longevity indices. The latter are associated with general quality oflife, reflecting
relative improvement inlocal livingconditions.




        National ClassificationI  1345   I   1187   I    42       80    I  618   I  830


With lower numbers denoting higher humandevelopment, Betim's rankinghas improved from
144to 138 within the 853 municipalities inMinas Gerais. The inverse can be observed at national
level as Betim has moved down from 1,345 to 1,187 within Brazil's 5,600 municipalities.

2.2 Index of Social Exclusion

The Index o f Social Exclusion (IES) was calculated in2000 inBetim, Belo Horizonte, and
Contagem, complementing the IDHMthrough a set o f indicators for social vulnerability.




                                                                                                 101

With 0 representing the worst situation, Betimhas a lower IESthan Belo Horizonte and
Contagem, as shown inTable 4. The low value o f the Index o f Inequality, however, indicates
social disparities and territorial fragmentation.


3. Social Programs inBetim

3.1 Federal Social Safety Net Programs

The federal government supports three social programs inBetimthrough a monthly cash transfer
to families that earn up to 2 SM/month (US$120) andhave dependent children, assisting
approximately 25,000 households. To qualify, beneficiary families must enroll their dependent
children inschool andkeep them there.




                   Improve children access and permanence inschool
                   Integrate parents into children's educational process




These programs have found gaps incoverage, where some families receive more thanone benefit
while others livinginthe same conditions receive nothing.

Component 2 will aim to (i)    inform the new federal government's `BolsaFamilia'program of
existing impacts and challenges; and (ii) potential linkages and complementaritiesbetween
                                             find
short-term cash transfer programs and SEMAS's long-term programs.




                                                                                             102

3.2 SEMAS's MunicipalSocial Policies

Since 2001,the Municipality o f Betim has decentralized its institutional and legal framework
towards the regions considered most socially vulnerable, through eight Regional SEMAS. This i s
consistent with the Federal Organic Law for Social Assistance (LOAS no. 8.742/93), which
mandates localmanagement o f social programs and actions.

Betimhas 91municipal social programs, developed and implementedby eight Secretariats or local
organizations: SEMAS (38), APROMIV (25), FUNARBE(7), Housing Superintendence (7),
Education Secretariat (6), Anti-drugs Superintendence (4), Sport Secretariat (2) and Government
Secretariat (2). The Government Secretariat administers a municipal cash transfer program,
`Cesta-Escola ',which assists an average o f 18,000 families.

As mentioned inthe introduction, SEMAS programs are managed either directly or inpartnership
with federal, state, municipal and/or civil society organizations, and complementedby actions and
projects developedby a local social network, which comprises 84 organizations. Approximately
25,000 individuals are assisted by these initiatives. The UFMGanalysis and discussions with
Municipal Secretariats and SEMAS showed that despite all efforts the social system inBetimi s
fragmented, particularly inits targeting, geographic coverage, andmanagement.

Targeting. There is a clear needto enhance the capacity and effectiveness o f SEMAS and the local
social network inresponding to growing, diversified demand for services. Children o fpre-school
age, considered the most vulnerable population, are the main target o f SEMAS ando f 70% o f
Betim's local social network and social programs. This concentration isjustified because 32% o f
households with children from 0-6 years of age eam less than2 S Mper month. The demand is
still higher than SEMAS's capacity to meet it. Only 4 o fthe 84 organizations address migrants as
their main target, despite Betim's rapid demographic growth, and only one organization addresses
migrant unemployment. Other groups, including a growing elderly population, and issues, such as
income generation, also merit more attention.

Geographical Coverage. The regional SEMAS,with their focus on regions without social
facilities, such as Norte, have beenwell receivedbythe population. This administrative
decentralization, however, has not been accompanied by decentralization incoverage. With the
exception o f day-care centers andpre-schools, most services and actions remain concentrated in
the central region, where income is highest.

This centralizationo f services inthe central region andunequal distribution o forganizations and
services means that the most vulnerable (the elderly, disabled, andunemployed) must paymore
for transportation to social services and spend more time getting there. This pattern extends to
sharp regional differences inbasic services, with cases where 65% o fresidents ina region lack
connection to the sewerage system. This reveals the importance o f improvingefforts to provide
social services for the population intheir area o f origin.

Management. The segmented targeting system and geographic concentrationo f services inthe
central regionrevealbottlenecks inmanagement o f the social system, pointing to a need to
improve alignment and collaboration among service providers, public communication, and
staffing. With regard to competition for resources within the social network as well as the
existence o f different social cadastres within the Municipalityindicate the need for strong
coordination and accountability. Special attention should be paidto better understanding the
relationship between SEMAS and the social network andthe interrelations within the social
network. Inaddition, the internal incentives, structure andinteractionwithin the Municipal
Secretariats should be improved to align efforts andresources towards more integratedand
effective social development policies (income generation, housing, etc).

Withregardto communication, alarge number o fpeople are referredfrom one organization to
another, either because the service requested was not available or the capacity to meet the demand
was inadequate. This points to lack o f appropriate channels o f information on the source and
existence o f services available ineach SEMAS Regional andwithin the social network.

Onstaffing, most organizations inthe local socialnetwork and SEMAS said they lackedthe
professionally trained social service providers andnecessary equipments to manage andmet
existing demand.
