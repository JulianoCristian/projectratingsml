the project\n            is to assist the municipality of Betim in: (a) promoting\n            sustainable socio-environmental development, (b) reducing\n            inequality, and (c) enhancing the city's quality of\n            life through integrated investments in urban environment\n            infrastructure and social services coupled with broader\n            efforts to improve municipal governance, regulatory policy,\n            and institutional strengthening. The project has the\n            following four components: Component 1) will focus on\n            strengthening policies, finance and management capacities of\n            the Betim Municipality in key thematic areas: governance and\n            planning; local service provision; and environmental\n            management. Component 2) will finance short, medium and\n            long-term initiatives to improve living conditions for poor\n            and vulnerable families. It will also strengthen municipal\n            social policies and programs through: resettling families\n            living in risk-prone areas; support for physical\n            improvements in poor communities; and strengthen municipal\n            social policies and programs. Component 3) will invest in\n            environmental improvement of the Betim River basin and in\n            the quality of life of its inhabitants by: implementing and\n            expanding basic urban environmental infrastructure,\n            improving the protection of water resources by creating\n            three urban parks (totaling 30 ha) and restoring riparian\n            vegetation. Component 4) will establish a project management\n            unit (UGP) responsible for managing and monitoring project\n            implementation and coordinating civil works supervision and\n            project auditing."}, "docdt": "2004-05-21T00:00:00Z"}
