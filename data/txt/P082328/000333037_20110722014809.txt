About this Report
       The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank’s self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank’s work is producing the
expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEG annually assesses 20-25 percent of the
Bank’s lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that
are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which
Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
      To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEG staff examine project files and other
documents, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other in-country
stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
      Each PPAR is subject to internal IEG peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. The PPAR is also sent to the borrower
for review. IEG incorporates both Bank and borrower comments as appropriate, and the borrowers' comments are
attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has
been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.

About the IEG Rating System for Public Sector Evaluations
     IEG’s use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive
at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional
information is available on the IEG website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project’s
objectives are consistent with the country’s current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project’s design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High,
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface
This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) of the Brazil Integrated
Municipal Project – Betim Municipality (Ln7246) for which the World Bank approved a
Loan of US$24.1 million on July 1, 2004. An amount of US$26,812 was cancelled and
the Loan closed on June 30, 2009, as planned.

The report is based on a review of project documents, including the Implementation
Completion Report, the Project Appraisal Document, legal documents and project files,
and on discussions held with Bank staff involved in the project. An IEG mission visited
Brazil in January 2010 to review project results and met with nearly 30 interlocutors
including officials of Betim Municipality, Minas Gerais State (in Belo Horizonte) and the
Federal Government (in Brasilia). The mission also met with project beneficiaries during
field visits to project sites in Betim. IEG gratefully acknowledges the courtesies and
attention of all these participants, and their keen interest in the project evaluation process.

IEG selected this operation for a PPAR field assessment to verify the ongoing
performance of this important urban development project, one of the first financed by the
Bank to be fully decentralized to the municipal level.

Following standard IEG procedures, copies of the draft PPAR were sent to government
officials and agencies for their review, no comments were received.

Summary
The Municipality of Betim, (population 416,000) hosts a very important industrial hub of
Brazil’s third largest metropolitan region, Belo Horizonte (population 5.4 million). Betim
itself has a strong economy, but families of the higher paid workers of its industries
prefer not live there. Instead, they reside in the city of Belo Horizonte for the better
services and amenities they say they find there, making a daily 25-30 km commute.
Today Betim’s population is twelve times more than when the Fiat vehicle assembly
plant, now Brazil’s largest, launched industrial development there in 1970. So Betim is
practically a new town. Urban service coverage today is generally good: 94.9 percent for
water and 67.9 percent for sewage connections. However, only 9.1 percent of the city’s
sewage was treated in 2009. Raw sewage has turned the small Betim River—
1.4m3/second flow—into an open sewer as it runs through the urban center.
To help address this problem, Betim municipality requested assistance through the Brazil
Integrated Municipal Project – Betim Municipality reviewed here. This was the first
“retail” municipal project designed to help one city as borrower that the Bank financed in
Brazil. Earlier municipal assistance by the Bank had been through “wholesale” projects
that supported many municipalities simultaneously. Betim itself had been a beneficiary of
one such prior operation in Minas Gerais called SOMMA. A recent IEG study found that,
worldwide, wholesale projects perform better than retail projects.
Betim municipality was well placed to take charge of this retail project and the loan. It
had a healthy fiscal position strengthened partly with the assistance of SOMMA. Betim
also had its own ambitious Strategic Development Plan. The acute environmental damage
to the Betim River system, however, posed a development challenge for the municipality.
All three Project objectives—promoting socio-environmental development, reducing
inequality/poverty, and enhancing Betim’s quality of life—were substantially relevant to
Betim’s own Strategic Plan and to the Bank’s 2008 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS).
The first objective was substantially relevant to these documents’ environmental
priorities, even though it used a “socio-environmental development” formulation that was
not adopted by these policy documents or defined by the project itself. Reducing
inequality/poverty, the second objective, was substantially relevant, although disparate
references - to reducing inequality in the project appraisal document (PAD) and to
reducing poverty in the loan agreement (LA) - raises uncertainties about the project’s
intent. The relevance of the third objective of enhancing Betim’s “quality-of-life”, to
Betim and Bank priorities, was substantial - understanding “quality-of-life”
improvements to come from the infrastructure and services provided by the project.
The relevance of the project design was modest, with its unrealistic expectation of fully
cleaning up the Betim River very quickly and for including project institutional
development components that were unrelated to the project objectives.
The pace of project implementation was uneven. Start-up stalled while loan effectiveness
conditions were being met. Implementation peaked around mid-term during a 19 month
period between October 2005 and July 2007 when 90 percent of the entire Loan was
disbursed. Disbursements then stalled until the final months of the outgoing municipal
administration in 2008. The falling US dollar - Brazilian real exchange rate sharply
                                              x


reduced the local currency value of the Loan, and required significantly greater local
counterpart funding than foreseen to pay for it.
The project’s mid-term acceleration did not affect the implementation of the Betim
Central sewage treatment plant, not financed by the Bank loan, but still the project’s
largest component accounting for 40 percent of total costs. Construction began three
years behind schedule in the project’s final months in early 2009. Among the causes of
delay, common to the implementation experience of many other projects, were:
protracted land acquisition that alone took two years; the need to change land use through
a protracted approval process by the municipal council; engineering challenges of the
site; and the initial reluctance of COPASA, the Minas Gerais (MG) state utility
responsible, to undertake these works and the later challenge of fitting them into its state-
wide work program. Legal action was taken against COPASA by MG’s state prosecutor
ministério público requiring COPASA to carry out the Betim works. During IEG’s visit
in January 2010, work was well advanced, and by end-May 2010, the contractor informed
IEG that it had completed the job, handing the plant over to COPASA at that time.
M&E’s negligible rating comes from a design that did not focus upon intended outcomes
foreseen by the objectives. This made meaningful implementation and utilization of
M&E very difficult. The consequences include a lack of data on project outcomes, and
uncertain data on the full final project costs of the operation.
Thus far, results in promoting sustainable socio-environmental development, the project’s
first objective, have not yet been achieved, but are likely to be significant when the
central sewage plant becomes fully operational, sewage interceptors are connected and
illegal sewage discharge is curbed. These considerations of expected future benefits make
for a substantial efficacy rating. Betim River pollution continues and, at this writing, the
river’s water quality remains poor. It should be set for a steady improvement, however, as
the Central sewage treatment plant becomes fully operational, provided that continuing
illegal sewage discharge elsewhere in Betim is curtailed. When fully operational and with
all sewage interceptors connected, the Central treatment plant will have capacity to treat
all sewage collected in Betim, well above the 9.1 percent treated in 2009.
Mainly for the lack of project baselines and targets, the project’s second objective of
reducing inequality or poverty did not yield evidence at the level of the Betim
municipality, but localized and specific project efforts led to overall substantial efficacy.
The Project resettled 887 low-income families from flood prone areas, some into new
housing areas developed under the operation, in accordance with Bank safeguards. Also a
review by the project of the Federal Government’s Bolsa Familia conditional cash
transfer program in Betim identified additional eligible low-income beneficiaries,
expanding coverage three-fold.
Enhancing the quality of life in Betim, the project’s third objective, had mixed results
with modest efficacy. Drainage works, involving a storm water retention basin, improved
lining of river and canal banks, and dredging, reduced the risks of future flooding. Sub-
projects called Avenidas Sanitarias brought better street-level drainage and road access to
selected neighborhoods of Betim. Work began on two of the three planned urban parks
but was not completed. They are now fenced off without public access. More generally,
Betim’s ability to improve municipal services in the future is enhanced by the
strengthening of its already sound municipal finances over the 2004-2009 project period.
                                            xi


The efficiency of the project investments is rated modest. Final data show cost overruns
in local currency of 25 percent. The appraisal method of cost-benefit analysis may not be
applicable at completion, however. Proxy benefits estimated at appraisal, beneficiaries’
willingness to pay for environmental improvements such as the recreational use of urban
parks and other environmental improvements, should by now be measureable as concrete
results—results that still have to materialize when expected benefits actually materialize.
IEG rates the overall outcome as moderately satisfactory, as the project has yet to fully
achieve its relevant objectives but is likely to do so, albeit with moderate shortcomings.
The risk to development outcome is rated significant, because population and economic
growth will continue to challenge the urban environment, and illegal sewage discharges
still need to be curbed. Bank performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory, a higher
rating requiring a stronger project design with realistic environmental targets, a fuller
preparation of key components, and a results framework built around clear intended
outcomes and an M&E system to track progress in achieving them. Bank supervision
could have more readily recognized the challenges faced by project implementation.
Borrower performance is rated moderately satisfactory for Betim’s commitment to the
project investments especially through increased counterpart funding, but with
shortcomings being the late delivery of key components and less than fully satisfactory
record keeping.


The lessons of the experience include:
       o If the scope of an autonomous municipal development project goes beyond
         municipal responsibilities, as this project’s did by invoking environmental and
         sanitation improvements and monitoring that are state-level responsibilities in
         the case of Betim, project design should include a Project Agreement with the
         Bank that binds any state level parties to an operation through the Bank—
         COPASA in this case.

       o Bank preparation of investment projects that target environmental
         improvements should deploy relevant specialized technical knowhow and
         experience effectively so that environmental problem are properly appraised
         and feasible targets set for improvements. For this project, illegal sewage
         discharge, that continues to pollute the river, needed more analysis and
         preventative action, while river water quality targets should have been more
         modest and achievable over a reasonable time period.

       o The preparation of components in investment projects, especially key ones
         such as the Betim Central sewage treatment plant, should routinely take into
         account land acquisition, land use zoning, stakeholder commitment and site
         difficulties, to set a realistic and achievable path to implementation.

       o Policies and actions to curb the causes of environmental degradation should
         be at the core of operations designed to improve the urban environment. The
         lesson from this project is the need to include measures to curb the illegal
         discharge of sewage, observed on site by the IEG mission in Betim that, if not
                               xii


curtailed, could bypass the environmental gains made by additional sewage
treatment.

1. Background
1.1      The Municipality of Betim and its 416,000 residents 1 host a very important
industrial hub of Brazil’s third largest metropolitan region, Belo Horizonte, itself with a
population of 5.4 million in 2008. Betim’s estimated GDP of RS$21.5 billion (US$11.0
billion) in 2007 makes it economically the second largest municipality in Minas Gerais
(MG) State. A GDP per capita of R$51,700 (US$26,500) ranks Betim’s as one of the
highest in Brazil, thanks to value-added by the Fiat vehicle assembly plant, Brazil’s
largest, and a major Petrobras oil refinery. Betim’s high GDP per capita does not mean
that its residents are predominantly high income, however. On the contrary, most highly
paid industrial employees who work in Betim’s industries prefer to live in better served
residential areas of the capital, Belo Horizonte, making a daily 25-30 km commute to
their places of work in Betim. The majority of Betim’s population is moderate to low-
income, with 29 percent considered to be poor. Moreover, 20 percent of the population
received some kind of conditional cash assistance such as through the Federal
Government’s Bolsa Familia program (PAD p. 9).

1.2      Betim’s population has grown rapidly since industrial development was launched
there in 1970, with the establishment of the Fiat assembly plant. Then Betim had just
35,174 inhabitants. Its population today is twelve times greater, making Betim in this
respect, a new town. Most “new” urban development has taken place along an 8 km axis
between the large industrial plants to the east of the municipality and the old town center
to the west (see map at end of this report). Some of these residential areas, if not favelas,
still lack basic sanitation services. While 94.9 percent of Betim’s population has adequate
water supply and 67.9 percent are connected to sewer networks, only 9.1 percent of the
sewage collected is actually treated. The resulting pollution of Betim’s watercourses has
turned the small Betim River 2 into an open sewer as it meanders through the town,
prompting the municipality’s request for Bank assistance to clean it up.

1.3     That assistance came through the Brazil Integrated Municipal Project – Betim
Municipality (Ln 7246) reviewed by this Project Performance Assessment Report
(PPAR), and called “the Project” hereafter. This was the first example in Brazil of direct
Bank support to an individual municipality as Borrower (with a Federal Government
guarantee). For dealing with just one municipality, this kind of operation is called a
“retail” municipal development project in a recent IEG study of this sector (IEG 2009).
Before this, Bank support for municipal development in Brazil had been for many
municipalities indirectly through intermediary institutions. IEG’s study found such

 By population, Betim ranks in 52nd place among Brazil’s 5,500 municipalities, some 850 of which, with
more than 25,000 inhabitants each, accommodate most of the country’ urban population.
2
 As it crosses the town, the Betim River runs for 35 kms from the Varzea das Flores dam in the north to the
large Paraopeba River to the south (whose flow is one hundred times greater). At its maximum (within the
town), the Betim River is 25 meters wide with an average flow of 1.4m3 per second. That is about twice the
width and flow of the Rock Creek in central Washington DC. Throughout this report “Betim River” refers
to the small system within the urban area that comprises the river itself, and its two smaller tributaries, the
Areias and the Imbiruçu (see photo on p. 4 and map at end of this report).

confidence in its future economic
development potential while considering social and environmental issues at the same
time, is apparent in the municipality’s Strategic Development Plan (Box 1).

1.5     The industrial development and demographic growth of Betim have been
remarkable, but have taken their toll on the urban environment. Untreated sewage
transforms the Betim River from a clean water stream as it enters the city into an open
sewer by the time it has traversed the town center some 12 km downstream. At present, it
discharges some 1.4 m3 per second of very poor quality water into the much larger
Paraopeba River 23 km further downstream. Thus water quality of the Betim River, the
key environmental performance indicator of the project (ICR p.8), is an iconic indicator
of the quality of life of Betim that the project sought to enhance.

 In the past ten years, the Bank has supported 228 municipalities through three State-level “wholesale”
projects in Bahia, Ceará and Minas Gerais. The projects were: Minas Gerais Municipal Development
(P00654; FY95-FY02; US$150m; outcome - Sat); Ceará Urban Development and Water Resource
(P006436: FY95-FY04); US$140m; outcome - M.Sat); Bahia Municipal Infrastructure Development &
Management (P006562; FY97-FY05; US$100m; outcome - Sat). “Retail” projects after Betim’s were: (i)
Santa Maria-Rio Grande do Sul (RS) Integrated Municipal Development Program FY08; (ii) Sao Luis
Enhancing Municipal Governance and Quality of Life Project FY08; (iii) Teresina Enhancing Municipal
Governance and Quality of Life Project FY08; (iv) Uberaba Agua Viva Project FY 2007; (v) Integrated
Municipal Project - Betim Municipality FY04. Other than Betim’s, all are ongoing at this writing and have
yet to be evaluated by IEG.

relevance to Betim’s Strategic Plan and the Bank’s 2008 Country Assistance Strategy

Note: Estimated total project costs at appraisal were US$49.2 million. Actual total costs at completion were reported by the ICR as
US$98.2 million. IEG estimates that about 75 percent of the overrun was due to the declining US dollar:Brazilian real exchange rate, while
25 percent of the overrun was due to higher local costs (in Brazilian reals) of project investments.

2.2     Promoting sustainable socio-environmental development: substantial relevance.
This objective’s relevance derives from its links to environmental priorities highlighted
by the 2003 CAS, the 2008 CAS and Betim’s strategic development plan. The 2003 CAS
emphasized dealing with environmental vulnerability in metropolitan areas, where Betim
is located and brown environmental problems are most acute (2003 CAS p. 44). The
2008 CAS called for specific Bank attention to the increasing challenges of the “urban
environmental agenda” that includes protecting water sources, wastewater treatment and
urban drainage in Brazil, all actions taken by this project (2008 CAS Annex p. 28). As
noted earlier, two key activities of Betim’s strategic development plan, the environmental
                                                       4


constraints facing new industries and the environmental impacts of development
scenarios, have a bearing on the project objective. The relevance of the first objective
would have been higher with a better formulation that did not rely upon the little used
expression “socio-environmental development”, a term not defined in the project itself,
nor adopted by the policy documents mentioned here.

2.3      Reducing inequality/poverty: substantial relevance. Bank, Betim and Federal
priorities for equity and poverty reduction make project aims in these directions relevant,
but uncertainties about the intent of the Betim project come from the disparate
formulations of this objective in different project documents where they should be
identical. The PAD called for reducing inequality, while the Loan Agreement (LA) aimed
for reducing poverty. In these circumstances, IEG looked for evidence of relevance to
reducing either inequality or poverty. The project objective is relevant to consolidating
Brazil’s poverty reduction gains that features strongly in the 2008 CAS, while reducing
inequalities is consistent with Betim’s aim for a more even distribution across income
levels among its resident population. 4

2.4     Enhancing the city’s quality of life: substantial relevance. While it does not
explicitly elaborate the quality-of-life goals to be achieved by the project, the PAD does

4
  At the national level, these aims have been reflected in recent results, notably the fall of the national Gini
coefficient from 0.60 in 2002 to 0.54 in 2006 (CAS 2008 Annex 2 p. 5). Poverty in Brazil had likewise
fallen from 34.1 percent of the population in 2003 to 29.5 percent in 2005.
                                              5


list the instruments or components to achieve these goals, namely integrated investments
in urban environment infrastructure and social services coupled with broader efforts to
improve municipal governance, regulatory policy, and institutional strengthening (PAD
p. 10). The ICR (p. 39) notes that a better quality of life will come from urban
improvements, the environmental recovery of the Betim River, stronger municipal
management of public spaces and services. Beyond the Betim River improvement itself,
quality-of-life enhancement as a project objective would have had greater relevance with
more precisely measureable and verifiable improvements for the lives of the citizens as
the project intended.

RELEVANCE OF DESIGN

2.5     Modest: Two weaknesses in project design lessened its relevance. Firstly, MG
State and its sanitation utility COPASA were crucial players for ensuring project success,
yet were not formally harnessed to the operation through the Bank, as they would have
been through a Project Agreement with the Bank. The PAD (p. 6) explicitly
acknowledged the risks entailed and a legal covenant (LA Section 5.1) entitled the Bank
to suspend disbursements to the Municipality of Betim, should COPASA not comply
with its agreement with Betim to implement and finance the agreed sanitation works. But
this meant that, in the event of a failure by COPASA, the sanction would not have been
applied to COPASA, but to the Betim Municipality. Secondly, the project design
included institutional components that, while intrinsically important in themselves, were
not directly related to the project objectives.

2.6     COPASA was a key stakeholder, but a reluctant party to the Project. Legal action
by Betim municipality in 1996 against COPASA led to action by MG State’s public
prosecutor, ministério público, against COPASA, requiring it to make investments in
sanitation in the municipality that it should have done earlier. In Brazil, where states have
primary responsibility for managing the environment, and most municipalities delegate
their constitutional water and sanitation responsibilities to their respective states (as
Betim had done in 2006), project design should make clear where ultimate
responsibilities lie.

2.7     The Project’s first component, Municipal Policies and Institutional Capacity
Strengthening, does not connect clearly with the objectives of the operation. The PAD
would have made its case better had it provided a results chain to show how a component
consisting of actions of updating an urban plan, strengthening policy options analysis and
cost implications, proposals for alternative development goals related to fiscal
performance, methodologies for stakeholder impact evaluation and consensus building,
indicators and evaluation criteria for impact of policy actions, detailed monitoring of
financial performance, and strengthening the environmental secretariat of the
municipality (PAD p. 14) would promote socio-environmental development, reduce
inequality/poverty, or enhance Betim’s quality of life, the intended results of the project.

3. Implementation Experience
3.1    The pace of project implementation was uneven. Startup stalled. The project was
approved in July 2004, and the loan became effective in April 2005. The delay resulted
                                                      6


from difficulties Betim encountered in setting up a project financial system, a condition
of effectiveness. The first disbursement came six months later in October 2005, after
which disbursements picked up rapidly. From October 2005 to July 2007, a 22 months
period, more than 90 percent of the Loan was disbursed (ahead of schedule). In the
following twelve months, however, nothing was disbursed until the penultimate
disbursement of US$1.6 million in October 2008 during the final months of the outgoing
municipal administration. Only one US$0.8 million disbursement was made to the new
incoming Betim municipal administration in 2009.

3.2      With implementation underway during 2005-2007, project costs denominated in
US dollars began to rise and doubled by completion. There were two reasons for this.
First, the Brazilian real appreciated significantly against the US dollar. Instead of the
US$1.00 = R$3.21 exchange rate projected in the PAD, the actual exchange rate averaged
US$1.00 = R$2.03 over the 2004-2010 period—an appreciation that explains 75 percent
of the increase in US dollar project costs. Second, project costs measured in Brazilian
reals themselves rose—accounting for the remaining 25 percent of the rise in US dollar
project costs. 5 Since the US dollar value of the loan disbursed remained the same as the
loan commitment, this increase was financed by a sharp rise in counterpart funding from
its appraisal estimate of US$25 million to actual counterpart financing of US$73.8
million by project closing.

3.3     With project financing thus assured, the rhythm of most works and technical
assistance picked up. In particular, activities on resettlement and improving river and
canal drainage accelerated.

3.4     Implementation of the Betim Central sewage treatment plant, the project’s largest
component with a cost of US$38.8 million6--40 percent of the project total—financed by
counterpart funds, was delayed as COPASA’s own annual report of 2008 and the ICR (p.
17) report. Work started only in final months of the project in early 2009, three years later
than planned. Bank loan funds were not allocated to this component. The 1996 action by
the MG State prosecutor (ministério público) against COPASA to carry out the work also
required COPASA to fully finance it. The main reasons for the delay included:
    •    Inadequate initial preparation that led to the plant twice being re-designed: first to
         shift from manual to automatic control and, second, to double the plant’s
         capacity. 7


5
  This increase of project costs in Brazilian reals reported here is an IEG estimate that assumes these costs
were incurred throughout implementation when different exchange rates were in force. As is normal Bank
practice, ICRs do not report project costs in local currency and IEG did not see reports of final project costs
in Brazilian reals.
6
 Betim municipality informed IEG that the cost of the plant was R$74.5 million. This converts to US$38.8
million using the average of the US dollar exchange rates for 2008 (R$1.83) and 2009 (R$2.01) the two
years during which the plant was planned and built.
7
 The basic sequence of aerobic and anaerobic treatment remained in the design, however. As a first step,
aerobic treatment is a bacterial process that involves aeration of untreated sewage sludge. The next step is
anaerobic treatment, particularly suited to tropical conditions, in sedimentation tanks using micro-
organisms to break down remaining biodegradable material in the absence of oxygen.
                                                  7


   •   Land acquisition difficulties, taking two years to resolve. The existing owner
       wanted to receive other land in compensation, something that proved difficult to
       find.
   •   The site had to be converted from rural to urban land use, requiring protracted
       deliberations by the Betim municipal council.
   •   COPASA’s own limited capacity to carry out work that was not its top priority,
       when it had several large projects underway elsewhere in MG State.
   •   Differences between COPASA and Betim municipality over the cost sharing of
       the plant construction took time to settle, until COPASA accepted responsibility
       for nearly 100 percent.
   •   After work started in September 2008, soil conditions at the site made foundation
       work difficult. Twice as many piles had to be sunk as originally foreseen in the
       design, making the foundation work take twice as long to implement.
   •   Laying main sewage interceptors that would connect the existing sewage network
       to the plant suffered delays through the collapse and erosion of unstable drainage
       channels (Fig 3) and the imposition of unduly high technical standards where
       these interceptors crossed railway lines.

3.5     During field visits in Betim in January 2010, the IEG mission saw that work on
the plant was well advanced in the challenging conditions of the site. By end-May 2010,
                                                      8


one month before project closing, the contractors handed it over to COPASA. By this
writing, IEG received reports that the plant is currently operational, at about one third of
it design capacity thus far.

4. Results of the Operation
MONITORING THE RESULTS (M&E)

4.1    Overall Negligible: The low rating comes from a design that did not directly
address the intended project outcomes foreseen by the objectives. This made
implementation and utilization of M&E all but impossible. The consequences are scarce
data on project outcomes, and poor record-keeping generally.

4.2     Design: The weakness underlying M&E derives from a project results framework
(PAD Annex 3) that focuses more upon tracking project inputs than addressing the
objectives of the Project. M&E does not include baselines, targets or indicators needed to
measure progress toward achieving these objectives. The M&E’s intermediate outcome
indicators were mostly input indicators that would be triggered by the delivery of project
components, such as a specific number of municipal offices to be improved. M&E design
lacked performance indicators related to the achievement of the second project objective
of reducing inequality and/or poverty.

4.3     Implementation: Implementation of a weak M&E, while allowing follow-up of
the implementation of the project components, did not allow outcomes to be monitored.
Even the tracking of inputs, the components, did not pass smoothly from one municipal
administration to the next in Betim. Thus, M&E did not help produce complete and
detailed final project cost data for the incoming municipal administration as the IEG
mission noted. IEG requested these data from Betim Municipality during the first
semester of 2010, receiving a partial data set in mid-2010 that pointed to a total project
cost of more than US$128.1 million. The ICR, on the other hand, reports a total and
complete final cost of US$98.2 million 8 (details Box 2). The difficulty of reporting costs
and the inconsistency of the results raise concerns about financial reporting and record
keeping at the municipal level. This experience points to the need for more solid M&E in
future municipal development projects, especially of the retail kind that directly depend
upon the municipalities themselves for day-to-day management.

4.4    Utilization: Utilization of M&E now rests with the new municipal administration
of Betim, whose difficulties in estimating the actual costs of this project reflect the
shortcomings in utilizing even the partial M&E set up under this project.

 In this report, IEG uses the figure of US$98.2 million reported by the ICR, as it covered all project
components, unlike the partial estimates provided by Betim to the IEG mission that left some small
components out.

OBJECTIVE 1. PROMOTING SUSTAINABLE SOCIO-ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT

4.5      Efficacy: Substantial. Actual results
have been mixed thus far. The Betim River
system water quality still remains very poor
at this time (by when there should have
already been a full improvement according to
the original PAD plans for the project). The
lack of progress to date is the result of the
delays in bringing the Betim Central sewage
treatment plant into operation. There should
be a long and steady improvement, however,
as the plant approaches full capacity
operation, with all interceptors connected to it
(or another one of Betim’s smaller treatment
plants) and illegal untreated sewage discharge
into the river prevented. A promising sign is
the current Betim mayor’s awareness of the
urgency of curbing illegal sewage discharge
in the municipality. With these conditions
met, the project can be expected to achieve a
worthwhile result in the near future, but will
fall short of the original intent in two ways:
firstly pure, potable standard water may be
impossible to achieve ever with Betim’s
growing population, according to MG               Fig 3. Final link to Betim       Photo by
                                                  Central sewage treatment         Roy Gilbert
environmental experts; and secondly, the
                                                   plant (Jan 2010 )
eventual improvement will come long after
the 2009 target set for it by the PAD (p. 31). A water quality index IQA, that measures
the biological demand for oxygen and the level of fecal coli forms shows that the quality
of Betim River water declined less in traversing the city in 2009 (minus 50 IQA) than it
did in 2004 (minus 64 IQA) (Table 4.1). However, the 19-23 IQA range of the
downstream water quality is still very poor by MG State environmental standards.
Summing up the three reasons for this shortfall: (i) the necessary sewage treatment has
barely begun; (ii) illegal discharge of raw sewage continues and (iii) the ecological
recovery of such a highly polluted water course as the Betim River will take several
years.

4.6     More sanitation services: Betim municipality was better served by basic urban
water and sanitation services in 2009 than before the Project in 2004 (Table 4.2). The
Project provided 6,500 additional sewerage connections, short of the project target of
7,500, but still accounting for nearly half of all new connections in Betim over this
period. The share of the population served by sewage collection rose from 63.6 percent
before the project in 2004 to 67.9 percent in 2009, after the project. Thus sewage
connection services grew at about twice the rate of urban population growth, but more
than 30 percent of the population still produces sewage that is uncollected sewage. But,
as noted earlier, in 2009 still only 9.1 percent of collected sewage was treated, a share
                                                                10


that is expected to rise, however, with a fully operational Betim Central plant that will
have more capacity than needed to treat all sewage collected in Betim.

4.7     Water supply services, already good in Betim prior to the project, expanded at a
similar rate to that of the growth of the urban population. Solid waste collection and
disposal, on the other hand, expanded at a far more rapid pace. These services were
beyond the scope of the project design and changes in the level of service are not
attributable to the project.

4.8      Sewage network and Betim Central treatment plant coming into operation: IEG
learned that the contractors handed over the completed Betim Central sewage treatment
plant to COPASA at the end of May 2010. At this writing the plant is running test
operations up to one third of the design capacity of the plant. More sewage interceptors
still need to be connected and the plant’s treatment sludge will have to become
biologically active for full treatment to take effect. While it is still too early to report
definitive results, the well tried aerobic and anaerobic technologies used by the plant are
likely to function properly. The plant was expected to come into full capacity operation at
the end of 2010. If all goes according to plan, it would be able to treat 500 liters per
second, or 15,780 cubic meters per year effectively. This exceeds the 15,171 cubic meters
of sewage currently produced in Betim, and is well in excess of the 11,552 cubic meters
currently collected (Table 4.2).

4.9     Greater environmental role for Betim municipality: The project sought greater
Betim involvement in environmental matters through the strengthening of its municipal
environmental secretariat, SEMEIA with some results. SEMEIA now prepares municipal
environmental plans for Betim annually. It carried out environmental education programs
by sending teams of municipal experts to local factories and industrial plants including
the Petrobras oil refinery, to help them comply with environmental regulations within the
municipality. Through SEMEIA, Betim entered into cooperation agreements for urban
environmental protection with other municipalities of the Belo Horizonte metropolitan
region and elsewhere in MG State, such as the important cities of Ouro Preto and Juiz de
Fora. Since a 2002 agreement with MG States environmental agency FEAM, Betim took
on responsibility (from MG State) for issuing environmental licenses for smaller works.

OBJECTIVE 2. REDUCING INEQUALITY OR POVERTY

4.10 Efficacy: Substantial. Persuasive evidence of achievements at the level of Betim
municipality in these areas is scarce for three basic reasons: (i) no specific baselines were
measured at appraisal; (ii) there were no explicit or specific targets establishing by how
much inequality or poverty should be reduced; (iii) especially for inequality no specific
Project actions were designed to reduce it. There were however, project interventions
with significant localized interventions within specific areas or affecting specific groups.

4.11 Resettlement: Altogether, 887 families were resettled peacefully from flood-
prone canal and river banks in Betim, somewhat more than the 820 originally foreseen.
As described to IEG by Betim municipality officials, the resettlement procedures
complied with Bank safeguards on involuntary resettlement. All affected families were
surveyed by the municipality and direct contact made with municipal social workers.
Affected families contacted by the IEG mission during field visits confirmed these
arrangements. Betim’s “Evaluation Commission” in the Secretaria de Obras, the
municipal secretary of works, assessed the value of compensation to be paid and prepared
a final action plan for resettlement with the knowledge and involvement of the affected
communities. Several beneficiaries told the IEG mission that they had opportunities to
question the conditions of the plan, particularly the compensation and alternative housing
offered, but most did not, finding the conditions offered to be adequate. These reports
point to a resettlement process that was in compliance with Bank safeguards in this area.
                                             12


4.12 Nearly half these families were accommodated in a housing estate called Celso
Pedrosa that was specifically built for this purpose. Others were re-housed in five
existing projects in Betim. In Celso Pedrosa itself, five families, all previously resident in
Betim, told the IEG mission that their present houses were far superior to their previous
dwellings, located in favelas and others in areas prone to flooding. The success of the
Celso Pedrosa estate was confirmed by the many improvements and extensions made to
the original core unit with its kitchen/bathroom/one bedroom.

4.13 Broader social protection: The project also helped strengthen Betim
municipality’s social services secretariat, SEMAS, by helping it adopt a consolidated
social assistance system called the Sistema Unico de Assistencia Social that provided a
one-stop shop where needy citizens of Betim could seek social services from the
municipality. Through the Project, SEMAS also conducted a review of the Federal
Government’s Bolsa Familiar conditional cash transfer program in Betim. It resulted in
the threefold expansion of the program after finding 43,000 families were eligible,
against the 14,000 who had received assistance prior to the project. But a counterpoint to
these gains was the threefold increase of the professional cadres of SEMAS during
project implementation from 180 to 500, without following the proper concurso público
recruitment procedures required under Brazilian law. The overall result has been SEMAS
retaining a strong core but carrying a contingent of less than fully qualified staff.

OBJECTIVE 3. ENHANCING BETIM’S QUALITY OF LIFE

4.14 Efficacy: Modest. Actual results obtained by the project were mixed across the
outcomes that derived from different project components. They were stronger in helping
to reduce the risks of flooding in the municipality. They were weaker in not providing
useable recreational areas in the form of urban parks promised by the project. It is clear
that more still has to be done to give Betim a better quality of life, making it an attractive
residential location for families of all income groups.

4.15 Road and drainage improvements: Quality of life improvements in some Betim
neighborhoods resulted from project investments in what were called locally Avenidas
Sanitarias. These consisted of street paving of major access roads to selected
neighborhoods, the installation or improvement of drainage, and final landscaping.
Altogether, eleven such avenidas were thus upgraded. The IEG mission visited four
avenidas three of whose works were completed to a high standard, while one was still
unfinished. Through easing access to key neighborhoods throughout Betim, they
contribute to improved traffic conditions throughout the municipality. Cleared of
informal occupation by squatters, river and canal banks could be stabilized and drainage
channels improved under the project. Such improvements were made to sections of the
Betim River and adjacent drainage canals. The IEG mission inspected a storm water
                                                 14




Fig 6. Avenida Sanitaria nearly completed in Betim (Jan 2010)            Photo by Roy Gilbert

retention basin built to temporarily hold run-off during heavy rainfall. Taken together,
these efforts better control and ease flows to reduce the risk of flooding that had seriously
affected neighborhoods like the Jardim Santa Cruz. Some of this work involved the
relocation of families especially on river and canal banks prone to flooding. As already
noted, resettlement was conducted in accordance with Bank guidelines.

4.16    Urban parks not ready for use: Two of the three parks initially planned,
covering 30 hectares, were demarcated but not landscaped. Work on them was not
underway during IEG’s visits. Although fenced off to prevent trespass, the IEG mission
saw fencing broken in a few places, where garbage had been illegally dumped. In these
conditions, they do not yet constitute urban parks for public recreational use, and thus far,
have not generated the real intended benefits that can only begin to be realized when they
come into use.

4.17 On balance, some enhancement of Betim’s quality of life: On the positive side
of the scorecard: drainage and road improvements have been brought to specific areas
through the avenidas sanitarias. On the negative side: the continuing severe pollution of
the Betim River system, and the abandoned urban parks. We can expect the quality of life
in Betim to improve in the medium term as unfinished projects come into use and Betim
municipality makes new investments in municipal services and infrastructure.

4.18 Stronger Betim finances in recent years favor such improvements and a greater
role of the municipality in enhancing the quality of life there (Table 4.3). Municipal
revenues and expenditures doubled over the 2004-2009 period of the project—more than
twice the rate of Brazil’s GDP growth—and an already healthy budget surplus has
increased. These trends have given Betim municipality a significant investment capability
of its own, the equivalent of US$64 million annually. These positive trends are due to
economic growth and stronger financial management at the municipal level. While
neither cause can be attributed directly to the project, nor can financial improvements
alone guarantee a better quality of life in the city, they help ensure a favorable context for
achieving more of the kind of the improvements foreseen by the project.

EFFICIENCY IN ACHIEVING RESULTS

4.19 Efficiency rating: modest. The likely efficiency of the project investments in
generating benefits through improved sanitation (sewerage connections, sewerage mains,
and the waste treatment plant), urban drainage, and parks was estimated at appraisal,
using the Contingent Valuation Method that surveyed 1,400 potential beneficiaries in
Betim to learn how much they would be willing to pay for the improvements intended by
the project (PAD Annex 9). The ICR re-applied the same approach with updated values
of costs and benefits to yield an estimated ERR at completion of 18 percent (ICR annex
3). Such an approach may not yield the best measurement of project efficiency at
completion, however, for two reasons. First, completion estimates should measure real
benefits and not the hypothetical proxy benefits of the ex-ante contingent valuation
method. For this project, real benefits mean the actual improvements of reduced pollution
and functioning urban parks. It is difficult to understand, for instance, how a project
investment in urban parks made three years ago could generate an (contingent valuation
method) estimate of 47 percent ERR (ICR p.33) when the parks are not complete and
generating no real benefits at this writing. A measurement instead of actual benefits, their
delays in coming on stream, and project cost increases noted earlier would point to a
significantly lower ERR at completion of this and other delayed components than at
appraisal. The consequent loss of project efficiency leads to the modest rating here.

5. Ratings
OUTCOME

5.1     Rated: Moderately Satisfactory. Overall, the project achieved or is likely to
achieve its relevant objectives with moderate shortcomings. This outcome rating is based
upon the following consideration of the relevance and efficacy of each of the three
objectives. The first promoting socio-environmental development was, despite its
imprecise formulation, substantial relevant to Bank and Borrower priorities. It has not yet
been met, but is likely to be achieved with substantial efficacy as environmental
improvements begin to take hold in Betim, albeit later than planned and to a lesser degree
than intended. The second, reducing inequality/poverty, has also been substantially
relevant to Betim and Bank priorities, and was achieved with substantial efficacy through
localized impacts on poor communities vulnerable to flooding and more broadly through
expanding the coverage of the Bolsa Familia program in Betim. The third, enhancing
Betim’s quality of life was modestly relevant for not having a precise and measureable
outcome. At this writing, it has still not been met, but is likely to obtain modest efficacy
as municipal services begun under the project are fully delivered. Efficiency in achieving
these objectives is less than planned and rated modest owing to cost overruns and delays
in realizing the benefits of project investments that lower their present value.

5.2      The Betim River is an icon of the city’s environment and quality of life. Its
condition is therefore symbolic of the performance of this operation—still in poor
environmental condition, but set for improvement after the full operation of the recently
completed Betim Central sewage treatment plant, and the eventual effective prevention of
the illegal discharge of untreated sewage. The project itself has much the same
performance status as the river.

RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

5.3      Rated: Significant. The highest risk comes from the continued population growth
and economic expansion of Betim, beyond current projections, and the consequent
growing demand for water, sanitation and other urban services. Particularly problematical
are illegal “clandestine” discharges of untreated sewage that, if unchecked, will continue
to pollute whatever treatment plants are in operation. The project did not address this
issue or help the municipal authorities to suppress what has been a common practice. In
comments on this report, the Bank Country Department pointed out that this problem was
not ignored by COPASA. IEG witnessed considerable illegal discharge during its field
visits to Betim, and considers that curbing it should be a central part of the design of a
project aimed at improving the urban environment. Technical and financial risks are low.
Most of the improvements introduced by the project use proven technologies that have
worked successfully elsewhere and the municipal and state authorities have strong
enough finances to ensure operation and maintenance. Political and governance risks are
moderate; successive municipal administrations of different political parties have all been
committed to the project, but information flows among them about project performance
have been less than agile. The risk from natural disasters is low. The most likely natural
disaster event in Betim is flash flooding the worst effects of which the project itself took
action to mitigate.

BANK PERFORMANCE

5.4     Preparation and quality-at-entry: rated Moderately unsatisfactory. Weaknesses
in project design left two objectives with imprecise formulations, such as socio-
environmental development and quality-of-life. Not having the project objectives
incorporated into the project’s results framework (PAD p. 30) meant that the project
design did not make full use of that framework to help articulate the intended results to be
obtained and the results chain linking them to the project components. With insufficient
analysis of baselines and targets, an unrealistic expectation was raised of bringing the
Betim River water to top quality—almost drinkable—by 2009, year five of the project.
Also, the most important single project investment, the Betim Central sewage treatment
plant could have been more fully prepared. Its details were given only cursory treatment
by the 106 page PAD in two short paragraphs (pp. 18 and 56). Inadequate preparation
meant that challenges and risks typically facing this kind of investment—land
acquisition, land-use zoning, stakeholder commitment, and engineering difficulties on
site—were not properly thought through, leading to more than three years delay in start
up, and the plant not completed at project closing.

5.5     Supervision: rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. Bank supervision missions did
not highlight the challenges that project implementation faced. Five supervision missions
rated implementation progress very highly even while the project’s main component, the
Central sewage treatment plant was unable to get off the ground. Lack of implementation
progress with this important plant—with building starting up just six months prior to
project closing—should have been reflected critically in each of these supervision
mission assessments. Instead, the supervision missions based their assessments upon
counterpart commitments to future implementation—hence the Bank’s positive
evaluation of implementation progress, even when it was stalled. Bank missions could
not influence COPASA as an executing agency of that component, as it was not formally
a partner of the Bank in this project, but Bank missions could have worked more closely
with the municipality to bring pressure to bear for accelerating the works.

5.6    Overall Bank Performance: rated Moderately Unsatisfactory

BORROWER PERFORMANCE

5.7     Government: rated overall Satisfactory. In the case of this project, under
“Government” the present rating covers the Federal Government as guarantor and the
Betim Municipal Government as borrower of the loan. Both are rated satisfactory, the
Federal Government for fulfilling its fiduciary role under the loan effectively and the
Betim Government for aligning its policy priorities and the project and for substantial
increases in counterpart funding above the initial commitment at appraisal.

5.8     Implementing Agency: rated Moderately Satisfactory. In the case of this project,
under “Implementing Agency” the rating covers the Betim Municipal Secretariats
responsible for the execution of the project. These included the Secretariat of
Infrastructure and Works, the Secretariat of Environment and the Secretariat of Social
Assistance. Collectively they contributed actively to project implementation, albeit with
significant delays to key components, and less than complete record keeping and
                                              19


reporting. The inability to complete the execution of key project components within the
time frame set was a moderate shortcoming.

5.9      Overall Borrower Performance: rated Moderately Satisfactory

MONITORING AND EVALUATION

5.10 Rated: Negligible. M&E design did not focus upon intended outcomes foreseen
by the objectives. This made meaningful implementation and utilization of M&E to track
progress in achieving the intended results very difficult. Beyond the lack of data on
project outcomes, the consequences of weak M&E also made the assembly of final
project cost data challenging.



6. Lessons
•     If the scope of an autonomous municipal development project goes beyond municipal
      responsibilities, as this project’s did by invoking environmental and sanitation
      improvements and monitoring that are state-level responsibilities in the case of Betim,
      project design should include a Project Agreement with the Bank that binds any state
      level parties to an operation through the Bank—COPASA in this case.
•     Bank preparation of investment projects that target environmental improvements
      should deploy relevant specialized technical knowhow and experience effectively so
      that environmental problem are properly appraised and feasible targets set for
      improvements. For this project, illegal sewage discharge, that continues to pollute the
      river, needed more analysis and preventative action, while river water quality targets
      should have been more modest and achievable over a reasonable time period.
•     The preparation of components in investment projects, especially key ones such as
      the Betim Central sewage treatment plant, should routinely take into account land
      acquisition, land use zoning, stakeholder commitment and site difficulties, to set a
      realistic and achievable path to implementation.
•     Policies and actions to curb the causes of environmental degradation should be at the
      core of operations designed to improve the urban environment. The lesson from this
      project is the need to include measures to curb the illegal discharge of sewage,
      observed on site by the IEG mission in Betim that, if not curtailed, could bypass the
      environmental gains made by additional sewage treatment
