improvements, and secondary roads.\n            This environmental assessment anticipates negative\n            environmental impacts resulting from construction and\n            suggests mitigation measures. Impacts include dust, noise\n            pollution, erosion, water contamination, and removal of\n            protected plant species. Moreover, 820 families in urban\n            flood-prone areas will have to be involuntarily resettled\n            and compensated accordingly. Short-term impacts to river\n            habitats will be offset by treating river pollution sources,\n            building a wastewater treatment plant, creating and managing\n            urban parks, and restoring vegetation along all creeks\n            affected by the project. Drainage program selection will\n            maximize preserving existing water courses and \"mata\n            ciliar\" vegetation; use adjacent spaces to create or\n            augment linear parks to promote environmental awareness of\n            residents and to buffer urban impacts to streams; and\n            strengthen the protection of existing parks or protected\n            areas. Homeowners will be required to properly connect to\n            the sewerage network with costs borne by the property owner\n            or the municipality. The EA also evaluated the operational\n            and safety procedures for the Varzea das Flores Reservoir.\n            The reservoir's operation will be coordinated with the\n            flood control management plans for the Betim watershed and\n            overseen by the state water company, with annual inspection\n            reports produced. Routine operation and safety procedures\n            will be set for the new flood-retention basins. A dredge\n            materials manual will regulate the removal, transport, and\n            disposal of dredged sediments. Environmental monitoring is\n            included within several project components to assess the\n            impact of project activities on water quality."}, "docdt": "2004-02-05T00:00:00Z"}
