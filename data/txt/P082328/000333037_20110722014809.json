Betim Municipality for Brazil were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, risk to development\n            outcome was significant, Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: bank\n            preparation of investment projects that target environmental\n            improvements should deploy relevant specialized technical\n            knowhow and experience effectively so that environmental\n            problem are properly appraised and feasible targets set for\n            improvements. For this project, illegal sewage discharge,\n            that continues to pollute the river, needed more analysis\n            and preventative action, while river water quality targets\n            should have been more modest and achievable over a\n            reasonable time period. The preparation of components in\n            investment projects, especially key ones such as the Betim\n            Central sewage treatment plant, should routinely take into\n            account land acquisition, land use zoning, stakeholder\n            commitment and site difficulties, to set a realistic and\n            achievable path to implementation. Policies and actions to\n            curb the causes of environmental degradation should be at\n            the core of operations designed to improve the urban\n            environment. The lesson from this project is the need to\n            include measures to curb the illegal discharge of sewage,\n            observed on site by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG)\n            mission in Betim that, if not curtailed, could bypass the\n            environmental gains made by additional sewage treatment."}, "docdt": "2011-03-14T00:00:00Z"}
