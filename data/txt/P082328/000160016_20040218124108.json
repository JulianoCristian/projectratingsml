"abstracts": {"cdata!": "This environmental assessment for the\n            Integrated Municipal Project (Municipality of Betim)for\n            Brazil evaluates the existing conditions, identifies the\n            potential direct and indirect environmental impacts and\n            proposes adequate mitigation measures for each negative\n            impact identified, as well as measures for enhancing each\n            identified positive impact. As part of the project\n            objectives and design, the Project has a strong\n            environmental emphasis, including strengthening the\n            environmental institutional capacity of the environmental\n            secretariat and the capacity of the regional river basin\n            committee. Moreover, the Project will review environmental\n            policies and regulations in order to scale up the municipal\n            capacity to respond to the environmental  needs at the local\n            level. While the Project is expected to result in\n            significant positive impacts for biodiversity and natural\n            habitats, short-term impacts to riverine habitats will\n            result from making drainage improvements. These impacts will\n            be more than mitigated by project interventions to\n            rehabilitate Betim River tributaries through eradicating and\n            treating polluting sources (building a wastewater treatment\n            plant), resettling populations living within the\n            floodplains, creating urban parks, and restoring wetland\n            vegetation along the project waterways. Also, the project\n            will ensure that urban drainage emphasizes the selection of\n            alternatives that 1) maximize preservation, to the extent\n            possible, of existing watercourses and \"mata\n            ciliar\" vegetation; 2) use adjacent spaces to create or\n            augment linear parks to promote environmental awareness\n            among residents and to buffer urban impacts to streams; and\n            3) strengthen the protection of existing parks or protected\n            areas to maximize the long-term sustainability of water\n            quality improvements. An environmental construction manual\n            appended to all project infrastructure-related contracts\n            will include activities to minimize and mitigate\n            construction-related activities (such as noise, air\n            pollution from dust, and water pollution from dredge\n            sediments). Other activities involve public awareness and\n            environmental education, replacement housing and cash\n            compensation for involuntary displaced  households,\n            identification of illegal household sewerage connections,\n            dam safety and flood control management, technical and\n            safety procedures for flood-retention basins, and dredge\n            transport and disposal."}, "docdt": "2003-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
