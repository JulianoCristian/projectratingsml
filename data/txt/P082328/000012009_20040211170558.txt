RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN (RAP)
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY                        RP203
Volume 1
1. Introduction
This document presents the executive summary of the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) for the Betim
Project. The development objective of the Betim Project is to support and assist the Municipality of
Betim in achieving a sustainable socio-environmental municipal development, reducing poverty,
improving urban environmental conditions and enhancing the city's quality of life. To reach this
objective will require a balanced approach of integrated, well targeted investments in infrastructure
and social services in the poorest and most environmentally degraded region of the city, the Betim
River basin, coupled with broader efforts to improve municipal governance, regulatory policy and
institutional strengthening.
The Betim Project includes the following components:

2. Key Aspects of the Resettlement Action Plan
The goal of the Resettlement Anchored Plan is to ensure the improvement of the quality of life of the
families resettled by the Project. Under this RAP, compensation will be provided with respect to
physical aspects, such as housing, as well as social and economic aspects, such as disruption of their
social network support and neighborhood relationships.
The RAP is based on the following principles:
*  Permanent effort to minimize the resettlement's potential negative social and environmental
impacts;
*  Minimize the number of families to be resettled;
*  Assure provision of different assistance options;
* Assure the payment of compensation for the replacement value of the property, including all the
improvements made;
*  Assure an improvement or maintenance of the housing conditions;

* Assure the possibility of maintaining income generation;
* Assure the provision of social services, such as education, health care, public transport.
The RAP also observes the following guidelines:
* The works should only begin after the resettlement is properly implemented;
. The population to be resettled will have freedom of choice as regards to the options of
compensation within the criteria adopted by the RAP;
. The population will have access to voice their claims through participatory mechanisms and
communications channels.
To reach these principles and guidelines, the RAP will undertake the following key activities:
• Open local offices in the Project's areas to facilitate channels of communication and grievance with
the population;
* Hold campaigns to inform and update the population about the implementation of the Project's
activities;
* Provide legal and social support for the population without charge;
* Provide coordination between the resettlement and the civil works teams to ensure appropriate
schedule compatibility;
* Negotiations with the population will start when all the assistance options are effective.
3. Betim Municipality Experience in Resettlement
The demand for popular housing in the municipality of Betim has been very strong due to its
proximity to the capital and its industrial vocation and, therefore, job opportunities. The current
administration has responded to this high demand through several popular housing programs in
consistency with the current urban and environmental legislation. The main target of these programs
are the populations located in risky prone and environmentally degraded areas, without urban
infrastructure and adequate services, as well as residents of slums and precarious land parceling
developments. Through this programs, the Municipality of Betim has already resettled some 2,600
families living in risk areas and built twelve housing complexes. These resettlement operation were
implement based on policies and methodologies similar to those guiding the RAP to the Betim
Project. Actually, besides the guidance provided by the Bank involuntary resettlement policy, this RAP
also builds on the knowledge and lessons learned from the vast experience of the Municipality of
Betim in implementing resettlement operations.
Annex I presents a table containing a summary of the principal programs and projects currently being
developed by the Municipality.
4. Resettlement Plan - Methodology
The preparation of the RAP is based on 4 key structural elements, as described below:
* The project resettlement impact;
* The profile of the families and the properties affected;
* The social dynamics the families to be resettled by the Project; and
* The situation of the property and personal documentation.
4.1 Project resettlement impact
2



Melhor com voci
The total number of families to be resettled by the project is estimated im 820. In addition to those
families, there are 323 empty lots whose owners will be compensated by the project. With respect to
the land property situation, the 820 families to be resettled follows under the following category: 51
families have regular land title; 769 have no land title.
The empty lots and regular buildings are mostly partially effected, allowing the current owner to keep
the remaining part of the property. The irregular buildings are in general of small size (less than 60
m2), in consequence the remaining area does not allow for the construction of an appropriate housing
solution.
4.2 Socioeconomic Profiles of the Affected Families and Properties
A field survey was carried out in July-August 2003 to identify the profile of the population to be
resettled, and also their perception of their living conditions. The main findings are:
Housing and Infrastructure
Residential properties occupied by the owners and/or squatters, made from brickwork, most of them
having more than 5 rooms;
*   Occupation initiated more than 10 years ago;
*   Wood-burning stoves used by 1/3 of the families;
*   10% of the families still use collective bathrooms;
*   Almost 100% of the families served by treated water but only 1/3 served by the sewerage system; the
remaining discharge the sewage into the stream or in the open air;
*   100% of the families have public transport less than 500m from their houses;
*   The greatest problems related to the current housing location are: lack of jobs available; absence
and/or precarious public transport; lack of sewerage facilities; health problems; lack of security; lack
of leisure areas; lack of drainage; flooding.
Heads of Families
Great majority are men of working age, with low level of education and coming from the interior of
the State of Minas Gerais; 3/4 are married and live with common-law wives;
More than half have between 1 and 3 children;
Half of the heads of families work and they declared that their principal income basically comes from
3 sources: salary, self-employed/daily worker, pension;
Only 1/3 of the heads of families have stable jobs with employment cards signed, 1/5 of the heads
of families are unemployed and another 1/5 retired;
Half of the heads of families provide services and work in Betim;
* 1/3 of the heads of families have working hours of more than 10 hours.
Families
*   Families with 5 or more members represent 50% of the universe;
*   2/3 of the families have at least one member less than 15 years old;
*   1/4 of the families have at least one member more than 55 years old;
*   In almost 1/2 of the families only one person is responsible for the family income;
*   Less than 10% of the families have a family income exceeding 3.0 minimum salaries;
* The income of 1/2 of the families is derived from the provision of services;
*   Almost all the dwellings have showers, fridges, TV sets, stereos and simple washing machines, most
of them second-hand purchase.
Urban And Community Facilities
*   68% of the families said that they use the services of the health post;
* 57% of the families have members that attend school;
*   85% of the families do not use the creche services;
*   72% of the families informed there is a community association, and 74% said do not participate;
3



Melhor com voct
* Almost 1/2 of the families stated that the police only appear when called out.
Expectations
*   54% wish to receive compensation;
*   18% would like to purchase another house in the same district with the support of the program;
*   13% would like to purchase another house in another district with the support of the program;
*   10% at the moment are unable to state the most adequate option;
*   3% would like to purchase a property in the interior;
* 2% would like to be resettled.
4.3 Social Dynamics
Implementation of an involuntary resettlement plan is multi-dimensional, including social, legal and
technical aspects. In addition, it is essencial to ensure the participation of those who might be
resettled along the project design and implementation.
At the current state of preparation of the Project, the following events have been undertaken to
provde iformation about the Project and involve the commnunities in the process:
v/ Meeting with the formnal and informal leaders of the River Betim II sub-basin;
v/ Meeting with the formnal and informnal leaders of thelImbiru9~iisub-basin;
v/  Field visits to fill out the socioeconom1ic survey formns;
v"Internal meetings among the various Secretariats of the Municipality (I-ousing, Social Assistance,
Chief of Staff, Civil Works) to define the best means of informnation disclosure about the Project.
Despite those important activities, complementary actions will be undertaken to guarantee a
transParent commumication process and a relationship of confidence between the parties.
Understanding that the relationship with the communiity during the resettlement process should be
constructed daily, in the forthcoming stages of the Project, the Municipality will set up an office
copiing a multidisciplinary team dedicated exclusively to the resettlement activities and to attend
the families to be resettled. These offices will also provide an enabling environment for the
4



Melhor com voc6
community to manifest complains and other relevant issues. The Project Coordination Unit will
closely monitor the implementation of the resettlement activities. The Muncipality will also widely
disclose the RAP, particularly the compensatory options, and provide the necessary clarification.
4.4 Property and Personal Documentation
The socioeconomic profile of the population to be resettled showed that the number of families that
declare themselves owners of the dwellings is high. However, the technical survey demonstrated that
the great majority of these properties are irregular since they do not are eligible to receive land title.
An assistance on legal issues will be provided to the population to be resettled in order to support
them in accessing regular personal and/or property documentation as appropriate. The legal advice, in
addition to generating credibility with respect to the affected population, is also be instrumental in
contributing to enhance the transparency, respect and trust between the Municipality and the
population more. The lack of regular documentation will not prevent the population to be resettled
from receive the appropriate compensation in order to re-establish and improve their living
conditions.

5. Compensatory Policy
The Compensatory Policy of this RAP targets at reconstructing community ties and also the recovery
or improvement of their quality of life, production capacity and living conditions. The Compensation
Policy also includes actions to address, assist and ensure the rights of the most vulnerable groups,
including elderly, widows, families headed by women and families headed by very young people.
The first stage in the formulating of the Compensatory Policy entails the identification of all the
potential losses generated by the resettlement. Some of them are easily identifiable, such as the loss of
material assets, whether movable or fixed, and, therefore, may be easily replaced.
5



Betim
Melhor com voce 6
Other kind of losses, with a more subjective nature, can pass unnoticed, and for this reason are more
difficult to measure and to compensate for. Amongst these we can mention the breaking of
neighborly and family ties and of the network of social support and affection among the residents and
families. The valuation methods foreseen for movable or immovable assets are not sufficient to
address these kinds of losses.
Another issue of great significance is the fact that despite the families being inserted in the same
context, this does not signify that their realities and needs are exactly the same and for this reason they
require differentiated solutions. It is therefore necessary for the Compensation Policy to contemplate
assistance options to offer different solutions that satisfy the specific profiles of family composition.
The following table presents the preliminary views of the interviewed families regarding potential
choices for the Compensatory Policy:
Compensatory Policy Options              Area: Imbiru96     Area: Betim II
Sub-basin (%)      Sub-basin (%)

The final decision by the family will be taken at the time of negotiation, when the family will have all
the information available, such as the social and property valuation as well as the new housing units.
Based on this survey and experience of other resettlement operations in urban areas in Brazil, the
RAP comprises 2 lines of assistance:
* Housing Replacement Option;
* Compensation Option.
5.1 Housing Replacement Option
Selection of the Housing Replacement Location
The 2 areas defined by the Municipality for constructing popular housing developments, one in the
Imbiru,c sub-basin and the other in the River Betim sub-basin, have the following characteristics:
each one has an area of around 100,000 m2, with a capacity to construct 250 housing units in each;
* both are located close to the current living location of the families, within the urban network;
• both will be provided withal basic urban services, such as water, electricity, sewage, transport,
school, health post;
* both have topography adequate for the implementation of residential parceling;
* both comply with the requirements of current land titling.
Definition of the Housing Model
The housing units will be constructed within the technical standards of the current legislation, in
addition to being provided with all basic urban services, as abovementioned. They will have two
bedrooms, living room and kitchen, bathroom, complete water and sewerage installations, grease
6



Betim¶s
Melhor com vocAe
traps, and with an approximate area of 42m2. The housing model allows for different expansion
alternatives.
One issue that should be further analyzed is the use of wood burning stoves. It is well known that the
use of LPG - liquefied petroleum gas - is expensive, but the survey also indicated that the firewood is
obtained from the areas where parks would be created in the region. One alternative considered by
the project is to ensure that the needed families will be included in the 'vale-gas' program which
provides cash transfer for poor families to buy their LPG supplies.
Income Replacement Model
The presence of properties affected that are used for commercial, industrial or mixed use is very
reduced. The resettlement housing complex offer alternatives for accommodating the few economic
activities found. In addition, the areas indicated for implementing the resettlement are very close to
the existing location. This favorable location also reduces the likelihood -of negatives impact on the
income of the affected families. But even so if there is an impact, it should be compensated, and
actions aimed at replacing the productive activities will be ensured through the large social assistance
program imnplemented by the municipality, with local and federal funds.
Removal Assistance
All the families to be resettled will receive assistance to transfer their movable assets, totalizing R$
350,00.
5.2 Compensation Options
The other compensatory option possible is cash compensation.
Of the 1143 properties identified, 323 are empty plots, and in these cases, the only option to be
offered is cash compensation at market value, in advance, as required by the Brazilian legislation. The
remaining 820 properties identified can opt either for housing replacement or for cash compensation.
7



Melhor corn voc6 
Experience shows that properties with higher values normally opt for compensation while those with
the lower values, some opt for compensation and others for resettlement.
To actually ensure the effectiveness of the Compensatory Policy, the proposed options, Housing
Replacement or Cash Compensation should be equally attractive. Designing the options is a very
important step, avoiding situations in which an excellent model of resettlement offered vis-a-vis a
compensation model which is insufficient for reinsertion in the market, may result in a rush for
resettlement, even if this is not the desired option. The opposite situation may provoke a rush for
compensation, even if this is not the desired option.
The property valuation appraisals are the starting point for the composition of the Cash
Compensation amount. This amount should be complemented by the social valuation of the non-
measurable losses and of the right and access to land, even if this is not legally titled.
This Policy seeks to ensure that the owners and/or squatters of the smallest and most precarious
housings will have the possibility of obtaining sufficient compensation to recompose and even
improve their living conditions. The owners of properties with higher valuation values will have
lower subsidies.
When the same individual is the owner and/or squatter of more than one property affected, the value
of the subsidy will be applied to the total value of all his or her properties and improvements, and the
Cash Compensation table applied once only.
Based on the average value of the local market for similar housing but in areas with basic services, the
Project adopted the minimum value of R$ 8.500,00, and the final estimated cost of R$ 18.000,00 for
the housing units to be constructed.
The table below presents the values of the Cash Compensation including the property estimated
valuation and the social non-measurable compensations:
Appraisal Value (R$)   % Social Compensation Social Compensation (R$)
Up to 6.000                        50                           8.50(

* This value may not exceed R$ 15.000
The presence of tenants or families living on borrowed housing is very reduced, but will receive the
equivalent of 6 months average rental in the region, around R$ 1.800,00 plus the removal allowance of
R$ 350,00, totalizing R$ 2.150,00 compensation per family or tenant.

The action plan presented here comprises three interdependent instruments, which appropriate
management will ensure that the project is carried out as planned: Institutional Matrix, Time Schedule,
Budget and Source of Funds.
6.1 Institutional Matrix
The Municipal Housing Department, with the support of the Municipal Social Assistance Secretariat
(SEMAS), will be in charge of implementing the project resettlement actions. The Project
Coordination Unit will be provided with appropriate technical capacity to strengthen the resettlement
team capacity as needed. This Housing Department has implemented several resettlement operations
as part of the Municipality efforts to upgrade the city standard. Through these operations, some 2600
families living in risk areas have already been resettled to twelve housing complexes also built by this
Housing Department, which also builds 'sites and services' solutions and slums upgrading
interventions.

The total resettlement costs are fully included on the project costs. This measure allows to the Project
Coordination Unit to have the appropriate control of the implementation of the resettlement
activities. The estimated resettlement costs are as follow:

7. Monitoring
The Municipality will carry out the monitoring of the activities planned in the Involuntary
Resettlement Plan to verify whether the key aspects and objectives of the plan are being achieved and,
if not, implement the necessary corrections, adaptations and adjustments.
For this reason, a consultant will be contracted for the specific purpose of monitoring the
resettlement activities. This work will be carried out in 3 stages (see time schedule in Annex III): the
first just after the preparation of the cadastral survey, when a group of families affected should be
selected as a basis to be monitored throughout the process. The second stage just after the negotiation
process, following the handover of the housing or payment, and the third stage should occur within a
minimum of 6 months after resettlement and a maximum of 18 months, the desirable time being
around 12 months.
The monitoring system will be critical for the Municipality to make a far-reaching review of the
planning phase of the plan in case there is any significant change in scenario between the planning
period and the implementation period of the plan,
8. Project proposal for the area vacated by the families removal
The families will be removed from rivers banks which are not appropriate for housing construction
mainly since: (i) these areas are frequently affected by flooding and land slides; (ii) the environmental
legislation ask for the protection of the riparian vegetation; (iii) to complete the city-wide basic
infrastructure, the sewerage system interceptors have to be lay down along the low lying areas, which
coincides with the river banks in each the families to be removed are living. In the areas vacated by
the resettlement, the project will: install sewerage interceptors; built the macro drainage as

appropriate; create urban parks; rehabilitate and expand the riparian vegetation, and; improve
secondary roads.
9. Land Acquision for resettlement housing
The acquisition of the two areas for construction of the resettlement units is being undertaken by the
Municipality. The final acquisition steps are scheduled for March 04.
