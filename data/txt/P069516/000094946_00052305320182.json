allocation for education; create a knowledge base\n            for education; and improve the efficiency of public\n            financing for health services. There are three main project\n            components. This component focuses on education: 1) It\n            assists the policy design, implementation planning, and\n            training of a comprehensive decentralized system of\n            education funding; and develops management systems and\n            related software aimed at capturing essential school data\n            and information, and builds an information culture. 2) It\n            strengthens governance and the institutional capacity of the\n            University of Pristina by providing technical support to\n            legislate the university's mandate and operating\n            procedures, and develops its strategic planning and\n            management capacity. 3) It develops the staff's\n            capacity to define modern standards and assess student\n            performance. 4) It develops the education department's\n            governance and management structures. The second component\n            develops a health and welfare strategy through 1) designing\n            and implementing mechanisms for the financing system; and\n            providing technical assistance to develop a social\n            protection strategy; 2) strengthening the capacity of the\n            health insurance fund; and 3) preparing an implementation\n            plan for restructuring the health sector. The third\n            component provides critical information on the project\n            concerning financing and the public's use of social services."}, "docdt": "2000-05-02T00:00:00Z"}
