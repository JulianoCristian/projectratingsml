The project achieved its objectives, its\n            impact on institutional development was modest,\n            sustainability is uncertain, and the performance of the Bank\n            was satisfactory while the Borrower's was\n            unsatisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, granting greater management responsibility\n            in exchange for a performance-based approach to technical\n            assistance could have offered better prospects. Second, in\n            the future, GOG should only agree to measures which are\n            within its capacity to execute and the Bank should be more\n            circumspect in accepting such assurances at face value.\n            Finally, IDA played a crucial role in bringing about\n            fundamental sector reforms. Its support was a critical\n            element that finally resulted in a turn around situation,\n            which may not have otherwise been achieved."}, "docdt": "1992-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
