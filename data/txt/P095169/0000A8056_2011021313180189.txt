                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The GEO of the project is to strengthen the capacity in the four participating countries to implement the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety. Specifically, it aims to
                         strengthen the technical capacity in knowledge generation for biosafety risk assessment and management; and strengthen the biosafety decision-making
                         capacity.

                         The project is making progress. A total of 23 sub-project proposals have been considered for implementation. They are distributed across the 4 thematic areas (gene flow, GIS,
                         impact on non-target organisms and socio-economic impact) and 4 implementing countries (Costa Rica, Colombia, Brazil, Peru), including CIAT, the Regional Coordinator of the

                         activities. To enable the project to reach its objectives, a 1 year extension has been granted, with a new closing date of June 30, 2012. Activities are on-going under the

                         (including media) are invited to learn about the project, as well as participate in discussions about biosafety. A regional conference on biosafety is planned for April 27-28 in Costa

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The mid-term review of the project was held in July 2010 and was favorable. One key action that remains is the approval and signing of all sub-project agreements between the four
                         countries and CIAT, which would enable the implementation of country and theme specific project activities. Next project meeting (supervision mission) will be held in San Jose,
                         Costa Rica during the week of April 25, 2011.
