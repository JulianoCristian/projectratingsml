7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The GEO of the project is to strengthen the capacity in the four participating countries to implement the
Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety. Specifically, it aims to strengthen the technical capacity in knowledge
generation for biosafety risk assessment and management; and strengthen the biosafety decision-making
capacity.

                         Extension of Closing Date
1.     The closing date for Latin America: MULTI-COUNTRY CAPACITY-
BUILDING FOR COMPLIANCE WITH THE CARTAGENA PROTOCOL ON
BIOSAFETY, Grant No. TF091844, P095169, will be extended from June 30, 2011 until
June 30, 2012.

2.     Present disbursements amount to $1,096.614 (27.42% of the total) for FSP
P095169 and $190,765 (21.20% of the total) for MSP P110098 and overall Project
progress was rated moderately satisfactory. As Task Team Leader of these Grants, I
confirm that (i) the objectives of the projects continue to be achievable; (ii) the projects
continue to be implemented satisfactorily; and (iii) there are no outstanding audit reports
or unresolved audit issues.

3.       The need for extension has been discussed within the project teams comprising
the Regional Coordinator, the four National Coordinators and the Thematic Leaders.
There is a consensus that a one year extension is required for the following reasons.
Declaration of effectiveness was delayed by almost 6 months. This in turn caused a delay
in the first disbursement for project activities (on June 20, 2009), as well as in the signing
of the Legal Agreements between the Regional and the National implementing
institutions, and participating entities. Consequently, project activities (through sub-
projects) that depend on an agricultural calendar and crop biological processes, such as
planting and harvesting seasons, will need to continue beyond the current closing date.

4.       The full sized and medium-sized projects are implemented jointly and their
activities are interrelated. An extension of the FSP requires an extension of the MSP, as
the communication and public awareness activities under the MSP are based on the
knowledge generated through the larger project.

5.      The Borrower (CIAT) has prepared a detailed Action Plan to complete the
projects within the new time frame. This Action Plan is attached to the Extension Request
Package.

6.     This      will      be      the     first      extension     of      the      projects.
