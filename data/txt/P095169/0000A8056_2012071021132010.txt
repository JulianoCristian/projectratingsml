                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The GEO of the project is to strengthen the capacity in the four participating countries to implement the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety. Specifically, it aims to
                         strengthen the technical capacity in knowledge generation for biosafety risk assessment and management; and strengthen the biosafety decision-making capacity.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Almost four years after becoming effective, the project held its closing event - the Regional Conference on Biosafety - on June 7 and 8, 2012, in Cartagena, Colombia. The project will
                         officially close on June 30, 2012. The project was able to achieve its objectives and present the results at the event in front of more than 140 participants from many LAC countries,
                         including the Vice Ministers of Environment of Colombia and Costa Rica, as well as special envoys of the Ministries of Environment and Agriculture of Peru and Brazil. The project

                         was able to implement 25 sub-projects distributed across 4 thematic areas (gene flow, GIS, impact on non-target organisms and socio-economic impact) and 4 implementing
                         countries (Costa Rica, Colombia, Brazil, Peru) and CIAT, the Regional Coordinator of the Project. The results of the sub-projects were used for the creation of capacity building tools
                         for decision-makers in those countries. Communication activities were critical for the adequate dissemination of the results. The project has generated important co-benefits (regional
                         public goods) in the areas of biosafety.
