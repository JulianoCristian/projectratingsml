                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The GEO of the project is to strengthen the capacity in the four participating countries to implement the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety. Specifically, it aims to
                         strengthen the technical capacity in knowledge generation for biosafety risk assessment and management; and strengthen the biosafety decision-making capacity.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is making good progress. All 25 sub-projects that have been approved are now under implementation, with expected completion of the end of May 2012. They are
                         distributed across the 4 thematic areas (gene flow, GIS, impact on non-target organisms and socio-economic impact) and 4 implementing countries (Costa Rica, Colombia, Brazil,
                         Peru) and CIAT, the Regional Coordinator of the Project. The implementation of sub-projects is enabling the generation of knowledge for capacity-building of decision makers.

                         Activities are also on-going under the communication components of the smaller (MSP) project in all 4 countries. Public fora on biosafety continue to be part of every mission. In
                         those fora, the public (including media) are invited to learn about the project, as well as participate in open discussions about biosafety. The sub-regional conference held in Costa
                         Rica on April 27-29, 2011 was well received by both technical experts and the public. The closing event of the project, a Regional Conference, will be held in Cartagena, Colombia on
                         June 7 and 8, 2012. The project officially closes on June 30, 2012.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         During the last mission two focal areas were identified: 1) with sub-projects already under implementation, the focus of the project should be shifted towards the strengthening of the
                         capacity of decision-makers; actions in this area are linked to outputs from component 1 and should be further developed; 2) the coordination of the communication activities requires
                         strengthening in light of the new information that the project is generating across 4 countries and the need for better targeting and packaging of the information; actions in this area
                         have been taken by the CIAT team and the regional communication team has been strengthened with advisory services from experienced communication specialists from CIAT.
