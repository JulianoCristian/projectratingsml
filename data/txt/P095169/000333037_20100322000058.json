protocol on biosafety. Specifically, it aims\n            to strengthen the technical capacity in knowledge generation\n            for biosafety risk assessment and management; and strengthen\n            the biosafety decision-making capacity. The changes include:\n            change of a national coordinating agency in one of the four\n            project countries. In Colombia the national coordinating\n            agency is to change from Instituto Alexander von Humboldt to Corpoica."}, "docdt": "2010-03-08T00:00:00Z"}
