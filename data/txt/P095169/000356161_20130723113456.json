Protocol\n            on Biosafety Project for Latin America were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory; risk to global environment\n            outcome was moderate; Bank performance was satisfactory and\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned includes: project design is an effective framework\n            for multi-country collaboration and capacity-building and\n            proved to be an appropriate mechanism for achieving project\n            objectives. However, it can be strengthened by the explicit\n            inclusion of components on communications and project\n            management and by the adequate allocation of resources for\n            financial management and oversight. Continuous and active\n            engagement of environmental and agricultural sector\n            entities, as well as Global Environment Fund (GEF) focal\n            points in each country is critical for project\n            implementation and leverage of buy-in in the changing\n            political economy of biosafety. The challenges experienced\n            in the financial management of the project point towards the\n            need to rethink implementation support for regional\n            initiatives and the need for streamlining of financial\n            management approaches."}, "docdt": "2013-01-28T00:00:00Z"}
