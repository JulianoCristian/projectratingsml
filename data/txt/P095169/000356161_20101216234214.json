Specifically, it aims\n            to strengthen the technical capacity in knowledge generation\n            for biosafety risk assessment and management; and strengthen\n            the biosafety decision-making capacity. The closing date of\n            the project will be extended from June 30, 2011 until June\n            30, 2012. The need for extension has been discussed within\n            the project teams comprising the regional coordinator, the\n            four national coordinators and the thematic leaders. There\n            is a consensus that a one year extension is required for the\n            following reasons. Declaration of effectiveness was delayed\n            by almost 6 months. This in turn caused a delay in the first\n            disbursement for project activities (on June 20, 2009), as\n            well as in the signing of the legal agreements between the\n            regional and the national implementing institutions, and\n            participating entities. Consequently, project activities\n            (through subprojects) that depend on an agricultural\n            calendar and crop biological processes, such as planting and\n            harvesting seasons, will need to continue beyond the current\n            closing date."}, "docdt": "2010-07-09T00:00:00Z"}
