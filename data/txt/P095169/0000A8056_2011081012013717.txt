                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The GEO of the project is to strengthen the capacity in the four participating countries to implement the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety. Specifically, it aims to
                         strengthen the technical capacity in knowledge generation for biosafety risk assessment and management; and strengthen the biosafety decision-making
                         capacity.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is making good progress. All 23 sub-projects that have been approved are now under implementation. They are distributed across the 4 thematic areas (gene flow, GIS,
                         impact on non-target organisms and socio-economic impact) and 4 implementing countries (Costa Rica, Colombia, Brazil, Peru) and CIAT, the Regional Coordinator of the Project.

                         The implementation of sub-projects is enabling the generation of knowledge for capacity-building of decision makers. Activities are also on-going under the communication
                         components of the smaller (MSP) project in all 4 countries. Public fora on biosafety continue to be part of every mission. In those fora, the public (including media) are invited to learn

                         about the project, as well as participate in open discussions about biosafety. During April 27-29 a regional conference on biosafety was held in Costa Rica, organized by the project
                         team in Costa Rica in coordination with IICA, which has its headquarters in San Jose. All National Technical Commissions on Biosafety of Central America were present at the event.
                         Local environmental NGOs were among the participants and so were international organizations working in the area of biosafety and present in the region, such as UNEP and IFPRI.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         During the last mission two focal areas were identified: 1) with sub-projects already under implementation, the focus of the project should be shifted towards the strengthening of the
                         capacity of decision-makers; actions in this area are linked to outputs from component 1 and should be further developed; 2) the coordination of the communication activities requires
                         strengthening in light of the new information that the project is generating across 4 countries and the need for better targeting and #packaging# of the information; actions in this area
                         have been taken by the CIAT team and the regional communication team has been strengthened with advisory services from experienced communication specialists from CIAT.
