Specifically, it aims\n            to strengthen the technical capacity in knowledge generation\n            for biosafety risk assessment and management; and strengthen\n            the biosafety decision-making capacity. The need for\n            extension has been discussed within the project teams\n            comprising the regional coordinator, the four national\n            coordinators and the thematic leaders.
