Annex A 
to 
SCHEDULE 2
 
Additional Provisions Relating to  
Particular Methods of Procurement 
Section I. 
Goods and Non-Consulting Services
Without limitation upon the provisions of Schedule 2 to this Agreement or the 
Procurement Guidelines, the following additional provisions shall apply to all goods and 
Non-Consulting Services procured for the Project (pursuant to Section III of Schedule 2 
to this Agreement) under contracts awarded on the basis of National Competitive Bidding 
(“NCB Contracts”): 
1. 
The Recipient shall submit all forms and models of requests for quotations and 
bidding documents that it or any National Coordinating Agency or Participating 
Entity proposes to use for the procurement of goods and Non-Consulting 
Services under NCB Contracts to the World Bank for its approval before it issues 
its first invitation for bids for any of the NCB Contracts for the Project.  Except 
as the World Bank shall otherwise agree, neither the Recipient nor any National 
Coordinating Agency or Participating Entity, as applicable, shall revise or 
otherwise modify or change the bidding documents that have been approved by 
the World Bank in accordance with the foregoing sentence (the “Approved 
Bidding Documents”).   
2. 
Each bid shall be evaluated and the corresponding contract awarded to the 
responsive bidder: (a) who meets the appropriate technical and financial 
standards or capabilities; and (b) whose bid has been determined to be the lowest 
evaluated bid. Such determination shall be made exclusively on the basis of the 
specifications, conditions and evaluation criteria stipulated in the Approved 
Bidding Documents.  If the bid evaluation will consider any factor other than the 
amount or amounts of each bid, the Approved Bidding Documents will precisely 
stipulate and describe each such factor, including, 
inter alia
,
the manner in which 
such factor will be quantified and given a relative weight for purposes of 
determining the lowest evaluated bid.  The award of contracts for goods and 
Non-Consulting Services shall be based exclusively on price and, whenever 
appropriate, shall also take into account factors similar to those referred to in 
paragraph 2.52 of the Procurement Guidelines; provided, however, that the bid 
evaluation shall always be based on factors that can be quantified objectively, 
and the procedure for such quantification shall be disclosed in the invitation to 
bid. For purposes of bid evaluation and comparison, the only bid amount or 
amounts to be used as a factor shall be the bid amount or amounts as quoted in 
the corresponding bid, as such bid may be corrected by the Recipient, National 
Coordinating Agency or Participating Entity, as applicable, for arithmetic errors.

3.

participate and shall not, as a condition for participating in the bidding process, 
be required to: 
(a) 
be registered in a Participating Country
’s territory; 
(b) 
have a representative in a Participating Country’s territory; 
(c) 
enter into a joint venture agreement with local bidders; or 
(d) 
legalize their bids or any documentation related to such bids with an 
embassy or consulate of a Participating Country, a Participating 
Country’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, or any other governmental 
authority or representative of a Participating Country, as a pre-condition 
to participating in the bidding process. 
4. 
No reference value shall be required for publication in the bidding documents 
and call for bids. 
5. 
Any standards and technical specifications (quoted in the bidding documents) 
which are at least substantially equivalent to the standards and technical 
specifications of the Recipient or such National Coordinating Agency or 
Participating Entity, as applicable, shall be acceptable. 
6. 
No minimum number of responsive proposals shall be required prior to awarding 
a
contract for goods or Non-Consulting Services. 
7. 
No margin of preference shall be granted for any particular category of bidders. 
8. 
The Recipient, National Coordinating Agency or Participating Entity, as 
applicable, shall open, or cause the opening of, all bids at the stipulated time and 
place in accordance with a procedure satisfactory to the World Bank.  
9. 
No other procurement rules or regulations of the Recipient, National 
Coordinating Agency or Participating Entity shall apply without the prior review 
and approval of the World Bank.

legalize their proposals or any documentation related to such proposals 
with an embassy or consulate of a Participating Country, Participating 
Country’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, or any other governmental
