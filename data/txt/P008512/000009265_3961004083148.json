the government and the\n            association; (iii) to finance critical imports of inputs,\n            raw materials and spare parts in key sectors, thus easing\n            the shortage of foreign exchange and minimizing further\n            contraction of economic activity; (iv) to stimulate foreign\n            exchange markets and enhance private sector access to\n            foreign exchange; and (v) to provide priority technical\n            assistance in the key structural reform areas, which will\n            facilitate implementation of the program and build up\n            overall implementation capacity in the country. The proceeds\n            of the credit will finance: (a) pre-identified imports for\n            priority sectors; (b) other priority imports by the private\n            and public sectors through the provision of foreign\n            exchange; and (c) technical assistance."}, "docdt": "1993-04-22T00:00:00Z"}
