REPUBLIC OF KYRGYZffAN
REHABILIATION CREDIT
Credit and Project Sumn_y
BORROWER:          Republic of Kyrgyzstan
BENEFICIARY:    The Government of Kyrgyzstan
AMOUNT:            SDR 43.3 million (US$ 60 million equivalent)
TERMS:             Standard IDA tenns, with 40 years maturity.
OBJECTIVES:        Te objectives of the Credit are: (J) to support the Governmen's Reform
Program, oudined in the Memorandum from the Government to the Association;
(ii) to establish a policy dialogue between the Government and the Association;
(iii) to finance critical imports of inputs, raw materials and spare parts in key
sectors, thus easing the shortage of foreign exchange and minimizing further
contraction of economic activity; Civ) to stimulate foreign exchange markets and
enhance private sector access to foreign exchange; and (v) to provide priority
technical assistance in the key strucural reform areas, which will facilitate
implementation of the program and build up overall implementation capacity in
the country.
DESCRI}TION:    The proceeds of the Credit would finance (i) pre-identified imports for priority
sectors (PIC); (ii) other priority imports by the private and public sectors through
the provision of foreign exchange (FXC); and (iii) technical assistance (TAC).
The import component of US$ 53 million will comprise PIC of US$ 33 million
and FXC of US$ 20 million. In addition, TAC will amount to US$ 7 million. In
the case of the FXC, the items not eligible for financing under the Credit have
been developed into a standard 'negative list." Foreign exchange will be
provided for imports under the Credit at the market exchange rate, without any
exchange rate subsidies. Any compensatory subsidies subsequent to importation
will have to be through the budget within the constraints imposed by the
stabilization program, targeted where possible.
RENEWS:            The proposed Credit would allow increased production and capacity utilization
through the provision of resources to finance critical imports of inputs, raw
materials, spare patts and services. These imports would help limit further output
decline and sustain employment and the balance of payments. The foreign
exchange financing provided by the Credit would help to develop an inter-bank
market in convertible currency and also would enhance private sector access to
foreign exchange. Technical assistance (TA) under the Credit would contribute
to the development of capability in economic, financial and technical management
and would reinforce the implementation of the Government's Economic Reform
Program. TA would also contribute to the restucturing of the Government to



meet the needs of a market economy. Tho Credit has also had the catytic effect
of mobilizing other sources of financng, picultaly through the Consultative
Group meeting in December 1992. Cofinancing of US$ 70 million ½s expected
to be provided by the Goverments of Japan, Netherlands and Switzerland.
RISK:              Mm main risks include the following: (i) substantial instttution building is
required to underpin the key elements of the Reform Program: while this is being
advanced with TA to be provided under the Credit as well as by other donors,
slippage in financing and organizing the TA activities might result in delays in
the implemeion of the Reform Program; (ii) underfinancing of the external
requirements might slow down the implementation of the Economic Reform
Program of the Government and increase the resistance by conservative elemets,
jeopardizing the Program; and (iii) lack of familiarity and experience in working
with IDA prourement, accounting and disbursement procedures might cause
implementation delays. The risks under (i) and (iii) are being addressed with a
core TA program which is already under way with resources from the Trust
Fund established under the Technical Cooperation Agreement (TCA), and the
Project Preparation Facility. In addition to those provided under the Credit,
additional resources to finance TA, particularly grant funds, are being provided
by other donors. Finally, the Association took the lead in organizing the
Consultative Group meeting to help mobilize resources to counter the risks under
(ii).

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF TB  RESIDENT OF TEE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMT ASSOCUITION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DlRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED RUA)ILITATION CREDIT
TO TE REPBLIC OF KYRGYZSTAN
L   ITRODUCTION
1.          I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a
proposed Rehabilitain Credit to the Republic of Kyrgyztan for SDR 43.3 millon (US$ 60
million  valent) to finance essental imports and technical assistance associated with the
Government's Economk Reform Program. The Credit would be at the standa  IDA tems, with
a mauity of 40 years. Coflnncing of US$ 70 milUion on a parallel basis e apWdto be
provided by the Govements of Japan, the Netherlands and Switzerland.
2.          The Republic of Kyrgyzstan joined the IMS   on May 8, 1992; the IBRD on
September 18, 1992; theIlDA on September24, 1992; andIFC on Pebuaiq 11, 1993. Economic
missions from the Association visited KyWzstan in Febray, April and October, 1992 and
J=uary - Fehnary 1993. A draft Countty Eoonomic Memorandum (CEM) was distried to
the Bar in December 1992 and a red cover CPEM is being publisbed. A note on Kyzgywsn's
IDA eligibility is being distributed to the Executive Directors.
M COUNTRY POLICIES AND IIDA ASSISTANCE STRATEGY
A.   Recent Polcal and Economic Deveopments
3.          Badkgrouud. Kyrgyzstan is one of the smallest and poorest ofthe newly emerging
countries of the PSU, lading the abundant natural resource endowment of moEt of its
neibors.1 In some rst it faces sues smilar to those facing other low income developing
coutries. It has apopuation of 4.4 million, of which 62 percent fiveinthe nual areas.2
hPer capita estimates are subject to major uncerties. A Bank-wide working group is
acutly revising estmaes for all FSU counties. Prelhinary indications are that Kyrgyzst  is
likely to be at or below IDA operation cut-off level in 1992.
2     Over half of the population is Kyrgyz. Other nationality groups, in prcentages, are Russian
(21), Uzbek (13), and Ukrainian and German (2.5 each). About half the population is in te acdve
age group, and the demographic composition has been fairly stable during the l1t decade. Popudation
growth averaged 1.8 percent in 1985-90 and declined to 1.2 percent in 1991 following net emigration,



2
Agriculture, which accounts for about 32 percent of GDP and 36 percent of employment, is
geared mainly towards livestock and crop farming. The industdal sectr comprises about 30
percent of GDP and 20 percent of employment. The most impotant industies include
mechanical and electrical engineering (vehicle assembly, washing machines), light industry
(mainly textiles), and food procesing. During the Soviet period, the central government chose
to exploit very little of the country's minerals (gold, uranium, and antimony). Although its
economy is highly dependent on other sources of imported energy, Kyrgyzstn has considerable
hydroelectric potential and is an exporter of peak electric power.
4.          Kyrgyzstan displays some important differences from other developing countries
oK similar income level. Its population is relatively well educated, and until recendy the county
enjoyed generous social services in education, health, pensions, and income support. The Soviet
system also developed an idustrl base in Kyrgyzstan designed to support the Union-wide
indutiazaon strategy which fostered strong intdendence among the republics. Finally,
although Kyrgyzstan's physical infastictme was mainly designed for FSU trade, it is relatively
developed and reaches a significant portion of the country and popuation.
5.          The aftermath of the Soviet Union's collapse has been particularly difficult for
Kyrgyzstan. Until 1991 the economy depended on large transfers fiom the Union Government
to finance trade and fiscal deficits. On average, the Republic's bedget was financed by explicit
trasfers of 10 to 12 percent of GDP. Industrial and agricultural prduction relied heavily on
inputs and spare parts from other republics, which were often subsidized. Kyrgyzan also
received large implicit subsidies on wheat, oil, and gas imports from Russia and other Cental
Asian republics. A large portion of output was exported to meet centally managed demand in
other parts of the FSU. Almost all of Kyrgyzstn's trade was conducted through FSU-wide trade
and payments organizations.
6.          Now deprived of Union transfers, subsidized imports, and a centrally managed
tade network, Kyrgyzstan is facing a dire economic situation. Output and trade have
plummeted, real incomes have fallen drastcally, and annual inlation has surged to four digit
levels. As in other FSU counties, many production units are on the verge of collapse with
limited prospects for future viability since they lack either inputs or markets for output.
Unemployment is not yet pervasive, but is imminent, as enterprises exhaust all means to keep
labor employed.
7.         Despite expectations of heavy short-rn economic costs, Kyrgyzstan's political
decision to break with the Union was very clear. In 1989 emerging nationalist sentiments were
manifested in the passing of a Law making Kyrgyz the official language. In 1990, major ethnic
violence broke out near the border with Uzbekistan over what was regarded as an unfair
distribution of land between Kyrgyz and Uzbek populations livmg on Kyrgyzstan's temtory.
Widespread demonstrations became the focus of a broader anti-regime campaign by aU
mainly of Russians.



3
opposition forces. This eventually forced Parliament to hold new Presidential elections. In
October 1990, Mr. Askar Akaev, who has led the pro-reform and pro-democracy movement in
Kyrgyzstan, was elected President by popular vote. During the failed coup of August 1991 in
Moscow, a parallel attempt was aimed at President Akaev. The defeat of the hard liners led to
a formal declaration of independence. Kyrgyzstan joined the Conunonwealth of Independent
States (CIS) in December 1991.
8.          Recent Performance. The Government demonstrated its commitment to achieve
a market-oriented economy by introducing reforms often ahead of other FSU countries. These
reforms include a more rapid reduction of the role of the state, the introduction of a new tax
system, measures to strengthen the autonomy of the central bank, quicker price decontrol, and
the targeting of family allowances.
9.          Kyrgyzstan is expected to be the first country in the CIS to have an upper tranche
standby agreement with the lMP. It was the head start on reforms in 1992 and the resulting
hardships of transition, that made the administration aware of the need for macroeconomic
stability. The country's reform-minded leadership believes th-t its only chance for success lies
in implementing a radical reform program and stabilizing the economy as soon as possible.
10.         Efforts to achieve macroeconomic stability in 1992 were undermined by events
elsewhere in the ruble zone and a relaxed domestic credit policy in Kyrgyzstan in the second half
of the year. Inflation and steep exchange rate depreciations were mainly ;mported from Russia.
After the one-step price liberalization in early 1992, an inflationary process was fueled by credit
expansion. Although Kyrgyzstan tightly controlled its fiscal deficit during the first half of 1992,
in the last quarter expenditures increased to compensate for large declines in real incomes. The
relaxation in fiscal control of the second half of the year gave way to a budget deficit of about
15 percent of GDP. By the end of 1992, inflation had reached almost 2,000 percent for the year.
11.        In spite of the delineating macroeconomic situation, important structural reforms
were approved in 1992. First, the Government started privatization quickly, but lacked the
enabling legal framework to carry ou. the whole progrAm. A legislative framework and a new
program were designed thereafter to allow for the acceleration of privatizaton: a privatization
law was approved in July 1992, and was subsequently further developed in a Concept Note
adopted by Parliament in December 1992. By January 1993, about 2300 enterprises accounting
for about 12 percent of total fixed assets, were privatized. The majority of these, about 2000,
were small-scale enterprises in the trade and services sectors. Second, most legal and
institutional bariers to prvate sector participation in trade and distribution, including state
orders, were eliminated by the end of 1992, except for some exportable goods (wool, tobacco,
cotton, and grains). These state orders remain as emergency measures m order to obtain,
through bilateral arangements, oil and gas from the FSU for 1993. State orders and purchases
will be eliminated by December 1993 (see para 38).
12.         Third, the tax system was thoroughly reformed in order to respond to the new
emerging economic system and to prepare for the anticipated collapse of the revenue base. This



4
effort began with the introduction of VAT, personal and corporate income tax, and excis. By
December 1992, most of the preously granted tax privileges and exemptions had been
eliminuated. Further fiscal measurs have been approved by Parlament and are included in the
DO  standby program. Fourth, mutple exchange rates and foreign exchange sunder
requirements on exports were abolished in September 1992, and a 10 percent export tax was
introduced. Fth, new  cenral bank and commercial banng laws have been adopted,
establishing a two-tier banling system with the National Bank of Kyrgyzstan (NBK) as the
ceral bank with increased supervisory authority. This legal framework, sumppoted with
pndential regulations, constitutes a basis for transformg specalized stateMowned bans and
recently established commercial banks, largely owned by enteiprises, into modern market-
oriented banks. Sixth, discussion of a draft new constition which includes provisions for
propelty rights and private ownership of land is at an advanced stage.
13.          The declines in output and living standards in Kyrgyzstan are wmong the most
severe in the FSU republics not involved in a civil war or intea strife. Output in 1993 is
expected to be 40 percent below the level in 1990 (Table 1). Real wages ffll by 37 percent
between the last quarter of 1991 and the last quarter of 1992. Pensions and minimum wages have
dropped to only a few dollars a month. While this level reflects in part the undervaluation of the
ruble at the market exchange rate, there is no doubt that the purchasing power of pensions and
minimum wages has declined shaiply in real terms. Although there are no firm data on the
incidence of poverty, it is very likely that at least one-third of the populton was below the
poverty line in 1992. As economic hardships deepened, social pressures also mounted.

14.         Under the Soviet system, the stat-e spent about 30 percent of GDP on social
services in Kyrgyzstan. In 1990, the state provided social services in he;lth (4 percent of GDP)
and education (8 percent) as well as financial support through family allowances (4 percent),
pensions and food subsidies (7 percent each). Such extensive social coverage cannot be
sustained. Indeed, social expenditures fell shaiply in 1992 to about 17 percent of GDP in
response to the tightening fiscal position. Moreover, the system of job guarantees combined with
soft budget constraints led to overslaffing of state enterprises (SEs), also unsustnable under a
market economy. In addition to jobs, SEs have provided social services such as basic health and
housing.
15.         Social pressures are now becoming apparent. Privileged groups from the past
system are recruiting support from state farm and enterprise managers, and from vulnerable
groups who have suffered the seveit effects of the first year of transition. These groups have
recendy become more outspoken, and are being heard in Pariament.
16.         Mobilizing political endorsement of the reforms is extremely difficult in an
environment in which policy changes are seen as leading to a continuing deterioration in living
standards: while some transition costs have already tken effect, the benefits will take some time
to materialize. Mainuining support for reforms will require providing the public a stake in the
economy's transfonnation through vigorous promotion of pnvate sector activities, continued
privatization, provision of basic public services, and effective protection of the most vulnerable
groups in the transition.
B.   Country Development Objectives and Policies
17.         The policies for accomlshing the Government's objectives are articulated in the
Economic Reform Program which was presented to Parliament by President Akaev and approved
after extensive deliberaton in July 1992. The program details are outlined in the Memorandum
of Economic Refonn PoUcies (Annex  D). Kyrgyzstan's reform program has two primary
objectives. First, to achieve a macroeconomic framework that reduces infation and includes the
necessary fmancing to prevent furter declines in critical imports. This framework also conains
the inedients for gradually making the economy less dependent on foreign savings. Second,
to generate an early supply response through structural and sectoral reforms. Key elements of
the structural reforms include:
o EnterprIse refornm, including privatizaion and better governance
of SEs expeced to remain in state ownership
o Creation of an Incentive framework to foster private sector
development, inclding promotion of foreign direct investment and
dismantlement of monopolistic markets



6
o Reform  of the rmncial secor to support both entprise
restructuring and development of the private sector and,
o Establishment of a strong social safety net in which spending is
targeted to the most vulnerable groups and is consistent with the
budget constraints imuposed by stabilization needs.
Sectoral reforms designed to promote a rapid supply reWonse in Iky sectors of the economy
are initially to be focused on the agriculture, mining, and service sectors.
Macroeconomic Stabilization
is.          Negotiations with the IM  have been concluded ano an upper-tranche standy
arrangement covering an ll-month period is expected to start in May 1993. In order to be able
to implement a stabilization program, Kyrgyzstan has decided to leave the ruble zone and
introduce its own currency, the Som. At the same time, the Government intends to pursue
restrictive monetary and fiscal policies to ensure the successful introduction of its new cumrency.
19.         Successful stabilization requires the containment of budget deficits to around 5 %
of GDP over the nineties. For 1993, the program aims to achieve a dastic reduction in both the
budget deficit (from 15 to 7 percent of GDP) and the growth of broad money and domestic
credit. Measures to increase revenue are essential. Parliament recently approved measures to
enlarge the tax base and increases in tax rates for alcohol and petroleum. Exndiures are also
under pressure. For 1993, the program includes subsidy reductions, better targeting of transfers,
and a conservative wage policy.
20.         Non-inflationary domestic financing is virtally non-existent and the stabilization
program envisages no central bank financing of the fiscal deficit for the remainder of 1993.
hnerefore, the fiscal deficit needs to be funded by et>,-rnal resources The role of the donors is
essential in the financing of Kyrgyzstan's budget aeficit over the coming years. Otherwise,
critical social expenditures will not materialize under such stringent budgetaty conditions.
Currently less than one-third of foreign savings can be used by the Central Government: most
of the remaining foreign savings are tied to financing inter-enterprise trade with FSU countries,
mainly oil and gas imports, which will ease the adjustment to higher imported energy prices.
Structural Reforms
21.         The success of the stabiliion prgram  and reform im general depends to a large
extent on whether the state enterprises (SEs) can be transformed into economic entities which
respond to market signals. A successful transition will require simultaneous progress on three
fronts: privatization, enterprise reform, and assistance to the development of new business.
22.         Wide-ranging decrees on privatization and the creation of joint ventures were
approved by Parliament in 1991 and 1992. The State Property Fund's (SPF's) authority to



7
exercise the State's rights on property has been backed by a law approved by Parliament in July
1992. In December 1992, the Parliament adopted a Concept Note on Privatization which
envisages: (i) rapid sale of small-scale-enterprises such as shops and restaurants; (ii) mass
privatization of medium- to large-scale-enterprises through a voucher system; and (iii) the
privatization of large enterprises on a case-by-case basis. By late 1993, 35 percent of the fixed
assets of SEs are to be transferred to new forms of ownership; a further 35 percent are to be
transferred by end-1996.
23.         There are three steps to enterprise reform: (i) reducing subsidies and state
financial transfers to SEs; (ii) restructuring SE1s; and (iii) improving corporate governance of
SEs. Given the lack of resources, the Government has started enterprise reform by contracting
credit to SEs in real terms, reducing subsidies and switching them to the budget, and linking
financial support to enterprise-level adjustment or liquidation.
24.         Restucturing of small to medium sized enterprises is expected to be undertaken
by new private owners. Given the lack of resources for large investments in restructuring, large
enterpises will be passively restructured over time. These SEs, however, will need to engage -
with foreign technical assistance - in some reorganization, segmentation, downsizing, and
management changes. With no substantial private and foreign capital available, a more active
adjustment program for these enterprises will require provision of lines of credit for
rstructuring, and increased technical assistance from the international community. This is taken
into account in the projected external requirements (see Table 1), where the non-Government
sector continues to absorb an important share of foreign savings.
25.         In conjunction with tightening financial discipline, the governance of state
enterprises is to be improved through their conversion to joint stock companies with boards of
ditors, the establishment of proper statutes, and increased clarification of assets and liabilities.
Moreover, a system to monitor and assess the financial performance of enterprises is to be
established. Branch ministries are to transfer the state's remaining ownership rights to the SPF,
except for a few enterprises in need of continued regulation. The SPP has set up a temporary
holding company for those remaining SEs that require complex restructuring and partial
liquidation.
26.         Private Sector Development. Privatization is a necessary but not a sufficient
condition for the emergence of a strong private sector. The Government is developing a program
of measures designed to encourage the emergence of new private enterprises. Legislative
measures to be presented to Parliament include: (i) measures to expand ownership and property
rights; (ii) enacting commercial legislation on contracts, bankruptcy, and liquidation procedures,
secured transactions, and the registration of ownership in real and intellectual property; and (ii;)
measures to identify and eliminate obstacles to the formation of new enterprises and eradicate
the abuse of monopoly power through regulation or the brealdng up of amalgams into competing
enterprses.



8
27.         The Government expects foreign direct investment to play an important role in
the development of the productive base of the private st. It intends to promote foreign
investment through a stable macroeconomic environment and the implification of foreign
investment procedures. A one-stop system for foreign invetment processing and licensing is
planned for 1993. Direct foreign investment and joint ventures are needed as a source of capital
flows and as a way of gaining access to world markets. Investment potential exists in mining,
tourism, electronics, and some light manuuing production.
28.         FinancIal Sedor. During the initial stages of the transition the financial sector
will be exposed to increasing bankruptcies and entezprise closures. The role of the financial
sector is likely to be constrained in Kyrgyzstan in the early stages of reform, since there are only
15 com1nercial banks mostly owned by SEs, and 3 large stae owned banks which dominate the
system. Moreover, the stringent monetaly policy and restricted access to credit which will
accompany the introduction of a new currency will put SEs under additional financial strain.
29.         A large fiscal contingent liability is expected to arise from the deterioration in loan
portfolios as SEs restcture and the existing banking system comes under stre. A
Restructuring Agency is envisaged, to handle non-performing assets in the banking system as
soon as a new curmency is adopted. Ths restucting agency would relieve the commercial banks
of liabilities of at least the 20 to 25 largest loss-making entelprises, and would force the
estructring or liquidation of these firms. The removal of subsidies should also help because
the largest uncollectible bank loans are from bakeries and oil trding firms which have carried
the burden of price controls.
30.         As institutions develop and the economy recovers, the financial market is expected
to play the main role in allocating scarce resources. Although the response to new incentives and
prudential standards will take time, extensive institution building in the sector is reqired now
to build up expertise, to further improve banking standards, and to tighten prudential
requirements. Over time prudendal standards for the baning system should increase the
competition for funds and make possible the continuation of tight budget constraints on SEs
through indirect monetary policy.
31.         The National Bank has recendy been given more autonomy, and central bank
refinancing is now being auctioned. By September 1993, all banks will have to comply with the
recently adjusted capital requirements and exposure limits to individual shareholders and
bonowers. Future measures to strengthen the financial sector include the resthurig of long-
term and agiculral lending (now provided by state banks) and the mobilization of household
deposits by commercial bans. The Savings Bank, which held a virtual monopoly, will be
downscaled and restructured. Similarly, aU interest rate subsidies will be removed parallel with
the intoduction of the new currency. Implicit subsidies, through interest rates which are lower
than NBK rediwounting or are different for specific sectors, will also be eliminated.
32.         Social Safety Net. Protection of the poor and maintenance of the political mandate
to continue with the thrust of the reform progam is one of the most difficult tasks confronting



9
the Government. Moreover, the Soviet system of social protection is not sustainable under a
market economy, because of its large burden on the budget and on SEs. Restmcturing social
expenditures is, therefore, part of the refonn program. Among others things, it will involve
shifting SEs services to the central or local governments, which will assume responsibility for
primar' services.
33.         The Goverment's immediate concern is the growing number of poor in the
country. The immediate objective is to protect vulnerable groups from falling into poverty by
preventig a dramatic deteioration of their personal income, and ensuring that they have access
to an adequate social safety net. Vulnerable groups will be identified and policies implemented
to effectively protect them by estabLishing a reasc poverty line. A baseline survey on the poor,
as well as institutionalizng a monitoring system based on restuctured family budget surveys,
will also be camied out. Techical assistance will be needed in the monitoring of poverty, in the
development of a minimum consumption baset and a poverty line (no later than the end of
1993), and in the monitoring of the social impact of the reform process.
34.         The Govermment intends to separate social protecdon needs into social insurance
and social assistance. Soclal inurance will cover pensions, unemployment compensation and
sicknessldisability benefits. Increasingly, these benefits would be funded on a contributory basis,
managed through an amald fund. The Government is expected to propose legislation by
June 1993 to reform the funding and expense obligations of the Pension Fund. To ensure that
vulnerable groups are protected immediately, the value of minimum pensions would be protected
from inflation, but pensions above the minimum would be allowed to fal in real terms. The
Government would be fully responsible for socidal a ance, implying additional budgetary
costs, which wiU be covered temporarily by the extnal financing package embodied in the
macroeconomic program.
35.        In addition to falling output levels, the readjustment in the domestic terms of trade
in favor of agricultral prices will have major short rn implications for social saft  net costs
and real incomes. Along with the need for income compensadon meaures to mitigate the social
impact of falling real incomes, labor mobility needs to be facilitted. For this puipose, the
Government wiU submit to Parliament daft legislation on amending laws to eliminate the
propiska, i.e., the residence requirement for both employment and the provision of social
services that also serves securty puiposes. To increse the efficiency of the labor market, iob
antees will be eliminatd by June 1993. Activities for retaining and for providing
employment services will also be implemented.
Sectoxal Refonns
36.        The most rapid sWpply response is expected to come from the agrIcul  sector.
Under the old system, prices of farm products were kept artificially low to provide cheap food
forthepopulon. Stae controls over allocation, distribution, and markeing (of inputs, services,
and products) compounded the disincentive to produce. The positive domestic terms of trade
effect which follows complete price ibealization of  ical products should stimulate



10
farmers to increase production. Moreover, yields in agriculture production could increase
significantly if the production, distribution, and marketing networks were liberalized and/or
privatized. The agricultumal sector should grow by an average 4 percent per year over the
nineties, with higher growth rates in the early years.
37.        Small-scale farmers are expected to respond positively to the revised incentive
structure. In the next few years, the expansion in agricultural production may substitute for food
products currendy imported from elsewhere within the FSU and China. Legal and institutional
barriers to private sector competition with state operations have been removed to facilitate the
expansion of agricultural activity. The reduction of state control over the input and distribution
networks should, if coupled with strong promotion of the private sector, stimulate higher yields
in 1993. State purchases with prices determined by the Government continue for a few products
covered by trade agreements (grains, wool, tobacco, and cotton), but will be eliminated by
December 1993. During this year's transition, private and public sector use of the state trading
agencies will be allowed on a commercial and voluntary basis. Government control over land,
inputs, and distribution networks will be eliminated in tandem with restructurng efforts.
38.         The mining sector may also have significant long term potential. Compared with
its relatively well-endowed neighbors, Kygyzstan's mineral potential was only partally explored
by the Soviet planners, and an early assessment of its actual potential will need to be undertaken
in conjunction with the development of an overall sector strategy. The Govemnment is already
moving to establish an appropriate legal, institutional and taxation framework in the sector
conducive toward new investment and ensuring an appropriate management of these natural
resources. The Government hopes that the development of this sector will strengthen the
economy's export base and, over time, improve its debt servicing capacity.
Medium Term Prospects
39.        The experience of centrally planned countries that sed the transition to a
market economy ahead of the FSU shows that output recovezy takes time to materialize. Output
in 1993 is expected to be 40 percent below the level in 1990 and could decline further in 1994
before renewed growth emerges in the middle of the decade (Table 1). Provided that
macroeconomic stblization and structural and sectoral reform begin to take hold, GDP growth
of 3 to 5 percent could be achieved in the second half of the 1990s. In addition to agriculture
and mining, other sources of growth in the short term are likely to come from services and light
manufacturing production. If structural reforms proceed at the envisaged pace, and extemal
financial support is forthcoming, inflation should drop significantly in 1994.
40.         The service sectors have been underdeveloped under centrally planned economies.
There is a large gap between the level of business and consumer services in the FSU countries
and those in both OECD and developing countries. Prelimary studies of Eastern Europe show
that services have been rapidly expanding in terms of employment and number of establishments.
Indeed, some growth in services is already evident in Kyrgyzstan. The establishment of
commodity exchanges dealing with a wide range of products, particularly agricultural produce,



11
is an example. Although services are starting from a smaU base and are mostly developing as
an informal sector, future growth is likely to bring about a major expansion of trade and
business services. Some of these services will be associated with transition needs, such as
privatization. The expansion of consumer services, however, is likely to lag behind because of
the general decline in real incomes.
41.         Domestic resource mobilization is expected to faU short of Kyrgyzstan's needs for
many years to come. Given the drastic erosion in real incomes and the expected gradual
recovery, financial savings will be minimal. Corporate savings are also expected to be limited
during the transition period when enterprises adjust to new relative prices. Kyrgyzstan,
therefore, needs to rely on large external savings in the foreseeable future.
42.         Kyrgyzstan's eports, which are starting from a very low base, are expected to
grow to about US$1.1 billion in 1998, while imports increase from about US$1 billion to
US$1.3 billion. Almost half of the trade deficit may sfill be on account of imports fom FSU
countries, since market diversification may take some time. Although non-ruble exports of
leather, mining, and agricultural products couid grow strongly, they are startng from a low
base. Over the medium term, increased eanings from electricity exports are expected to reduce
the trade imbalance. Moreover, Kyrgyzstan's comparative advantage could lie in the production
of high value/low weight exports. Low unit labor cost levels, coupled with a well educated work
force with some specialized skills - in electronics for example - suggest that an internationally
competitive light manufacturing sector could be developed. The Government hopes foreign direct
investment, in infrastrucre and tourism for example, may provide the initial stimulus to this
development.
43.         As inftastructre is developed and the private sector expands, trade with non-FSU
markets, will probably become an important source of growth. A recently established railroad
connection through Kazakhstan to Western China in Xinjiang, China's province bordering
Kyrgyzstan, should facilitate an expansion in trade in a relatively short time. This could open
possibilities for trade with other East Asian economies. In 1992, as inter-state arrangements were
not working, trade with the Xinjiang province expanded significantly.

a/ Concessional.
Source: Staff esfimates.
44.         Kyrgyzstan's exteral financing requirements will peak at around US$400 to
US$450 million in 1993 and will gradually decease to about US$250 million during the second
half of the nineties (Table 2). The curent account deficit of the balance of payments is projected
to reach 20 percent of GDP in 1993, which is in part an arct of the exchange rte. When
foreign resources are converted to rubles at such an undervalued exchange rate, the rato of
foreign financing to output is ovenrtaed. These financing requirements are evenly split between
FSU and non-FSU liabilities. Following the Consultative Group meeting in December 1992, a
pledging session held in April provided US$200 million of grant and concessional financing for
balance of payments support and US$114 million of export credits from non-PSU sources,
together with US$44 milLon from the IMP and a 131 billion ruble credit tmanche from the
Russian Federtion. Kazakhstan, Uzbedstan, and Azeibaijan have also agMed to provide
Kyrgyzsn with 73 billion rubles of trade credits. For the outer years, closing of the external
financing gap would require financial support of about US$100 to US$120 million from the
multlateral sources, and of about the same amount from bilateral donors, including the FSU.
45.         Having agre-d with Russia on the zero debt option, by transferring Kyigyzstan's
share of the assets and liabilities of the PSU to Russia, Kyrgyzstn's initial debt position is
minimal. While debt obligations wil probably remain low in the short term, the existing export
arnings and the lag between policy changes and productive respnses suggest that Kyrgzstan
would continue to require access to external iELancing on highly concessional terms in the near
term. In order to keep the debt service ratios within manageable limits in the late nineties,



13
Kyrgyzstan would need to moblize about three quarters of its extemal financing on concessional
terms.
C.   External Environment and Major Uncertainties
46.         Kyrgyzstan confronts a difficult extemal environment. The economy benefited
from large explicit and implicit transfers under the old system and thus ran a large, hidden
structural balance of payments deficit which was financed from the center. Because of its weak
domestic production base, the economy is heavily dependent on imports from Russia and the rest
of the FSU (representing over 90 percent of all imports). As relative prices adjust in the PSU
toward world levels, especially for oil, the burden of adjustment will intensify. The country's
weak export base does not provide much of a cushion for the difficult transition to a market-
oriented economy that will compete in intemational markets.
47.         Although Kyrgyzstan already suffered negative terms of trade shock m 1992,
additional losses are expected for the future. The economy is totally dependent on imported oil
and gas, and its main suppliers are moving to world market prices. The distribution of the
remaning shock over time will be determined by the pace at which these prices move to
international levels. Nevertheless, in the next few years the total value of Kyrgyzstan's exports
is likely to fall short of the country's energy import requirements.
48.         Given the heavy dependence of Kyrgyzstan's economy on the FSU markets,
delays in stabilizton and recovery in other FSU economies would significantly constrain
prospects for Kyrgyzstan. Since establishing new export markets outside FSU and substituting
for imports from the FSU would require time, the pace of output recovery would critically
depend on restoration of trade relations among the FSU states. Introduction of national
currencies by increasing number of PSU states would pose further challenges for establishing
well functioning, market based, and mutally beneficial trade, payments, and tade financing
arrangements. Delays in establishing these arrangements would seriously hamper the supply
response in Kyrgyzstan, and could potentially prolong the transition.
49.        In addition to the potenal constraints posed by the external environment and
availability of extemal financing, Kyrgyzstan's reform program is faced with two additional
areas of uncertainty: (i) the possibility that the commitment to reform will weaken and lead to
policy slpages; and (ii) limited implementation capacity.
50.         Commitment to Reform. Although the authorities in Kyrzstan have
demonstrated their commitment to reform under exceedingly difficult circumstances, the
simultaneous implementation of stabilization and structmal reforms will be a difficult challenge.
The success of the stabiliation program will depend to a large extent on the transformation of
SEs into economic entities which will respond to marlet signals. At the same time,
implementation of structural reforms might themselves result in trnory macroeconomic
instability. For example, as implicit subsidies are made explicit and directed through the budget,



14
the fiscal deficit will increase, thus putting further pressure on the stabilization efforts. Similarly,
as state en'erprises face losses, profit-based fic revenues will decrease, making the budgetary
situation even more difficult.
51.         Domestic political pressures posed by the dual challenge of stabilization and
structural reform could be further aggravated by continuing large economic decline and the
uncertain prospects for future growth. The likely increase in unemployment and continued
restraint on real wages constitute additional socil costs. These pressures may force the
Government to ease up on the implementation of the comprehensive reform program. Sustained
strong support from the donor community will be important to counter these domestic pressures.
52.        Implementation Capacity. While policy design is critical, the formulation of an
appropriate reform program is not sufficient; the program must be implemented. As the range
of decisions broadens and the complexity of issues increases, decentralization of authority will
be necessary if the pace of reforms is to be sustained. Timely and effective implementation of
the structural and sectoral reform program will require a substantial strengthening of institutional
capacities -- both at the center to establish priorities in the reform agenda and allocate resources
to support these priorities, and in the line ministries and specialized institutions to undertake
these programs. The extent of the new processes to be installed and skills to be acquired cannot
be overtated. The conduct of economic activities consistent with market prnciples will require,
for example, creating a capacity within the Government to procure goods and services under
conditions of competitive bidding and putting in place a system of financial control and audit to
ensure proper use of funds.
53.         The transformation of institutions into structures that are suitable for democratic
processes and supportive of market-oriented activities will require fundamental adjustments in
the existing institutional framework. Technical assistance from abroad can assist the
transformation process - this report identifies several areas of priority - but it is clear that the
process will be lengthy and made more difficult by the current economic decline. Training to
improve the capacity to implement economic policy should therefore be of high priority. At the
same time, the formulaton of reform objectives should attempt to incorporate identified
deficiencies in implementation capacity, to improve the realism of the reform package and the
prospect that it can be fully realizeo.
D.   IBRD/IDA Country Assistance Strategy
54.         Main Objectives and Future Program of Assistance. The design of an assistance
program for Kyrzstan poses an unprecedented challenge. All sectors are being simultaneously
reformed while old structures collapse. Not only a new economy but also a newly independent
country is being built. As the situation evolves and geatr understanding of the country is
gained, the most important task for the program is to remain open to new ideas and to have the
flexibility to adapt to changing conditions. IDA's assistance program to Kyrgyzstan has been



15
designed to provide early and strong support to the Govermment's program through policy
advice, ESW and lending in the following areas:
o Macroeconomic stabilization through balance of payments support
o   Structural reforms through enterprise estructuring, pnvatization, and fiancial
sector reforms
o   An effective social safety net
o   Sectoral reforms through operations in agriculture, infrstructure, mining and
environment
o Institution building and reinforcement of the Government's implementation
capacity, including the establishment of an agency to manage external assistance.
55.         Assistance in 1992. Beginning with the preparation of the first economic repot,
the Bank's assistance since Febnrary 1992 has consisted of: (i) policy advice and institution
buflding under the Technical Cooperation Agreement (TCA); (ii) aid coordination through the
rcently established Consultative Group; and (iii) preparation of investment and policy-based
operations. Bank assistance to Kyrgyzstan began through the TCA signed on November 5, 1991.
In addition to policy advice and institutional support, the work funded by the TCA provided an
initial understanding of the overall structure of Kyrgyzstan's economy through the first Country
Economic Memorandum (CEM) and the initial prepation of the proposed Rehabilitation Credit.
56.         Other areas of assistance provided under the TCA include: (i) advice on the legal
and institutional infrastructure necessary in a market economy; (ii) assistance in the development
of an overall strategy for privatization and private sector development; (iii) a review of the
financial sector that provided initial policy advice in this area; and (iv) a review of the
Government's social sector policies, soon to be distributed in Gray Cover. The work in these
areas has helped to define the Government's reform program and the Association's lending
priorities. It is being continued under the Association's ESW and project preparation work.
57.         The policy dialogue between Kyrgyzstan and the Association has been extremely
open and has been instrumental in the Government's design of its structural reform program.
Committed to a fast-tack reform program toward a market economy, the authorities have been
highly receptive to outside support and advice. The Govermment has also established a productive
policy dialogue with the IMF, culminating in an agreement on the standby arrangement.
58.         Future Assistance. In order to manage the risks described in section C, while
maintaining the required flexibiity, the IDA assistance program wiU adapt to alternative
scenarios that may develop during the next three years. Three alternatve scenarios are presented
below, which differ with respect to lending totals and instruments used.



16
59.         The policy actions that underlie the strong reform scenario are contaihed in the
Memo'andun of EFonomic Reform Polcies (Annex mI) supporting ftis proposed Rehabilitation
Credit. They are also described in Secdon C of this report. Macroeconomic policies to sustain
the successful intoduction of a new currency are a key element of this scenario. Moreover, the
stabilization program is being supported by structudal measures that enable the achievement of
the macroeconomic targets in the program and are consistent with long run growth and equity
requirements. This strong reform scenario supports privatization and improved governance of
SEs remaining in the public sector, rationalization of social expenditures and social assistance
targeting; and cost recovery in infstructure. In particular, this scenario depends on successful
implementation of the Govenmuent's privadzation program, described in paras 21 to 27. Another
trigger, which is key for materializaton of the supply response, is the reduction in the role of
the state in distribution and marketing, especially in agriculture.
60.         The main risk to the strong reform scenario is that large external shocks and social
costs could lead to politically induced slippage in the implementation of reforms. Policy slippage
on privatization, on reducing the role of the state, or on macroeconomic management, will
trigger a move towards an intemediate case lending program. The working assumption in this
sceono would be that macroeconomic stabilization is expected over a longer period but that
policy measures are still in the right direction. Delays in privatization relative to the existing
goals (although with a minimum progress required on medium and small-scale privatization) as
well as slow expansion of private activity in agriculture production, trade and distribution would
also trigger a move to the intermediate program.
61.         There are two triggers that would move IDA's assistance progam to a low case.
First, if key elements of reforms already taken were reversed. This would involve reversals of
actions in the area of privatization, legislation and regulation, financial sector and social safety
net. It would also involve actions that reimpose barriers to entry or state orders. Second, if
macroeconomic management deteriorated.
62.         Strong Reform Soenario. As seen today, it is the Association's judgement that
the strong reform scenario is the most likely for Kyigyzstan. The reform program has strong
support from the highest adminisration officials. Moreover it has been approved by Parliament
(para 17). At the same time, negotiations for an upper-tranche standby arangement with the
DOF have been concluded. In addition to the proposed Rehabiliation Credit, the lending program
under the strong reform scenario would include policy-based loans over the FY94 to FY96
period covering enterprise and financial sector reforms, human resources, and cross sector
reforms in the outer years. It would also include investment operations and technical assistance
as described below. Total lending for the period would be around US$ 240 million.
63.         Adjustment Lending in Support of Stnucul Reforms. The first proposed
operation, the Rehabiltoon Cedt, has been designed in response to Kyrgyzstan's immediate
needs: (i) to help stabilize the economy by fiancing critical imports, and thereby halting the
decline in output and trade; (ii) to help the Government launch the structral reform program
with technical assistance in core areas; and (iii) to initiae sectoral reforms, by providing



17
technical assistance m key sectors. The proposed Credit would be the first quick disbursing
operation for the CIS, excluding Russia.
64.         Given the authorities' lack of familiarity with DA requirements and prctices,
several actions have been initiated at an early stage of prepaation of the proposed Credit to
minimize potential implementation problems. Implementaton arangements for the Credit are
discussed in Section m and Annex VI. These arrangements include the establishment of a local
project implementation unit, significant staff msources for IDA supervision activities to ensure
fast disbursement and full uilization of the proposed Credit, and training on procurement and
disbursement procedures. Fmally, the Regional Mission in Tashkent is expected to play an
important role in supervision and implementation support.
65.         Support for privizaton, private sector developmen, andflna lsector refonns
would form the core of the Association's policy-based assistance for struscural reforms. A
proposed Financial and Enterprise Sectors Credit, amounting to about US$50 million, would
support reforms of commercial banking and the establishment of a payments system,
privatization and enterprise restructuring. The Credit would also finance the strenng of
institutions through trining, technical assistance, and related equipment and software.
66.         Considering the speed and scope of the privatization effort in Kyrgyzstan,
addressing the potential unemployment to be generated during the adjustment process will be
IDA's first priority in the area of human resources. The Association plans to prepare a FY95
operton of about US$40 milion to help ensure the provision of an effective and adequate social
safety net. This project would aim to strengthen the capacities of the Ministry of Labor and
Social Protction, the Employment Service, and the State Committee for Training to pay
unemployment compensation, to design and cany out proactive labor market policies, including
job search and placement activities, and to implement retaining programs.
67.         The proposed operation would also provide technical assistance, training, and
equipment to support the Govermnent's effort to improve the efficiency of the various existing
social insurance measures by integating the Pension Fund, the Employment Fund, and the
Social Insurance Fund, by improving the collection system and financial management of the
three insurance funds, and by computerzing the system and enhancing financial contols. It
would also increase the capacity of the Ministry of Social Protection and the State Satisti
Committee to devise mechanisms for targeting social assistance to vulnerable groups. Finally,
given the tension between fiscal tighteing and rsing social safety net expenditure needs,
additional assistance from donors, in the form of cofinancing or parallel financing, to support
health and education programs, may also be warranted.
68.        Investment Lending in Support of Sectoral Refoms. In addition to adjustment
lending, the Association plans to develop investment operations in sectors with potential for a
quick supply response. Ihis assistnce would begin in agriculure and would extend later,
possibly into hydropower. In addition, support is needed in key areas of infrasuctu  to
increase the competitiveness and quality of domestic production and promote sectors with export-



18
eaming potential. The Association will provide some assistance in the telecommunications sector
and will continue to seek cofinancing for these activities and to encourage other donors to invest
in Kyrgyzstan's infrastructure.
69.         Given the dominance of agricuture in Kyrgyzstan's economy, operations in this
sector are a critical part of the Association's assistance program. In order to ensure that the
sector generates a positive supply response, it will be essential to support continuing sectoral
reforms, particularly in the structure of agricuttural incentives and institutions. An investment
operation in agriculture would address the most significant constraints in the crops and livestock
sub-sectors, with emphasis on physical infrastructure, storage and distribution, research and
extension, and availability and quality of inputs. The proposed opration would amount to about
US$65 million. The policy content of this operation will depend on the outcome of the
agricultural sector review panned for FY94.
70.         Because Kyrgyzstan is landlocked, investment in potentially productive sectors is
necessary but is not sufficient for the country's access to world markets. The iorsructure
needed to facilitate communication and transporeation to the outside world will be particularly
critical in linkLng both export and import markets to the productive sectors, and thus facilitating
their growth. In this context, the Association, together with other donors, plans an investment
project in telconmuicatons for FY95, with the Association's contribution amounting to about
US$10 million. This operation, consisting of a small component of TA and a large component
of specific investments, would aim at: (i) rehabilitating and expanding the basic (international,
national, and local) telecommunications network to provide priority subscribers with quick,
economic access to quality telecommunication services; (ii) establishing a market-oriented policy,
regultory, and institutional framework to facilitate private and public investment in basic and
non-basic services and improve sector efficiency; and (mii) commercializing and corporatizng
the basic telecommunication operator. Over time, although the Association may become involved
in other inftucture activities emphasizing the maintenance of existing capital assets, it will
continue to encourage other donors to support infastructure investments in Kyrgyzstan.
71.         Based both on the vulnerability resulting from Kyrgyzstan's dependence on
imported energy and the country's potenial for growth in the hydropower sector, the Association
would consider investing in this sector in the medium term. Ideification of investment projects
will depend on the outcome of an overall strategy for the sector and the assessment of potential
markets in the region. Hydropower studies, expected to be financed by USAID and EBRD,
could be instrumental in defining IDA's fuure interventions in the sector. at present, an
operation of about US$30 million, is proposed for FY97. Based on the Association's current
knowledge of the sector, activities in hydropower could focus on the need for rehabilitation and
reconstruction of existing plants, improvement in the transmission and distribution systems,
improved efficiency of energy use, and technical assistance for the marketing system in
hydropower.
72.         Intermediate Case. Quick-disbursing lending would be postponed but investment
lending, training, and technical assistance would be maintained. The privatization project



19
(para 66) would be limited to support reforms of the payment system since the lack of a
stabilization program would affect the success of the privatization of four large statewned
commercial banlks, which is currently envisaged. Investment projects would focus on supporting
reforms and sectors which are less dependent on macroeconomic stability. In agriculture, for
example, investment projects would support the liberalization of distribution and marketing in
the sector and, thus, foster private sector participation and supply response. Similarly,
investment in telecommunications and social sectors could advance the reform program. UJnder
the intermediate case the lending program would range between US$ 120 and US$ 180 for the
PY94 to FY96 period.
73.         Under the low case the Association would like to maintain presence in all sectors,
focussing on '.A to maintain institutional reform and the policy dialogue. The lending program
would comprise technical assistance and institution-building operations and a small amount of
investment lending in key infrastructure sectors. These investment projects would be aimed at
rehabilitating facilities and basic service levels, to avoid the collapse of key inrastrucre where
postponement of rehabilitation would increase its cost in the future. Overall lending would be
within the range of US$ 50 to US$ 80 million for the FY94 to FY96 period.
74.         Lending Summary. Six projects are planned for Kyrgyzstan during the FY93-
FY96 period. The total lending amount for these years could be in the range of US$240 million.
Given the country's low income, large drops in output and real incomes for 1992 and those
expected in 1993 and beyond, its weak creditworthiness, and fast-track reform program, the
Bank has decided to consider Kyrgyzstan eligible for financing on IDA terms. Over time, as the
Association is better able to assess the country's creditworthiness, lending may shift to a blend
of IDA and IBRD financing. The extension of IDA to Kyrzstan is already having a catalytic
effect in the mobilization of concessional financing from other donors.
75.         The Association's strategy emphasizes the role of quick-disbursing, adjustment
lending in support of a strong program of structural reforms. The forms of assistance could
comprise as much as 50 percent of total lending in the next four years, after which its share
would decline sharply. Such a high proportion is justified on balance of payments grounds to
meet the country's external financing requirements. Quick-disbursing, policy-based operations
will help finance imports, preventing further collapse in the economy and thereby contributing
also to the political sustainability of the reform program. Without IDA's policy-based support
for structural reform, Kyrgyzstan would have difficulty accessing other sources of external
finance.
76.         Economic and Sector Work. The Association's ESW on Kyrgyzstan is the basis
for advising the Government on policy design and implementation. Economic work should be
less sensitive, than the lending progam, to the scenarios described above. The first
comprehensive economic assessment of the country's macroeconomic framework and its
structural and sectoral characteristics was carried out under the first Country Economic
Memorandum (CEM). The report also contains the Association's initial policy recommendations
on the transition to a market economy.



20
77.         Given their impoltance in these inital years and the need for annual Consultaive
Group meetings, annual CEMs are planned for the next three years. The new CEMs will tak
stock of economic developments and the progress of the reform program and then focus on a
series of cross-sectoral issues. The next CEM, envisaged for FY94, will include a firt review
of the public investment program, to provide advice on the efficient allocation of public
resources and on preventing the crowding out of pnvate investment as well as the on
development of an appropriate institutional fnamework.
78.         Sectoral reviews will also provide the analytical basis for designing the various
sectoral lending operations. The first of these, the human resources review and the enteiprise
reform, privatization and financial sector review, are already underway. A comprehensive
agriculture review is also planned for FY94.
79.         The Govermment has requested participation in the Trade Expansion Program
(TEP). This program, financed by UNDP and executed by the Association, has been extrmely
successful in other countries. If the financing is forhcoming, the program would help provide
the blueprint for future trade reform. The advantage of the TEP is that its terms of reference are
developed by the main agencies involved in the reform program. The resulting agenda for trade
reform programs is thereby owned by the local agencies concerned. This would provide the basis
for the Association and other donors to support the implementation of trade reform through
lending operations.
80.         As in the other FSU republics, the past system of state planning in Kyrgyzstan
did not factor in the value of the environmental resources that were lost as a result of economic
plans and policies. The incentive framework led to overonsumption of resources, such as
energy and water for irrigated agriculure. A Bank staff report 'Aral Sea Crisis: Proposed
Framework of Activities" was published in March 1993. An intemational conference will be held
on April 26, 1993 to discuss the proposals contained in the report.3 An Environmental Action
Plan will be de veloped in FY94 to address these issues and to help the Goverment improve
environmental policies and regulations as t!'ey develop their economic structure. Tbis work will
be supported by other sector work on agriculture and by the regional work carried out by the
Bank on the Aral Sea.
81.         Prtfoo           MIDA's stategy will be based on the lessons leared from
the implementation experience of other FSU countries and Eastern Europe with the objective of
minimizing potential implementation problems. At the project design stage, the Association will
ensure that adequate emphasis is given to building up the institutional capacities to manage and
implement projects. Training needs of local staff in procurement, disbursement, and financial
management will be given paricular attention. As the portfolio develops, through the Mid-Term
Review process and Country Implementation Reviews (CIRs), implementation issues will be
closely examined with a view to fadlitating the design of future operations.
3    The conference has been organized by the Bank in collaboration with UNEP and UNDP.



21
82.        Other Bank Group Activies. Kyrgyzstan became a member of the Inteonal
Finance Corporation (IFC) on Febmary 11, 1993 and is expected to become a member shotly
of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Association (MGA). IFC has already conducted a
preliminar assessment of potential work in the country. As a result, two iniial projects, for the
establishment of both a model private commercial bank and a leasing company for small and
medium-size enterprises, are currendy planned. At a later stage, IFC envisages playing a role
with IDA on the privatization program as wel as in the mobilization of private foreign
investment in the tourism, mining, and electronics sectors. IFC is already investigating a
possible investment project in gold mining.
83.         Coordination of Extermal Assistance. A major pait of the Association's work
in Kyrgyzstan is devoted to mobilizing and coordinating donor resources. Through chairing
Consultative Group meetings and through ensuring a continued exchange of information, the
Association aims to maintain close cooperation with multilateral and bilateral agencies. The
Association organized and chaired the first Consultative Group meeting for Kyrgyzstan on
December 15, 1992 and, as a follow up, a pledging session was held on April 8, 1993 to fmn
up donor commitments for extrnal financing. Given the success of both meetings, the
Association, as Chairman of the CG, will continue its resource mobilization and coordination
efforts with the international community, including with FSU countries. Throughout the process
of aid coordination and mobilization, the Association and the IMP will continue to work closely
in developing complementary programs of assistance.
84.        In cooperation with the BC and UNDP, the Association is helping to establish the
External Assistance Management Unit (EAMU). This unit will be the channel through which
Kyrgyzstan will receive and coordinate the aid from various donors. In this effort, the Bank has
provided a grant of approximately US$300,000 under the Institutional Development Fund. The
local Consultative Group meeting, exected to be held in Bishkek in May 1993, will: (i) take
stock of technical assistance flows to date and remaining requirements, (ii) discuss procedures
for implementation of the EAMU, and (iii) discuss specific technical assistance needs in the
social sectors.



22
Summary Assessment
85.         Kyrgyzstan faces issues pertaining both to an economy in transition, and to a low-
income developing country. Since Kyrgyzstan is small and has a political leadership commitued
to reform, the external community has the opportunity to play an important role in facilitating
the transition to a more resilient economy.
86.         Kyrgyzstan faces many uncertainties in its transition to a market economy. These
include developments in the external envirnment, the sustainability of political support for
reform, and the capacity of the Government to implement across-the-board reforms. Sucn
uncertainties are complicated by the fact that this is a new country with no track record of past
performance. Also, political developments in Russia could have implications in Kyrgyzstan. The
adoption of a new currency in such a fluid and uncertain situation has inherent risks.
87.         The international community, including the Association, should support the current
Government's determined effort to proceed with reform. Assistance is needed to slow down
output decline through the financing of critical imports, selective investments to minimize further
decline in basic services, pivotal technical assistance to support reforms in key sectors, and
measures to support enterprise restnrcturing and strengthen social safety net arrangements.
Tining and the implementation of an adequate institutional framework are also required for the
Government to be able to effectively use this financing.
88.         Given the uncertainty and newness of the Kyrgyzstan economy, the Association
faces a threefold challenge: (i) to be able to adapt to rapidly changing conditions; (ii) to
pnoritize interventions so as to maximize the effectiveness of IDA and other donor resources;
and (iii) to invest relatively large proportions of IDA resources in designing policies and
projects, that can become a platform for other assistance, including cofmnancing.
89. The Association's assistance strategy described earlier is based on three scenarios that
are triggered by alternative Government policy performance. It is also based on the most likely
financial needs and realistic financing availability as seen today. However, it is important to
recognize that there are significant uncertainties suounding the magnitude of external financing
needs and sources. If these uncertainties were to matedalize, the Association would have to
reconsider stepped-up assistance - at least temporarily - provided that it is complemented by
the mobilization of additional financing from the donor community and, additional domestic
policy measures. Achieving a proper balance between these elements would represent a complex
challenge for the Association in the future.



23
m.  TE REABLTATION CREDIT
A.   Background
90.         The proposed Rehabilitation Credit would be the Bank Group's first lending
operation in the country. It would provide concrete support for the Government's reforn effoits
by providing foreign exchange for imports critical to production and for technical assistance
critical to the implementation of the systemic reform measures. The Association intends to
continue to support the reform process through its lending program, portfolio management and
ESW. Supervision of the proposed Crdit, which is expected to be very staff-intensive, will also
provide the basis for carning out a policy dialogue in the areas of systemic reform that the
Credit supports.
91.         Rationale for IDA Involvement. As has been discussed earlier in this report, the
economic situation in Kyrgyzstan has been deteriorating in the last few years, in line with the
developments in the FSU. Output has declined owing to severe disruptions in interstate trade.
The economy is suffering a severe terms of trade deterioration because of the recent and
prospective increases in energy prices. The fall in demand, as a consequence, is expected to
heighten the need for adjustments in the goods and labor markets.
92.         Although the country's economic management capability is weak, it has a reform-
minded Government. The Government's Economic Reform Program is consistent with the
recommendations of the Association and the IMF. It represents a courageous and ambitious
attempt to remove the vestiges of a commanc economy and move to a market economy with
predominantly private sector activities. Substantial adjustment will be involved: a massive
restuctuing of agricultunal, industrial and commercial activities will take place as producers
adjust to realigned relative prices; the financial sector will undergo reforms involving the
development of a strong centrl bank, a commercial banlkng sector, and a stronger regulatory
environment; privatization will be implemented; a targeted social safety net, that will make
effective use of its budgetary resources, will be developed; and the state will reduce its role in
production, distibution and resource allocation. The basic constraint the Government now faces
is the financing of the Economic Reform Program so that the adverse effects of the adjustment
are minimized.
93.        IDA supports the Government's Economic Reform Program. The Government's
Memorandum on the Economic Reform Program will form the basis of the future policy
dialogue between the Goverment and the Association. The Government's Program will focus
on limiing economic decline in the short-term and establishing the basis for systemic reform in
the medium and long-term. (lTe Govenment's Memorandum is provided in Annex M.)
94.         In the short-term, the reform process will entail significant problems of
unemployment, aserity, inflation and political confrontation. Obstacles in the development of
markets (limited market and price information, limited private sector traders and intermediaries,



24
inadequate communication facilites, regulatory environment, etc.) will slow down the adjustment
of relative prices. Trade, already significandy dismpted among the FSU republics, will not be
easy to develop with the rest of the world. Industry and agriculture will suffer setbacks as
profound restiucturing takes place. However, Kyrgyzstan has good longer tenn potential for
development. While its mineral wealth (with potental for exploitation on an expanded scale in
gold, antimony, mercury, uranium and rare earth metals) has yet to be exploited, agriculture
(with potential for intensive high value production), hydroelectric potential, tourism, and well-
educated human resources are major assets which could form the basis for sustained growth.
B.   Project Objectives and Description
95.         The objecie of the Credit are: (i) to support the Govermnent's reform program,
outlined in the Memorandum from the Government to the Association; (ii) to establish a policy
dialogue between the Government and the Association; (iii) to finance critical imports of inputs,
raw materials and spare parts in key sectors, thus easing the shortage of foreign exchange and
minimizing further contaction of economic activity; (iv) to stimulate foreign exchange markets
and enhance private sector access to foreign exchange; and (v) to provide priority TA in the key
structural reform areas, which will facilitate implementafion of the program and build up overall
implementation capacity in the country.
96.         Project Descrition. The proceeds of the Credit would finance (i) pre-identified
imports for priority sectors (MC) of SDR 23.8 million; (ii) imports by the private and public
sectors through the provision of foreign exchange (FXC) of SDR 14.4 million; and (iii) technical
assistance (TAC) of SDR 5.1 million. In the case of the FXC, the items not eligible for
financing under the Credit have been developed into a standard "negative list.  Foreign exchange
will be provided for imports under the Credit (both FXC and PiC) at the market exchange rate,
without any foreign exchange rate subsidies. Any compensatory subsidies subsequent to
importation will have to be through the budget, targeted where possible and within the
constraints imposed by the stabilization program.
97.         PIC. For the PIC, priority sectors will be limited to a few pre-identified imports
which will be financed for only a limited number of large orders. The emphasis will be on
maintaining production and services in critical areas and reducing production and employment
declines. Such imports include: telecommunications replacement equipment and spare parts,
pharmaceuticals, agricultural chemicals, veterinary medicines, spae parts in the public
transportation sector, petroleum products, racement power tansmission lines and motors,
replacement irrigation pumps and equipment and spare parts, and equipment for environmental
monitoring laboratories. A summary of items to be financed under the PIC is provided in Annex
IV and the procedures for implemenation are discussed in Annex VI.
98.         DXC. The foreign exchange market in Kygzstan has been limited, owing to the
legacy of Government controls under the FSU. However, now several commercial banks and
exchanges are authorized to deal in foreign exchange. With the introduction of the national



25
currency, the exchange rate will be determined by periodic auctions in the independent inter-
bank foreign exchange market. The govenmment is committed to refrain from intervening in the
market with the purpose of influencing the exchange rate. There is apparent demand for foreign
exchange by the private and public sector entetprises but the volume of transactions is
constrained by the limited export eamings and foreign capital inflow. Commercial banks have
limited experience in foreign exchange transactions but are interested in expanding their activities
in this area; they are establishing correspondent bank relations, and TA will be provided in the
Credit for training in foreign exchange operations. Through the FXC, private and public entities
will have access to foreign exchange. Disbursement under this component will be made as
reimbursement to the government for imports by the private and public sector already made.
Individual documentation for imports costing less than US$10,000 equivalent or exceeding
US$500,000 equivalent would not be eligible for reimbursement under the FXC.
99.         The FXC of TUS$ 20 million wiUl serve three broad purposes. First, it will provide
foreign exchange to finance imports by the private and public sectors at the exchange rate freely
established in the inter-bank foreign exchange market. Second, the local currency received by
the Goverment from the sale of this foreign exehange will provide non-inflationary deficit
financing for the budget. Third, the FXC will also provide some assistance to the authorities in
the establishment of the new inter-bank foreign exchange market and help underpin the new
currncy during the initial critical penod after its introduction. The volume of transactions that
will initially flow through the market is uncertain. However, the formal auction market will tend
to set the rate for transactions outside the market (since sellers will have no reason to sell for
less than and buyers have no reason to pay more than the auction market prices). By adding to
the potential supply of foreign exchange available for sale, the FXC will help get the new market
established. The rate and periodicity of sales by NBK of foreign exchange at the inter-bank
foreign exchange market will be agreed upon between the authorities and the Associaton.
100.       The linkages between the foreign exchange auctions and the financial sector need
to be noted. The auctions of rediscount credit initiated by the NBK in Febnuy, 1993, will
ensure that public and private entexprises shall have access to commercial bank credits under the
same terms and conditions. Meanwhile, prudential regulations have been introduced to prevent
concentration of lending by commercial banks to their public enterprise shareholders. In
December, 1992, loans to individual shareholders were reduced to 20 percent-of a bank's capital
while exposure limits on individual borrowers were set at 40 percent of capital and reserves.
Furthermore, loans to all shareholders, who own more than 5 percent of shares individually, will
be reduced to a total of less than 25 percent of the outsanding loans by the end of 1994, with
intermediate targets to be agreed upon between the Government and the Association. The
stabilization program also contains global credit ceilings which will limit the public sector's
access to credit. In addition, by the end of January 1993, privadzation has been extended to over
2000 entrprises, which amounts to a transfer of more than 10 percent of the total fixed assets
of the state enterprise sector to the irivate sector. The Govemment intends to accelerate the
privatzation of state enterprises and by the end of 1993 aims for a target of 35 percent of state
enterprise fixed assets. Implementation of these measures facdlates the creation of a conducive



26
environment for the private enterprises to have access to the foreign exchange provided through
the FXC and limits the possibility of the private sector being crowded out by the public sector.
101.       A protocol would be required between the Government and the NBK indicating
the predetermined amounts and periodicity of the foreign exchange transfers to the NBK for sale.
at the inter-bank foreign exchange market. NBK will submit to the PIU, with copy to the
Association, monthly reports indicating the portion of foreign exchange auctions during the
month that has been financed through the resources from reimbursements by the Association for
imports under the FXC.
102.       TAC. The TAC will provide fimancing for technical assistance in the key
structural reform areas of the Govenmment's Economic Refonn Program. The key areas of the
reform program include, enterprise reform, privatization anci private sector development, the
financial sector, social safety net, policy and legislation development in agriculture, muing,
procurement, development of private and public sector capacities in technical and economic
analysis, including project preparation, evaluation and implementation. Technical assistance will
be provided to the State Property Fund (SPF) and the Antimonopoly Committee (AMC) in the
areas of privatization, enterprise goverance, enterprise restructuring/liquidation and competition
policy. In the financial sector, TA will be provided to (i) develop an approach and procedures
that are suitable for auditing commercial banks during the transition of the economy and the
financial systems, and (ii) to carry out, as a pilot exercise, audits of two large commercial
banks. For the mining sector, the TA is designed to aid the Government to establish a legal
framework and an enabling environment to promote efficient production operations under market
economy conditions which will be conducive to new investment. Technical assistance in the area
of social safety net will focus on key aspects of the health sector, emphasizing the critical areas
of pharmaceutical policy and health facility restructuring. Development and implementation of
policy change, and privatization of production and production factors, particularly land
privatization, in the agriculture sector would be supported by detailed studies to be carried out
under the TA program.
103.       TA related to procurement is being expedited through the use of part of an
advance from the Project Preparation Facility (PPW) resources of US$ 0.5 million. The TAC will
also facilitate continuity with the TA activities already started by other donors, mainly the
European Community (BC), and with resources from the Trust Funds established under the
Technical Cooperation Agreement (TCA) between the Government and the Bank. The TA needs
are much larger than can be supported by the proposed Credit and major multilateral donors
such as the EC. A Consultative Group meeting was convened under the chairmanship of the
Bank to mobilize additional multilateral and bilateral support for Kyrgyzstan's core TA
requirements. A summary of the TAC is provided in Annex V and the TAC procurement and
implementation schedules are provided in Annex VI, Tables A-VI.2 and A-VI.3.
104.       The TA program has been developed in close consultation with the Government
as it is closely linked to the development and implementation of the Reform Program. The terms
of reference (TOR) for individual TA actvities have been substantally developed by the



27
Borrower and are being reviewed by the Association. Bids have been launched using resources
from the PPF for the Procurement Agent.
C.   Environmental Aspects
105.       The project would be consistent with IDA policy and would follow acceptable
IDA procedures. In conformity with IDA policies for adjustment operations, no environmental
rating has been assigned. Nevertheless, in developing procurement procedures for financing
imports under the Credit, specific provisions will be made to ensure that the inclusion of any
toxic or hazardous substances would be under conditions acceptable to the Association.
Furthermore, in the privatization program, environmental audits will be conducted where
pertinent and a legal framework will begin to be developed in order to incoiporate assignment
of environmental liability for past and current environmental damage into the privatization
process.
D. Project Implementation
106.       The State Commission for Foreign Investments and Economic Assistance
(GOSKOMINVESI) is the high level Government organization responsible for coordinating and
implemening the proposed project. GOSKOMINVEST, chaired by the Prime Minister,
coordinates foreign assistance to the Republic. It was created by decree on July 27, 1992, as a
state entity outside the regular strcture of the Government. Its functions cover external
assistance management, aid management, foreign investment facilitation, and prcurement and
audit service. It will serve as a focal point for relations with investors and donors, and as the
official counterpart of all donor agencies operting in Kyrgyzstan, as far as their economic,
financial and technical activities are concerned.
107.       The Project Implementation Unit (PMU) will be under the direction and
rsponsibility of GOSKOMNVEST. The organization of the PIU is described in detail in Amnex
VI. The PIU will be responsible for the overall implementation, procurement and disbursement
of the Rehabilitation Credit and the related reporting and accounting activities of PIC, FXC and
TAC. In these activities, PIU will benefit from the services of the Procurement Agent and the
TAC management consultants (organization and finance). Given the wide scope and importance
of its assigned functions, the PlU has been given the authority and stature to deal direcdy and
effectively with Govemnment ministries and offices, as well as the NBK, and commercial and
correspondent banks and project beneficiaries. The Govemment bas agreed to provide the PMU
with adequate staff, and office space, transport and office furniture for the staff. Equipment for
photocopying, telecommunications (telephone, telex and facsimile) and information systems
(computers and software) will be prvded under TAC. The PU will be requied to provide
extensive support to commercial banks participating in the FXC and TAC, and to provide
guidance in            procedures new to the country and other aspects of project
implementation. As a reslt, it is important that the PIU be exclusively concerned with the



28
Credit during the implementon period and that it not be given additional duties and
responsibilities unlated to the Credit. The main reonsilities of the PIU and details of
implementation arrangements are described in Annex VI.
E    Procurement
AL08.      As imports and procurement in the FSU were coordinated through Moscow, there
has been practically no procrement capacity in Kyrgyztn. An internatonat procurement
agency acceptble to IDA will be contracted to assist the Govemment in the management of
procurement and pre-shipment inspections, and training of the PIU staff will also be provided
in procurement (resources have been mobilized through the PPF to choose this procurement
agency through a tender). The Borrower and the procurement agency wil ensure that
procurement complies with IDA guidelines. Contracts estimated to cost above US$ 300,000
equivalent will be awarded through modified International Competitive Bidding (ICB), using
IDA's standard bidding documents modified to suit the requirements of individual packages.
Contracts costing less than US$ 300,000 equivalent witl be procured through intemational
shopping, based on at least three quotations from two different counties. Limited intemational
bidding winl be used for goods for which there are a limited number of suppliers. Direct
contracting wiln be allowed for proprietary goods and items required for standardizaton. Subject
to the Association's prior approval, commonly traded commodities win be procured through
organized intemational commodity markets or through other channels of competitive
procurement acceptable to the Association in the event that the pre-identified import list is
amended. The necessary prior clearances wil be obtained from the Association forprocurement
of hazardous materials such as agricultural chemicals (herbicides, pesticides, etc.).
109.       To ensure compliance with IDA guidelines, the first two conats for the
prorement of goods through the PIC (including bidding documents) in each sub-sector, all
contract packages awarded under Direct Contracting procedures and aUl conacs (including
bidding documents) over US$ 0.5 million equivalent win be subject to prior review by IDA. All
other concts win be subject to ex-post review. Pre-Shipment inspection win be cared out as
necessay for contacts costing over US$ 300,000 equivalent. Conts win be selected in
accordance with the "Guidelines for the Use of Conts by World Bank Borrowers and by
the World Bank as Execudng Agency" and the evaluation will be based on technical criteria
only. Details of the funcdons of the PIU,    processes under the Credit and a draft
Terms of Rerence for the consultant Procurement Agent are provided in Annex VI.
110.       The proposed procurement arangements for goods and the hiring of consultants
are presnd in Annex VI, Tables A-VI. 1 and A-VI.2. These procurment plans represent best
estimates; precise amounts under each procurement category win be detrmined when the
Procurement Agent identifies bidding packages according to equipment needs and at the time
when the bidding document for each package are prepared. The bidding packages will require
the prior approval of IDA. The estimated aggrgte amounts to be procured under procedures



29
other th  ICB are as follows: LIB: US$ 12 million; Intonal Shopping (IS): US$ 14.5
million; Direct Contacting US$ 0.5 million and TA (consultants' services): US$ 7.0 million.
F.   Disbursement
Ill.       The proceeds of the Credit will finance 99.6 pecent of the project costs or 100
percent of the expenditures on imported items. The Credit wiU also refinance the advance made
under the Project Preaation Facility (PF) No. P193-0 KG. The pmceeds of the Credit are
expected to be fully disbursed for the MC and the FXC within six months from the time of
effectiveness. For the TAC, disbursement will extend over 36 months. The Closing Date for the
Rehabilitation Credit is June 30, 1996. Conttacts costing less than US$ 10,000 under the FXC
and less than US$ 50,000 under the MC will not be eligible for financing under the Credit. To
facilitate the disbursement of MC and TAC, a Specal account (SA) of US$ 5.0 milMion will be
opened in a foreign commercial bank acceptable to IDA. The SA will not be used for FXC,
which will be disbursed on a reimbursement basis. Details of the disbursement processes under
the Credit are provided in Annex VI.
G.   Retroactive Fnancing
112.        The proposed Credit will provide retoactive financing for up to 20 percent of the
sum of the PIC and FXC for imports of goods and services that meet the procurement guidelines
of IDA and which have been imported on or after Febuary 1, 1993.
H. Reporting, Accounting and Auditfng4
113.       The PIU wiU establish and maintain a Management Infonnation System (MS)
covering all procurement financed by the Credit, as follows: (i) under the PIC and the TAC, the
records will include information received on all procrement transactions, including the identity
of the user, the kind of goods and services purchased, the contrct value, identification of the
bidders and the winning supplier, the key dates for the bidding process, and the subsequent
fulfillment of the contract; (ii) for the FXC, the records will include details of the purpose of
the foreign exchange purchased, as per information submitted by the pari ng commercial
banks and imports. The PIU will use this information to prqr proge reports and the
Proect Completdon Report required after the Credit has been disbursed and closed.
114.       The PIU will establish an appropriate accouning system according to generally
accepted standards, in order to provide information on receipt and use of funds, in line with the
terms of the Credit Agreement. The Borrower will pepare annual statements of all receipts and
4     Details of Accng,. Audtidg and ioQrng are provided in Annx VI.



30
payments under the Credit showing the amounts relating to each component and category as
detailed in the Credit Agreement.
115.       Project Accounts (including the Special Accounts) will be audited in accordance
with the March 1992 'Bank Guidelines for Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects fmanced
by the World Bank." The Borrower will arrange for the auditing of all the above financial
statements, in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards, by independent auditors
acceptable to IDA. The Association will be provided by the Borrower the audited statements and
audit report of such scope and detail as the Association may reasonably request, within six
months after the end of each fiscal year of the Borrower. The auditor's report will specifically
refer to the eligible use of IDA's funds in accordance with the Credit Agreement and with IDA's
guidelines.
I.    Agreements Reached
116.        Conditions. The Government's Economic Reform Program has been officially
communicated to IDA in the form of a Memorandum of Economic Reform Policies, referred to
in the Credit Agreement and included as Annex IH to this report.
117.       In addition, at negotiations the following specific agreements were reached with
the Borrower:
a.    GOSKOMINVEST will represent the Government as the Borrower for the
Rehabilitation Credit;
b.   the Government has established the PW under GOSKOMINVEST; staffed and
provided adequate facilities and budgetary resources for the PIU and the
implementation of the project; and has agreed that the PIU be exclusively in
charge of the Rehabilitation Credit, and not be encumbered with other duties and
responsibilities;
c.   the Borrower will hire and authorize a procurement agent to conduct procurement
on behalf of the Borrower,
d.   the Borrower will hire consultants to aid in the management of the TAC and the
consultant's TOR will be reviewed and approved by IDA;
e.   the Borrower has agreed to provide IDA with audited statements and audit reports
of the Project of such scope and detail as IDA may reasonably request, within six
months after the end of each fiscal year of the Borrower;



31
f.    The Borrower has agreed to sign with the NBK a Protocol satisfactoiy to the
Association indicating the predetermined amount and penodicity of the foreign
exchange transfers to NBK for ale at the interbank foreign exchange market;
g.   The Borrower has agreed to establish intermediate targets satisfactoty to the
Association for reducing the share of outstanding loans to shareholders, who own
more than 5 percent of shares individually, to 25 percent by end of 1994;
h.   The Borrower agreed that PIU will enter into implementation agreements with
respective ministers, agencies and the NBK, clearly delineating responsibilities,
identifying counterparts, and indicating actions to be taken.
J.    Benefits
118.       The proposed Credit would allow increased production and capacity utilization
through the provision of resources to fmance critical imports of inputs, raw materials, spare
parts and services. The PIC to be financed by the Credit would help limit further output decline
in priority sectors and also would reduce adverse developments in employment and balance of
payments. The FXC would help to develop an inter-bank market in convertible currency and also
would allow the private sector access to foreign exchange. Technical assistance financed under
the Credit would contribute to the development of capability in economic, financial and technical
management and would reinforce the implementation of the Government's Economic Reform
Program. TA would also contnbute to the restucturing of the Govermment to meet the needs
of a market economy. The Credit has also had the catalytic effect of mobiizing other sources
of financing, particularly through the Consultative Group meeting in December 1992.
Cofinancing on a parallel basis of about US$ 70 million equivalent is expected to be provided
by the Governments of Japan, Netherlands and Switzerland.
K.   Risks
119.       The main risks include the following: (i) substantial institution building is required
to undexpin the key elements of the Reform Program: while this is being advanced with TA to
be provided under the Credit as well as by other donors, slippage in financing and organizng
the TA activities might reslt in delays in the implementation of the Reform Program; (li)
underfinancing of the external requirements might slow down the implementation of the
Economic Reform Program of the Government and increase the resistance by conservative
elements, jeopardizing the Program; and (iii) lack of familiarity and experience in working with
IDA procuremunt, accounting and disbursement procedures might cause difficulties. The risks
under (i) and (iii) are being addressed with a core TA program which is already under way with
resources from the Trust Funds established under the TCA, and the Project Preparation Facility.
In addition to these provided under the Credit, additional resources to finance TA, particularly
grant funds, are being provided by other donors. Finally, the Bank took the lead in organizing



32
the Consultative Group meedng and a subsequent pledging session to help robiUze resours
to counter the risks under (ii).
IV. RECOMMENDATION
120.        I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Intemational Development Association and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.

REPUBLIC OF KYRGYZSTAN
MIEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC REFORM POLICIES
Kyrgyzstan has embarked on a comprehensive reform program to transform its
centrally planned economy to a market economy. The key objectives of the reform progam are:
(i) to stabilize the economy, which has been severely affected by the disintegration of the Soviet
Union; and (ii) to undertake extensive structural reform to create the conditions for long-term
growth in an economy increasingly integrated with the world economy.
The transition to a market based economy will not be easy, even in the best of
circumstances. Output has already declined substantially since 1990 and will continue to do so
as the economy of Kyrgyzstan adjusts to new conditions. Inflation was 85 percent in 1991 and
consumer pnces have already increased by 855 percent in 1992. These transitional costs are
specially difficult to bear at a time when our society is establishing a democratic Government
with new political and administrative structures.
The year 1992 was an extremely difficult one for Kyrgyzstan. Industrial
production, which accounted for 45 percent of Net Material Product (NMP) in 1991, declined
by about 27 percent in 1992. This decline is expected to continue as inter-republican tlade is
constrained by access to credit in Russia and oil prices continue to increase, affecting the terms
of trade adversely. Public investment has fallen shaiply as a consequence of the tight fiscal
situation and to date, there is only limited expansion in the private sector. Agricultural output
growth was flat in 1992; grain production increased owing to favorable weather conditions while
the performance of other crops was variable owing to downward adjustments in area and output.
Overall output in 1992 fell by 24 percent compared with a decline of 3.9 percent in 1991.
While the severe cash shortage experienced in the first half of 1992 has now been
alleviated, the restriction on credit with Russia has resulted in most trade now being undertaken
through barter arrangements. This has put additional pressure on the economy which is heavily
integrated with Russia. The instability of the Ruble has similarly reslted in nearly all trade
outside the Ruble area occurring through barter. The falling output, increased reliance on barter
trade, and acceleration in inflation have caused shortfalls in fiscal revenues. The budget problem
is exacerbated by the ending of grants from the Union and the uncertainty of financing sources.
The lack of foreign exchange to finance critical imports aggravates the output implications of
this financial plight.

Anm
page 4 of 12
In spite of these difficult circumstances, the Government of Kyrgyzstan is
committed to implementing the necessary measures to successfully support the transition to a
market economy. At the beginning of 1992 the Government took several measures to initiate this
transition. These were wide ranging and covered: (i) price liberalization; (ii) revenue and
expenditure measures to decrease the fiscal imbalance; (iii) adoption of a new legislative
framework, more appropriate for promoting private sector development; and (iv) initiation of
privatization in most sectors of the economy. In late 1992 the Government took several
additional measures. These include: (i) parliamentary approval of the Concept Note on
Privatization and the Banking Law; (ii) liberalization of rents on privatized housing; (iii) removal
of all barriers to private entty into competition with state operations in agriculture; (iv)
elimination of input subsidies in agriculture; and (v) approval of the first drft of Constitution,
which stipulates private ownership including land ownership. The nascent private sector activities
in production and trade and the establishment of commodity exchanges are visible positive signs
of the Government's reform policies.
The economic program outlined in this Memorandum of Economic Reforn Pol}cies
has been designed to support the implementation of this reform program. First, the Memorandum
briefly reviews the program aimed at the financial stabilization of the economy. As was
mentioned above, this is one of the key objectives of the reform that the Government of
Kyrgyzstan has embarked upon. A fuller discussion of our program in these areas can be found
in the Memorandum that we have submitted to the International Monetary Fund. This
Memorandwn focuses on the second key objective: building the conditions and institutions for
long-term growth in an economy increasingly integrated with the world economy.
Five areas of systemic change or strcural adjustment are covered. The first is
eniteprise reform, including privaization and corporatization, and dismanding the system of
state intervention. Second, the steps that need to be taken to create a more competitive
environment where the private sector can develop, in agricultural, industrial and commercial
activities. Third, given the sector's importance to the economy, issues of agricultural sector
reform are discussed. Fourth, the main areas for fmancial sector reform and the requirements
for the commercial banking sector are discussed. The Memorandum concludes with a discussion
of social protection: what the Government has already undertaken and the future needs,
consistent with sound fiscal management, to strengthen the social safety net during the transition
period in which substantial increases in unemployment seem inevitable.
Prices, Macroeconomic Mae agement and External Economic Relations
In January 1992, a wide ranging price reform was introduced in tandem with the
beralization measures implemeLted in the FSU. Most of the consumer and producer prices were
liberalized, and those remaining under Government control were raised by factors ranging
between 3 and 11. All limits on profit margins were abolished, but monopolistic enterprises were



40
Annex m
page 5 of 12
required to consult with the Pricing and Antimonopoly Committee on pricing decisions to
prevent abuse of monopolistic power. The Government's policy is to fiuther limit the number
of goods and services subject to price controls and reduce subsidies. At the producer level, price
controls, without entailing any subsidization, wiU stay limited to energy and oil products,
precious metals and strategic minerals, to prevent the abuse of monopolistic power. Utilities,
public transport, housing rents and communications services wiUl also remain subject to regulated
prices and partial, but declining, subsidies. On the retail level, price controls will be limited to
only low quality bread, and well tageted subsidies will remain only on milk for children and
lactaig mothers, and on coal ditributed to low income groups during winter.
The Govermnent fully recognizes the importance of stabilizing the macroeconomic
situation in containing the decline in output and eventually embaring on a sustainable growth
path. The experience in 1992 has proven that, as a small state in the Ruble area, Kyrgyzstan
would not be able to pursue an independent macroeconomic policy, and thus isolate its economy
from the instbility in the rest of the Ruble area, unless it introduces a separate currency and
then maintains the credibility and the value of the national currency through pmident fiscal,
monetary and incomes policies. Therefore, the Government has decided to introduce the national
currency, Som, in early 1993. It has worked out, in collaboration with the Intemational
Monetary Fund, measures to reduce the budget deficit from 17 percent of GDP in 1992 to 7
percent in 1993, to eliminate money financing of the budget deficit, and to limit domestic credit
expansion after the introduction of the national currency. It has decided to eliminate all targeted
and subsidized credits from the financial system, including the National Bank of Kyrgyzstan, and
to channel any such financial support through the budget. The Government is also committed
to adopt a restrictive wage policy for the public sector in line with the projected decline in real
national income and the scarcity of fiscal resources, and to reduce budgetary transfers to the
enteiprise sector as well as the household sector. A detailed discussion of our macroeconomic
policies is provided in the Memorandum we have submitted to the Intrnational Monetary Fund.
The Government recognizes the positive role of an open external trade and liberal foreign
exchange regimes in fosering a more efficient resource allocation, eliminating supply shortages,
and introducing a rational relative pnce strucure. Given the dominance of economic relations
with the FSU states, the Government's intention is to take all possible measures to establish
muully beneficial economic reltions with other FSU states based on multilateral trade and
payment arrangements, to eliminate trade disnrtions, and to promote direct trade relations
between enteprises. However, given the current difficulties in achieving these objectives, the
Government has signed bilaeal trade and credit agreements with its major tring partners,
such as Russia, Bela-is, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan, so as to prevent further declines in inter-
republican trade. Regarding relations with non-FSU countries, given the currently limited export
potential, Kyrgyzstan's imports in the coming years will be determined by the amount of
exel financing expected to be provided by the intenaional donor community through the
Consulaive Group mechanism. The Government also recognizes the importance of a liberl
foreign exchange regime in promoting exports to and increasing imports from the non-FSU area.

It is committd to eliminat all reticdons on current account tansactions, and keep such
restiction to a minimum on capital account transactions. It has difted a liberal foreign exchange
law which is expected to be passed by Parliament before the introduction of the national
curency.
Enterprise Reform
The reform of public enteprnses constitutes a fundamenall element of systemic
change. The Government intends to undertake enterpQise reforms in three main areas. First,
there will be quick privatization of small enterprises at the local level and the implementation
of a program for the privaization of medium and large enterprises. Second, improved corporate
govenance will be implemented for those medium and large state owned entrises (SE) which
are exected to remain in the public sector in the medium or long-term. Fancial support to
entises will be conditional on their restructuring efforts and measures will be taken to bring
all SE under strict financial discipline. Finally, state intervention in the commercial decisions
of enterprises wil be stopped. Ths will be achieved primarily by the elmination of the State
Order system and the controls over the input, service and output distition system. In the State
Order system, the stat required deliveries of specified quantities of products at prices
deermined by the state. In an interim period, the    ents of the State wiU be managed
through the State Purbases system, where prices are negodated between the suppliers and the
state agency in charge. (See below on State Purchases and Stae Orders.)
Priatizaon Prorm
In early 1991, the Government designed a program for coporatization and
pivazion. The first phase of the program focuses on establishing the principles of ownership
of all state property, an adminisative fiamework for the delegation of ownership rights, and
the privaon of small-scale industrial and agricultur enterprises and most small shops, trade
and service establishments. The second phase is inended to focus on the privatizaion of medium
and large entewrises. In December 1992, the Parliament adopted a resolution on new Concept
Note on Privaizaion which enviages rapid pion of small entrs  mainly through
auctions, and three princpal methods of privatizing medium-size and large enteWises, with
varying roles played by voucher holders, employees, the National Enpreneurs Fund and other
investors. It also envisages special forms of privatzation for specific sectors. Contract
management and the. formaion of holding companes under the State Property Fund (SPF) are
among the meaus provided to impzove the governance of the still non-privadzed firms.
Wlde-ranging decrees on ptiton and the creaton of joint ventures were
approved by Paliment in 1991 and 1992. The allocation of legl authority to the SPF to
exercise ownehip rights in all the properties of the Republic has been implemend in order



42
Annex m
page 7 of 12
to clarify ownership and management responsibility. The authority of the SPF in exercising the
state's rights on property was further strengthened by a law approved by the Parliament in July
1992. The SPF will retain a significant degree of independence from the branch ministries that
exercised the State's ownership role in the past but should now regulate their sectors independent
of the State's ownership. Moreover, the SPF will have an adequate fmancial allocation from the
national budget to exercise its functions.
As of the end of January 1993, privatization has been extended to 2,299
enteIprises of which 1,984 were in the service and trade sectors. Trais amoun!s to the transfer
to the private sector of around 10.2 percent of the total fixed assets formerly in the state
enterprise sector. It is the Government's intention to accelerate the privatization of the SE which
will not remain in state hands. By the end of 1993, the aim is to privatize 35 percent of SE fixed
assets, valued at 11.2 billion rubles in 1991 prices, and to privatize a further 35 percent by the
end of 1996. In each year, sale or transfer of the majority shares to the employees of medium
and large scale enterprises in the non-agricultural sectors shall not account for more than 20
percent of fixed assets in these sectors. Privatization will not only pursue these quantitative goals
but will also be oriented toward creating ownership structure that enhance effective governance,
ensuring competition between potential investors and - it giving preferential treatment to
employee collectives for their acquisition of a controlling or higher share of an enterprise.
Privatization of many large industrial enterprises will be preceded by their
rganizaion and segmentation into smaller components. Detailed procedures and legislation
for the further refinement and implementation of the Concept Note on Privatizadon together with
a timetable for the inplementation of the new privatization strategy are being elaborated. The
privatization program in housing will be initiated by providing citizens with a one time lump sum
payment for purchase of homes. All rent controls on privafized housing have been removed. In
order to support the success of housing privatizadon, the Government has agreed to prepare a
timetable for increasing public housing rents which includes an increase of a minimum tenfold
by mid-1993 in close coordination with the increases in Government wages. The Government
has also planned full recovery of operation and maintenance costs of public housing by the end
of 1993. The Government will review land privatization, and legal ownership rights to land
attached to prpetty being privatized will be clarified (see section on Agriculture below).
Improved Corporate Governance of Large Enterprises
The Government has already established a Working Group to strengthen corporate
governance for those SE expected to remain in the public sector. Boards of directors will be
appointed, and incenfives and accounting systems will be spelled out. An action plan will be
completed by June 1993 and its implementation in selected large enterprises will start by
July 1993.

Elimination of State Orders and State Purchases
As price controls are eliminated, State Orders and State Purchases for SE in
industry will be reduced and will be eliminated by the end of July 1993 (also see section on
Agriculture below). Given that Kyrgyzstan is an economy in transition, where information is not
as widely available as in market economies, the state trading agencies will continue to offer
services on a commercial and voluntary basis. In other words, enterprises will not have to sell
to or buy from the Government and the Government will not be forced to provide inputs or buy
output from the enterprise. Purchases for Govenmment consumption (military, hospitals, etc.) are
now conducted at market pnces through competitive procedures, and legislation on nrles and
regulations for public procurement on all categories of goods is to be developed by June 1993.
All legal and institutional barriers to private entry into competition with state operations have
been removed.
Competition and Private Sector Development
The Economic Reform Program gives specal attention to promoting competition
in both production and distribution in order to support private sector development. To this end,
numerous laws and decrees have been enacted aimed at the development of a market economy.
These measures have recognized rights in private property and business activity, have established
the legal basis for the banking system and privatization, have simplified regulation procdures
for new enterprises, and have facilitated the growth of commodity exchanges, and they include
a foreign investment law and a law on concessions through which the state can lease property,
including mineral rights.
The Government will ensure the implementation of judicial reforms in a fair,
tansparent and consistent manner. Moreover, it intends to pursue other reforms to ensure
consistency among laws and to complement actions already taken. The new reforms include: (i)
expanding ownership and property rights; (ii) enacting commercial legislation on contacts,
bankruptcy and liquidation procedures, secured transactions and the registration of ownership
in real and intellectual property; and (iii) identifying and eliminating the obstacles to the
formation of new enterprises and eradicating the abuse of monopoly power through reglation
or the breaking up of amalgams into competing enterprises. The bulk of these legal reforms and
a set of legislation facilitting private sector development are expected to be presented to
Parliament before mid-1993. A foreign investment commission was created in September 1992
and a one stop foreign investment processing and licensing system and agency will be established
by June 1993.
The Government recognizes the importance of demonopolizotion to promote
competition and efficiency. An Antimonopoly Committee (AMC) has been established, is already
working on these issues and will conduct a comprehensive review of the regulatory obstacles to



44
page 9 of 12
the entry and exit of firms as well as, more generally, the obstacles to new entepdse formation.
An action program will be finalized by June 1993 and concrete progress in its implementation
will be acdhieved by September 1993. Given the urgency of ensuring competition at this stage,
the AMC will concentrate its work on breaking up monopolistic firms into competing
enterprises, especially in trade and transport, and on regulating monopoly power.
Agriculture
The dissolution of former Soviet trade relations has caused disruptions in
agricultur  production, input and output marketing and distrbution and processing. The
Government initiated a liberlization program in agriculture in March 1991, covering increases
in farmgate prices for agricultural commodities, and in eady 1992, increased prices for farm
equipment and inputs. In April 1992, the Government initiated an agricultral program through
a Presidential Decree that increased input and output subsidies and reinstated physical controls
in the allocation of inputs and output. Wbile the intention was to stimulate the agricultural sector
and promote import substuton, these decisions have been reconsidered. In particular, it was
felt that the lack of financial resources to support this program may have adverse consequences
in raising expectations. This program has been explicitly rescinded following the approval of the
Economic Reform Program by the Govermment and the Parliament. A medium-term agricultural
stategy that will induce efficient and profitable agricultural producdton will be developeu. The
following are some of the salient feates of the initial actions in this context.
State Ords  in aricultre have been reduced substantially and State Purchases
with negotiated prices have been itoduced for some commodities. State Orders and State
Purchases on food products except grains have been eliminated and State Orders and State
Purchases for grains, wool, tobacco and cotton will be elimintd by December 1993. Until the
remaining State Orders and State Purchases on grain, wool, tobacco and coton are compltely
phased out by Decemnber 1993, pnvate and public sector use of the state trading agencies will
be allwed on a commercial and voluntry basis (e.g., charges and commissions to cover
opeion costs). Subsequentdy, such agencies will be restricted to state procurement only. All
legal and institutional barriers to private entry into competition with state operations in
agriclte (input, outut and services) have been removed.
A law on private ownesip explicitly allowing private sector oeatiop s in
agricultural iput and output markdeting (wholesale and retail), tan on and distribution,
imports and exports, storage, pruction and processing has been adopted. All policies and
procedues favoring the public sectr in the allocation of goods and services and all delivery
quotas, physical input allocations and actal sales or purchases by the swte or its agents for these
purposes have been eliminated with a view to reducing the role of the state in these areas.

Ann=m
pae 10 of 12
The privatization program in agiculture will continue, with due consideration to
social conditions. The Govermsent bas been reviewing the limited experience with long-term
leases with rights of inheritance. Owing to social problems, imple ton of the program was
slowed down in some areas. The Government intends to accelerate this program and three
alternative drafts of legislation have been prepared and submitted to the Parliament allowing
transferability, inheritance, sale, rental (for cash or in kind) and collateral use of land lease
rights.
The present structure of crop and livestock production and agroprocessing is based
on the trade relations of the former Soviet Union. A medium-term program will be developed,
based on a study of agriculural policies to be completed by September 1993. The transition will
be managed carefully to ensure that the current and future terms of trade shocks do not affect
the profitability of operations in a drastically adverse manner so as to cause a collapse of tbe
sector. This program will involve interventions in the sector through policies based on the results
of the agricultural policies study. Input subsidies covering chemical inputs, fertilizer, seeds,
equipment, energy and water, except for credit, have been eliminated. Credit subsidies will be
eliminated when the new currency is introduced. In the future, all subsidies will be financed
through the budget, where they wil appear as explicit and tansrent line items. Furthermore,
such interventions wiU not be through direct purchases or sales but through fiscal interventions
(such as compensation payments) based on the agricultual policies study through which the
program will be developed.
A medium-term program has been developed for the transformation of the
remaining State and Collective Farms into private corporate entities or private farms, no longer
depending on the Government for adminiion, salaries, provision of goods and services, etc.
An inventory of the current and proposed public investment projects in the
agricultunal sector, including irrigation projects, will be completed by June 1993, indicating the
stage of development and remaining works to be undertaken. A study wil be conducted and
finished by September 1993, aessng the technical and economic feasibility of these projects
according to internatonal standards and prices. Subsequently, the public investment program in
agriculture will be based on the results of this study and will focus on inffituctual investments
and leave investments in productive capacity to the private sector. In particular, investment in
social faciLities in state and collective farms and numl areas will be suspended.
In irrigation, a system of water charges to cover operation and maintnance costs
was introduced on December 15, 1992 and the Goverment intends to adjust water charges for
inflation. Water user associations will be encouraged and a Govenment resolution has been
prpared for their organization.

Fhnancdal Sector Reforms
The Government wants to ensure that Kyrgyzstan has a solid and efficient
financial system. To this end, institution building and other measures will be implemented in the
near future.
A new Banking Law, introducing prudential regulation and a supervision system
was approved by the Parliament in December 1992. Modern accounting and auditing standards
are necessary for the expansion of financial intermediation and will be introduced by December
1993. Bans are required to increase capital requirements (commercial banks and banks with
foreign participation, to 150 million rubles; limited liability banks to 100 million rubles and
private banks to 50 million iubles) by April 1, 1993, and these requirements will be reviewed
on a regular basis and changed according to developments. In December 1992, loans provided
to individ-cl shareholders/founders were reduced to 20 percent of capital. Exposure limits on
individual borrowers were reduced from 50 to 40 percent of capital and reserves in December
1992. New banks ar required to comply with these rues while existing banks will be required
to comply by September 1993. Furthenmore, loans to all shareholders/founders owning more
than 5 percent of shares individually wil be reduced to a total of less than 25 percent of the
outstanding loans by the end of 1994, with intermediate targets to be agreed upon between the
Government and the Association.
Given the importance of competition for financial intermediation, a draft of a
study on the necessary measures to increase competition among banks will be ready by
June 1993 and initial measures will be implemented by September 1993. By July 1993, plans
for special institutional arrangements and procedures to deal with overdue debts of enterprises
will be elaboratd in detail, and initial implementation steps will be taken by August 1993. Any
relief on enterprises from major overdue debt will be tied to strict requirements of privatzation
or restructuring subject to the plans elaborated in July 1993.
To facilitate the opening of the economy to intemational markets, the banking
sector is encouraged to increase its foreign exchange operations. Autoized banks are now
allowed to establish foreign exchange bureaus and banks are allowed to hold foreign exchange
positions.
Finally, in order to facilitate competition and efficiency in capital markets, all
credit subsidies, particularly those implemented through differential interest rates or interest rates
lower than the NBK rediscount rate, will be removed by when the new currency is introduced.
In order to put monetary policy on a sound base and promote savings, positive real interest rates
will be achieved and maintained as inflation is brought down to a moderate level.

Social Safety Net
The Government of Kyrgyzstan is aware that social investment and expenditures
will need to be reconsidered in these difficult times, and refocused on those families that are
more vulnerable to or most affected by output decline, unemployment, and inflation. There are
also structural measures which can ease the difficulties in the transition.
A poverty (subsistence) line will be defined as soon as possible, but not later than
the end of 1993, in order to have a threshold with which to estimate the minimum income
required for subsistence. A methodology will be agreed on to estimate this line as well as to
defend it from inflation. The poverty line will be used as a criterion for targeting the social
safety net and Govement social assistance.
Pensions and family allowances will be revised to reduce them to affordable levels
and target them to the poorest families. Pensions above the minimum will not be fully protected
from inflation until the budgetay situation permits. The Government will propose legislation by
June 1993 to reform the funding and expense obligations of the Pension Fund to make it
financially viable.
The anticipated drop in output will aggravate unemployment in the short to
medium-term. The Government is ready to take measures on several fronts in order to mitigate
the impact of unemployment on vulnerable families. This will be implemented through income
compensation and helping labor mobility through eliminatng the effect of "propiska" on
employment. For this puipose, the Government will prepare and submit to the Parliament draft
legislation on amending laws to eliminate the "propiska" requirement for employment and
provision of social services. To increase the efficiency of the labor market, job guarantees will
be eliminated and active labor maiet policies will be implemented to retrain and offer
employment services by June 1993.

REPUBLIC OF KYRGYZSTAN
REHABLIATION CREDIT
ANNEX V: TECINCAL ASSISTANCE COMPONENT (TAC)
Introduction
1.         In implementing both its Economic Reform Program and the Rehabilitation Credit, the
Government of Kyrgyzstan will need to develop strategies, execute studies, devise legislation, implement
specific programs and carry out procurement. In these activities, Kyrgyzstan will need technical
assistance (TA) in many areas such as economic and financial analyses, agriculure, macroeconomic
management:, privatization and private sector development. Resources have already been mobilized
under the World Bank Trust Fund whereby a program under the Technical Cooperation Agreement
(TCA) between the Government of Kyzstan and the Association is currenty under advanced
implementation. lTis program covers the areas of the banking sector, pnrvatization and pAvate sector
development and the social safety net as well as the preparatory economic work for bank membership.
Several renorts have been produced, including the CEM, under the TCA and activities have been
inited that will be followed up under TAC. Through the Consultative Group meeting, additional
resources have been mobilized from other donors.
2.   Technical assistance will be provided to the SPF and the AMC in the areas of privatization,
enterprise governance, enterprise restrmcturing/liquidation and competition policy. In the financial
sector, TA will be provided to (i) develop an approach and procedures that are suitable for auditing
commercial banks during the transition of the economy and the financial systems, and (ii) to carry out,
as a pilot exercise, audits of two large commercial banks. For the mining sector, the TA is designed
to aid the Government to establish an enablint environment to promote efficient production operations
under market economy conditions which will be conducive to new investment. Technical assistance in
the area of social safety net will focus on key aspects of the health sector, emphasizing the critical areas
of pharmaceutical policy and health facility restuctuing. Development and implementtion of policy
change, and privatization of production and production factors, particularly land privatiation, in the
agriculture sector would be supported by detailed studies to be caried out under the TA program.
3.          This Annex summarizes the Technical Assistance Component (TAC) of the Rhabilitation
Credit and highlights the core TA activities, which are defined as those that are closely linked to the
Government's Economic Reform Program and that serve the development of policies, legislation and
implemenation under the Program. Total resources allocated to the core TA program under the
Rehabilitation Credit are US$ 7 milion equivalent (12 percent of the Credit).

Flnterprise Reform, Privatiation and Private Sedor Development
4.          Privatization, Eneiprse  Governance. lnerse -estructuring uidation  and
Consolidation Policy. Kyrgyzstan has made a firm commitment to establish a market economy and has
focused on systemic reforms to accomplish its goals. To demonstrate its commitment, it has begun a
legislative progmam to create the legal frmework for a private sector; a detailed program has Lsen
adopted providing for the privatization of 35 percent of enterprise fixed assets by the end of 1993 and
another 35 percent by 1996; enterprises not privatized are to be reorganized to operate on a commercial
basis; and a program for demonopolization and the encouragement of competition through the
development of new enterprises has commenced. Not surprisingly, the capacity to implement many of
these reforms is severely limited owing to a lack of experienced personnel, and there are numerous
constramnts arising f*om an uncertain property rights regime, the absence of clear commercial laws and
resistance from those with vested interests in the status quo. The two institutions charged with
undertaing many of the reforms, the State Property Fund (SPF) and the Antimonopoly Committee
(AMC), have requested TA for their programs and for the improvement of the regulatory and
administrative environment for the emerging private sector. There is an immediate need to address these
requests to maintain the momentum and enthusiasm for reform and to have the greatest and most
efficient impact at a time when much of legislation and reform program design are being drfted.
5.          The objective is to provide TA to the SPF and the AMC in the areas of privatization,
enterprise governance, enterprise restrcturitg/liquidation and competition policy. This TA would be
provided through help in drAffing and reviewing relevant legislation; designing strategies and
implementation mechanisms; carrying out pilot transactions; and strengthening institutions and skills.
The scope of the TA would involve the provision of assistance (until March 1995) to the SPF and AMC
through the placement of four long-term advisers in Bishkek, several short-term interventions through
specialist missions, and training of local staff outside Kyrgyzstan, mainly through guided study tours
on particular subjects.
6.          The long-term advisers would include a senior adviser in charge of team coordination,
overall privatization policy, and the privatization of medium and large firms; a mass privatization expert
focusing on issues related to vouchers, investment funds, share auctions, etc.; a legal expert providing
advice on pertinent legislation, model contacts and statutes, individual privafization documents
including contacts, etc.; and a competition policy expert dealing with antimonopoly policy but also with
further constrnts to private sector development, especially to market entry and exit. One set of
specialist missions would concentate on issues of entewrise governance, including a database and
regular reporting system on all state enterprises, revaluation of enterprise assets and capital,
coipoatizaion, establishment of diversified holding companies removed from the branch ministries,
mechanisms of financial supervision of state enterprises, etc. Another set of short-term missions would
deal with problems related to insolvent state enterprises, in particular with the detailed planning of
institutional and procedual arrangements for handling such enterprises, the assessment of their viability,
their financial and organizational restrctuing, and their possible liquidation. A third group of missions
would support small-scale privatization; it is here presumed that further assistance in this area will be



54
wAnnexV
page 3 of 15
provided from other sources. Public information will benefit from short-term assistance as well.
Training would include, among other forms, study tours on state enterpnse governance (including
supervision, corporatization, holding companies), on enteiprise restmcturing and liquidation, and on
privatization. Each study tour would consist of three to five local policy makers and staff and one
foreign expert, and would visit two to three countries mainly in Eastern and Western Europe.
Equipment would be provided as early as possible, and would include mainly facsimile machines,
computers, photocopiers, printers and other office equipment for SPF, AMC, and their territorial
branches.
7.          Counterparts and Reports. The main counterpart for these TA activities is the State
Property Fund. However, the Anti-monopoly Committee will be involved in the competition policy
component and the Ministry of Economy and Finance will be involved in the financial arrangements for
the State Entexprises under rstructuring. The output from the TA activities will include an Inception
Report outlining the approaches and the implemention program; bi-montly progress reports; informal
reports on a variety of specific issues; draft legislation, statutes, guidelines, etc.; and a Final Repoit at
the completion of the work program. These reports and the Final Report will form the basis of
discussions between the Association and the Borrower, with the participation of the consultants if
necessary, and eventual agreements on implementation of the recommendations.
8.         Privatization in Agriculture. This TA activity is discussed below under Agriculture and
enils a budget of US$ 600,000.
9.          Mning Policy and Legislation. This program is intended to help the Kyrgyzstan
Government establish an enabling environment which will promote efficient production operations under
market economy conditions and which will be conducive to new investment. It is recognized that
Kyrgyzstan's mineral endowment can provide the tax revenues and export earnings for sustainable
development. To realize this potential the sector should be opened to new capital, technology, and
international market expertise offered by private local and foreign investors. The technical assistance
program is composed of two interrelated projects: mineral sector development policies and mining
legislation, including regulations and model investment agreements.
10.        Project 1: Mining Development Policies Statement. The objective of this project is to
prepare a "Statement of Principles and Policies" with respect to mining and metafluiical sector
activities in Kyrgyzstan. This sttement will then serve as the guideline for further work specifically on
the mining legislation. The Consultants will assist in the identification of the key sector issues, and
inform the Government about how similar issues are addressed in other countries. Some of the relevant
issues are:
a.    The nature of the international mining industry: lare and small companies, commodities
markets, economic and financial evaluation of projects and ore-bodies (gold).



55
Annex V
page 4 of 15
b.    The position and competitiveness of the Kyrgyzstan mining and metallurgical sector with
repect to the local economy, inter-republican economy, international economy.
c.    Mining rights: policies, instnrments, institutional implications.
d.    The role of the state institutions in promoting, regulating, and monitoring developments
in the sector.
e.    The fundamentals of mine project assessment.
f.    National, regional and municipal jurisdiction over natural resources.
g.    Private and foreign ownership of producing facilities and access to mining titles;
h.    Environmental issues associated with mining, including environmental audits and
environmental liability.
i.    The layout of legislation and limits to government discretionary authority.
j.    The spin-off effects of mining and metallurgy on other economic sectors, including
employment, tax and export reserves.
11.          Pject 2. Mineral Deoment Legzslaion. The objective of this project is to assist the
Goverment in preparing mining legislaton and regulatons, and a model investment agreement which
will provide acceptable and atractive investment conditions for prospective investors while adequately
procting the intrests of the Government. A law on sub-soil resources is to be considered by
Parliament shortly, which elaborates some of the basic principles that are common to mining codes and
legislation in other countries with significant mining industries. However, many of the principles and
concepts of the law need to be defined, clarified, and/or further specified in order to provide a firm
legal basis for investment in the sector. This wil entail the prepration of a new law specific to the
mining sector that wiU be of equal standing, but will not conflict with, the proposed law on sub-soil
resources.
12.         Building upon the 'Statement of Principles and Policies," the Consultants will assist
Kyrgyzstan authorities to (i) examine the proposed law on sub-soil resources, determine its consistency
with intemational practice and recommend any amendments on clarifications; (ii) prepare clear and
concise implementing regulations; (iii) establish procedures for implementing the law and regulations;
and (iv) prepare a model mining investment agreement. The wori should fully address, among other
topics, the following:
a.    Ownership of minerals
b.    Administrative jurisdiction of mineral rights



56
Annex Y
page 5 of 15
c.    Exploration rights
d.   Exploitation rights
e.    Small-scale mining
f.    Access to land and resources located thereon
g.    Storage, transport, marketing and export of minerals
h.   Processing of minerals
i.    Environmental protection and liability
j.    Dispute resolution
k.   Offenses and penalties
1.    Adminirative provisions
13.        Countes and Reports. The main counterpart for these TA activities is the Mining
Agency. The output from the TA activities will include an Inception Report outlining the approaches
and the implementation program; bi-monthly progress reports; informal reports on a variety of specific
issues; draft legislation, statutes, guidelines, etc.; and a Final Report at the completion of the work
program. These reports and the Final Report will form the basis of discussions between the Association
and the Borrower, with the participation of the consultants if necessary, and eventual agreements on
implementation of the recommendations.
14.        Leal Reform Cordination and InsXtiton Building. Apart from the various specific areas
in which TA will be required to develop and implement the legal aspects of the reform activities
(privatizafion, coiporate governance, accounting, the financial sector, mining legislation), there is an
urgent need to develop an overall legal reform program and to coordinate the legal reform activities in
the various sectors of the economy. The transition from a command to a market economy will require
substantial changes in the legal and institutional framework governing economic activities in Kyrgyzstan.
Sustainable development and, in particular, increased private sector development can only be achieved
if an appropriate legal system is put in place - a system based on comprehensive objective rules, which
are actally appLed, and on functioning institutions, which ensure the proper application of such rules.
The challenge for the Government is to review and analyze the existing legal and institutional
framework and to reform and adjust it in parallel to the political and economic reform measures already
implemented or planned by the Govemment. In order to stegthen the Goverrment's capacity to carry
out such a comprehensive legal reform program, this TA component would support the establishment
and operation of a Central Legal Reform Unit. This unit should (i) be placed within the Central
Government with appropriate links to both the Parliament and the economic reform group in the
President's Office; (ii) coordinate all legal reform activities within the various sectors of the economy;
(iii) make use of the indigenous legal expertise, including that in the private sector, and (iv) serve as
liaison vis-a-vis inteested donors involved in separate legal TA activities. The Central Lg  Reform
Unit would be supported by a Resident Legal Adviser and would receive logistical support (computer,
office equipment) as well as a basic set of intemational legal materials and law books. Funds would also
be provided for in-country training and overseas study tours for its staff. The total cost of the TA under
this heading would be US$ 950,000, of which US$ 250,000 would come from the Rehabilitation Credit
and the balance from interested donors. Because of the critical importance of the legal reform program



57
Annex V
page 6 of 15
to Kyrgyzstn's transition towards a market economy, the TA for the Legal Reform Coordination and
Institution Building is considered core TA.
15.        Coun=Mp      and RBo. The main countexpart for these TA activities is the Ministry
of Justice. The output from the TA activities will include an Inception Report outlining the approaches
and the implementation program; bi-monthly progress reports; informal reports on a vanety of specific
issues; draft legislation, statutes, guidelines, etc.; and a Final Report at the completion of the work
program. These reports and the Final Report will form the basis of discussions between the Association
and the Borrower, with the participation of the consultants if necessary, and eventual agreements on
implementation of the recommendations.
16.        Promotion of the Refod=  Activities. The reform process will entail many positive
developments that need to be publicized. Legislative and policy developments have to be communicated
to the public and the business community in a clear and expeditious manner. There will also be adverse
developments for some in the short to medium-term that will need to be explained and justified, and the
measurs to buffer these adverse developments will need to be clarified. Traditional communication
devices for public announcements, such as the publication of official texts in newspapers or the
broadcasting of announcements on radio or television, will not be fully effective in extending the spirit
of reform and mobilizing public support. Instead, publicity campaigns, using both established and new
channels of communication, will be needed to increase public knowledge regarding the reforms and,
thereby, to gain public sUppOrt for them in due course. A TA budget of US$ 250,000 is allocated for
this purpose, to be used for advisers in public relations, media experts, public opinion polls, etc.
17.        COuMW       and Rcta. The main counterpart for these TA activities is the State
Commission for Foreign Investments and Economic Assistance. The output from the TA activities will
include an Incepton Report oudining the approaches and the implementation program; designs for TV,
radio and other media programs; bi-monthly progress repoits. These reports and the Final Report wil
form the basis of discussions between the Association and the Borrower, with the participation of the
consultants if necessary, and eventua agreements on implementation of the recommendations.
18.        The total cost of the TA under the heading of Enteprise Reform, Privatization and
Private Sector Development would be US$ 3.85 million, of which US$ 300,000 has already been
ptovided under the TCA with Trust Fund resources, and US$ 3.55 million from the Rehabilitation
Credit. in view of their critical importance to the Government's Economic Refonn Program, the TA
for Enterprise Reform and Privatization TA activities are considered core TA. The consultants wil be
provided with (im addition to the resources speled out under the "Responsibiliies of the Borrower," in
the President's Report and Annex VI) secretarial assistance, interpreters, office space and equipment
as available.

Financal Sector
19.        Audits of Commerci Banks. The rapid improvement of bank supervision is critical to
the restfucturing and sound development of the commercial banking sector. One important aspect in this
regard is the audit of commercial banks. TA will be provided to (i) develop an approach and procedures
that are suitable for auditing commercial banks in Kyrgyzstan during the transition of the economy and
the financial system, and (ii) carry out, as a pilot exercise, audits of two large commercial banks. It is
recommended that the Promstroibank and the Kyrgyzstan Bank be selected for those pilot audits. The
TA would start as soon as possible, should take no more than six months to complete, and is estimated
to cost US$ 400,000.
20.        Commercial Bking. Associated with the financial sector, and specifilcally the
procurement activities, is the critical importance of the commercial banks for the Foreign Exchange
Market component (FXC) of the Rehabilitation Credit. The commercial banks of Kyrgyzstan are young
banks with practicaUy no experience in commercial banking practices. Most of the trade operations in
the past were made on a barter system within the Soviet republics; for imported goods, Moscow handled
all the operations and Moscow state banks were the intermediaries with international commercial banks.
There are only a few banks in Kvrgyzstan that are licensed to operate in foreign exchange, but most
of these foreign accounts are inactive and the volume of transaction is minimal. Without a rapid
development of sound commercial baning practices in Kyrgyzstan, trade will not improve and the
banks will face major difficulties in entering the intenational market.
21.        TA should be provided to selected commercial banks. The eligibility of banks for training
would be carully evaluated by the consultants, as several banks are non-performing. This training
should be provided by large international commercial banks and international institutions and should
cover all aspects of commercial banldng (documentary credits, payments transfers, intemational banking
rles, SWIFT system and other international communications tools, computer technology, language,
etc.).
22.        The training would take the following form:
a.    Secondment of staff from foreign commercial banks to Kyrgyzstan banks for the short,
medium and long-term;
b.   Training abroad in commercial banks and international institutions; and,
c.    Seminars and fellowships.
23.              and Reports. The main counterpart for these TA activities is the National
Bank of Kyrgyzstan, even though the beneficiaries under the Commercial Banking TA will be the
commercial banking sector. The output from the TA activities will include an Inception Report oudining
the approaches and the implementaion program; bi-monthly progress reports; informal reports on a



59
Annex V
page 8 of 15
variety of specific issues; draft legislation, statutes and guidelines on bank audits; audit reports; and a
Final Report at the completion of the work program. These reports and the Final Report will form the
basis of discussions between the Association and the Borrower, with the participation of the consultants
if necessary, and eventual agreements on implemenettion of the recommendations.
24.         This training is urgently needed and is considered part of the core TA activities. The bank
chosen for the Special Account, if it agrees to, could provide this training as part of its services.
Otherwise, grant resources or direct financing from the proposed Credit should be considered. The cost
of this program is estimated at around US$ 350,000.
Social Safety Issues
25.         Through the TCA, the Association conducted a review of the social safety net. The
identified needs for TA in the social sector cover more areas than can be supported within the frame
of the TAC under the Reh ibilitation Credit. Some of these areas are being covered by TA resources
provided on a grant basis '-y other donors. The Japanese Government has provided a grant of US$ 1
million to Kyrgyzstan for TA in the areas of income support design, labor markets and education, with
the Association as the executing agency. It is also expected that another bilateral donor will fund
technical assistance in the areas of health financing and health personnel planning and training. The TA
under the Rehabilitation Credit will therefore focus on other key aspects of the health sector,
emphasizing the cntical areas of pharmaceutical policy and health facility restructuring.
26.         Pharmaceutical Pgicy. Currently, the drug and equipment supply system is operated in
the old command mode, except that senior managers at the 'Pharmacy' organization now contract
directly with suppliers. There is viralaly no national expertise in international procurement or modern
mnanagement of drugs, vaccines and equipment. The plans for creating a pharmaceutical industry,
including herbal medicines, should be subjected to considerable strategic thinldng and analysis.
Kyrgyzstan's comparative advantage in the production of solutions and essential dmgs, in extracting
compounds from local herbs and in the production of syringes, needles, sutures and the like should be
assessed early. However, any large scale industrial development should be looked at in an international
perspective.
27.         The objective of the TA would be to transform the drug, vaccine and equipment sector
into a modem, effective system. Without a national drug policy, improvements in organization and
training in modern procurement systems, much money could be wasted and chronic drug and equipment
shortages could become the rmle. Investments in pharmaceutical and equipment industries could be both
costly and might require long term subsidies or protective trade barriers. TA could contribute to much
improved management of drug proement, distnbution and rational use of drugs, vaccines and
equipment.
28.         TA would be provided to advise and train personnel to: (i) develop a national drug policy;
(ii) streamline the organization of "Pharmacy", incluing the establisment of private retail phrmacies;

Annex
page 9 of 15
(iii) apply interional procurement techniques; (iv) improve management of drugs, vaccines and
equipment supplies; (v) carry out a comprehensive study of the present and futre drug and equipment
needs and to determine the feasibility of and cost of national or regional production of drugs, vaccines
and equipment.
29.        The projected cost of this component would be US$ 250,000 and it would commence
soon after Credit effectiveness and be completed by June 1994. Assistance would be provided to the
Minsty of Health (MOH) and the newly established Pharmindustry by specalists in drug policies,
procurement (e.g., from UNICEF) and pharmaceutical and equipment industries. The outcome would
be (i) a draft national drug policy, (ii) a more effective drug, vaccines and equipment system and, (iii)
a comprehensive plan for the future importation, production and pricing of drugs, vaccines and medical
equipment.
30.        Pacit  E=Mung. Kyrgyzstan has a total of 1,482 health facilities, including 464
hospitals. There are over 118 inpatient beds per 10,000 population, which is higher than that of any
middle income country outside of the FSU. In order to increase the resources available for priority
outpatient and primary health care programs, the number of hospital beds needs to be reduced and some
undendilised health facilities closed ckwn. Savings could be used to reequp and upgrade remaining
hospitals, and to improve referral systems (for example, through extesion of the ambulance services).
Redundant hospitals could be auctioned off or converted into polyclinics.
31.        However, bed reductions and facility rationalization obviously need to be planned
cally and phased in slowly. Hospital closure is a highly sensitive issue, and every effort needs to
be made to ensure that the quality of care in remaining facilities is indeed improved. Standards of care
need to be specifed and moniored, and the average length of hipatient stay needs to be reduced from
its current high level of 14.9 days. Cost effective technologies also need to be adopted, especialy in
the delivery of emergency, trauma and midwifery services. In many instances this will involve the
purchase of new medical equiment.
32.        The objectives of the technical assistance in this area are: (i) to help develop a
comprehensive five year plan to reduce the number of inpatient beds and excess hospitals; (ii) to help
develop standards of care and systems for regulating standards in public and private facilities; and
(iii) to help develop systems to enable rayon and oblast authorities to "purchase' services, under
contact, from public and private healh facilities.
33.        The different components of this stregy would need to be developed in a phased fashion
over a period of up to 24 months. Technical assistance should be packaged under one contrct, and the
total cost would be about $250,000. Ouputs would include a five year plan for bed- and facility
rationalizion; the development of standards of care along with systems to monitor and regulate service
quality; and the ouding of longer term plans for the development of an internal market for health care.
Trining would also be provided to develop a cadre of hospital administors.

34.         Countets and REpoits. The main counterpat for these TA activities is the Ministry
of Health. The output from the TA activities will include an Inception Report outlining the approaches
and the implementation program; bi-monthly progress repoits; informal reports on a variety of specific
issues; draft legislation, statutes, guidelines, etc.; and a Final Report at the completion of the work
program. These reports and the Final Report will form the basis of discussions between the Association
and the Borrower, with the participation of the consultants if necessary, and eventual agreements on
implementation of the recommendations.
Agricultural Sector
35.         Dunng the transition from an administrative command system to a market economy, the
agricultural sector will undergo fundamental changes. The agncultural structue in Kyrgyzstan reflects
the regional specialition developed in the FSU to promote interdependence among the Union
republics. This is observed also in agroindustrial production and the production of agricultunal inputs,
machinery and equipment. Tbe dissolution of these former Soviet reJations has caused disruptions in
agiculural production, input and output marketing and distribution and pocessing. The following areas
are currently major constraints to agricultural development; they should be thoroughly reviewed and
adequate policy changes should be implemented on the basis of detiled studies:
a.    Agricultural policies. Tlis would involve the agncultural incentive structure, including
the distorted price policy with its system of administered prices for both inputs and
outputs, and the opaque and pervasive subsidy struture.
b.    Privatization of agricultural production and production factors, with special emphasis on
land pnvatizafion. The issues would relate to small-scale private sector development,
including legal aspects, farm  and business management, marketing, sustainable
agricultural practices (integrated pest management, small scale machinery, etc.), mass
privatization of agroprocessing and input supply industies including transport and storage
facilities, and implementation of an adequate legal, financial and institutional framework.
c.    The changing comparative advantages in agricultual production. This requires analysis
of the curent prouction stucture, a thorough review of the irigation system and its
potental and needs for rehabilitation, and an assessment of Kyrgyzstan's potential in
diversifying agriciltural production under changing terms of trade in the agricultural
sector.
36.         The objectives of the proposed studies are to understand and describe the current stnacture
of the areas discussed above and to develop proposals for agrcultual development based on best
fnncial, economic and enviroental practices.
37.         S"dy 1 - Agricultural Policies. This study would examine the extent to which controls
have distorted the relative price stucture and encoumaged inefficient use of resources, and have



62
Annex V
page 11 of 15
contributed to the emergence of crop-mixes not in conformity with the comparative advantage of
Kyrgyzstan. The study would review the effect of the introduction of international prices on inputs and
the generl profitability of agriculture including the livestock sector (for example, the issues of the
comparative advantage of intensive ven- s extensive livestock, and the heavy emphasis on fodder
production). In reviewing the profitability of agriculture, the study would develop farm budgets for all
main agricultural activities showing the cuffent price structure for inputs and outputs, and then a price
structure reflecting intemnational prices at different projected exchange rates. The study would also look
at the transition relating to the elimination of the system of state orders. In addition, it would assess the
status of the rural poor and the effects of the reforms with recommendations as to how any adverse
impacts may be mitigated.
38.         The emphasis on the subsidy side would be on production subsidies; consumer subsidies
would not be considered. It would look into such aspects as the magnitude and nature of subsidies, the
distortions they produce, and ways in which they can be simplified for easier and more transparent
management as a poLicy tool. The study would consider subsidy policies in a market economy, with the
elimination of input subsidies and a focus on output and compensatory subsidies. It would discuss
related issues of the comparative advantages of Kyrgyzstan's agriculture (through the estimation of
protection coefficients), and the natural protection arising from distance from major markets. It would
seek to identify the framework in which the Government could develop policies, within the bounds of
budgetary resources and discipline, for a limited number of major agncultural commodities. Such
programs would interfere as little as possible with production decisions and would be in the form of
compensation payments (methods would be developed through the study) instead of active purchases by
the Government. The study would be managed by a group of expert consultants, comprised of specialists
in agricultural economics (two), crop production, livestock, irrigation, agroindustry, agricultural
machinery and equipment, and chemical inputs including fertlizers.
39.         Study 2 - Privatization. This study would seek to identify the issues that will affect the
privatization process in agriculture and those actions necessary to address these issues. Important areas
to be covered would include (i) limitations in the legal system, including procedures for registration and
licensing, that would affect private ownership and operations including the ability to trade such
ownership in part or in whole; (ii) options available to achieve private ownership, such as joint stock
companies, cooperatives, sole proprietorships, partnerships, or a mixture of the above; (iii) changes
needed in the financial system including rural credit to provide fmancing, including the issue of
collateral; (iv) the effect of privatization on wages of management and labor, including the introduction
of incentives and social benefits such as schools and pensions; (v) infastucture such as roads,
transportation and communication, land and buildings for storage and operations; (vi) the availability
of expertise and its development, particularly in the areas of accounting and management information
systems, auditing, marketing and other commercial activities; and (vii) the general climate and political
will toward private ownership and endeavor. In addition, this study would address the issue of land
reform and would seek to identify a methodology for allowing the lease rights of land to be transferable
through sales and rental and also to be used for collateral. The review would include representative



63
Annex V
page 12 of 15
enterprises eligible for privatization and would draw on the experience of recently privatized enteiprises.
40.         Aspects of the study related to privatization in maAceting, distribution. storage and
transport would examine the effects of state dominance in marketing, distribution, storage and transport
of agricultural inputs, services and products on the efficiency of the distribution network, farmgate to
retal costs and margins. This part of the study would define a program that would gradually eliminate
state controls in processing and marketing, to be implemented in the transition to a market economy.
It would also look at current restrictions to the development of private marketing channels, the adequacy
of inftastructure, and the institutional framework along with its linkage to the transport system.
41.         The study would be managed by a group of expert consultants with experience in
economies recently moving toward a market system, including macroeconomic and trade policy experts,
and marketing, distribution, storage and transport specialists. In addition to expertise in privatization,
the team would include expertise in legal and commercial practices. The output of the study would
include recommendations as to the future course for the development of the private sector and the
privatization of existing entities.
42.         The studies would be conducted in Kyrgyzstan over a period of four to six months each.
They would be provided with assistance from staff, information and resource contributions from the
-Ministries of Agriculture, Trade, Finance and Water Resources, and the Institute of Agricultural
Sciences, particularly the Faculty of Agricultural Economics, as weli as any other organization related
to the subjects being studied. The recommendations would take into consideration the Government's
Economic Reform Program and the associated Plan of Action.
43.         The consultants for the above studies would h. provided with suitable accommodations
and transportation as indicated in the Project Implement!.' i,n Section of the President's Report and in
Annex VI. They would be given furnished office sp' -e, stiitably equipped with telephones, telexes and
facsimile machines, bilingual secretaries, interpreters and any other reasonable requirement. The above
facilities, including equipment and supplies, would be in place before the arrival of the foreign experts
and would be free of export and other duties, and imports would be expedited. All data, legal texts, and
other pertinent information would be made readily available to the experts. The experts would be
allowed to travel unrestricted around the country, including in rural areas, and would be allowed to
conduct surveys necessary for their work.
44.         Counterparts and Reports. The main counterpart for these TA activities is the Ministry
of Agriculture. The output from the TA activities will include an Inception Report outlining the
approaches and the implementation program; training activities; bi-monthly progress reports; informal
reports on a variety of specific issues; draft legislation, statutes, guidelines, etc.; and a Final Report at
the completion of the work program. These reports and the Final Report will form the basis of
discussions between the Association and the Borrower, with the participation of the consultants if
necessary, and eventual agreements on implementation of the recommendations. The draft of each Final



64
Annex V
page 13 of 15
Report would be discussed with the Association and the Government at least one month before
fnalization.
45.         These studies are crtical to the Government's Economic Reform Program in Agriculture
and are considered core TA activity. Each study would begin as soon after Credit effectiveness as
possible and the cost of each of the above studies is estimated as follows (Study 2 is considered under
Enterprise Reform, Pivatization and Private Sector Development):
Study 1 -         six months        $  500,000
Study 2 -         six months        $  600,000
Total                               $ 1,100,000
46.         Study 3: Irigation and Water Cres. There is concern about the financial sustainability
of existing irrigation schemes and the economic justification of future projects under the present
cropping pattern, which is largely devoted to grain and feed crop production. More diversified
agriculture including higher value crops may be required to justify the moderization program
considered by the Minstry of Water Resources and Irigation. Import substitution in agricultural
production, if justfied, may require different stateies for irrigation development. TA will be required
to assess the irrigation program, including the rebabilitation of existing systems and proposed future
investments. This would include the services of experts or consulting firms, familiar with the
international technical and economic criteria, to assist in taining for the preparation of feasibility
reports, particularly on the marketing, economic, social and environmental aspects.
47.         This study would review proposed irrigation investments for the rehabilitation of existing
systems, their economic and environmental impact and their technical aspects. This review would
consider expected changes in water distribution arising from the proposed privatization of large fanms
into smaller units. It would also develop a water tariff system that would at least cover operation and
maintenance costs with automatic adjustment linked to cost changes. The study would be managed by
a group of experts in irrigation and water management, economists with water resources management
expenence and an environmenalist. The output of the study would take into considertion the
privatization of land nghts, and possible crop diversification based on comparative advantages and
existing and potential environmental issues. The tentative costs of this activity are estimated to be
around US$ 300,000. This is considered a core TA activity.
48.         Counteas and Reports. The main counterparts for these TA activities are the Ministry
of Water Resources and Irigation and the Ministry of Agriculture. The output from the TA activities
will include an Inception Report outlining the approaches and the implementation program; taining
activities in project evaluation; bi-monthly progress reports; informal reports on a variety of specific
issues; draft legislation, statutes, guidelines, etc.; the review and design of water charges; and a Final
Report at the completion of the work program. These reports and the Final Report will form the basis

of discussions between the Association and the Bonrower, with the participaion of the consultants if
necessaty, and eventual agreements on implementation of the recommendations.
Project Implementation
49.         ManIOn= of the Technical Assistance Pwrm. The technical assistn  program is
integrally linked to the development and implementation of the critical aspects of the Govemment's
Economic Reform Program. Tlmely and effective implementation of the TA program will enhance the
likelihood of success of the Economic Reform Program. The coordination of TA between the technical
staff in the line ministries, consultants providing the TA and the policy makers will require managment
and organization skills that are not readily available in Kygyzstan. Therefore, two long term consultants
will be hired (initally for one year) under the TA to assist the Government in managing and
coordinating the TA program. These consultants will focus on the administraton and the organization
of the TA as well as financial matters related to TAC. The consultants' activities will entail primarily
coordination among the technical authorties, the consultants for the different TA actvites and policy
makers and ensuring that the scheduling of TA allows timely availability of results that can be used in
the development and the implementation of the reform processes. The consultants will work with the
counterpart agencies, guide TA consultants, monitor the progress of the TA programs and ensure the
communicaton of results to the Government and the Association and also provide on the job tmning
to the TA Coordination Unit staff in GOSKOMNVEST. The consultants will be placed in the PIU.
From among the PU staff already appointed, one staff will be dedicated exclusively to assistng the
consultants in the management of the TAC under the Credit. A budget of US$ 500,000 is allocated for
the TA management consaltants.
50.         Reauirements of the P    Iplementation Unit. For the efficient operation of the PIU,
particularly for the processing and communication needs, office and communication equipment
(computers, software, telex, telephone, facsimile, etc.) will be required. A budget of US$ 200,000 is
allocated for this purpose. The resources to be provided for the FH  by the Govemment are discussed
in Annex VI.
51.         Cotets= and sR      . The main countetpart for these TA activities is the PIU. The
output from the TA activities will include an Inception Report outlining the approaches and the
implementation program; training activities in procurement; bi-monthly progress repons; infonnal
reports on a variety of specific issues; and a Final Report at the completion of the work program. These
reports and the Final Report will form the basis of discussions between the Association and the
Bonrower, with the participation of the consultants if necessry, and eventual agreements on
implementation of the recommendations.
Contingency
52.         Additional mources of US$ 450,000 are earmarked for contingencies or TA actvities
which may be identified.

ANNEX VI: PROJECT IMALEMENATION
INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS
1.          The State Commission for Foreign Investments and Economic Assistance
(GOSKOMINVEST), is the high level Government organization responsible for coordinating and
implementing the proposed project. GOSKOMINVEST coordinates foreign assistance to the
Republic; its Chainnan is the Prime Minister. It was created by decree on July 27, 1992, as a
state entity outside the regular structure of the Government. Its functions cover aid management,
foreign investment facilitation, and procurement and audit service. It wil serve as a focal point
for relations with investors and donors, and the official counterpat of aU donor agencies
operating in Kyrgyzstn, as far as their economic, financial, and technical activities are
concerned.
2.          The Responsibilities of GOSKOMINVEST. GOSKOMINVEST will be the main
agency for coordination and communication between IDA and the Government. It will also be
ewponsible for ensuring that the links between the PIU and the various Government Ministres
and agencies and the NBK is conducive to effective and efficient implementaion by channeling
the communication under GOSKOMIVEST's own authority. It will have the authority to sign
contracts, open bank accounts under the Credit in Kyrgyzstan and abroad in the name of the
Borrower and authorize withdrawals from these accounts under the Credit; some of these
functions can be delegated to the PIU. It will ensure that the PIU conducts its business in a
timely and efficient manner. It will faciLitate and assist Credit supervision and audits. It will
ensure that under TAC, the consultants have complete access to information, facilities (office
space, furniture, telecommunication and office equipment, etc.) and tanortation necessary for
the implementation of their duties. It will also ensure that consultants and IDA staff can travel
unrstricted to and from and within Kyrgyzstan, be accorded dispensation from taxation, and be
allowed to bring and take out of the country freely and without being subject to customs duties,
restrictions and taxes the personal effects, equipment and furniture for the execution of their
duties.
3.          Overall Implementation and the Responsibilities of the PIU. The Project
Implementation Unit (PIU) will be under the direction and responsibility of GOSKOMEIVNST.
The PIU will be responsible for the overall implementation, procurement and disbursement of
the Rehabilitation Credit and the related reporting and accounting activities of PMC, PXC, and
TAC. In these activities, PIU will benefit from the services of the Procurement Agent and the
consultants for the management of TAC. Given the wide scope and importance of its assigned
functions, the PIU has been given the authority and stature to deal direcdy and effectively with



68
Anne
pagp 2 of 19
Government ministries and offices, as well as the NBK, and commercial and corrondent
banks and project beneficiaries. The Govemment has agreed to provide the PIU with adeqate
staff, and office space, transport and office furniture for the staff. Equipment for photocpying,
telecommunications (telephone, telex and facsimile) and informatio systems (compts  and
software) will be provided under TAC. The PIU will provide SUpport to commeral banks
participating in the FXC, and TAC, and wfll provide guidance in procurement procedurs new
to the new implementing agencies in the country and other aspects of project implementation.
As a result, it is important that the PIU be exclusively concerned with the Credit during the
implementation period and that it not be given aMdiol duties and responsibilities unrelated to
the Credit. The following is a summary of the main responsibilities of the PIU; which should
be read with IDA's Procurement Guidelines, Disbursement Handbook, and Guidelines for
Financial Reporing and Auditing, which are the binding documents defining the resonsimilities
of the PIU, and copies of which have been left with the PIU.
4.          The overall project implementation responsibilities of the  UIJ will include the
following:
a.    To follow up and report periodically (monthly) on the progress of the
Government's Economic Reform Program, as indicated in *the Memorandum of
Economic Reform Policies" in the Credit Documentaion.

Procurement Agent r       es  and the long term  management consultant for the
implementation of the TA program will also be placed in the PIU.
6.          The Responsibilities of the Goveemment. The Government will provide the sales
and the benefits of the PIU staff, and, office space and furniture, and access to direct
communication facilities (direct domestic and intemational telecommunications access) to the PIU
and all the consultants working under TAC. The Government will provide adequate housing to
long term consultants (staying more than one month in Bishkek) at reasonable cost. Ihe
necessary repairs to consultant housing will be provided by the Govenmment or obtained in the
market and charged to the Project. Short term consultants (less than one month) will be housed
in acceptable hotels. The Govemment will provide transportaton (vehicles and fuel) to the TAC
consulants on the following basis: (i) for the long term consultants for procurement and TA
management and those residing temporarily in Kyrgyzstan for longer than one month, permanent
allocation (seven days a week) for the duration of their activities of one vehicle with driver per
two consultants, and all the related operating expenses (fuel, mainenance and regular and
overtime salaries and benefits of the driver); (ii) for the short term consultants staying in
Kyrgyzstan for a period of less than one month, the allocation of one vehicle per three
consulants under the same conditions as (i).
7.          The Ronsibiitie of the Ministries and other Government Agencies. The
Miistries and other Government Agencies benefiting from PMC, FXC or TAC will provide
adequate resources and staff to assipt the PIU, the Procurement Agent and the TAC management
consutant for the timely development of procurement documents, especially the technical
specifications; assist in the evaluation of the bids; and ensure that the imports under FXC and
PIC are within their budgets and/or credit ceilings. They will actively assist the PIU and the
TAC  nament consultant in the development of the terms of reference for the TAC, and
provide counterpart staff, facilities, assistance (transortation, access to information, etc.) and
guidance for the consuant hired under the TAC and in the implementation of the TAC. A draft
implementation agreement between the PU and the respective ministres, agencies and the NBK,
cleady delineating rewonsibilities, identifying counterparts and indicating actions to be taken is
expected to be finalized shortly.
8.          The ReMonsibilities of the NBK. The NBK will maintain the accounts of the
Govemment pertaining to the Credit and transfer funds from these accounts in a timely and
expedited manner, obtain adequate imports documentation to enable reimbursements under FXC
and provide these documents to the Pm; allocate and channel a pm-determined amount (to be
decided jointly between the Assocation and the Borrower) of the FXC to the inter-bank foreign
exchange auction market (IEAM), deposit local currency equivalent of auctioned amounts of
the aucton exchange rate to the Government's account, and provide monthly progress to the
PM, on the amounts of foreign exchange from the PXC auctioned at the IPEAM.

9.          Supervision. Owing to the weak instutional structure and implementaton capaty
in Kyrgyzstan, the high level of TA activities in this Credit and the extensive reform activities
that would need to be monitored, supervision requirements will be higher than indicated in the
normal supervision coefficients and are estimated to be around 75 SW. The supervision program
is given in Annex VI, Table A-VI.4.
PROCUREMENT
10.        The PIU's responsibilities for procurement are discussed below under the Pre-
identified Component (PIC) and the Technical Assistance Component (TAC). As imports and
procurement in the former Soviet Union (FSU) were coordinated through Moscow, there is
practically no procurement capacity in Kyrgyzstan, and also because of the lack of experience
of the PIU, a Procurement Agent, responsible to the Borrower and acceptable to the IDA, will
be hired to carry out public sector procurement under the Credit while simultaneously developing
a local procurement capacity or institution to be responsible for public procurement in future.
A draft "Terms of Reference for the Procurement Agent" is provided in the Attachment to this
Annex. An international procurement agency acceptable to the Association will therefore be
contracted to manage procurement activities and provide training in procurement. The Borroi ter
and the procurement agency will ensure that procurement complies with Bank guidelines.
Contracts estimated to cost above US$ 300,000 equivalent will be awarded through ICB, using
IDA's sample bidding documents modified to suit the requirements of individual packages.
Contracts costing less than US$ 300,000 equivalent will be procured through international
shopping, based on at least three quotations from two different countries. Limited inational
bidding will be used for goods for which there are a limited number of suppliers. Direct
contacting will be allowed for proprietary goods and items required for standardiztion. To
ensure compliance with IDA guidelines, the first two contract packages (including bidding
documents) in each subsector procured through ICB and all contracts (including bidding
documents) costing more than US$ 0.5 milion equivalent will be subject to prior review by the
Association. AU other contracts wiU be subject to ex-post review. Pre-shipment inspection wil
be carried out as necessary for contracts costing more than US$ 300,000 equivalent. Consulns
will be selected in accordance with the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank
Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency."
11.        The proposed procurement arngements for goods and the hiring of consultants
are presented in Tables A-VI.1 and A-VI.2. These procurement plans represent best estimates;
precise amounts under each procurement category will be determined when the Procurement
Agent identifies bidding packages according to equipment needs and at the time when the bidding
documents for each package are prepared. The bidding packages will require the prior approval
of the Association. The esfimated aggregate amounts to be procured under procedures other than
ICB are as follows: LIB: US$ 12 million; IS: US$ 14.5 million; Direct Conactng US$ 0.5
million and TA (consultants' services): US$ 7.0 million. IDA financing is 99.6 percent of the
cost of the project.

Annex VI
page 5 of 19
12.        Pe-,Identified Component 1(PC. For procurement to be conducted under the PIC,
the PIU will coordinate activities between the Procurement Agent and the end users of imports.
13.        In addition, the PIlU will review proposals under the PIC for the purchase of
imported goods to ensure that they comply with the agreed 'pre-identified list," that funds are
available in the Credit account to cover their costs and that the local currency equivalents have
been deposited by the importers in the Borrower's account in the National Bank of Kyrgyzstan
(NBK) (see Som Account - SOA, below under Disbursement).
14.        Foreign Exchange Component IPXC). For the FXC, the PIU would undertake the
following:
a.    Review import documentation submitted by NBK for reimbursement under the
FXC, to ensure that these items are not included on the 'negative list," to ensure
that these items were imported in accordance with agreed procurement
procedures, and that funds are available in the Credit Account to cover their
costs.
b.    Establish and maintain records of purchases committed and paid, to ascertain the
total amount of this component that remains available, and to record the
utilization of this component by main economic activities.
c.    Designate a staff who will be responsible for the disbursement of the component.
15.        Technical Assistance Component (TAC). For the TAC, the PIU will undertake
the following:
a.    Complete the preparation of terms of reference acceptable to the Association, and,
with the assistance of the Procurement Agent and the TA management consultant,
review proposals and appoint consultants for the studies agreed to be carried out
under this component, ensuring that the procurement procedures and contracts
comply with the Credit Agreement and with MDA Guidelines.
b.   Monitor, with the assistance of the TA  management consultants, the
implementation of the TAC concs to ensure their timely execution, and also
to ensure that the consultanu receive the supporting services agreed (housing,
transportation, staff, office facilides, etc.), that they travel unrestricted to, from
and within Kyrgzstan and have access to documents and other information
necessary, and that they are paid in a timely and professional manner; the P1U
will also ensure that an acceptable output is received for each study.

DISBURSEMENTS
16.         The PIU will be responsible for the disbursement of fund., the preparation of
withdrawal applications and the collection of documents. Disbursement will start once the Credit
becomes eh;ctive, and funds for the PIC and FXC will be disbursed within 6 months but the
TAC may take 36 months to disburse. The Disbursement Handbook, which is binding in
disbursement matters for IDA Credits, provides additional information on the procedures and
will be utilized in conjunction with this section.
17.         Project Preparation Facility (PPM). A PPF of US$ 500,000 has been provided to
finance some activities related to the start-up of project implementation (equipment for the P1I
office, procurement, training and technical assistance, etc.). The Credit will refinance the
advance made under the Project Preparation Facility (PPF) No. P193-0 KG.
18.         SecialAont. To facilitate the disbursement of funds for PIC and TAC, a
Special Account (SA) will be opened in a foreign commercial bank acceptable to the Association.
The currency in which the SA is to be maintained is to be agreed between the Borrower and the
Association and is to be specified in the Credit Agreement. The SA will be maintained in a fully
convertible and stable currency. The authorized allocation to the SA under the Credit will be
TJS$ 5 million. The SA will be used for PIC and TAC components.
19.         The foreign commercial bank selected to be the depositary bank of the SA should
be selected as soon as possible. The criteria for the selection of this bank are defined on page
31 of the Disbursement Handbook. The SA will be in the name of the Borrower and will be
admnistered by authorized representatives of the Borrower (preferably staff at the PMU). Two
signatures will be required to make any transaction from the account. The SA will be replenished
monty.
20.         Pre-Identified Component (PIC2. Under the PIC, large contracts, i.e., equivalent
of US$ 50,000 (fift thousand) minimum of eligible imports from the pre-identified list, will be
financed under this component. The contracts will include payment terms and the PIU will have
to ascertain, before approvmg the contracts, that these payment terms are in line with IDA
disbursement procedures. The acceptable disbursement procedures for this component will be
the following:
a.    Procedure of special commitments for larger LCs (a special commitment is an
irrevocable agreement to reimburse commercial banks for payments made, or to
be made, under the cover of an LC). The special commitment is issued by the
Association at the request of the Borower and is in favor of the supplier through
their banks; the mechanism for this procedure is fully described in the
Disbursement Handbook, page 24.



76
page 10 of 19
b.    Payments of the LC through the Special Account: once the importer's commercial
banks have notified the SA depositary bank of their readiness to pay the suppliers,
the SA depositary bank will transfer the necessary funds to the banks of the
suppliers and notify the Borrower and the PIU of the transactions. The importer's
bank will send all documentation to the SA depositary bank. This documentation
will support the requests for the replenishment of the SA.
c.   In the case where no LC has been used, direct payments to the suppliers by the
Borrower from the SA can also be effected. Payment terms should be reasonable
and protect both the buyer and the seller. Advance payment of 100 percent cannot
be accepted; acceptable commercial payment terms are, for instance, 10 percent
at signing of contract, 80 percent at shipment and 10 percent at delivery, or a
reasonable variant of this.
d.    There might be cases when the same contract will include one or more of the
acceptable procedures. A combination of these procedures can also be used.
21.         The Borrower will submit to the Association monthly (or more frequently, if
necessary) requests to replenish the SA; these requests will be made against Statements of
Expenditures (SOE) for contracts of less than US$ 300,000 (three hundred thousand), and by
full documentation for those contracts equal to or in excess of US$ 300,000 (three hundred
thousand) (two copies of contracts, copy of LC, invoices, evidence of payment and evidence of
shipment, or any other documentation as might be required by the Association). A sample of the
SOE format can be found in the Disbursement Handbook, pag- 34.
22.         The Borrower will open an account, called the Som Account (SOA) hereon, in
the name of the Borrower, in the NBK or in a commercial bank. Public sector importers using
foreign exchange resources under the PIC of the Rehabilitation Credit, will pay (deposit) at the
time of the request for imports the equivalent local currency into the SOA in the NBK for the
foreign exchange converted at the market exchange rate.
23.         Foreign Exchange Component (FXC). The PIU will be responsible for this
component. Disbursement under this component will be made as reimbursement to the
Government for imports by the private and public sector already made. Individual documentation
for imports costing less than US$ 10,000 equivalent or exceeding US$ 500,000 equivalent will
not be eligible for reimbursement under the FXC. These imports will comply with and not
include items in the Association's standard negative list.
24.         The FXC is expected to disburse over a six month period from the date of
effectiveness of the Credit and would also cover retroactive financing. The Bank wil disburse
foreign exchange for FXC to the Borrower on a reimbursement basis for eligible imports which
have alrady been made by the public or the private sector. These funds will be disbursed in



77
Annex VI
page 11 of 19
foreign exchange in account(s) opened by the Government. The Borrower would be expected to
provide an initial set of documentation for imports made since the retroactive financing cutoff
date of February 1, 1993, which would be the basis for the initial disbursement on a
reimbursement basis. NBK will submit all the necessary documentation (customs certificates
where available, LCs, shippers' documents, etc.) to the PIU. If, during the implementation of
the Credit, disbursement under the FXC proves to be lower than anticipated or other unforeseen
issues appear, resources will be transferred from the FXC to be used under PIC.
25.         As soon as the Credit Agreement is signed, PIU, with input from the NBK, will
collect documentation on imports either from the customs office (if these documents are
available) or from commercial banks. Once the Credit is effective, PIU will send to the
Association the first request to reimburse the Government for these imports. The Association
will deposit these funds in foreign exchange in the Government's account(s). There might be
more than one account as the requests for reimbursement are expected to be expressed in various
currencies, depending on how the imports were paid. The funds deposited as reimbursement of
FXC by the Association in the Government account(s) will be used to feed the inter-bank foreign
exchange market through the NBK.
26.         A protocol would be required between the Govenmment and the NBK indicating
the predetermined amounts and periodicity of the foreign exchange transfers to the NBK for sale
at the inter-bank foreign exchange market. NBK will submit to the PIU, with copy to the
Association, monthly reports indicating the portion of foreign exchange auctions during the
month that has been financed through the resources from reimbursements by the Association for
imports under the FXC.
27.         The PIU will submit periodic applications for reimbursement for FXC with the
following documentation:
a.    For imports under US$ 300,000; statement of expenditures (SOE) based on
customs certificates (if available) or on information obtained from the commercial
banks (copies of LCs issued and paid and other documents such as invoices,

PROCUREMENT OF KYRGYZSTAN
REHABILITATION CREDIT
DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE PROCURMNENT AGENT
1.         Procurement. According to IDA policy, procurement is the responsibility of the
borrower. However, due to the fact that before the independence of Kyrgyzstan, all public sector
procurement was carried out centrally form Moscow through long established and experienced
trading companies, no procurement expertise was created in the Republic of Kyrgyzstan, nor
does any exist today. Appropriate international procurement practices need to be developed to
use scarce foreign exchange resources efficiently.
2.          Consequently, the Government of Kyrgyzstan and the Association agree that either
through obtaining grant funds and/or through the proceeds of the Project Preparation Facility
(PPF) and the proposed Rehabilitation Credit, a Procurement Agent be hired to initially carry
out procurement under the Rehabilitation Credit while simultaneously training a local
procurement capacity or institution to do so in the future. This training effort would require an
adequate organization of the procurement capacity or institution, which should be staffed with
at least some staff who speak English because it is commonly used in intemational commerce.
It is important that the Procurement Agent base the services required in the designated
Government offices in Bishkek, Republic of Kyrgyzstan, to be able to conduct the procurement
and training functions adequately for the Government.
3.          The services of the Procurement Agent will be financed through: (i) using the
proceeds of the Project Preparation Facility and the Rehabilitation Credit; and/or (ii) obtaining
grant funds.
4.          Profile of the Procurement Agent. The Procurement Agent will be responsible
for carrying out procurement functions on behalf of the Borrower in accordance with the
procedures outlined in IDA Guidelines and specified in the Credit Agreement with the Borrower.
The term Procurement Agent is used to mean expert staff from an organization, which has wide
knowledge of and experience with the international commercial practices and the Procurement
Guidelines and the Guidelines for the Use of Consultants of the Association. The Procurement
Agent must also have an established organization capable of providing the various back-up
services expected under procurement activities.
5.          Responsibilities of the Procurement Agent. For procurement conducted
according to International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures, the Procurement Agent will:
a.    Arrange advertising and provide infonnation to interested suppliers;



84
Annex VI
page 18 of 19
b.    Prepare bidding documents in all respects, including review of technical
specifications, using the Sample Bidding Documents for the procurement of goods
issued by the Association with appropriate adjustments to suit individual
procurement packages; seek approval of documents from the Association which
would involve discussions and meetings;
c.    prepare documents for the selection of consultants complying with Dank
requirements;
d.    Distribute/sell bidding documents to prospective bidders at a nominal cost,
crediting the funds received to the Borrower's account;
e.   Invite bids;
C.    Provide clarifications in response to potential bidders' questions;
g.    Conduct the bid opening process and prepare the minutes of bid opening;
h.    Evaluate bids (and Consultants' offers) and submit a bid evaluation report to the
Borrower with award recommendation. Provide any clarification or analysis
required by the financhig agency;
i.    When designated to do so, sign and finalize the contract, follow-up and monitor
the delivery schedule and status of goods which could include visits to suppliers;
j.    When required, arrange and witness pre-shipment inspections (PSI); and,
k.    Receive goods at entry, clear customs, and ensure delivery to final destination.
6.          For non-ICB procurement, the Procurement Agent would follow the appropriate
procedures specified in the Credit Agreement, including:
a.    Soliciting written quotations from a list of potential suppliers broad enough to
secure competitive prices and informing the Borrower of the results in writing;
evaluating the quotations and negotiating the resulting contracts;
b.    Soliciting quotation on sole-source basis, after required approvals, and negotiating
with supplier for spare parts or other proprietary items at reasonable cost; and,
c.    Placing purchase orders and contracts with selected suppliers, including follow-up
for delivery of goods according to schedule.



85
Annex VI
page 19 of 19
7.         In the area of contract administration services, the Procurement Agent will:
a.    Collect documentation, such  as inspection  certificates, certificates of
origin/manufacturer, manufacturers'/suppliers' guarantees, bills of lading,
beneficiary insurance certificates, and manufacturers' invoices;
b.    Forward documentation to the forwarding agent;
C.    Maintain, in coordination with the PIl, accounting and financial management and
handle warranty and insurance claims; and,
d.    Assist in the preparation of withdrawal applications with the required supporting
documentation an'd arrange payments to suppliers through the Pill.
8.          The Procurement Agent will also undertake the following two tasks;
a.    Training the Borrower's staff in international commercial practices and IDA
Procurement Procedures, including familiarization with IDA's sample bidding
documents so that the Borrower's staff can eventually handle the procurement
work in the future. (This part may be financed by grant funds and be handled
independently by the Procurement Agent). The cost for training should be
provided separately in your financial proposal; and,
b.    Assisting in collecting and translating into English local procurement laws,
regulations and commercial practices with the purpose of enabling the preparation
of a Country Procurement Assessment Report for Kyrgyzstan (CPAR) and
recommending improvements to the existing regulations and practices, within the
framework of international procedures and trading practices using the model
developed by UNCITRAL as a basis.
9.          Reports. The Procurement Agent will submit periodic reports to the Government
of Kyrgyzstan as follows:
a.    An Inception Report, within one month of work in Bishkek, describing the
proposed program of work for assistance in the procurement and training;
b.    Subsequent reports every two months thereafter and a Final report on the
conclusion of the work including a draft CPAR based on the IDA's outline; and,
c.    Five copies of each report will be submitted in English and in Russian to the
Govermnent of Kyrgyzstan and one copy of the English version will be submitted
to the Association.
