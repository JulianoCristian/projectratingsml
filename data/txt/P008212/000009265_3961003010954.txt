MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBRD TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBUC OF VENEZUELA
FOR A LOW-INCOME BARRIOS IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of Venezuela for the equivalent of US$40.0 million to help finance a project for low-
income barrios improvement. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a
repayment period of 15 years, including five years of grace.
Background
2.    Despite Venezuela's high per capita income, poverty in both urban and rural areas has
constrained the country's development. In terms of socio-economic indicators, such as infant mortality
and the illiteracy rate, Venezuela ranks about the same as countries with half or less of its per capita
income. Moreover, a recent Bank study noted that poverty not only remains widespread in Venezuela
but, indeed, has increased significantly in the past decade with declining petroleum prices and real per
capita GNP. According to the study, some 53 percent of Venezuela's population is considered poor,
a sharp rise from the 32 percent in the same category in 1982. This study also found that poverty is
primarily an urban phenomenon; of particular concem are the often squalid conditions of the urban poor
living in unserviced squatter areas, or barrios, surrounding the major urban centers. In the past, social
programs have been poorly designed and targeted, with a large portion of expenditures going toward
general subsidies for food or agricultural inputs. Recently, the Govemment of Venezuela (GOV) has
decided to shift much of its social program expenditures away from general subsidies to targeted
programs. As part of this change in policy, GOV intends to improve and expand shelter-related
infrastructure services (i.e., water and sewerage, waste disposal, electricity, road paving) in low-
income neighborhoods surrounding Venezuela's major cities, and has requested Bank support to
achieve this objective.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
3.    Since 1989, the Bank has assisted GOV in a broad-ranging program of policy and institutional
reform aimed at creating a policy environment conducive to sustainable growth. The Bank's strategy
is to assist GOV in its macroeconomic adjustment efforts in two ways: first, by helping to reorganize
key sectors of the economy through lending aimed at improving efficiency and encouraging the
privatization of key public services; and secondly, by assisting GOV in mitigating the negative effects
of restructuring on Venezuela's poorest population. The project will support this strategy by: (a)
improving efficiency in the provision of urban infrastructure in low-income areas; and (b) strengthening
financial management, technical and administrative capabilities of municipalities, thus developing a
sound foundation for sustainable and replicable urban improvement programs, especially in low-income
barrios.
Lessons Leamed from Past Bank Projects
4.    Since the project will be the first Bank-financed urban operation in Venezuela, its design
Incorporates lessons leamed from Bank projects elsewhere in the Region with similar features. The
most important lessons leamed are: (i) that a lack of cost recovery reduces project sustainability and
sector agency involvement; {ii) efforts to ensure financial sustainability should focus greater attention
on administration and monitoring, in addition to the design and formal establishment of cost recovery
mechanisms, such as measures to expand the local property tax base through the improvement of
cadastres; and (liU) successful achievement of project goals is contingent upon the institutional capacity



of project entities, and on project design appropriate to the executing agencies' capabilities. The
design of the proposed project has taken into account these lessons by incorporating a strong
institutional strengthening component.
Project ObJectives
5.    The broad objectives of the project are to improve living conditions in low-income
neighborhoods, develop a sound foundation for sustainable urban improvement programs, and increase
municipal participation in financing and managing urban infrastructure investments. Specifically, the
proiect aims to: (i) improve the provision of basic urban infrastructure services in low-income barfios;
01i) develop the planning, administrative and executive capabilities of the municipalities in support of
the Venezuelan govemment's decentralization policy by making municipalities responsible for
subproject execution and introducing basic municipal management concepts such as project evaluation
and monitoring, fiscal responsibility, cost recovery, and maintenance of assets; and (ii) strengthen the
administrative and technical capacity of FUNDACOMUN (Fundacidn psra el DesafroJlI Comunal y
Fomento Municipal) and improve its ability to assist municipalities. The project is modest in size
(US$85.5 million, with US$40 million in Bank financing) compared to urban needs. It is essentially a
pilot project that provides a quick response to urgent barrio needs, while laying the institutional
foundations for stronger municipal govemment.
Project Description
6.    The proposed project consists of: (a) an Infrastructure improvement component (73 percent
of total project cost) which will finance small civil works and the purchase of equipment to extend or
Improve municipal services such as water supply, sewerage, electricity, drainage, street paving, and
garbage collection in selected low-income barrios; (b) an institutional development component (27
percent of total project costs) which will support the improvement of municipalities' institutional
capacity through material support, technical assistance and training, and the strengthening of
FUNDACOMUN's institutional capacity by financing the prmparation of an organizational development
plan; the development of a management Information system; technical assistance for project
management; policy studies and surveys; staff training; and the purchase of vehicles and equipment.
The infrastructure improvements will focus exclusively on barrios and consist of simple works in basic
infrastructure, such as water supply, sewerage, and electricity. Only low-cost solutions, affordable
by low-income beneficiaries, and with an adequate economic rate of retum, will be financed under the
project. As part of the effort to improve municipal financial management, a municipal finance study
will be carried out under the project to develop municipal fiscal and financial policies in support of
GOV's decentralization program and to enhance the financial and management capabilities of
municipalities.
7.    It is estimated that project implementation will take five years, at a total cost of US$85.5
million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$33.2 million (39%). A breakdown of
costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Procurement and disbursement information Is
presented in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Venezuela are given In Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report No.
10401 -VE dated May 29, 1992, is being distributed separately.
Project Implementation
8.    FUNDACOMUN will have overall responsibility for managing and implementing the project. A
special project management unit (PMU) will be created in FUNDACOMUN to assist with project
implementation. FUNDACOMUN will also be directly responsible for carrying out the instiuional



-3-
development component, while the participating municipalities will execute the investment component.
Participation of municipalities and selection of investment subprojects for financing under the project
will be based on an agreed methodology and eligibility criteria (derived from financial, technical,
economic and environmental considerations). An operational manual prepared by FUNDACOMUN will
guide implementation of the project. Bank loan proceeds, as well as GOV counterpart funds, will be
transferred to FUNDACOMUN through annual budgetary allocations. About 42 percent of Bank loan
proceeds will be made available to participating municipalities through subloans at 85 percent of the
variable non-preferential lending rate of commercial banks, with a repayment period of 10 years,
Including three years of grace. These subloans, corresponding to 27 percent of investment costs in
each participating municipality, will be made by a financial agent with which FUNDACOMUN will
establish a trust fund (fideicomiso). GOV counterpart funds will be made available to participating
municipalities in the form of grants, and municipalities will be required to make contributions from their
own revenues of no less than 13 percent of the investment costs. The remaining 58 percent of Bank
loan proceeds will be used for implementing the institutional development component.
9.    Considering the concentration of urban poverty, the financial capacity of municipalities, and
compliance with legal requirements for updating municipal cadastres and urban development plans,
only municipalities with populations of more than 50,000 will be eligible to participate in the
Institutional Development component of the project. To qualify for investment subprojects, however,
these municipalities must meet additional criteria: (a) presence of low-income barrios with the following
characteristics: (i) more than 50 percent of the barrio population falling in extreme and critical poverty
categories, as defined by the govemment; (ii) lack of one or more of the infrastructure improvements
eligible for financing under the project; (iii) location on land over which the municipality has titling rights
and which is considered safe from landslides, floods, etc.; and (iv) population densities of more than
120 inhabitants per hectare; (b) no overdue debt with FUNDACOMUN and a balanced current account
in which the municipality's current revenues are equal to or greater than its current expenditures,
including debt service; (c) the municipality's total debt service on outstanding and proposed loans will
be no more than 15 percent of the total budgeted revenues for any given year during project
implementation; (di preparation of barrio improvement programs, according to criteria set out in the
Project Operations Manual (POM); and (e) signing a participation agreement to include, inter alia,, the
following commitments: (i) implementing the recommendations of technical assistance plans to be
prepared by FUNDACOMUN, especially in the areas of billing and collecting local taxes; (ii) carrying out
a program to secure land tenure for barrio dwellers; and {iii) maintaining the credit-worthiness criteria
(b) and (c) above, during the entire project implementation period. Each proposed subproject would
be the object of a feasibility study prepared by participating municipalities and approved by the PMU,
in accordance with guidelines agreed with the Bank. A mid-term review with the purpose of examining
progress made, assessing the relevance of project objectives and actions, and agreeing on appropriate
revisions, as needed, is planned for end 1995.
Project Sustalinability
10.   The financial contributions to investments required from participating municipalities and the
stret -gthening of their administrative and financial capabilities should contribute to project sustainability.
Compared to a near total dependence on central govemment for new infrastructure investments, the
participating municipalities will not only be responsible for executing the infrastructure improvements,
but will contribute 40 percent of the total cost of investment subprojects - 13 percent from intemal
contributions and 27 percent from borrowings from FUNDACOMUN. While the remaining 60 percent
of the cost of infrastructure improvements will be financed by central govemment grants, this new
Infrastructure investment policy will strengthen the municipalities' financial discipline and independence
by making them less reliant on govemment funds. The strengthening of FUNDACOMUN should also
contribute to project sustainability as it will improve FUNDACOMUN's ability to assist municipalities.

C. As Conditions of Disbursement, that: (a) in respect of any investment subproject,
satisfactory participation and subproject agreements between FUNDACOMUN and an eligible
municipality, and a subloan agreement between the Financial Agent and the municipality in question
shall have been executed; (b) in respect of expenditures related to technical assistance and training
for the municipalities, a satisfactory participation agreement between FUNDACOMUN and the
respective eligible municipality shall have been executed; and (c) for any expenditure, subloans or
annual project implementation plans approved by the Bank include such expenditures.
Fnvironmental Aspects
12.   The project is expected to have a positive impact on the conservation and enhancement of the
physical environment of barrion benefitting from the investments. Properly designed and constructed
subprojects, such as street paving and storm drainage, produce significant reduction in erosion and In
the disposal of unsanitary material. As the subprojects are expected to be small in size, consisting
most frequently of exten,sions of existing services, the project will have few direct environmental
impacts commonly associated with sewerage treatment plants or sanitary landfills. For subprojects
related to potentially environment-sensitive systems, such as sewerage and solid waste disposal, the
project operations manual will include the condition that they will not be eligible for financing under
the project, unless they comply fully with local environmental protection laws and regulations, and with
specific environmental guidelines in the operational manual. Compliance with this condition and the
operational manual guidelines for reviewing environmental aspects of physical investment subprojects
will be evaluated in the annual performance audits. The manual will also include satisfactory provisions
to address the relocation of those people displaced from the land needed for construction of
infrastructure. Although relocation is expected to be minimal, the following provisions will be adopted
in an effort to minimize the negative impact associated with it: (i) local participation of project
beneficiaries in municipal investment decision-making will be required, starting at the early stages of
the decision-making process; lii) people displaced from land acquired for construction of infrastructure
will be, to the extent possible, resettled in the same barrio, following Bank guidelines for involuntary
resettement. FUNDACOMUN, through its Directorate for Community Development, will assist
municipalities in the design and implementation of community participation schemes.
Program Objective Categories
13.   The criteria and methodology for selecting investment subprojects for financing under the
project will ensure the targeting of benefits to the poor. By strengthening the planning, administrative
and executive capabilities of participating municipalities, the project will support the govemment's
efforts in administrative decentralization and capacity-building, allowing municipal govemments to deal
more effectively with the urban infrastructure needs of their communities, especially the unplanned,
low-income ones. Although financial intermediation is not an explicit objective, the use of subloans
to municipalities, with the objective of helping them finance part of their counterpart contribution, will
encourage sound financial management in the participating municipalities.
Project Benefits
14.   Project investments will improve the environmental and sanitary conditions for about 230,000
low-income inhabitants of barrios in Venezuelan cities. Private investments in housing are expected
to increase as a result of the infrastructure improvements financed under the project, coupled with the
legalization of land tenure. Although these investments are difficult to estimate, past experience
suggests that they can be quite significant. The project will also improve municipal finance and
administration. Since municipalities will be required to repay FUNDACOMUN an amount equal to 27
percent of the total cost of the infrastructure improvements under the project, they will be faced with



-6-
the need to increase their own revenues to cover these payments. The proJect will thus introduce the
principle and, more Importantly, the practice of cost recovery to municipalities in Venezuela. Finally,
the project will improve FUNDACOMUN's ability to assist municipalities and establish a new working
relationship with municipal govemments, which are becoming increasingly important as a result of
decentralization measures taken by the Govemment.
Risks
15.   Potential project risks are: (a) slow development and strengthening of FUNDACOMUN's project
management capabilities which are needed to implement the project; lb) lack of sufficient demand for
subproJect financing by municipalities under the terms and conditions offered under the project; (c)
lack of adequate institutional capacity of municipalities for preparation and implementation of
subprojects; and (d) reluctance on the part of the Govemment to continue supporting reforms related
to the decentralization process, especially those related to the funding of urban infrastucture
investrnents.
16.   To minimize these risks, the following safeguards have been introduced into the project: (a)
staffing, equipment and installations of the PMU will be reviewed by Bank supervision missions as a
priority during the first year of implementation, with changes made as necessary; (b) a first year
investment program will be secured before the loan is effective and a project mid-term review will
provide for adjustments in subproject financing terms and conditions if municipal demand for project
funds were to change; (c) training and technical assistance for participating municipalities under the
institutional development component will address their weaknesses in subproject preparation and
implementation; and (d) a municipal finance study has been included under the project; its conclusions
and policy recommendations will be discussed between GOV and the Bank with the purpose of
establishing a timetable for implementing of govemment policies on municipal finance.
17.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
