Among the most\n            important lessons learned were the following: Thanks to\n            adequate Government counterpart funding and its skillful\n            mobilization by the Community and Municipal Development\n            Foundation (FUNDACOMUN), the project was not held hostage to\n            delayed disbursements from the special account, nor the lack\n            of local counterpart funding. A highly satisfactory Bank\n            performance helped secure the better-than-expected outcome.\n            More resources for supervision in a situation of uncertainty\n            allows for an intensive and proactive approach to build\n            Bank/borrower trust and steer a project through an uncertain\n            macro-context, such as that experienced by Venezuela. Staff\n            continuity involving experienced and skilled individuals on\n            both the borrower and Bank sides cemented relationships and\n            contributed to project success. Project monitoring should be\n            given priority at the outset of implementation, and\n            constantly highlighted during supervision missions. Projects\n            that can make only fractional improvements to enormous\n            problems such as Venezuela's urban barrios should be\n            consolidated by a follow-on operation and an active sector\n            dialogue to help establish the basis for long-term solutions\n            to large-scale sector problems."}, "docdt": "1999-06-09T00:00:00Z"}
