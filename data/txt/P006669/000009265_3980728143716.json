Implementation Completion\n            Report (ICR) for the Second Public Sector Management Project\n            in Chile. The Second Public Sector Management Project (PSMI\n            I) aimed at: (a) Increasing the efficiency and effectiveness\n            of the Internal Revenue, Treasury, Customs and Social\n            Security operations; (b) remediating the Government's\n            in adequate economic policy analytic and coordination\n            capabilities; and (c) improving policy making in the\n            legislature. The project achieved most of, and even somewhat\n            exceeded, its targets. The Bank's performance was\n            satisfactory. The Government looked to it for technical\n            assistance, especially for facilitation of project design\n            and supervision. Key lessons learned included: (a)\n            Legislative institutions typically are largely politically\n            minded and have collegial (rather than executive) management\n            cultures, short term mandates, frequent turnover, and are\n            focused on disparate local concerns. (b) There should be a\n            careful assessment of the extent to which a legislative\n            institution has: (i) adequate managerial capacity to\n            undertake planned investments; (ii) sufficiently centralized\n            and potent decision-making capability; (iii) demonstrated\n            success in reaching consensus on proposed actions within\n            reasonable periods, and then seeing them carried out; and\n            (iv) is receptive to transparent and modernizing changes.\n            (c) The Bank's presence may provide a helpful buffer in\n            executive-legislative branch dealings in projects. (d)\n            Chile's approach to public sector management\n            illustrated the concept that the transition to a market\n            economy may entail limiting the ambitions of the state--but\n            still ensuring that what government does, it must do well."}, "docdt": "1998-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
