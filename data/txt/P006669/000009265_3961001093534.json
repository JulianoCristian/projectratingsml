aims to improve overall\n            central governmental management efficiency and to enhance\n            Chile's policy formulation and implementation capacity.\n            Specifically, it will: (a) improve information systems and\n            management of the principal public financial management\n            agencies; (b) increase the quality and facilitate the use of\n            information and subsequent analysis in legislative economic\n            decision-making; (c) contribute to strengthening the\n            analytical policy and implementation capacity of the\n            government; and (d) enhance the capacity to assess\n            critically issues that cross specific development sectors.\n            To achieve these objectives, the project will: (i) develop\n            and/or improve existing taxpayer and beneficiary management\n            information systems, to include development of performance\n            indicators in four financial management agencies; (ii)\n            improve the capacity of the Library of Congress to provide\n            economic information and analysis, including strengthening\n            its reference holdings; (iii) provide improved economic data\n            and information systems and analytic capacity to guide\n            decision-making; (iv) strengthen the analytical information\n            base available to the Interministerial Committees; and (v)\n            strengthen the Ministry of Finance's capacity to manage\n            the proposed project."}, "docdt": "1991-09-11T00:00:00Z"}
