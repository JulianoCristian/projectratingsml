                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Projects development objective is to reduce urban poverty in a sustainable manner, targeting the poorest and most vulnerable sections of Salvador and strategic
                         cities of the state of Bahia with access to basic services and improved housing and social support services. This development objective is aligned with the Millennium
                         Development Goals MDGs (especially Goal 7, Target 11) in line with the growing number of governments around the world that are launching comprehensive slum
                         upgrading programs, setting development targets, undertaking reforms to prevent the growth of new slums, and leveraging public and private resources to improve the
                         lives of slum dwellers.
