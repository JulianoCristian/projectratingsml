                         Implementation Status Overview
                         A level II Project restructuring was processed in January 2011 at the request of the Borrower. The restructuring has no impact on the Project development objective to reduce urban
                         poverty in a sustainable manner, targeting the poorest and most vulnerable sections of Salvador and strategic cities of the state of Bahia with access to basic services and improved
                         housing and social support services. The restructuring enables a greater geographic focus in the state's larger urban areas and as such will increase the overall number of
                         beneficiaries, in large part due to the benefits of improved service though access to network infrastructure. The restructuring includes the following changes: (i) focusing of
                         geographic coverage within a sample of the eight eligible municipalities; (ii) change in the scope of coverage to scale-up overall beneficiary impact; (iii) reallocation of funds between
