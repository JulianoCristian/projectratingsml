                                                               months.

I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.    The Bahia Poor Urban Areas Integrated Development Project (Viver Melhor II, as also
      referred to by the Borrower as Bahia Dias Melhores) was an emblematic multi-sectorial
      slum upgrading project for the World Bank urban portfolio in Brazil, following a number of
      previous initiatives in the State of Bahia. The Project was prepared from 2002 through 2006,
      approved by the World Bank Board on December 6, 2005, and declared effective on June 20,
      2006. The original closing date of the Project was January 31, 2011, but it was extended for
      a cumulative 33 months through two restructurings, with a final closing date of October 31,
      2013. Activities remained incomplete at the time of closing.

1.1 Context at Appraisal

2.    Country and sector issues and rationale for Bank involvement. At the time of Project
      preparation and appraisal, the urban poor in Brazil lived predominantly in unplanned
      communities characterized by insecure land tenure, lack of adequate physical infrastructure,
      and lack of access to educational, health and other social services. Their inhabitants were
      also subject to crime victimization, poor health, unemployment, and other self-perpetuating
      conditions of poverty, which has been proven to have a strong correlation with social
      exclusion and informal housing and slums. 1 The State of Bahia was no exception, with
      roughly a third of its urban dwellers – around three million people – living below the
      poverty line. 2

3.    The Viver Melhor II Project was thus designed to alleviate urban poverty in Bahia’s capital,
      Salvador, and in another seven strategic municipalities throughout the state. The Project
      satisfied two of the four vectors in the Bank’s 2003-2007 Country Assistance Strategy
      (CAS) for Brazil: (i) scaling up programs to provide services to the urban poor; and (ii)
      expanding assistance for capacity building at the municipal level. 3

4.    The Project followed a number of multi-sector investment operations in Bahia. These
      included the Novos Alagados Urban Upgrading and Social Promotion Project, begun in 1995
      and financed under Bahia Municipal Infrastructure Development and Management
      (PRODUR, P006562), as well as the Technical and Social Assistance Project of the Urban
      Poverty Reduction Program in the Ribeira Azul Area of Salvador, Bahia (Ribeira Azul,
      P074058), launched in 1999, and also supported by grants from the Cities Alliance. These
      operations incorporated small pilot components aimed at broadening the urban upgrading
      concept through combined physical infrastructure and social services investments.

5.    Viver Melhor II intended to build on the previous experience and increased implementation
      capacity gained by the State through these earlier projects. By incorporating an integrated
      approach toward slum upgrading through combined provision of basic physical
      infrastructure with social services, the Project was designed to meet the lowest-income
      population’s basic needs in a more inclusive and sustainable fashion.

  This was highlighted by a study carried out by the State of Bahia. It was based on the social exclusion mapping and targeting
methodology developed by Professor Aldaisa Sposati in Sao Paulo, and was run for Bahia using data from the 2000 Census.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

6.       Project Development Objective (PDO). The objective of the Project was to reduce urban
         poverty in a sustainable manner in the poorest and most vulnerable sections of Salvador and
         certain other cities in the Borrower’s territory by providing access to basic services and
         improved housing and social support services. 4

7.       Specific objectives. The specific objectives of the Project were: (i) improved quality of life
         and asset base for the urban poor through the provision of basic infrastructure, improvement
         of housing conditions and access to urban land, and regularization of land tenure in slums
         and unplanned settlements; (ii) improved access to social programs in the areas of income
         and employment generation, direct support to the families’ survival strategies, health care,
         education and job training, and initiatives in community security at the local settlement
         level; and (iii) enhanced state and local government capacity to plan, implement, monitor
         and evaluate integrated urban poverty reduction strategies involving several different
         departments, undertake urban upgrading and land delivery, coordinate social delivery on the
         ground through participatory planning, and monitor and evaluate government programs
         through poverty and quality of life indicators.

8.       Key indicators. The original results framework contains one PDO indicator, “Improvement
         in the quality of living conditions for target communities,” as measured by the Índice de
         Vulnerabilidade Social e Urbana (Social and Urban Vulnerability Index), and an additional
         19 intermediate indicators corresponding to the three components. Additional key indicators
         of attainment of the specific objectives included in the PAD were: (i) Improvement in access
         to basic infrastructure, services and housing conditions for 30,000 households located in
         informal urban settlements in 8 municipalities; (ii) Increased access to social programs and
         income generating opportunities and enhanced safety for 78,000 households located in target
         informal urban settlement areas in 8 municipalities; and (iii) Improved capacity of 6 State
         Secretariats and 8 municipalities to plan, implement, monitor and evaluate integrated urban
         poverty reductions strategies.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators

9.       The PDO was not revised as part of the Project restructurings. 5

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

10. The Project’s main targeted beneficiaries were the poorest and most vulnerable segments of
    populations living in informal settlements in Salvador and in strategic cities in the interior of
    Bahia. The original number of beneficiaries targeted was 108,000.

11. As a result of Level II Restructuring completed in 2011, the Project’s geographic coverage
    was reduced to the two municipalities of Salvador and Feira de Santana, which would
    receive more concentrated infrastructure and social services investments in more densely

    The wording of the PDO in the Loan Agreement is used, which is almost identical to the PAD wording.

    For a detailed description of the changes made to the key indicators of the Project, refer to section 1.6, Revised Components.


                                                                     2
       populated territories. While the Project scope was reduced, the total number of intended
       beneficiaries roughly doubled to 201,000. 6

12. A study highlighting key characteristics of the population further confirmed the difficult
    economic conditions under which the target population lived: (i) the level of unemployment
    in the State of Bahia was calculated as 14 percent; (ii) women constituted 74 percent of
    those self-employed, most dealing with the preparation and distribution of food in the
    locality; (iii) 54 percent of households earned less than one minimum salary; (iv) 86 percent
    had no form of Social Security; (v) 86 percent had received no professional training for their
    area of employment; and (vi) there was no micro-credit available to enable small
    entrepreneurs to grow their businesses. 7

1.5 Original Components

13. The Project’s original components are were follows:

14. Component A – Urban Infrastructure Delivery, comprising: (i) urban infrastructure
    investments (drainage, roads, street paving, water supply and sewerage, solid waste
    management, home improvement, replacement housing); (ii) macro-level infrastructure
    (such as road links, collectors, and parks); (iii) low cost housing alternatives; and (iv)
    engineering design and supervision consultancies.

15. Component B – Social Services Delivery, comprising: (i) strengthening of community-based
    organizations (CBOs), government institutions, NGOs, and CBOs providing local social
    services; income and employment generation; health and environmental education; direct
    support to families; sports and cultural education; and crime and violence prevention; (ii)
    refurbishment or construction of communal facilities such as day-care centers, kindergartens,
    facilities for primary education and health care, sports and professional training facilities;
    and (iii) architectural designs and operations and maintenance plans for specific facilities.

16. Component C – Institutional Strengthening and Project Management, comprising: (i) studies
    of various kinds; (ii) strengthening of institutions active with slum upgrading and urban
    poverty reduction, both at the local and state government levels; and (iii) project
    management, including monitoring and evaluation.

1.6 Revised Components

17. The Project’s scope and focus were adjusted through its first restructuring, conducted in
    January 2011. 8 The first restructuring introduced the following changes (refer to Table 1 for
    a summary of the changes made):

18. Geographic coverage / scope. The original geographic scope of the Project was reduced
    from eight to two municipalities (Salvador and Feira de Santana) to focus and intensify the
    impacts of the physical and social interventions in light of the limited resources available.



6
  The revised number of total beneficiaries was calculated along with an in depth re-assessment of the limits of the PISs and PIFs, in
alignment with demographic information from the National Census. Refer to section 1.6 and Table 1 for further detail.
7
  Kraychete G. (2012), Fomento à Economia dos Setores Populares, Urban Development Secretariat and Urban Development
Company, State of Bahia, 2012
8
  Detailed reasons leading to the necessity of a restructuring, including a significant increase in the original cost estimations, are
described in section 2.2, Implementation.


                                                                   3
         The two cities were chosen for their status as the largest municipalities in the state, their
         disproportionate share of urban poverty, and greater capacity to implement Project activities.

19. Targeted beneficiaries. Although the number of municipalities was reduced from eight to
    two, the intensification of activities in Salvador and Feira de Santana, combined with the
    higher population density of these two cities, resulted in an overall increase in the total
    number of intended beneficiaries, from 108,000 to 201,000. Specifically, the restructuring
    significantly increased the number of beneficiaries targeted by Component A’s urban
    infrastructure works and reduced the number targeted by Component B’s social services
    delivery.

20. Results framework. The results framework was modified to reflect the change to the
    Project’s geographic coverage and scope. Modifications were also introduced as a means to
    clarify previous imprecisions. For instance, the original rather vague PDO indicator of
    “Improvement in the quality of living conditions for targeted communities” was replaced by
    five more specific PDO indicators. The original set of 19 intermediate indicators was also
    reduced to 13 to better reflect the new Project priorities, and particularly to account for the
    lack of financial or legal commitments provided for education and health activities described
    in the PAD, resulting in an inability to ensure their implementation.9

1.7 Other significant changes

21. Reallocation of funds among categories and change in percentages of Bank financed
    activities. Project funds were reallocated to account for several factors, including increase in
    Project costs, the need to increase Project management funding, and the shift in Project
    focus away from Component B social services activities. The increase in Project costs was
    driven by a number of economic factors further analyzed in section 2.2. Project management
    funding, formerly supported by a grant for EUR 5 million from the Italian government’s
    Association of Volunteers in International Service (AVSI), ran out. Lastly, Component A
    and C activities were prioritized and scaled up while Component B was scaled down (refer
    to Table 1). The amount and percentage of Bank financing under the different disbursement
    categories was also modified, with an increase from the original 54 to 100 percent of works
    financed, so as to accelerate disbursement while reducing pressure on the counterpart
    funding.

22. Extension of closing date. The closing date of the Project was extended three times, through
    two restructurings. The first restructuring included an initial extension of 12 months, and a
    second conditional extension of 10 months. The second restructuring included the third and
    final closing date extension of 11 months to October 31, 2013, for a cumulative total of 33
    months.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

23. Ambitious scope and PDO. The Project’s quality at entry was affected by the ambitious
    PDO, which placed high expectations on what Project activities should achieve in the target
    communities. The original inclusion of eight municipalities in the geographic scope led to an
    excessive number of sub-projects which had not been assessed in detail at the time of
    preparation. Furthermore, the Project was intended to coordinate with other Bank
    investments in sectors such as education and health, including the Bahia Education Project –
    Second Phase (P070827) and the Bahia Health System Reform Project (P054119), in order
    to achieve synergies. However, the process for achieving these synergies remained unclear,
    and no institutional or legal provisions were made to ensure that they be established. In
    consideration of these challenges, the likelihood of achieving a sustainable reduction of
    urban poverty resulting from deep-seated socio-cultural inequities was over-estimated.

24. Underestimated Project risks. Although the risks of this approach were analyzed at appraisal,
    inter-institutional coordination and cooperation across the political spectrum were both
    underestimated through their “Moderate” ratings. Vertical and horizontal coordination were
    assumed to exist at the outset among secretariats and municipalities, but without the
    appropriate assessment of the necessary financial resources, allocations and legal
    agreements to make such coordination possible. Expectations for the Project’s implementing
    agency, the Secretariat of Urban Development (SEDUR) were also set very high, especially
    considering that the Secretariat had only been established as recently as 2003. Lastly, the
    high social risks linked to resettlement activities, one of the major factors resulting in
    implementation delays, were not taken into consideration in the PAD Risk Framework. Nor
    was the amount of time required to carry out such activities.

25. Low level of implementation readiness. Despite the Project’s lengthy preparation period
    (2002-2006, supported by a grant for USD 1 million from the Japanese Policy and Human
    Resources Development Fund, PHRD), preparation efforts emphasized analysis and
    justification of Project activities over the development of practical technical inputs to
    facilitate implementation. These could have included topographic studies, social cadasters,
    or detailed technical designs, all necessary for implementation, and some of which could
    have been carried out in advance. Likewise, there was a limited level of consideration given
    to ‘readiness’ at entry regarding aspects of the Project that later proved to affect
    implementation, such as how to deal with crime and violence in the Project targeted areas.
    This lack of emphasis on concrete technical inputs during the preparation period also
    contributed to the overall underestimation of Project costs. The technical designs that were
    eventually carried out needed to be redone in 2008 and 2009 due to the changing conditions
    of the Project, indicating a general lack of efficiency in the preparation stage. The extended
    preparation process and lack of implementation readiness also had the effect of increasing
    beneficiaries’ expectations and drawing out resettlement negotiations, which could not be
    accomplished in a timely manner. Because resettlement negotiations could not be initiated
    until the technical designs had been finalized, negotiations began with a significant delay
    and contributed to the slow speed of implementation over the course of the Project.

26. A model for multi-sectorial urban projects in Brazil. Viver Melhor II followed a series of
    prior successful Bank-financed urban development operations in Bahia. The Project’s design
    was therefore driven by the desire to leverage the positive impacts of its predecessors (which
    focused on integrating physical infrastructure and social services delivery in low-income
    communities) and thereby create a new emblematic project for the State of Bahia. To
    implement this comprehensive and integrated approach, the Project’s design focused on two
    types of geographic territories: the Poligonais de Intervencão Física (PIFs –Physical
    Intervention Areas), which combined local infrastructure in smaller areas and macro-level
    infrastructure (such as the Pista de Borda and the São Bartolomeu Park); and the Poligonais
    de Intervencão Social (PISs – Social Intervention Areas), which focused social activities,
    institutional strengthening and productive inclusion inputs, the latter intended to benefit a
    broader spectrum of the population (refer to the map at the end of this report). Through this
    approach, Viver Melhor II has served as a model for a generation of multi-sectorial
    operations in Brazil, and is representative of the preparation and implementation challenges
    of integrated slum upgrading initiatives.

2.2 Implementation

27. Shifting political landscape. The October 2006 elections shifted the political landscape in
    Brazil, both at the national level as well as in the State of Bahia. The landslide victory of the
    left-wing umbrella party, Partido dos Trabalhores (PT), in the elections effectively ended a
    long period of Partido da Frente Liberal (PFL) dominance in Bahia. The incoming
    government that took office on January 1, 2007 sought to reflect the electoral results at the
    level of the Viver Melhor II Project through: (i) replacing the director of the Unidade de
    Gerenciamento do Projeto (UGP – Project Management Unit) in SEDUR; and (ii) making
    adjustments to the Project to meet the changed political priorities, including revising and/or
    stopping components that were at an advanced stage in the bidding process.

28. UGP and UTP implementation capacity. The abrupt switch of political emphasis negatively
    affected the capacity of the implementing UGP and Unidade Técnica do Projeto (UTP –
    Project Implementing Unit) agencies (the later within Companhia de Desenvolvimento
    Urbano – CONDER), resulting in virtually no disbursements of the Bank loan for two years.
    Eventually, the political cost of a stalled project grew in light of the high expectations for the
    Project in target communities. The potential failure of this emblematic and highly visible
    project led state political authorities to appoint new UGP and UTP directors in SEDUR and
    in CONDER in late 2008. The new directors had to essentially re-launch the Project, and
    begin to work toward improving the implementation capacity that had been negatively
    impacted in the 2007-2008 period. The implementation got started, but ramping up and
    getting to a steady pace of execution took time.

29. Increase in total Project costs and loss of purchasing power. Over the course of the lengthy
    preparation and implementation periods, total Project costs increased by 23 percent, from
    USD 82.2 million in the original design to an estimated (as of Project closing date) USD
    100.85 million through completion of the Project’s pending activities (currently scheduled to
    mid-2015). It is worth registering that the Borrower claims to have invested and budgeted
    for additional counterpart funding (not officially reported in the World Bank financial
    management system) to fully complete the Project’s activities 17.

30. Reasons for this significant increase include: (i) high inflation in the construction sector,
    particularly after the launch of the Programa de Aceleração do Crescimento (PAC) in 2007,
    which overheated the market and subsequently raised prices; 18 (ii) the lack of detailed design
    projects at preparation, leading to difficulty in producing reliable cost estimates; and (iii)
    increased costs of housing construction linked to the use of higher housing standards than
    originally anticipated, in accordance with national housing requirements. 19 In addition to the
    increased costs, the Project lost considerable purchasing power due to macro-economic
    developments in Brazil. The fluctuation of the Brazilian Real against the US dollar (in which
    the Bank loan was denominated) was substantially higher than anticipated in the PAD, and


17
   Refer to Annex 1, Table A1-1: Original and Revised Allocations of Project Funds (PAD vs. Project Restructuring, 2011), in USD
(M) and Table A1-2: Allocation of Project Funds through Project Completion, in USD.
18
   Construction costs increased much beyond what the price contingencies of 4 percent of base project costs. The construction price
increased 73 percent from 2005-2013, according to the Sistema Nacional de Pesquisa de Custos e Índices da Construção Civil
(SINAPI). Investments of the PAC program therefore mirrored but also competed by the types of activities proposed by the Bank.
Additionally, the consumer price increased 50% in the same period.
19
   While the original intention was to build just an “embryo” home, which could be expanded later by the beneficiaries, the Project had
to change its designs to produce homes of 42m2 in accordance with national standards for housing construction programs such as PAC
and Programa Minha Casa Minha Vida (PMCMV). In some instances, the finishing details on built houses were upgraded to match
the required standards of houses built under the said programs. Thus, while the PAD had assumed a unit cost of BRL 7,000, the
housing units built in the years 2011-2013 range from BRL 55,000 to as high as BRL 70,000.


                                                                  7
     the loan lost about 29 percent of its value due to Real appreciation. Additionally, the delayed
     implementation translated into later disbursements than projected, with the result that higher
     inflation eroded the purchasing power of the Bank loan in Brazil (since about 99.85 percent
     of project expenditure was in local currency). The sharp increase in costs required a forced
     increase in counterpart funding from the original USD 32.9 million to a total of 62.5 million,
     or an 89 percent increase.

31. Level II Project Restructuring. The Level II Restructuring was carried out as an attempt to
    redirect activities in a more realistic manner, as well as adjust to the changing circumstances
    of the Project. The restructuring attempted to account for the loss of purchasing power and
    adapt to changing political priorities after the 2006 state elections by redirecting financial
    resources to Component A infrastructure and Component C institutional strengthening
    activities. The reduced geographic scope was intended to intensify activities and reduce the
    high risks to implementation involving the original eight municipalities. Lastly, the
    restructuring addressed the increased burden on the State for counterpart funding by
    increasing the disbursement percentage of the “Works” loan category from 54 to 100 percent
    financing by the Bank. The restructuring did not revise the PDO (which could have occurred
    through a Level I Restructuring) and only addressed shortcomings of the results framework
    to reflect the Project’s new scope and priorities. As such, the PDO remained ambitious given
    the investments financed, and the indicators do not adequately reflect the range of activities
    carried out.

32. Turnover in Project leadership within the Bank. The changes of directors and staff at the
    Bahia state level were matched at the end of 2008 by the departure of the World Bank task
    manager who had been associated with the Project since the start of preparation in 2004. A
    succession of five Bank task managers followed during the remainder of the Project
    implementation period 2009-2013. The high turnover of Bank task managers implied a loss
    of institutional memory, and the need for the Borrower to assist each incoming task manager
    in becoming familiar with the complex project. The frequent change of Bank leadership,
    however, was partially mitigated by the Brasilia-based co-task manager who remained
    unchanged for most of the period from 2010 onwards.

33. The nature of resettlement under the Project. Activities related to resettlement became
    increasingly critical to the implementation process over the course of the Project. First,
    initiation of resettlement activities was delayed by the lack of technical designs at the
    beginning of implementation. In order for many of the works to begin construction,
    resettlement of families living on the sites had to be previously resolved. This was a lengthy
    process resulting in even further delay. Additionally, the resettlement process required the
    UTP to adapt to constantly evolving conditions at each site, especially the pressure of new
    families moving into the intervention areas over the duration of the Project. This also
    affected the implementation pace, as it added to the complexity of the social work carried
    out.

34. Crime and Violence. Crime and violence on occasion and to some extent also interfered with
    Project implementation. As drug gangs were present in the Project areas of intervention,
    sometimes (especially when there were confrontations between gangs or between gangs and
    the police) the functioning of the works’ sites had to be temporarily suspended. Site visits of
    the Bank during supervision missions were arranged in close coordination with the social
    team working with the targeted communities, which mitigated any potentially sensitive
    situations.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

35. M&E Design. A comprehensive Monitoring and Evaluation plan was developed by the Bank
    preparation team to track the progress and impact of the Project. The plan was part of a
    broader initiative to better assess the impact of Bank projects, Development Impact
    Evaluation (DIME), where a number of projects were selected as pilots, including the Bahia
    Poor Urban Areas Integrated Development Project. As originally planned, the Project
    implementing agency, CONDER, was to use its management information system and special
    periodic household surveys to provide the data on which it would produce quarterly results
    reports. Overall, the Project incorporated a sophisticated approach to M&E in its design,
    which theoretically included a rigorous impact evaluation. The original 19 intermediate
    indicators reflected the broad scope of the PDO and ambitious goals related to specific
    sectors, with indicators measuring achievement in areas ranging from health and education
    to violence reduction.

36. M&E Implementation. The limitations of the original M&E framework became apparent
    over the course of implementation, reflecting the broader limitations of overall Project
    design. Through the restructuring, the results framework was therefore modified in an
    attempt to better reflect the Project’s new focus and concentration of activities. The
    restructured Project produced a total of 18 indicators, (five of them PDO indicators, 13
    intermediary indicators). Reporting on two of the new PDO indicators required that
    satisfaction surveys be carried out with beneficiaries, while the remaining three required a
    geographic analysis of the intervention areas. Although the DIME team provided technical
    assistance during the results framework review that occurred during restructuring, a
    comprehensive impact evaluation was never conducted as originally planned.

37. Despite these efforts, the modified results framework remained limited and continued to
    reflect a misalignment with the actual Project activities carried out, as well as a lack of
    accurate understanding of the possible achievements within such a particular high density
    urban context. This is partially due to the fact that baseline values were not fully available at
    the time of restructuring. When achievement of indicators was assessed after Project closing,
    and the necessary satisfaction surveys and geographic analyses were carried out and reported,
    many of the target values were found to be not consistent with and uninformative about the
    Project’s actual achievements. 20, 21



20
   For example, the PDO indicator measuring “Improved infrastructure and social services: Increase in the percentage of households
within 250m of paved roads” failed to take into account that a 250m radius is much too large for the dense urban context of the Project
communities receiving infrastructure works. When the baseline was eventually calculated, it came to 92.5 percent, and thus the
previously defined target indicator value of a 60 percent increase above the baseline became mathematically meaningless (by bringing
the target value well over 100 percent). At closing, the measured value of this indicator was 8 percent (increase above the baseline),
indicating that 100 percent of households now had access to paved roads. A smaller radius would have been more informative of the
number of households benefitting from road paving. Similarly, the PDO indicator measuring “Improved infrastructure and social
services: Increase in the percentage of households within a 1km radius of social equipment (improved park, public plaza, soccer fields,
community center)” failed to consider that a 1km radius may have been too large to reflect a meaningful impact of Project activities,
since most of the households were already located within 1km of these social facilities.
21
   The satisfaction surveys carried out after the closing of the Project revealed further limitations of the results framework. The
baseline indices of satisfaction calculated for the first two PDO indicators, “Increase in the index of satisfaction with basic sanitation
conditions in the intervention areas” and “Increase in the index of satisfaction with the provision of new social equipment in the
intervention areas” were 2.18 and 0.33 (on a scale of 0 to 5), respectively, both with target values of a 25 percent increase above the
baseline. However, a 25 percent increase would bring the indices to 2.73 and 0.41, which would leave the index of satisfaction within
the same range on the classification scale as the original baseline, reflecting no real qualitative improvement in the level of satisfaction.
While the first indicator was Not Achieved (with an index of 2.13) and the second was Achieved (with an index of 2.04), the structure
of the indicators reveals serious flaws in their overall design, and should be taken into account when assessing the results framework.


                                                                     9
38. Lastly, the results framework fell short in capturing the depth of social activities carried out
    by the Project, especially those related to resettlement. Resettlement practices developed by
    the UGP over the course of the Project were later adopted at the statewide level. The UGP
    also carried out extensive supplemental activities with affected families related to
    “productive inclusion,” such as vocational training and skills development to support social
    and economic inclusion within their communities. These activities are not fully taken into
    account in the indicators provided.

39. Throughout the Project, the Borrower produced satisfactory quarterly reports on
    intermediate indicators. Information reported was generated by an automated system with
    the support of CONDER’s GIS department (INFORMS), producing a highly reliable and
    detailed source of information. However, it should be noted that while the UGP has carried
    out careful reporting of indicators, it has also undertook a fairly conservative assessment of
    its own activities to ensure the accuracy of results reported. For example, the intermediate
    indicator “Number of households with improved housing conditions,” only counts new
    homes, improved homes, and monitored indemnifications. Families receiving only cash
    compensation without additional monitoring by the UGP were not counted, as the UGP
    could not guarantee whether their new homes purchased were an improvement on the
    previous residence, or how effectively the compensation money was spent.

40. M&E Utilization. The limitations mentioned above have interfered with possibilities for
    M&E utilization, since the indicators do not reflect the full range and depth of activities
    carried out. The results framework has therefore limited the Borrower’s utilization of
    indicators for communication purposes about the achievements of Project implementation.
    The inadequacies of the framework also forced the Task Team and the Borrower to develop
    alternative mechanisms for data collection to supply data for the ICR, such as applying
    surveys to sub-samples of the population that had received infrastructure works.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

41. The Borrower has demonstrated a high quality of resettlement, environmental monitoring,
    and financial management procedures over the course of the Project.

42. Involuntary Resettlement. Resettlement was guided by the goal of moving households out of
    high-risk areas to new housing located at a maximum distance of 1 km from the original
    homes in order to minimize the impact on the community’s social fabric and residents’
    income-earning possibilities. Resettled households were presented with three options: (i)
    cash compensation (or indemnification); (ii) assisted purchase (“monitored
    indemnification”) of replacement housing; and (iii) monitored resettlement to newly
    constructed houses. The practice of “monitored indemnification” conducted by the Project
    was considered an important one. It was incorporated to the Borrower’s overall resettlement
    procedures during implementation, thus revealing interesting results 22. As of Project closing
    the two key indicators of resettlement had been surpassed. 23



22
  For details, refer to section 3.5c.
23
  The two indicators surpassed are: (i) 92 percent of households in high-risk areas or living under unhealthy conditions resettled
compared to the target value of 60 percent; and (ii) 1,332 households had been resettled from high-risk areas or unhealthy conditions
compared to the target value of 983 households. At the time of Project closing a total of 1,750 families had been resettled of whom 62
percent had opted for new housing, 21 percent for cash compensation, 12 percent for assisted purchase, and 5 percent for continued
legal proceedings, possibly in the hope of receiving higher compensation. In the only housing development concluded at Project
closing, Feira de Santana, only 4 percent (14 out of 358) of families sold their new housing. The national percentage is 12 percent of


                                                                 10
43. At Project closing there were still 832 pending cases of resettlement, which has since been
    reduced to 795 as of January 2014. Of these 795 cases, 661 (83 percent) are tied to the
    delivery of new housing units, a majority of which (535) are expected to be delivered by
    August 2014, with the remaining units by August 2015. 24 Refer to Table 2 and Table 3 for
    more detailed information on pending resettlement and on works to be carried out after the
    closing date.

44. An additional resettlement challenge was the influx of new families into high-risk or
    unsanitary areas. 25 To mitigate this impact, almost all Project interventions included design
    features to prevent the encroachment of new unplanned settlements within the Project
    areas. 26

45. Fiduciary Aspects. Procurement routines and the quality of the documents were overall
    found to be of good quality during Project implementation. There were no major
    shortcomings identified by supervision. Financial Management (FM) performance is rated
    Moderately Satisfactory, consistent with the UGP’s timely and reliable provision of
    information required to manage and monitor the implementation of the Project. The
    Project’s financial statements (Interim Financial Reports, or IFRs) were submitted on a
    quarterly basis and overall information has been accurate. All loan proceeds have been
    disbursed (100 percent) and properly documented by closing date. Counterpart funds had an
    84 percent disbursement and execution ratio by the closing date 28. External audit reports
    arrived at the Bank in time, with an Unqualified Opinion (CY12).

46. Some shortcomings in FM were present throughout implementation: (i) financial statements
    revealed overall low budget execution, and (ii) counterpart spending after Project closing
    was below what was estimated by the UGP. During the last missions, the Task Team
    appropriately followed with the State Government on their commitment to Project



resale within a short time period. These families had received their houses free-of-charge and were in practice able to transfer
ownership, or at least occupancy, to other families, promptly although there is a notional blocking period of at least three years.
24
   These units are part of the second stage of the São Bartolomeu urban upgrading.
25
   The number of households living in risk (whose situation was to be addressed by the Project, either by resettlement or by other
measures) went up from the original baseline of 983 to 1,448.
26
   For example, in the Ribeira Azul area, a road (Pista de Borda) was constructed along the perimeter of the community that could
serve as a barrier for future unplanned settlements in high-risk or unsanitary areas. In São Bartolomeu Park, fences were constructed
around the border of the park to serve a similar function.

         implementation, including guarantees that the flow of counterpart funds will not be blocked
         for the payment of remaining contracts in FY14 and FY15.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

47. As of the closing date, Project activities were not fully completed. However, all but one of
    the remaining works have been contracted with construction underway, and the Borrower is
    committed to completing the remaining works. 29 Key issues in the post-completion phase
    include:

48. Completion of resettlement. There are currently 795 pending cases of resettlement, a
    majority of which are tied to the delivery of new housing units. All pending resettlement
    activities, including those involving cash compensation, monitored indemnification, and
    judicial compensation 30, will continue to be monitored by the Task Team in accordance with
    OP 4.12.

49. O&M of shared infrastructure. The O&M of São Bartolomeu Park and other facilities such
    as the nursery school and community center will be carried out in accordance with a
    Management Plan. The Plan has been fully developed, but final agreements between the
    State, municipalities and private firms remain pending.

50. Overall O&M and land use control in the Project areas. The State of Bahia and
    municipalities of Salvador and Feira de Santana will assume responsibility for managing
    different elements within the Project areas. Sanitation works fall under EMBASA, the state
    water supply and sanitation concessionaire that has proven capacity for the task. Other
    infrastructure works, such as management of the roads, fall under the municipalities. Once
    completed, the constructed works are commissioned and delivered to the respective
    municipality that commits, in a formal agreement, to provide the necessary financial
    resources and institutional capacity to operate and maintain the works efficiently and
    sustainably. By the completion of this ICR, Feira de Santana agreement was signed;
    Salvador one was still pending full completion of the Project works. While the capacity of
    these municipalities is generally much lower than that of the State, their status as the two
    largest cities in Bahia supports the expectation that they will be able to manage these works
    effectively, despite inherent risks to operational sustainability, especially in areas such as
    solid waste collection and infrastructure maintenance.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: High

51. The relevance of the Project Development Objectives, Design, and the method of
    implementation is rated High because of its close fit with the World Bank Group’s former
    Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Brazil covering 2003-2007 31 (effective at the time of
    appraisal) and current Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Brazil covering 2012-2015. 32
    The project also supports Target 11 under the Millennium Development Goal 7 that deals
    with slum upgrading programs.

52. Additionally, the Project has a high relevance to policies at the state and national level.
    Subsequent PT Governments have continued to stress increased equity and reduced poverty,
    both objectives which the Project supported through its clear targeting of the urban poor.
    The Project directly supported Bahia’s statewide development strategy, Plano Estratégico
    da Bahia, 2003-2020 (PEB), which had similar objectives to the Bank’s former CAS for
    2003-2007, and is aligned with the general objectives of the national PAC program
    (launched during Project implementation, on January 28, 2007) and its successor PAC 2. For
    the Northeast region in particular, the PAC program allocated 55 percent of total projected
    costs to social and urban sectors.

From 2012-2015, the Bank will focus on: (i) increasing the volume and productivity of public and private investment; (ii) improving
the quality of public services for low-income households and expanding their provision through public and private channels; (iii)
promoting regional economic development through improved policies, strategic infrastructure investments and support for private
sector actors in frontier areas; and (iv) further improving the sustainable management of natural resources and enhancing resilience to
climate shocks while maximizing contributions to local economic development and helping to meet rising global food demand.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives 33
Rating: Modest

53. The Project Development Objective was to reduce urban poverty in a sustainable manner,
    targeting the poorest and most vulnerable sections of Salvador and strategic cities of the
    State of Bahia with access to basic services and improved housing and social support
    services. Three out of the five PDO indicators have been achieved. Nine out of the 13
    intermediate outcome indicators have also been achieved.

54. The rationale behind the proposed Modest rating lies in the fact that: (i) there was a non-
    negligible amount of uncompleted infrastructure and resettlement activities by the Project’s
    closing date; and (ii) Component A’s revised IBRD cost estimates (as per the Project
    Restructuring) account for 73 percent of the total Project costs, but only two of its five
    intermediate indicators were achieved.

55. Despite the above, several positive aspects should be highlighted: (i) a majority of pending
    works are due for completion by end of August 2014; (ii) given the shortcomings of the
    results framework, not all achievements are accounted for in the PDO and intermediate
    indicators; (iii) although Components B and C comprise a smaller percentage of Project
    activities than Component A, overall they reflect satisfactory levels of achievement.

3.3 Efficiency
Rating: Modest

56. The economic evaluation during appraisal was conducted using cost benefit analysis,
    measuring the benefits through a hedonic prices approach. For the ICR a cost benefit
    analysis was applied as well 34. However, the hedonic prices approach was not used due to
    lack of information regarding increase in price on the benefited properties caused by the
    Project. Instead, avoided cost, travel time, and willingness to pay approaches were applied
    based on gains obtained with the Project. The evaluation was carried out for the following
    interventions: a) Parks and Cultural center; b) Drainage; c) Daycare facilities; and d)
    Housing. Total investment evaluated corresponded to about 46 percent of total funds
    implemented.

57. Actual Costs and benefits were transformed to 2005 prices to make them comparable to
    those used at appraisal. For doing so, actual prices were adjusted by exchange rate
    fluctuations and inflation rate. This is very important, as the Brazilian real appreciated
    during the period and construction price increased as well. Results of the analysis of the loan
    proceeds show that real cost of the works was 46 percent lower than what was expected. In
    reality, the overall impact on costs was absorbed by the counterpart funding which increased
    by 89 percent (or 36 percent of total Project cost) during Project life. It was also absorbed by
    changes in activities during the restructuring and reduced scope.

58. The summary of results shows that the outcome of the Project has had important benefits for
    Bahia, as overall benefits are 25 percent higher than total costs and return of the Project on


33
   It should be highlighted that this performance assessment was made only against the revised design and results framework of the
Project. Although the restructuring process took place more than 4 years into Project implementation, at the occasion disbursement
was only at 21% of the total loan amount. It accounted for startup activities, as most of the critical activities leading to the PDO would
be implemented during the three final implementation years.
34
   Refer to Annex 3.


                                                                   14
      average is 16 percent. This is above the opportunity cost of capital of 12 percent. It is,
      however, lower than what was anticipated in ex-ante economic analysis of the Project in the
      PAD (in the range of 34 to 38 percent for the areas of Alagados VI and Pau da Lima, and 16
      to 25 percent for the other areas).

59. Additionally, the per unit costs of the housing units, even once brought to the 2005 price,
    remains high, with an average of USD 11,482 per home, excluding underlying infrastructure.
    This is relatively high if compared with international benchmarks, 35 highlighting a relatively
    low efficiency of the Project.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

60. Based on the Project’s achievement of objectives (Modest), relevance (High) and efficiency
    (Modest), the Overall Outcome Rating is MU.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

61. The Project targeted a socioeconomically disadvantaged population in Salvador and Feira de
    Santana. A 2009 study undertaken by Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (IBGE)
    within the national household survey Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domicílios
    (PNAD) estimated the open unemployment at 14 percent and the level of self-employment
    at 44 percent of the economically active population.

62. A Project study found that 74 percent of the targeted households were headed by a woman,
    of whom about 52 percent earned a living from preparing and selling food out of her own
    residence. About 54 percent of households earned less than one minimum salary and 14
    percent were assessed to have negative incomes. General education levels were low and 86
    percent had not had any professional training for their livelihood, nor was there any access
    to micro-credit. It is not surprising to find that 80 percent of households had no access to
    social security. 36

63. The activities under the Project to train these poor and usually self-employed income earners
    were welcomed by the beneficiaries who reported raised income levels as they became more
    proficient in calculating the costs of the goods they offered and in seeking out niches with
    improved economic prospects.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

64. About USD 11.66 million was spent on institutional strengthening activities, corresponding
    to about 15 percent of total executed Project funds. The funds were spent on consultant
    services, training and equipment to build SEDUR’s capacity in planning and managing
    urban development projects. SEDUR had only been created in 2003, but gained sufficient
    capacity over the course of the Project period to manage and monitor its complex activities.
    SEDUR worked in tandem with CONDER, a State enterprise that had existed since 1973,
    and had been successful in implementing earlier Bank-financed projects.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

65. Monitored indemnifications. The UGP developed new and effective practices related to the
    Project’s resettlement activities, which have since been adopted as standard practice
    throughout the State of Bahia. The use of “monitored indemnifications,” whereby the UGP
    assists families receiving cash compensation through the process of finding a new home,
    became increasingly popular with affected families over the course of the Project. Monitored
    indemnifications allowed the UGP to better ensure that cash compensation funds were spent
    effectively, and that the quality of the new homes purchased reflected an improvement over
    the former residence. 37 Furthermore, oftentimes they represented an option for accelerating
    negotiations on resettlement during implementation.

66. Training programs for the self-employed. As a result of the Project’s activities in technical
    training and assistance for low income self-employed households as a means of raising
    income levels, the Government of Bahia launched a state-level program, Vida Melhor, to
    continue and expand these activities. 38

67. Synergy with other development programs. Some sub-projects with technical designs that
    could not be accommodated under the Viver Melhor II Project (due to the financing
    shortfalls) were implemented with PAC funding that had very similar development
    objectives. Similarly, there was synergy with programs financed by the national BNDES and
    by the IDB in the Ribeira area.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

N/A




37
   At the time of Project closing, a total of 162 monitored indemnifications had been carried out. Currently, 26 remain pending (refer
to Table 2).
38
   As established through Decree No. 13.167 on August 11, 2011


                                                                  16
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Substantial

68. Activities completion risk. Counterpart funding in the amount of USD 25.3 million has been
    fully allocated in the State budget for the completion of remaining works (refer to Table A1-
    2). All except one of the pending construction works have been bid, with the majority
    scheduled for completion by mid-2014 (refer to Table 3).

69. Sustainability of O&M arrangements. The finalization and signing of formal agreements for
    the O&M plan for São Bartolomeu Park and related facilities is still pending. Furthermore,
    operational risks exist tied to the limited capacity of the municipalities to operate and
    maintain the built facilities, as discussed in section 2.5.

70. Political risk. The upcoming statewide elections in 2014 will bring in a new administration,
    which may have different priorities and perhaps less political investment in the Project’s
    pending activities. This scenario could negatively affect the sustainability of the
    infrastructure built under the Project.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Unsatisfactory

71. Bank performance during preparation is rated Unsatisfactory. Quality at Entry was
    compromised by the Project’s overambitious PDO and scope, underestimation of risks, and
    low level of implementation readiness. The likelihood of accomplishing the Project’s stated
    goal to achieve a sustainable reduction of urban poverty in the most vulnerable population
    segments in eight municipalities throughout the State of Bahia was therefore low from the
    beginning. The Bank ensured continuity in staffing, as the core preparation team of the Viver
    Melhor II was the same who worked in earlier urban development projects in Bahia. Project
    preparation was also supported by technical assistance grants from the Cities Alliance
    (through the Italian AVSI grant), and the Japanese-financed PHRD. This, however, did not
    prove sufficient to ensure a high Quality at Entry of the Project.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

72. Bank performance during supervision is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Continuity in task
    management was ensured with the same task manager during the two years of preparation
    and the first three years of supervision. However, the rest of the supervision period was
    characterized by high TTL turnover, and this was viewed by the Borrower as a factor
    negatively affecting implementation. In particular, the Bank provided substantial supervision
    resources to help the Bahia counterparts rebuild the implementation capacity that had been
    impaired during the years 2007-2008. As a result, the Bank supervision costs rose from an
    annual level of around USD 100,000 during the first two years of supervision to USD
    140,000 during the subsequent two years of restructuring and capacity rebuilding.
    Supervision missions were well staffed and scheduled at least every six months. Overall, the
    World Bank and Borrower teams established a strong working relationship with each other,
    benefitting from a high level of cooperation on both sides. Specifically, the Bank worked


                                               17
     with UGP and UTP to adapt to evolving Project circumstances and solve problems as they
     came up over the course of the Project, especially in the area of procurement. However,
     restructuring of the Project had some shortcomings, particularly related to the M&E
     framework.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

73. The Rating of Overall Bank Performance is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory, given the U
    rating for Quality at Entry and the MS rating for Quality of Supervision.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

74. Government performance is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. Although the ownership of the
    Project design was high at the outset, and overall the Project was supported throughout the
    implementation period, the high turnover of counterpart staff during the first two years of
    implementation motivates the MU rating. The turnover disrupted the continuity from earlier
    political administrations and impaired implementation capacity. Additionally, the Project
    was not viewed as a priority by the new administration, further impairing Project
    implementation. Lastly, the Bahia State government was late in providing counterpart funds
    in spite of commitments made in the last year of Project implementation, and the delays
    negatively affected the pace of activities.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

75. The performance of the implementing agencies is rated Moderately Satisfactory. SEDUR
    and CONDER exhibited a strong track record in building and applying implementation
    capacity. There was however a non-negligible inter institutional transaction cost involved in
    every Project procedure throughout the implementation period, due to the dual arrangement
    (UGP & UTP). Despite this, and especially after mid-2011 (when internal political
    alignment within the State was reached), the two agencies were also able to develop a new
    model of collaboration and coordination which did not exist previously.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

76. The Overall Borrower Performance is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory due to the
    shortcomings during the important first two years of project implementation and delays in
    providing counterpart funding on a timely basis.

6. Lessons Learned

    1. An investment loan dealing with slum upgrading should have an integrated
       approach to social and physical urban interventions. The Project was correct in
       matching the improvements in physical infrastructure with social infrastructure delivery
       and the build-up of capacity of community-based organizations. The deep-rooted socio-
       cultural causes of the problems of the lowest income populations living in slums require a


                                               18
         holistic approach to development. An investment project attempting to tackle challenges
         of slums should include activities in areas such as education, vocational training, health,
         crime reduction and violence prevention. These areas however should be properly linked
         to the project in terms of financial incentives and institutional set up, including all due
         consents from different levels of administration (to be cleared by project appraisal). For
         future projects, Bank teams should carefully consider: (i) the right balance and tradeoffs
         between social and physical interventions, and ‘being comprehensive’ versus ‘being more
         operationally realistic’; (ii) the sustainability of social interventions after project
         completion; and (iii) the limited capacity to monitor the impact of social interventions in
         the medium and long term.

    2. Setting realistic expectations, balancing scope and depth of project. Given the long
       legacy of the development problems and opportunities in slum areas, the design of
       effective solutions require a coherent long term strategy and adequate time and resources
       to pursue it. The Bank in particular might need to calibrate its expectations regarding
       advances that could realistically be achieved in the course of a five-year project (as seen
       in this and in several other slum upgrading projects in Brazil and elsewhere 39) and clarify
       what is meant by poverty reduction. Alternatively, the Bank may need to be prepared to
       undertake longer or multi-phase projects from the start. Assessing the importance of
       achieving gradual and small scale improvements (such as providing new homes,
       improving sanitation coverage, or increasing access to educational facilities) could help
       in setting expectations for the project as a whole, and later in assessing the project’s
       impact and its contribution to sustainable poverty reduction in a targeted area.

    3. It is important to size the right project for the right level of administration. Slum
       upgrading requires physical interventions whose scope is often within municipal
       authority. It is risky to support the state to take on housing construction and micro-
       infrastructure supply (such as roads and drainage), as well as social facilities whose
       operation will be shared, since these are not always the state’s real area of competence,
       expertise, jurisdiction and/or strength. In the case of the Viver Melhor II Project, this can
       threaten the availability of funds for completion of project activities. It can also pose
       future risks to the sustainability of the investments. Further and more broadly speaking,
       the relationship between the state and municipalities is often dependent on political
       alliances which may shift over elections, impacting the implementation and/or
       sustainability of the project. In light of this experience, the Bank should reframe its urban
       agenda in Brazil to engage more directly with large municipalities or state capitals, in
       order to strengthen institutional urban management expertise at the municipal level,
       notably on aspects related to land use control. On the other hand, the Bank could choose
       to engage with the States to impact urban development in a larger number of small cities;
       however, in so doing, not only the type of intervention (micro versus trunk infrastructure)
       should be carefully evaluated, but also strong institutional and financial linkages (State &
       Municipalities) should be guaranteed from the beginning.

    4. Project preparation of an investment loan should strike the right balance between
       readiness to implement and flexibility in project design. It is advisable that during


39
   Examples are Recife Urban Upgrading Project (P0499265), closed in March 2011 with uncompleted activities after 7
and half years of implementation (including a 2 years extension); Sao Luis Enhancing Municipal Government and
Quality of Life Project (P094315) currently under implementation and with projected 7 years implementation period
(including 2 years extension). The Barrio Ciudad Project (P088319) in Honduras also implemented (but not fully
completed) over 8 years.


                                                        19
    project preparation, efforts be focused on getting the project ready for an early roll out,
    by defining activities in detail and dedicating resources to prepare detailed technical
    designs, a social cadaster of targeted areas, topographies and geo-referencing of works to
    be undertaken. This will leverage early mobilization of counterpart funding, show early
    results of the project, help manage expectations among stakeholders, and elevate
    momentum. On the other hand, it is also advisable to leave some measure of flexibility
    into the overall design, including dividing works into modules to maximize articulation
    of project execution and to ensure that some activities can be adjusted over time if
    conditions (social, political) require it. Flexibility also needs to be taken into account
    when agreeing on the project’s table of loan categories, amounts allocated, and
    percentages of expenditures eligible for financing, as this can support faster project
    execution.

5. Bank engagement in urban and slum upgrading projects should include work on
   housing policy and finance at local level. When preparing and implementing urban and
   slum upgrading projects, the Bank should further consider: (i) to prioritize (to the extent
   possible under OP.BP 4.12) coordinated solutions for resettlement with existing low
   income financing programs at National or State level, rather than allocating direct
   financing for it; (ii) to engage and work with the Clients on aspects related to housing
   policy and finance – development of cost efficient and innovative solutions; and
   development, regulation and implementation of existing tools and instruments for urban
   development, land management and private sector participation.

6. Teams dealing with projects targeting at-risk and vulnerable areas should carefully
   consider variables that may be difficult to control. A project like Viver Melhor II
   includes a number of variables that are hard to control in terms of the impact they could
   have on execution – time, cost, effectiveness. At the outset, these variables need to be
   carefully examined, identified as risks whenever necessary, and mitigation plans need to
   be set up. Particularly, a team should assess the potential risks and impacts associated
   with: (i) organized crime and violence in the targeted areas; (ii) different strategies
   needed to handle different local communities, their expectations and demands; (iii)
   difficulty in document collection from the targeted population (this had strong impact on
   titling issuance under the Project); and (iv) resettlement complexity (assessing the
   availability of compensation options at entry and taking into account regular processing
   and judicial recourse times is critical).

7. Sequencing in core activities linked to slum upgrading projects could be the key to a
   successful project implementation. In slum upgrading projects, there is a need for a
   greater understanding during project preparation of the sequencing of activities in the
   implementation process, and their impact on the overall project timeline. Specifically,
   resettlement activities were found to dictate the timeline for project implementation. It is
   thus fundamental to allocate the right amount of energy during project preparation (and
   ideally by appraisal) in: (i) defining eligible areas of intervention; (ii) developing reliable
   topography and soil prospections; (iii) getting at least part of the detailed technical
   designs completed (the ones for the priority investments); and (iv) preparing social
   cadasters. Jointly, these will allow for a qualified baseline to assess costs and overall
   resettlement needs (including compensation options and sources of funds). The project
   ideally should be ready for a prompt roll out once it becomes effective (streamline of the
   negotiations with the families, and preparation of bidding documents); or, otherwise,
   these aspects should be factored in project length (additional 1-2 years of



                                             20
       implementation), as well as expected disbursements and communication strategies
       adjusted accordingly.

   8. Bank fiduciary approaches to project supervision could be better integrated,
      harmonized and congruent to clients’ capacities, in order to reduce project
      management costs and facilitate day to day routine supervision and implementation.
      FM and procurement were applied to Viver Melhor II project execution with different
      underlying modalities and visions. The former had (and in general is characterized by) a
      more holistic, comprehensive approach that focuses on ex-post ‘remedies’ (for instance
      funds ineligibility) as deemed necessary; the latter has more of a day to day
      accompanying approach, focused on step by step processing and contracting. It could be
      conceived that the two be more integrated and applied holistically, potentially bringing
      some savings to project management.

                      for the adjacent communities of urban poor. The park was previously under threat to
                      be permanently impaired through encroachment of unplanned communities, which has
                      been prevented by the Project’s upgrading activities in the area;

                                  Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1. The Bahia Poor Urban Areas Integrated Development Project (Viver Melhor II Project)
   comprised investments in (i) urban infrastructure services; (ii) social services; and (iii)
   improved institutional capacity. The project benefited a wide range of the population. There
   were people directly benefitting from new housing, those benefitting from an improved urban
   environment and provision of urban services (including streets newly paved, drainage, water
   and sewerage works, and safeguarded parks); and those benefitting from social infrastructure,
   such as day-care centers, markets, and community meeting facilities.

2. The economic evaluation during appraisal was conducted using cost benefit analysis,
   measuring the benefits through hedonic prices approach. A sample of surveyed households
   were asked to assign values to the houses they occupied (either as tenants or as owners) and,
   in addition, were asked to report on a large number of urban characteristics in the areas they
   lived in. Through regression analysis the variations in housing values were then associated
   with a large number of attributes of urban infrastructure where the variations in the housing
   prices could be then taken as a proxy for variations in the quality of the houses themselves
   and the surrounding infrastructure.

3. For the ICR a cost benefit analysis was applied as well. However, hedonic prices approach
   was not used due to lack of information regarding increase in price on the benefited
   properties caused by the project. Instead avoided cost, travel time, and willingness to pay
   approaches were applied based on gains obtained with the project. The evaluation was carried
   out for the following interventions: a) Parks and Cultural center; b) Drainage; c) Daycare
   facilities; and d) Housing. Total investment evaluated corresponded to about 50 percent of
   total implemented.

4. Actual Costs and benefits were transformed to 2005 prices to make them comparable to those
   used at appraisal. For doing so, actual prices were adjusted by exchange rate fluctuations and
   inflation rate. This is very important as the Brazilian real appreciated during the period and
   construction price increased as well. Results show that real cost of the works was 46 percent
   lower than what it was expected. The overall cost impact was absorbed by the counterpart
   funding which increased by 89 percent (or 36 percent of total project cost) during project life.
   It was also absorbed by changes in activities during the restructuring.

5. The summary of results show that the outcome of the project has had important benefits for
   Bahia, as overall benefits are 25 percent higher than costs and return of the project is 16
   percent. This is above the opportunity cost of capital of 12 percent. It is however, lower than
   what was anticipated in ex-ante economic analysis of the project in the PAD (in the range of
   34 to 38 percent for the areas of Alagados VI and Pau da Lima, and in the range of 16 to 25
   percent in other areas).

6. Additionally, the per unit costs of the housing unit, even once brought to 2005 price remains
   high, to an average USD 11,482 per home, excluding underlying infrastructure. This is
   relatively high if compared with international benchmarks, 42 highlighting a relatively low
   efficiency of the project.

Methodology

8. The economic evaluation during appraisal was conducted using cost benefit analysis,
   measuring the benefits through hedonic prices approach. For the ICR a cost benefit analysis
   was applied as well; however hedonic prices approach was not used to measure the benefits
   due to lack of information regarding increase in price on the benefited properties caused by
   the project. Instead avoided cost, travel time, and willingness to pay were applied based on
   actual gains obtained with the project. Costs and benefits were included as they actually
   occurred during and after the implementation. To make costs and benefits comparable with
   those used at appraisal, they were adjusted to 2005 prices by the impact of inflation and
   exchange rate differences. Net benefit of the project was estimated as the incremental benefit
   from two scenarios: with and without project. The without project scenario was projected
   assuming that the situation existing at time of appraisal remained; while with project scenario
   was projected including benefits already attained with the works. The cash flows were
   discounted using the same discount rate used at appraisal, which was 12 percent.

Benefits Analysis

9. Among the benefits already seen from the works are: a) drainage works have reducted risks
   and losses to property due to flooding; b) urban upgrade has shown productivity gains in
   improved urban areas; c) the park of São Bartolomeu has shown environmental
   improvement and increase access to recreational activities and training; c) public space
   infrastructure has allowed access to daycare facilities in the project area; d) road
   rehabilitation has facilitated access to some communities; and e) improved institutional
   capacity.

10. At the time of the ICR there was not enough information to evaluate all the components, but
    the evaluation includes the following: a) Parks and Cultural center; b) Drainage; c) Daycare
    facilities; and d) Housing. The cost of theses interventions comprises about 50 percent of total
    project cost.

11. The following approaches were used to measure the benefits: a) avoided damage cost for the
    drainage component; b) willingness to pay and saving costs were applied for the park; and c)
    travel time and savings costs for daycare facilities. Results were added to avoid double
    counting benefits. The avoided damage costs were based on data from previous flooding
    events. Travel time and savings costs were based on surveys carried out on the field



                                                27
      comparing with and without project situations. Willingness to pay was based on the case
      studies conducted by Hildebrand (2001) to estimate benefits of urban parks in Curitiba. 43

Costs Analysis

12. Costs consisted of actual costs of the works plus the institutional component, which is 18
    percent of works costs. For this evaluation, this percentage was added to the actual cost of
    each component.

13. Without including counterpart funds, expected costs at appraisal were R$ 127M (USD 49M)
    and actual costs were R$ 90M (USD 49M) which corresponds to 0 percent increase when
    expressed in US dollars, and a 29 percent decrease when expressed in Reais. However costs
    at appraisal are expressed in 2005 prices, while actual costs are expressed in prices of the
    implementation year, and therefore they are not comparable and the resulting price increase is
    not accurate.

14. During the period 2005-2013, the currency exchange rate fluctuated significantly and the
    inflation rate also rose. As Figure A3-1 shows, the exchange rate went from R$ 2.58 in 2005
    to R$ 1.61 to USD in 2008, and then R$ 2.01 in 2013; and the construction price index
    increased 73 percent during the period. 44

  According to IBGE, Consumer Price Index during the period was: 2005: 5.69%, 2006: 3.14%, 2007: 4.46%, 2008:5.90% , 2009:
4.31%, 2010: 5.91% , 2011: 6.50%, 2012: 5.84% , 2013: 5.91%. Construction Price Index was: 2006: 5.4%, 2007: 5.2%, 2008:
9.1% , 2009:7.7% , 2010: 6.5% , 2011: 7.75%, 2012: 7.0% , 2013: 8.0%. According to the Brazilian Central Bank Annual average
exchange rates: 2005:2.53; 2006: 2.25, 2007: 1.93, 2008: 1.62; 2009: 21.96; 2010: 1.81; 2011: 1.59; 2012: 2.05; 2013: 2.17.

15. To compare expected and actual cost, actual prices of investment were transformed to 2005
    prices eliminating exchange rate variation and inflation rate. Currency fluctuation is
    measured adjusting prices with inflation indexes and exchange rate fluctuation; any
    remaining amount corresponds to real increase of works.

16. If we run the analysis focusing on the WB proceeds (without counterpart funds) - results
    show that: a) 29 percent increase was due to the appreciation of the Brazilian Real to the USD.
    At appraisal the exchange rate was about R$ 2.58 per USD and the average obtained during
    implementation period was 1.84; b) 44 percent increase was due to inflation rate. This
    inflation was calculated as the average between construction price index and consumer price
    index. The construction price increased 73 percent from 2005-2013, while the consumer price
    increased 50 percent in the same period. The works were implemented along the period with
    an average price increase of prices of 44 percent (construction prices 46 percent and
    consumer prices 31 percent); and c) the remaining 46 percent increase is explained in higher
    costs of works.

Evaluation of Interventions

São Bartolomeu Park and Cultural Center

17. The interventions around the São Bartolomeu Park consisted of: a) enhancement of urban
    infrastructure around a park of 150 hectares, b) construction of a cultural and educational
    center for the community and additional facilities for park management. The park does not


                                                  29
    currently have an entry fee. Once the Park will be fully operational, the flow of expected
    visitors is estimated at 312,000 people. These people will come to relax, enjoy natural
    attractions offered by the park, participate to local festivities linked to São Bartolomeu (in
    July each year a big festival is held for instance) and so on. The cultural center has benefitted
    from the acquisition of diversified equipment; it has a service provision digital center for
    citizens, dedicated space for dance and theatre classes, manual arts classes, music classes,
    digital production room, a library, a play center and toy library, as well as dedicated space for
    exhibitions. It is estimated that about 156,000 people per year will visit the facilities. Before
    implementing the project there was no park or training facility in the neighborhood.

18. This evaluation used two parameters to measure the benefits: a) willingness to pay for the
    park; b) price of renting rooms with same characteristics of those available at the educational
    center; c) gains on time when distances to a training center decreased. Particularly, the
    considerations below were used to build assumptions for the analysis:

a) Willingness to pay based on the case studies conducted by Hildebrand (2001) to estimate the
   benefits of urban parks in Curitiba, Brazil. Results show that people were willing to pay an
   average of $ 2.10 per person, which corresponds to R$ 2.98 in 2005 prices.
b) Renting prices. The educational center has been used for courses and events. It is reasonable
   to assume that if the education center had not been built, other spaces would have to be rented
   in other locations. The current facility has 4 meeting rooms and 2 auditoriums. The rooms
   are used weekdays all yearlong; while the auditoriums are used weekdays during the school
   calendar, which is 9 months per year. The price of renting a room of the same characteristics
   is estimated to be R$ 500 per day. The prices were transformed to 2005 prices and applied to
   the number of rooms and auditoriums.

19. Results of the analysis show benefits 23 percent higher than costs and return of 16 percent.

Drainage

20. The drainage component contributed to reducing the risk of flooding in the targeted areas.
    Benefits were measured in the form of losses that are averted due to floods mitigation works
    implemented with the project. Damage costs were estimated for residential properties based
    on information from previous events. The evaluation was carried out for five localities with a
    total of 3,158 beneficiaries.

21. Previous events showed average damage cost per house of R$ 500 per year and repair costs
    of R$ 7,000 every five years. Additional cost of time was included of about 6 days per year
    per household, to cover the time lost to attend the emergency and risk of illness caused by
    flooding. Assumed time cost was the average wage in the zone of R$ 66 per day with 50
    percent adjustment to include kids, for a total of R$ 33 per person per day.

22. Results of the analysis show that benefits double the costs and return is 26 percent much
    higher that 12 percent discount rate.

Daycare Facilities

23. The evaluation was made based on the cost of time and number of kids. Before the project
    was implemented kids and her parents had to travel 6 km to get to another daycare facility.
    About 300 kids have benefited with the facilities (between day care, and after hours
    schooling). Cost of time was the same used for the other interventions.

24. Results of the analysis show returns of 13 percent and benefit 10 percent higher than costs.

26. All of these houses were located at risk areas, and some had severe damages when flooding.
    For the evaluation it was assumed (conservatively) similar damage to those in the drainage

    component, even though the damages were more severe. The time lost cost was assumed
    higher, 10 days repairing damages and 3 workers needed. Results of the analysis show return
    of 12 percent and economic benefits of R$ 273,000.

27. It is worth noting that for a good part of the units produced, the investment cost includes
    house interior features upgrade and possibility of expanding the size of the houses (up to
    doubling the entire size of the homes) through assigned adjacent space already pre-set for
    such purpose (with electricity, water and other utilities already connected). Therefore
    potential benefits for the units delivered go beyond those presented here.

Overall final analysis

28. Considering all elements presented above, the summary of results benefits 25 percent higher
    than costs and overall return of investment is of 16 percent.

*** Full content of the documents was uploaded in the Project files ***

(a) Summary of the Borrower's ICR

Context

The Project was conceived as part of the efforts of the Government of Bahia to reduce poverty in
the state, specifically among urban populations of higher social vulnerability.

Implementation of the Project was complex, characterized by a series of issues outlined below,
the majority of which arising from the preparation phase including (i) the Project implementation
time in relation to the complexity of its design; (ii) ambitious main objective and scope; (iii)
underestimation of costs and risks; and (iv) complexity in the proposed institutional and
implementation arrangements.

Project Results and Objectives

The Borrower substantially agrees with the Bank evaluation of the results framework. For more
details, refer to the full document, available in WB Docs.

World Bank Performance during Project Preparation and Implementation

The main negative aspects of World Bank performance during the project preparation phase
were:

    i)      Excess of planning instruments prepared
    ii)     Absence of integrated urban upgrading and infrastructure detailed design projects
    iii)    Ambitious PDO and scope
    iv)     Absence of an implementation plan with realistic costs and timeframes
    v)      Complex design relative to the proposed implementation period for the Project
    vi)     Underestimation of the risks of the Project—in particular institutional coordination
            and cooperation, and the risk inherent in cooperation across the political spectrum
    vii)    Complex institutional arrangement

The main positive aspects of World Bank performance during the project preparation phase were:

    i)      Integrated approach to slum upgrading
    ii)     Implementation support provided by the Bank (team) during project preparation

The main negative aspects of World Bank performance during the project implementation phase
were:

    i)      Limitations in the restructuring process of the project
    ii)     Changes in the World Bank’s project leaders (TTLs)
    iii)    Excessive bureaucracy in dealing with fiduciary matters (procurement) for the project

The main positive aspects of World Bank performance during the project implementation phase
were:

                                               37
    i)      Technical assistance made available by the project team

Government Performance during Project Preparation and Implementation

The principle negative aspects of Government performance during the project preparation phase
were:

    i)      Underestimation of the Project costs
    ii)     Lack of integration between UTP (Unidade Tecnica do Projeto – Project Executing
            Unit) and the rest of the organizational structure within CONDER (Companhia de
            Desenvolvimento Urbano do Estado da Bahia – State of Bahia Urban Development
            Company)

The main negative aspects of Government performance during the project implementation phase
were:

    i)      Slow pace of implementation of the project during the first years (2006 to 2008)
    ii)     Changes in project management (UGP / Unidade de Gestao do Projeto – Project
            Management Unit, within SEDUR; and UTP, within CONDER
    iii)    Modifications made to the detailed design projects for the urban upgradings in the
            PIFs (Poligonais de Intervenção Física -Physical Intervention Areas)
    iv)     Delays in the payment of invoices and bills for services rendered
    v)      Difficulties in making payments between May and September, 2013 negatively
            affected the implementation pace of the works

The main positive aspects of Government performance during the project implementation phase
were:

    i)      Government’s commitment in allocating the additional counterpart needed for the
            completion of the project’s targets
    ii)     Project resources invested in the preparation of detailed designs made it possible for
            the Government to reach alternative sources of funding through Caixa Economica
            Federal / PAC II and BNDES / PROINVEST (2014-2016)

Lessons Learned

During the preparation and implementation of the Project, the main lessons learned were the
following:

Importance of a policy for slum upgrading that integrates the various dimensions of urban
development – a state policy for slum upgrading should integrate environmental, social, economic,
and cultural dimensions of urban development, with the aim to physically integrate those parts of
the urban fabric with the formal city through (i) creation and improvement of accessibility; (ii)
implementation of public facilities and spaces in the design of slum upgrading; (iii) expansion of
basic sanitation, respecting the support capacity of natural ecosystems. Beyond these aspects,
sectors such as education, health, violence reduction and prevention, job and income creation, and
social inclusion should be promoted, as a way to improve quality of life for the resident
population.


                                               38
Relevance of an integrated approach to slum upgrading – it is advisable for slum upgrading
projects to balance demand for physical interventions with activities that support social
development. Slum upgrading projects should (i) integrate low-income settlements with the
formal city through creation and improvement of accessibility; (ii) value the implementation of
social public facilities and spaces; (iii) be aware of the support capacity of natural ecosystems in
the design of slum upgrading projects; (iv) expand basic WSS services; (v) work within (and
reveal) the characteristics of the existing social fabric; (vi) develop support activities for families
affected by physical works interventions or relocated from risk areas, principally those related to
job and income generation as well as group coexistence. It is worth highlighting that new
procurement documents from CONDER, including terms of reference for carrying out slum
upgrading works and social development projects, make this new concept explicit, mandating an
integrated approach to slum upgrading.

Importance of a social and environmental safeguards framework for the implementation of slum
upgrading projects – the improvement of involuntary resettlement processes and procedures for
families affected is essential for the implementation of slum upgrading projects. The involuntary
resettlement policy of the Project is cautious with the social fabric and forms part of the principle
that guarantees the reestablishment of the quality of life of families affected by physical
interventions regarding, (i) the loss of dwelling; (ii) the loss of financial income (interruption of
productive activities); (iii) losses stemming from the disruption of social support and relationships
within a neighborhood. The legal framework put in place by CONDER for procedures concerning
assisted purchase (indenizacao monitorada) amounted to a lesson learned and is being applied in
new slum upgrading projects. Concerning environmental safeguards, the Project developed
instruments for monitoring these aspects, which are available at CONDER for application in other
urban development projects.

Downsizing the institutional arrangements and integrating project management and execution
functions in a single unit/instance – in the case of similar projects financed by the World Bank, it
is advisable to simplify the institutional structure, with a focus on project implementation and
involve a reduced number of interlocutors and agents. It is also advisable to implement a single
coordinating unit to avoid instances of rework and overlapping roles, and to propel the project
forward during its implementation.

Necessity of alignment within diverse levels of public administration for the implementation of
slum upgrading projects – the difficulties encountered during the implementation process related
to (i) obtaining environmental licenses for the execution of physical interventions; (ii) obtaining
construction permits for the works (in some intervention areas permits have still not been issued),
(iii) resolving the legal status of public owned land in order to allow the issuance of titles to
beneficiaries; and (iv) the signing of legal terms for the delivery of the completed works and
social facilities to the due level of administration (the municipalities), these all suggest the
necessity of alignment of diverse levels of public administration, by means of the formalization of
processes and procedures for the implementation of slum upgrading projects and consequent
sustainability of investments made.

Alignment of methodology for addressing fiduciary aspects – the methodology for supervision of
the financial management and procurement fiduciary aspects of a project should be adjusted to
the institutional capacity of the borrower and approaches should be aligned. Depending on the
capacity of the client, supervision arrangements should give more or less autonomy to the
execution of administrative processes and procedures. That is, revise beforehand step by step the
procedures for the contracting of services, or provide more wide ranging and complete support,


                                                  39
with emphasis on the systematic control of revisions and possible penalties, which reduce the
management costs and streamlines implementation of the project.

Necessity of adopting preventative measures to address exchange rate fluctuations – in the case
of projects financed in foreign currency, financially subject to exchange rate fluctuations, it is
advisable to evaluate risks beforehand and adopt mitigation measures, with the aim to minimize
impacts, assure the completion of implementation, and reach goals and objectives.

(b) Comments made by the Borrower on Draft ICR

Most of the suggestions made by the Borrower were addressed in the final review of the ICR.
Key aspects raised are the following:

1. On the Results Framework:

1.1. Intermediate Outcome Indicator A1 – “Number of households with improved housing
conditions”: Different from what is mentioned in the ICR, the Borrower disagrees with the
comment from the Bank team on intermediate indicator A1 qualifying the monitoring approach as
‘conservative’. The client specifically reiterates that regular cash compensations provided to
beneficiary of resettlement policies should not be part counted as a household with improved
housing conditions given the impossibility to monitor the use of funds transferred to the
beneficiary.

1.2. Intermediate Outcome Indicator A2 – “Percentage of households in high risk areas or
unhealthy conditions resettled”: The Borrower comments that a different methodology – which
was a part of the Project’s Monitoring and Evaluation Plan and approved by the Bank in 2013 –
was undertaken to measure this indicator. By so doing, the actual achievement / measurement
would be 111%, as a result of the relation between the number of households resettled within the
PIFs (407 45) and the number of households taken out of high risk areas or unhealthy conditions
(366 46).

2. On Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes:

2.1. Crime and violence: The Borrower does not concur with the ICR’s assessment that crime and
violence have negatively impacted Project implementation, due to drug dealing gangs in Project
target areas.

3. Assessment of Risks to Development Outcomes and Project Costs and Financing: The
Borrower raises the fact that an estimated amount of additional counterpart funding (USD 56.3
million) – of which USD 31.05 million were executed before Project closing – was fully budgeted
for, among other, and included the completion of Project works after its closing date.
