7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The Projects development objective is to reduce urban poverty in a sustainable manner, targeting the
poorest and most vulnerable sections of Salvador and strategic cities of the state of Bahia with access to
basic services and improved housing and social support services. This development objective is aligned
with the Millennium Development Goals MDGs (especially Goal 7, Target 11) in line with the growing
number of governments around the world that are launching comprehensive slum upgrading programs,
setting development targets, undertaking reforms to prevent the growth of new slums, and leveraging
public and private resources to improve the lives of slum dwellers.
