1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design



1.1 Context at Appraisal


Country and Sector Background: Following its accession to the European Union (EU)
in 2004, the Latvian economy experienced rapid economic growth averaging over 10
percent per year. This high growth was driven almost entirely by domestic demand,
encouraged by rapid credit growth, large real wage increases, and expectations of a
progressive catching-up with EU living standards. New investment was concentrated in
the non-tradable sectors, creating a real estate boom, which culminated in an over 60
percent growth in housing prices in both 2005 and 2006.

The expansion of credit was largely financed by external borrowing from private
banks, resulting in high loan-to-deposit ratios. For foreign banks (which account for
almost 60 percent of the banking system), their parent institutions were the main source of
financing. Domestic banks relied substantially on short-term syndicated loans (as well as
non-resident deposits). The overall loan to deposit ratio at 248 percent in 2007 was the
highest in the region. With the bulk of the loans denominated in foreign currency (around
86.3 percent of total loans in 2007 were FX denominated, out of which 96 percent were in
Euros), and much of it unhedged, the banking sector also became indirectly vulnerable to
foreign exchange risk (i.e., through the risk of an increase in credit losses).

In the second half of 2008, in the context of the global financial crisis, these
vulnerabilities coalesced into a financial and balance of payments crisis. A large
current account deficit (-12.6% of GDP), high external debt (128% of GDP), and a very
high loan to deposit ratio (287.8%) resulted in the loss of access to foreign exchange
funding in the second half of 2008. This led financial markets to become increasingly
concerned about the sustainability of the peg arrangements. The currency peg came under
substantial pressure in September 2008 and, by November 2008, the Bank of Latvia
(BoL)'s foreign exchange reserves has fallen by 20%.

Concerns among foreign banks about their overexposure to the Baltic countries
resulted in a sharp slowdown in credit. The slowdown in credit, in conjunction with a
weakening in external demand in the context of depreciations against the Euro of the
currencies of some of Latvia's external partners, and deterioration in economic sentiment,
led to a significant downturn in domestic economic activity.

The deposit run on Parex Banka led to the state taking a majority stake in the bank's
capital and to a restriction on deposit withdrawals. Parex Banka is considered
systemically important (and therefore too big to fail) given its role in the domestic
payment system and in municipal financing, its large branch network and large market
share. Therefore, in mid-November 2008, in the face of growing illiquidity, the
Government took a 51 percent stake in the bank. This, however, failed to stem the

                                            1
outflow of deposits and the authorities had to increase their liquidity support. In early
December 2008, the Latvian Financial and Capital Market Supervisory Authority (FCMC)
restricted withdrawals by corporate, and individuals from the bank and the State further
increased their shareholding to 85 percent. New management was put in place to work out
a resolution that would minimize losses for the state and allow for a return of the bank to
the private sector. Further risks to the bank's stability came from the need to roll-over
Euro 775 million of syndicated loans falling due in February and June 2009. Negotiations
with syndicated lenders led to the rescheduling of payments in March 2009. A due
diligence analysis, focused on the bank's asset quality, liquidity and solvency, was
conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers in early 2009, on the basis of which additional
provisions were booked in the 2008 financial statements. In April, EBRD approved the
acquisition of 25 percent plus 1 of the ordinary shares of Parex Banka for LVL 59.5
million ( 84.2 million) and a subordinated loan of 22 million qualifying as Tier 2 capital.

These developments led the Government to seek external financial support and to
agree to an international stabilization program, supported by the EC, the IMF, EBRD,
Nordic and Central European countries, and the World Bank. The requested rescue
package amounted to 7.5 billion, equivalent to 35 percent of Latvia's GDP.

The international stabilization package was anchored to the Government strategy to
maintain Latvia's exchange rate peg through strong domestic adjustment policies
and substantial external financing. The 27-month program was based on preserving the
Lat exchange rate peg to the Euro within a narrow band. The authorities chose to maintain
the quasi currency board that served them well in the past. Among other factors, they took
into consideration the balance sheet effect of a potential devaluation and the risks that this
would have resulted in severe corporate, banking sector and social distress, which could
further have contributed to output contraction and sever Latvia's links to capital markets
for a protracted period of time. While maintaining the peg, exceptionally strong domestic
adjustment policies, including very substantial fiscal consolidation and sizable external
financing, was needed.

Rationale for World Bank Assistance. The proposed DPL to the Republic of Latvia
in the amount of 200 million (US$282.65 million equivalent) was designed to
support the Government's recovery program of end 2008 and of 2009. This program
included measures to: (i) stem immediate liquidity pressures; (ii) restore long-term
stability by strengthening the financial sector, correcting fiscal imbalances and adopting
domestic policies aimed at improving competitiveness while maintaining the fixed
exchange rate; and (iii) strengthen the long-term structural performance of the economy.
In the financial sector, the immediate objective of the program was to stabilize the sector
and restore depositor confidence. The program was coordinated with other development
partners, in particular with the IMF and the EC to ensure consistency.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The objective of the DPL was to support reforms and stabilize the financial system in
order to ensure long-term financial stability in Latvia.

The overall 10 Project key Outcome Indicators were set as follows:

·Adequate provisioning of NPLs;
· Well-capitalized banks;
· Stabilization of resident and non-resident deposits;
· Adequate handling of potential bank distress;
· Increased number of corporate rehabilitations initiated;
· Increased number of mortgage debt restructuring;
· Early identification of bank-level and system-level vulnerabilities;
· Early remedial actions taken to address vulnerabilities;
· Ten percent decrease in spread on credit default swaps reported for Latvia compared to
Dec. 2008 levels;
·Action plan established by CRPC to implement recommendations of consumer protection
review.


1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification

No revisions were made to the original PDO.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program

The DPL operation supported a comprehensive sector reform program including prior
policy measures in five main policy areas, in line with the objectives ­ and outcome
indicators ­ aforementioned to:

   ¾ Strengthen the banking sector's solvency and liquidity including: (i) conducting
     stress tests of the banking sector under severe macro-economic conditions and
     requiring banks showing signs of solvency or liquidity problems under the stress
     tests to prepare capital increase and liquidity contingency plans; (ii) preparing a
     detailed Contingency Plan for the banking sector, ensuring prompt government
     intervention as and where needed.

   ¾ Improve the bank resolution framework to enable swift bank interventions.

   ¾ Facilitate the renegotiations of corporate and mortgage debts with the objective to
     avoid the closure of viable firms and the foreclosure of residential properties
     wherever possible. The debt renegotiation facilitation measures included: (i)
     amending the insolvency framework to enable out-of-court corporate restructuring
     negotiations, (ii) publishing guidelines to facilitate renegotiations of corporate and
     mortgage debts, and (iii) organizing seminars on this subject to increase awareness
     of options among borrowers.

                                            3
        ¾ Strengthen financial supervision and regulation, including (i) asset quality and
          capital adequacy regulation and (ii) prudential supervision, especially through the
          adoption of a Prompt Remedial Action Plan by the supervisory authority.

        ¾ Strengthen consumer protection.

    1.5 Revised Policy Areas
    Policy areas were not revised.

    1.6 Other significant changes
    There were no other significant changes.


    2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

    2.1 Program Performance

    The Financial sector DPL was a single tranche operation. To support the measures
    mentioned above, the Financial Sector DPL set 10 prior, core policy actions as detailed
    in Table 1 below.

    Table 1: Financial Sector DPL: Disbursement conditions

Tranche 1         Description                                                                    Status
Policy action 1   The Bank of Latvia (BoL), with inputs from the FCMC, has completed             Met
                  stress tests of the banking sector in order to assess its resilience to
                  potential worst case scenarios.
Policy action 2   The Borrower has prepared a Strategic Contingency Plan for the                 Met
                  financial sector on the basis of the results of the stress tests referred to
                  in condition 1.
Policy action 3   The Borrower's Parliament has approved amendments to the Credit                Met
                  Institution Law with a view to strengthen the Borrower's legal
                  framework for bank resolution
Policy action 4   The Borrower's Parliament has approved amendments to the                       Met
                  Insolvency Law with a view to: (i) removing potential obstacles to out-
                  of-court proceedings for corporate restructuring; (ii) allowing pre-
                  packaged restructuring agreements; and (iii) introducing further
                  flexibility and easier access to insolvency proceedings.
Policy action 5   The Borrower's Parliament has approved amendments to the Civil                 Met
                  Procedure Law in order to simplify the existing mortgage foreclosure
                  process.
Policy action 6   The Borrower has implemented a debt restructuring program entailing:           Met
                  (i) the approval by the Consultative Council of guidelines for corporate
                  debt restructuring and their publication by the Ministry of Justice; and
                  (ii) the approval and publication by the FCMC of guidelines on
                  mortgage debt restructuring.

                                                  4
Policy action 7       The BoL has adopted an improved stress testing framework based on           Met
                      multiple scenarios and a revised credit risks module to be operated on a
                      regular module.
Policy action 8       The FCMC has adopted a remedial action framework that establishes a         Met
                      matrix of triggers and a range of discretionary and non-discretionary
                      supervisory actions for use when a bank has not complied with the
                      laws, regulations and supervisory decisions.
Policy action 9       The FCMC has: (i) issued revised and strengthened prudential                Met
                      regulations for asset quality and capital adequacy; (ii) prepared a draft
                      liquidity risk management regulation to be revised on the basis of the
                      recommendations of the Committee of European Banking Supervisors
                      and the directives of the European Union; and (iii) included the
                      issuance of regulations on credit risk management in its action plan for
                      2009.
Policy action 10      The Consumer Rights Protection Centre (CRPC) has completed a                Met
                      comprehensive review of consumer protection laws, regulations and
                      institutional set-up for the financial sector in line with international
                      good practices.


    All prior policy actions were met on time as planned and the tranche was released on April
    11, 2009 as described in Table 2 below. The loan was closed on its original closing date
    March 24, 2010.

    Table 2: Tranche dates

    The Financial Sector DPL emphasized how it supports and complements the 7.5 billion
    international rescue package of the IMF, EC, EBRD, Nordic countries and other lenders.
    The IMF operation was approved on December 23, 2008 and the World Bank team
    collaborated very closely with the IMF team by discussing complementarities and
    mutually supportive core measures. To this matter, there had been prior IMF policy
    actions notified in the program which were not part of the core prior actions of the
    Financial Sector DPL but played an important role in the realization of the program
    objectives:

    Among IMF prior policy actions, several were significant to achieve the Financial Sector
    DPL objective such as measures to:
          (i) Enhance Lender of Last Resort Facilities: the BoL issued regulations in January
          2009 to strengthen institutional arrangements for emergency liquidity support;
          (ii) Examine the banking system by international audit firms to ensure that banks
          are solvent and have sufficient liquidity;


                                                    5
       (iii) Amend banking laws to give FCMC, BoL and the Government powers to
       restore financial stability in case of systemic crises and enhance the special bank
       insolvency regime.

In addition, the Financial Sector DPL was one part of the World Bank's contribution to
the international rescue package. A parallel 200m DPL was approved by the World Bank
Board in March 2010 to support the Government's budget to implement the Government's
Emergency Social Safety Net Strategy (ESSNS). The program of two loans of 100m
each focused on safety net support and medium-term social sector expenditure reforms.
The objectives of the proposed program are: (i) to protect vulnerable groups with
emergency safety net support during the economic contraction; (ii) to mitigate the social
costs of fiscal consolidation; (iii) to ensure structural reforms lay a foundation for
medium-term improvements in the social sectors. The first operation (P115732 - Latvia
First Special DPL: Safety Net and Social Sector Reform Program) focused mainly on the
first and second objectives. Based on the latest Implementation Report Status (ISR)
produced on June 19, 2010, DO and IP are both rated Satisfactory: The Ministry of
Finance (MoF), and social sector ministries, including the Ministry of Regional
Development and Local Government, have met the targets for implementing the ESSNS,
which they set for themselves at the outset of the program. Finally, the project went as
planned, all activities were implemented as designed, and the project closed on December
31, 2010 as expected, with no change or restructuring.


The second DPL operation (P121796 - Latvia Second Safety Net and Social Sector
Reform Program Loan) is under preparation for 2011 and will expand the original focus to
ensure structural reforms lay a foundation for medium-term improvements in the social
sectors.


2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation

There were no significant factors making implementation differ from the agreed program.


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E and implementation arrangements were continuous and contributed to reforms
implementation and the achievement of development objectives.
   · There were enough indicators to monitor the outcomes. Targets were established
      for most indicators. Data were collected on a regular basis and used to monitor
      progress towards the outcomes. In addition, most of these indicators were
      supported by targets and baselines (for 6 indicators out of 10).
   · Given that the program was designed as a stand-alone operation over a period of a
      year in the middle of the 2008-early 2009 global financial sector crisis, efforts
      were made to define in collaboration with the authorities mostly quantitative
      indicators to facilitate monitoring.

                                             6
   ·   It is worth noting that the Program Document did recognize that some of the
       indicators - CDSs spreads and growth of deposits - were influenced by factors
       outside the control of the program, such as the general economic conditions in the
       region.


2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation

A Financial Sector follow-up operation is not anticipated. However, as detailed earlier, a
2nd DPL operation of the Latvia Second Safety Net and Social Sector Reform Program
Loan (P121796) is under preparation. World Bank approval is scheduled on May 24,
2011.

In addition, MoF has verbally requested a follow-on operation in the form of a
developmental Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) to maintain the ongoing
policy dialogue initiated by the DPL operation. The FSAP mission is planned in July
2011.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The objective of the DPL remained highly relevant throughout the course of the
project and continues to be highly relevant. The reform program supported by the DPL
was built on five objectives covering crisis mitigation measures to (i) strengthen the
banking sector's solvency and liquidity; (ii) strengthen the bank resolution framework;
(iii) facilitate the renegotiations of corporate and mortgage debts; (iv) strengthen financial
supervision and regulation; and (v) strengthen consumer protection. All these measures
were in line with the policy actions of the Government's 27-month stabilization program
signed on December 19th, 2008 with the EC, IMF, bilateral and multilateral donors and the
World Bank.

The DPL program focused largely on medium- and long-term measures aimed at
protecting financial sector stability in response to the crisis through strengthening the
solvency of Latvia's financial sector and ensuring adequate liquidity.

The project's intervention was very appropriate and timely. Latvia's Government and
the World Bank jointly in coordination with the IMF and the EC adapted the operation's
design to respond to the immediate needs of the country in the wake of the financial crisis.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

All the PDOs were either highly or substantially achieved, as demonstrated by the policy
actions taken and targets met. The independent feedback from various stakeholders about
project achievements and progress on PDOs demonstrate the positive impact of the project
on the reforms to stabilize the financial sector and increase its resilience to future shocks.

Stress-tests: Drawing on IMF and World Bank assistance, BoL has strengthened its
stress-test methodologies and capacity in 2009. BoL, and with inputs from FCMC, has
developed the capability to run regularly upgraded stress tests which can be calibrated
according to different risk-based scenarios. Regular stress-tests by BoL indicate that a
large majority of banks are well-capitalized improving the resilience of the banking sector.

Provisions and CAR: Based on the results of the stress tests, the resulting provisioning
needs caused banking sector losses of LVL640 million (5 percent of GDP) in the first 10
months of 2009. Banks have responded with equity and subordinated capital increases of
LVL700 million through October 2009, with a further LVL300 million in January 2010
and an addition LVL150 million in the first semester of 2010. During 2009, thirteen banks
increased capital, lifting the system-wide capital adequacy ratio above 13 percent. As of
end-September 2010, twelve banks (with market share in total assets - 74.5%, in total
loans - 76.6%) had provisions that fully met the regulatory requirements1. The remaining
nine banks have been required to correct capital by total amount of L43.5 million
constituting 1.5% of those banks' loan portfolio as a result of previously conducted onsite
inspections increasing the overall CAR of the banking system to 15.2% in November
2010, well above the minimum requirement of 8 percent (see Graph 1).

Both resident and non-resident deposits depositor's confidence has been restored as
evidenced by the continually increasing deposits since the beginning of 2010 (see
Graph 2). Between December 2008 and March 2010, resident deposits increased by 1
percent y/y and non-resident deposits by 2 percent y/y. These results reflect improving
liquidity in Latvia and in neighbor's countries, the confidence effect of recent program
disbursements, continued restrictions on withdrawals of large deposits from Parex Banka,
and the stabilization of the banking sector.

        sector, including liquidity or solvency risks. The strategy defines the
        responsibilities of each government agency in the event of a crisis and sets out how
        they would take decisions. It also identifies alternative options and methods for
        resolving problems in various sub-groups of banks in fragile state. The plans were
        adopted by the Domestic Standing Group and are being regularly updated. Internal
        FCMC guidelines were also introduced.

    ·   At the same time, amendments to the Law on Credit Institutions and to the FCMC
        Law were approved in February 2009 to align the legal framework for bank
        resolution, inter alia, as per the IMF-World Bank Global Bank Insolvency
        Initiatives principles. As a result, these amendments significantly strengthened the
        FCMC's ability to intervene troubled banks (swift bank resolution) if necessary.
        Finally, the Law on Bank Takeovers (which came in effect in December 2008) sets
        out the framework that permits the government to take over banks if needed.
    ·   Resolution of Parex Banka: Submitted on March 31, 2010, the long overdue
        restructuring plan of Parex established the transfer of performing assets and most
        junior liabilities into a new `good' bank. Remaining assets and liabilities stayed in

         a resolution bank. EBRD is a shareholder in both entities. This strategy allowed
         relatively quick and transparent sale of viable parts of Parex, while protecting
         depositors and giving the government a chance to recover part of its investment in
         the future by selling the `good' bank. This strategy should have been adopted in
         early 2009, but the political will and legal underpinnings were then lacking. The
         Cabinet approved the creation of the new bank on June 1, 2010 and on August 1st,
         2010, "Citadele' was launched and have been fully operating since then.

The new Insolvency Law: The new Insolvency Law aimed at speeding the exit of non-
viable firms and supporting rehabilitation of individual debtors was approved on June 26th,
2010 and it is in force since November 1st, 2010.

For individuals, the new Insolvency Law introduces two processes: bankruptcy and debt
write-off.
    · At the beginning of the bankruptcy procedure, an insolvency administrator is
       designated and will act upon notification to the court that the sale of debtor's
       property is completed so that bankruptcy can be finalized;
    · If there is no impediment to the debt write-off process, the individual can then
       proceed to a debt write-off. The length of debt write-off procedures can vary from
       one to three and a half years, depending on the expected income of the debtor. The
       debtor would only have to repay the debt principal; all contractual penalties, fines
       and delayed interests would be waived;
    · Unless the debt write-off process is applied, the rights of the creditors to claim the
       full amount of outstanding debts would be restored and suspended enforcement
       proceedings in the courts on awarded but uncollected amounts would be resumed;




                                                    13
   ·   The full benefits of this new Insolvency framework for private individuals would
       be better assessed once market participants and the legal system become familiar
       with the new framework.

For corporate, the new law provides two options ­ legal protection and insolvency at the
same time ­ which aim at simplifying the exit of non-viable firms in a possibly short time.

In 2010, additional legal reforms on debt restructuring were introduced:
    · Amendment to the Civil Procedure Law that, inter alia, make foreclosure of a
       mortgage a credible threat ­ thereby strengthening incentives for debtors to
       participate in workouts ­ became effective in February 2010;
    · In order to improve the lenders' and borrowers' understanding of the general
       principles for out-of-court enforcement of mortgage contracts, the FCMC adopted
       "Principles and Guidelines for Out of Court Consumer Mortgage Workouts" on
       August 14, 2009 (in effect as of August 21st, 2009) including the general
       principles for ensuring out-of-court enforcement of mortgage contracts. This
       amendment addresses inter alia rules of engagement for all parties and elements
       of proper restructuring;
    · Corporate Debt Restructuring Workshop (December 2nd, 2009) - The debt
       restructuring workshop focused on sharing with the authorities and with
       practitioners (bankers and lawyers) international experience with corporate debt
       restructuring, corporate rehabilitations, and insolvencies under times of crises.
       The workshop also described the new legal framework in Latvia for out-of-court
       debt restructuring, as well as the expedited court approval process for corporate
       rehabilitation plans. Since then, the number of corporate rehabilitations and debt
       restructurings has been increasing significantly.

Anecdotally, it has been reported that foreign-owned banks have their own internal
mechanisms to deal with workouts/restructuring cases. These mechanisms have been
borrowed from their corporate head-offices in Finland, Norway, Sweden, or Denmark. In
these cases, foreign banks reported that the newly introduced Corporate Debt
Restructuring Guidelines (CDRGs) validate their existing practices and could serve as a
tool to educate debtors about out-of-court debt restructuring practices. Local banks
(medium/small size financial institutions), on the other hand, were not well aware of the
CDRGs, did not have a restructuring/workouts unit, or a defined framework to manage
distressed corporate loans.

As a result, individual (mortgage debt included) and corporate debt restructuring have increased
remarkably as described in Graph.3 below.

Early detection of bank-level and system-level vulnerabilities

    ·   Liquidity risk revised: The improvement of the "Regulations on Liquidity
        Requirements, Compliance Procedures and Liquidity Risk Management" adopted
        on 28 December 2009 (in effect as of April 1st, 2010) details the requirements for
        liquidity risk management, inter alia introducing requirements for management of
        funding structure, management of assets eligible as loan collateral as well as a
        requirement to develop a set of internal indicators for liquidity measurement.
        Based on three types of stress tests, a bank should determine the size of the

                                                 16
       required liquidity buffer and maintain adequate liquid assets for the liquidity
       buffer.
   ·   Credit Risk revised: The enhancement of the "Regulations on Credit Risk
       Management" adopted on December 28, 2009 (in effect as of January 6, 2010)
       contains a requirement to develop and apply the credit risk tolerance determining
       methodologies and lay out the rights and responsibilities of a bank's council,
       executive board and employees involved in credit risk management. Requirements
       for credit risk management strategies and the policies and procedures required for
       their implementation have been further specified, particularly highlighting the
       lending policies and procedures, and concentrating on risk management
       requirements. "Regulations on Credit Risk Management" request the banks to
       perform regular stress tests and develop contingency plans for the pessimistic
       scenario.
   ·   Financial sector supervision has been strengthened by stronger cooperation
       between BoL and FCMC. Reporting requirements have been improved by
       increasing the frequency and quality of reporting on restructured loans to enhance
       assessments of asset quality. At the same time, improved cooperation between BoL
       and FCMC (in particular in the area of stress testing) has strengthened the
       authorities' understanding of macro financial risks and linkages.
Early remedial actions taken to address vulnerabilities
   ·   Prompt Remedial Action Framework: The "Policy on timely corrective
       measures for the banks" was adopted on August 21, 2009 and contains several
       preemptive actions and/or sanctions that can be used by FCMC when irregularities
       detected during on-site examinations. In 2009, FCMC imposed early limitations on
       some bank's risky activities by forbidding them to grant new loans (see Box 1).




Box 1: Example of early remedial actions taken by FCMC
Bank A: In order to resolve its liquidity problems, Bank A submitted a request to the BoL
to grant a loan of LVL15 million for 3 months. As collateral, Bank A loan portfolio was
proposed.
Following the request for financing, FCMC conducted an on-site examination of Bank A
during which FCMC discovered that there was no management board decision made about
this. Bank A recalled the request.
Taking into consideration the results of the on-site inspection, the FCMC requested Bank
A to make provisions for loans to banks and customers as well as for Bank A's
investments into financial institutions. This would decrease Bank A's CAR to 6.8% below
regulatory CAR of 8%.
On the basis of 21.08.2009 policy No.150 "Policy on timely corrective measures for the
banks", Article 16 (2), FCMC took the decision to impose limitations on Bank A's
activities, namely:

                                            17
1.       to forbid any kind of investment into capital companies, except investments in
         equity instruments traded in the stock exchange;
2.       to request Bank A to take legal responsibility of informing FCMC before making
         any investments in equity instruments traded at the stock exchange;
3.       to oblige Bank A to inform FCMC about any projects granting new loans exceeding
         LVL100,000, three working days before the decision is made.

                                                                                                     was released in
                                                                                                     March 2010.

     ·    In April 2010, drawing on the World Bank assistance, CRPC prepared a detailed
          Action Plan based on the Diagnostic Review of Consumer Protection and Financial
          Capability in Latvia, prepared by the World Bank in November 2009. The Action
          Plan focuses on the main issues described in the key findings and
          recommendations proposing specific actions to be undertaken by Latvian
          authorities, financial institutions and consumer organizations so that consumer
          protection is strengthened and made more effective and efficient.

     ·    The following regulations were adopted:
             ¾ Consumer Credit Regulations issued by the Cabinet of Ministers, which
             provides consumers with the right to obtain and review any credit contract
             before signing;
             ¾ Consumer Credit Regulations issued by the Cabinet of Ministers, which
             implement requirements of Directive 2008/48/EC of the European Parliament
             and of the Council of 23 April 2008 on credit agreements for consumers and
             repealing Council Directive 87/102/EEC (CCD), thereby imposing more
             stringent rules for pre-contractual information regarding consumer credit and
             information which should be included in consumer credit agreement.



                                                     18
   ·   With hindsight, perhaps the World Bank should have put more effort in raising
       additional funding to ensure the follow-up on the reforms on consumer protection.
       Most of these have been implemented but several were put on standby because of a
       lack of resources and capacity building.
   In addition to these results, to promote mutual cooperation and better protection of the
   consumer, FCMC and CRPC signed on August 26, 2010 a contract of institutional
   cooperation for financial services and surveillance of consumer rights. This agreement
   includes the following points:
           ¾ CRPC and FCMC agreed to exchange information, conclusions and
           interpretations, as well as assistance and competence; CRPC agreed to inform
           FCMC if any of the financial market participants would make substantial and /
           or repeated breaches of consumer laws, or fail to comply with legal
           requirements, for example, if they fail to comply with the decisions or do not
           provide requested information;
           ¾ In return, FCMC committed to inform CRPC about alleged violations of
           financial services' laws and regulations in relation with unfair commercial
           practices, inappropriate advertising, failure to provide full information to
           consumers, as well as other consumer protection issues;
           ¾ Both institutions agreed to collect quarterly statistics on the complaints
           received on financial services. This information is posted on both institutions'
           websites and distributed to media;
           ¾ On June 15, 2010, FCMC held training for CRPC staff about Forex
           transactions;
           ¾ In September 2010, CRPC held a meeting with the Association of
           Commercial Banks, where the most common consumer's rights problems in
           the area of financial services were discussed. It was decided that such meetings
           will be held regularly;
           ¾ CRPC regularly informs consumers of CRPC decisions (and events) that
           affect the interests of consumers in the area of financial services by means of
           press communiqués and announcements on CRPC website.
Overall program objective: the confidence in the financial system has been restored
as evidenced in narrowing CDSs spreads (see Graph. 4) and the announcement early
December 2010 by the ratings agency S&P's of Latvia rating upgrade by a notch to
BB+, the first time since 2008. The outlook is stable.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Highly Satisfactory

The overall rating is Highly Satisfactory. It reflects the high relevance of the development
objectives and the achievement of the program objectives. The operation was well-
designed. Prior actions were taken and only one of them is focused on the short-term,
demonstrating that structural reforms in the financial sector are crucial for a sound
institutional framework and to build resilience against shocks. The challenge for Latvia
now is to find the right balance of measures which will facilitate crisis recovery and
structural policy reforms in the current international environment.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

While the operation was not intended directly to benefit the poor in terms of contribution
to poverty reduction, the Financial Sector DPL, by stabilizing the financial sector is
expected to have positive social and poverty impacts in the medium-term through:
(i) Increasing the capacity of the financial authorities to anticipate risks in the banking
sector and limit future systemic crisis that could be very costly to depositors;
(ii) Enhancing the capacity of the financial authorities to deal with distressed banks and
thus help preserve taxpayers' money;
(iii) Encouraging viable corporate rehabilitations that would otherwise be pushed to
bankruptcy, thereby contributing to preserving employment and the economic fabric;
(iv) Helping household debtors renegotiate their debts with the banks, avoiding
foreclosures wherever possible;
(v) Facilitating resumption in lending.

In addition, the implementation of the recommendations of the consumer protection
review has improved the laws and regulations to protect consumers of financial services as
well as their means of complaints.


                                              20
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

It is difficult to assess institutional change from the DPL; however, the strengthened
legislative framework will likely lead to institutional change in the long-run, particularly
in the understanding and capacity of supervisory authorities and those overseeing overall
financial sector risks.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

None.

3.5 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

Not applicable.


4. Assessing of Risk to Development Outcome


Rating: Significant

Financial stability risk: The financial stability risk is significant. While there are signs
the economy is stabilizing (the pace of output decline is slowing as Q2 2010 seasonally
adjusted GDP seems to have leveled off; the industrial production has been increasing
since March 2009 and retail sales since December 2009); the relatively stable economic
situation continues to put pressures on the sector's financial stability in the medium term.
New overdue loans have stabilized, but NPLs (19.4% as of October 2010) and
provisioning needs (11.4% as of October 2010) remain high, mostly because of the
economic recession. In addition, despite the recent upgrade of the sovereign rating of
Latvia by Standard and Poor's in early December 2010, Latvia's rating remains two
notches below investment grade.

Macroeconomic risk: another significant risk comes from the challenge related to the
macroeconomic environment, specifically fiscal management. While economic
performance in 2010 has been better than foreseen, fiscal consolidation is set to continue
in 2011. On December 20, 2010, the parliament gave its final approval to the 2011 budget
that includes further austerity measures. Latvia's government plans to reduce its budget
deficit to 3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2012 as it bids to join the Euro in
2014. The 2011 budget foresees a deficit of 5.4 percent of GDP, down from an expected
8.5 percent of GDP this year, mostly by raising taxes, including value-added tax, real
estate tax and social taxes.

Political risk: The political risk is moderate. After a lot of political instability that
concurred with the beginning of the crisis, parliamentary elections were held in October
2010. Despite the austerity fiscal measures, the Prime Minister Dombrovskis' Unity party
performed well in the October 2010 parliamentary elections, winning nearly one-third of
the vote. The new coalition government was given de facto the mandate by voters to

                                            21
continue the on-going fiscal consolidation to stabilize the economy. As a result,
Dombrovskis' coalition government is well placed to confront the challenge of reducing
state contributions to pension schemes.

Social Risk: The 2011 budget looks very ambitious and further fiscal cuts in social
services presents significant social risk. There are concerns that the current budget as
approved would put further pressures on the funding for social and health safety nets,
public works jobs and job training. Unemployment remains very high (19.4 percent) close
to Latvia's all-time high of 20 percent. The IMF and the World Bank have urged the
authorities to ensure that the budget provides enough funding to social services to alleviate
the impact of the crisis on the most vulnerable segments of the population. In addition, a
number of adopted measures will be followed by further steps to clarify their operational
aspect or, as in the case of minimum wage increase, to mitigate side effects on
unemployment.

Overall, the risk is significant based on significant financial stability, macroeconomic and
social risks and moderate political risk.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Highly Satisfactory

The project team performance during identification, preparation and appraisal is rated
highly satisfactory. The Financial Sector DPL's strategic relevance was based on the
Government's 2008-2009 recovery program to (i) stem immediate liquidity pressures; (ii)
restore long-term stability and (iii) strengthen the long-term structural performance of the
economy. The design of the DPL profited from ongoing financial sector dialogue between
the government and the IMF as expressed in the Letter of Intent between MoF and IMF
signed in July 2009, as well as wide consultations with the Latvia and foreign bankers
associations. Findings and recommendations from the FSAP update (2007) were very
useful in project preparation as well as a close coordination with the IMF. Importantly, the
Bank closely coordinated with the IMF, the EC, bilateral and multilateral donors during
project preparation which also supported financial sector reforms in Latvia.


(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

The operation was very well supervised. The team in charge of both the design and the
supervision of the DPL operation possesses a deep knowledge of the Latvia's banking
sector as well as a solid expertise in bank supervision, asset restructuring, consumer


                                             22
protection etc. It allowed continued dialogue and stock-taking materializing with ongoing
engagement in a developmental FSAP planned in July 2011.

Finally, the operation ran on time, there were no changes; the operation was closed as
schedule, on March 24, 2010. The supervision report (ISR) was delivered with some delay
(in June 2010) enabling the team to maintain close dialogue and support the Government
through continuous monitoring of the impact of the reforms during three more months.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

Overall, the World Bank Team was prepared and provided timely and relevant policy
advice under the operation, and deployed knowledgeable expert resource to ensure
implementation and monitoring of quantifiable results; all aspects justifying the overall
satisfactory rating of the World Bank performance.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

Performance of the Borrower during the preparation phase was satisfactory. Government
agencies engaged in the Financial Sector DPL dialogue included BoL, the Ministry of
Justice, FCMC, the Ministry of Economy and MoF. All of them were involved in the
Financial Sector DPL dialogue from the early start. Coordination between different arms
of the government was strong during the Financial Sector DPL operation, partly as a result
of the operation itself, but also because of strong government commitment to the program.
Ownership of government was from the beginning essential supported by conscious MoF
efforts and the critical financial support package provided by the international community

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The implementing agency was MoF ensuring a very high level of coordination. MoF
displayed strong commitment to the project and team dedicated to the project provided
efficient coordination. The team worked with the Bank at all stages of the Financial Sector
DPL operation. Its availability and involvement through broad dialogue and active
problem solving resulted in the conditions for release being met as planned.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The Government has been committed to the reform agenda where such reforms were
difficult to implement by their nature (Insolvency Law). Tight coordination across the
government agencies as well as consultations with the banking sector has supported the


                                            23
implementation of policy actions defined in the Financial Sector DPL. In addition there
was a strong sense of ownership in implementing the reform programs.

6. Lessons Learned

In a difficult global setting, the importance of having a strong political commitment
in support of long-term strategic reforms should be highlighted. From preparation, the
Financial Sector DPL was a well supported operation as: a) policy actions ­ all prior
actions ­ were consistent with international best practices of public policy; b) they were
technically and politically difficult reforms, and c) the government is committed to not
reversing these policy actions. The alignment of the program with the Government
strategy reinforced its ownership. The goal of the euro-zone accession succeeded in
unifying the mainstream political parties and boosted the Government's commitment to
work towards the objective to ensure long-term financial stability in Latvia.

With the assistance of the World Bank, the IMF and other donors, the importance of
strong partnership was essential to the success of the operation. The Financial Sector
DPL was guided strongly by the internationalization of the stabilization package anchored
to the Government strategy. The coordinated policy dialogue with bilateral and
multilateral donors helped Latvia to define coordinated programs along the lines of the
Government strategy and designed synchronized policy actions adequately. Another
contributing factor was the coordination and consensus building among the relevant
implementing agencies.

The success of the reform program depended also significantly on the continued
involvement of all banks operating in or with Latvia, including foreign-owned banks.
In a coordination meeting held on September 11, 2009 in Stockholm, the parent banks of
the four key largest foreign-owned banks (DnB Nord, Nordea, SEB and Swedbank)
operating in Latvia reaffirmed their commitments to support their branches and
subsidiaries in the country and to promote financial stability in the Baltic region. These
commitments, along with the international package have cushioned the effects of the
financial crisis and strengthened international investor's confidence.

Overall, the program suggests that internal devaluation can work in terms of
restoring lost cost competitiveness, while maintaining a fixed exchange rate regime.
However, the social and financial costs of this policy approach have been very high.
The key elements of the program focused on measures to stabilize the financial system,
measures to achieve a large fiscal consolidation, and income policies based on nominal
wages reduction, while maintaining unchanged rate peg. The banking sector has stabilized
in 2010 and to this matter, the Financial Sector DPL is considered to be a successful
operation.

General Comments
 1.   The Financial Sector Development Policy Loan (Financial DPL) entered into force
 on September 24, 2009. The loan is part of an international financial support package of
 EUR 7.5 billion.

 2.    The main objective of Financial DPL was to support crisis management measures
 and structural reforms to stabilize the financial sector and increase its resilience to future
 shocks. The reforms were implemented by the Financial and Capital Market Commission
 (FCMC), the Bank of Latvia (BoL), the Ministry of Finance (MoF), the Ministry of
 Justice (MoJ), and the Consumer Rights Protection Centre (CRPC).

 3.   Our comments regarding the implementation of the financial sector reforms
 supported by Financial DPL are as follows:

Crisis resolution

    A. Capital Adequacy

 4.    In order to strengthen capital adequacy in banks the regulatory framework setting
 stress testing requirements for banks was enhanced during year 2009. Currently,
 Regulations on Establishment of Capital Adequacy Assessment Process mandate banks
 to conduct stress testing for all material risks and incorporate results in calculation of
 capital buffer. The FCMC Regulations on Liquidity Requirements, Compliance
 Procedures and Liquidity Risk Management specify stress testing requirements by
 introducing 3 types of stress tests (institution specific, market specific and combined)
 according to banks' or supervisory scenarios. FCMC Regulations on Credit Risk
 Management provide that banks shall have at least 2 stress-testing scenarios (base case
 and pessimistic) and assess impact of stressed conditions in a short-term (up to 1 year)
 and protracted phase. Stress-testing results shall be analysed and incorporated in credit
 risk management, capital planning and design of contingency plans. Stress testing
 requirements will be further enhanced to ensure full compliance with the respective
 Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS) guidelines by mid 2011.

 5.     Stress-testing is incorporated in a FCMC's supervisory toolkit. Top-down stress
 tests conducted by the Bank of Latvia have been analyzed on a regular basis and form
 the basis for dialog with banks regarding capital increase plans where needed.

   B. Liquidity Requirements

 6.    The FCMC Regulations on Liquidity Requirements, Compliance Procedures and
 Liquidity Risk Management were approved on 28.12.2009, effective as of 01.04.2010.
 As compared to the previously effective regulations, the above FCMC Regulations:

   ·   specify requirements for funding risk management;

                                             28
    ·   require to supplement the supervisory liquidity ratio with a set of indicators
        capturing liquidity risk aspects which are most relevant to the business model of a
        particular bank;
    ·   specify stress testing requirements by introducing 3 types of stress tests (institution
        specific, market specific and combined) according to banks' or supervisory
        scenarios;
    ·   mandate to establish and maintain liquidity buffer based on results of the stress
        tests;
    ·   define eligibility criteria for assets to be included in liquidity buffer;
    ·   introduce two new reports (funding concentrations; projected cash flows).

7.    The substantial progress in managing the effects of the crisis on the banking
system has been made by taking the following measures:

·       Adopting operational guidelines for the provision of emergency liquidity
        assistance (ELA) by clarifying procedures for inter-agency coordination, cross-
        border arrangements, and the treatment of collateral.
·       Reviewing regulations on emergency liquidity support so that they are consistent
        with international practice and provide for adequate safeguards.

    C. Bank resolution

8.     Law "Amendments to the Credit Institutions Law" in force as from 19.02.2009
introduced new restructuring measures for troubled banks by appointing a temporary
administrator with a wide range of powers to administrate the bank. Further amendments
to the law of 11.03.2010 defined more precisely the definition of set-off of claims and
obligations in line with the definition used in international practice. The law determined
the cases when the set-off of claims and obligations were possible during insolvency
proceedings of the credit institution. The rights of the administrator after announcing the
credit institution insolvent to terminate any agreement that results in reduction of the
credit institution's assets and that does not entail administration and implementation of
the financial services.

    D. Distressed asset management

9.   The substantial progress in establishing a debt restructuring framework has been
made:

    ·   Amendments to the Insolvency Law to encourage out-of-court restructurings and
        improve the insolvency framework were approved by Parliament in June 2009 and
        became effective on 01.07.2009. These amendments allow for out-of-court debt
        renegotiations through a new out-of-court Legal Protection Proceedings (LPP)
        option. The amendments also streamlined the insolvency regime. On 26.07.2010
        the new Insolvency Law was adopted by the Parliament. According to the new
        Insolvency Law there are 3 procedures: 1) Insolvency Proceedings for a Legal
        Person, 2) Insolvency Proceedings for a Natural Person and 3) Legal Protection
        Proceedings. Legal protection proceedings are a set of measures of a legal nature
                                              29
     whose purpose is to renew the debtor's ability to settle its obligations if the debtor
     has got into financial difficulties or believes that it will get into such. Insolvency
     proceedings for a legal person are a set of measures of a legal nature, within the
     framework of which the claims of creditors are settled from the property of the
     debtor to facilitate the fulfilment of the obligations thereof. Insolvency
     proceedings for a natural person are a set of measures of a legal nature whose
     purpose is to satisfy the claims of creditors from the property of the debtor as fully
     as possible and to provide the debtor, whose property and income are insufficient
     to cover all its obligations, with an opportunity to be released from unfulfilled
     obligations and renew its paying capacity. The Insolvency Law is aimed at: (i)
     removing potential obstacles to out-of-court corporate restructuring; introducing
     further flexibility to the Legal Protection Process and eliminating the settlement
     and recovery procedures; (ii) making access to insolvency proceedings easier; (iii)
     achieving efficiency in liquidation of assets in bankruptcy cases; (iv) increasing the
     insolvency administrators efficiency; (v) streamlining the liquidation procedure.
·    Amendments to the Civil Procedure Code to improve the mortgage foreclosure
     process and help the rehabilitation of household debtors have been prepared by the
     MoJ. The process for foreclosing on a mortgaged property in Latvia is expensive
     and time-consuming. The auctions process is very lengthy, including 3 separate
     auctions that are 3 months apart. Foreclosure procedures were streamlined in
     March 2009. The amendments to the Civil Procedure Law improving the
     foreclosure procedures were made with the amending law to the Civil Procedure
     Law, adopted on 17.12.2009. These amendments entered into force on 01.02.2010.
     The amendments had several objectives:
  1) To strengthen the protection of first lien holder, facilitating debt restructuring
     arising from lien and avoiding unnecessary enforcement/recovery procedures
     against immovable property. The solution in the amendments provides for a
     temporary rule applicable from 01.02.2010 until 31.12.2012, included in the
     transitory provisions (transitory provision No. 44). This rule provides that the
     acceptance of the first lien holder, unless he/she is also creditor, is necessary for
     the sale of the immovable property in auction for the purpose of ongoing
     procedures of different debt recovery. There are 6 exceptions, based on social
     grounds, where acceptance of the first lien holder is not necessary - when
     enforcement procedures are carried out in order to recover maintenance payments,
     payments arising from employment, tax payments in budget, payments arising
     from personal injury etc. The objections of the first lien holder postpone the sale of
     immovable property for one year but no longer than 31.12.2012.
  2) To reduce the number of auctions (amendments in Art. 606, Art. 615 and Art.
     616 and introduced transitory provision No. 43).The amendments reduce the
     number of three auctions to two (these amendments apply to those auctions that are
     announced after 31.01.2010. For earlier auctions the third auction is still possible
     and it takes place with the starting price set as 60% from the starting price of the
     first auction).
  3) To introduce bank guaranties as possible method of payment in auctions
     (amendments in Art. 611 and Art. 613). Unconditional guaranty letter is a bank



                                           30
       transactions according to which the bank acts as a guarantor and undertakes the
       obligation as debtor himself.
    4) To shorten the time limits for announcement of auctions (amendments in Art.
       606.). According to the amendments the auction has to be announced at least 1
       month before auction, but upon the request of the creditor the auction may be
       announced at least 2 months before auction, but not later than 1 month before the
       auction. Before the amendments these time limits for announcing auctions were
       different depending on the starting price of the immovable property, even up to 3
       months before the auctions of immovable property.

·      In December 2010 MoJ has submitted additional proposals for amendments to the
       auctions of immovable, which will streamline the procedure of approval of auction
       act before the court. The amendments, if adopted, will provide for fewer
       participants in the court proceedings, thus streamlining the procedures.
       Additionally, during the meeting of the representatives from the International
       Monetary Fund, MoJ, Latvian Commercial Bank Association, Council of Latvian
       Sworn Bailiffs, Association of Insolvency Administrators, Riga Regional Court,
       held in the MoJ on 04.11.2010, several additional issues were identified how to
       improve and streamline foreclosure procedures. These issues will be considered
       during 2011 and will result in concrete actions and/or measures taken by the
       participants involved in the meeting mentioned before.
·      The FCMC adopted on 29.08.2009 the Guidelines on Principles for Household
       Loan Restructuring. The FCMC has required banks to submit information on the
       compliance of the bank's activity and internal documents with the Guidelines
       applying to mortgage contracts concluded with consumers and in cases, when a
       particular physical person is in financial trouble that could burden or cause
       impossibilities to execute a mortgage contract. On the basis of received
       information the FCMC has evaluated the level of compliance with the Guidelines,
       made the results public and will continue to monitor further application of the
       principles by banks to household loan restructuring.

    E. Debt Restructuring Strategy

10. The Government has prepared, but put on hold, a state guarantee program for
restructured loans. As small borrowers are afraid to engage in loan renegotiations with
their banks, the Government has designed a guarantee program to relieve borrowers'
debt service to a level commensurate with their payment capacity. However, taking into
account the limited fiscal resources of the Government as well as other high social
priorities in the country the program will be launched only if it is possible to allocate
financial resources for its implementation.

11. The government of Latvia on 12.05.2010 decided to waive launching the support
programme for private mortgage loans foreseen in the Private debt restructuring strategy.
The Association of Latvian Commercial Banks had a position that the banks are not
willing to participate in the programme in its current design. The Association of Latvian
Commercial Banks considered that the situation in the loan market has stabilized and the
banks have performed restructuring for large number of borrowers in difficulties without
                                          31
 support from the state. In the same time the Minister of Finance had an opinion that the
 programme is the best possible compromise which has been conciliated with all involved
 parties and there are no more possibilities to make any relieves in it or allocate more
 resources from the state budget. Thus not having support from the banks it was decided
 that the programme cannot be implemented and the decision was taken not to proceed
 with approval of implementation regulations.

Stability at Parex Banka
 12. On 24.03.2009 following enactment of Article 59.9 Paragraph one of the Credit
 Institution Law and European Commission's (EC) decision on the compliance of
 planned state aid with the Treaty Establishing the European Community, the Cabinet of
 Ministers (CoM) decided to increase considerably the share of the state indirectly
 through the state JSC Privatisation Agency (PA) buying 165 000 000 registered shares of
 the new emission with the right of vote for nominal value of 1 lat and PA make
 investment to the subordinated capital of the Parex in amount of 62 000 000 to ensure
 capital adequacy.

 13. On 11.05.2009 EC allowed Latvian Government to buy Parex shares of the new
 emission thus increase the core capital of the Parex and also invest in the subordinated
 capital of the Parex. EC consent was necessary for Parex to receive additional state aid
 and improve its capital adequacy. EC has allowed Latvian Government to invest in the
 core capital and subordinated capital of the Parex necessary for the Parex capital
 adequacy to reach 11%.

 14. Since for the time being the Parex does not have sufficient liquid resources to
 make financial operations without assistance in full amount without limitation of
 liabilities, on 19.06.2009 the FCMC Council decided to extend the deadline for
 limitation of liabilities imposed by the decision of the CoM and FCMC on 01.12.2008
 "On limitation of JSC Parex Banka liabilities" till 30.11.2009.

 15. On 23.07.2009 the EBRD and Parex concluded a subordinated loan agreement in
 amount of 22 million euro and also agreed on amendments to the share purchase
 agreement and shareholders agreement.

 16. To ensure capital adequacy of the JSC Parex Banka on 13.10.2009 the CoM
 decided that indirectly through the PA the state had to increase its share in the Bank
 buying 165 000 000 registered shares of the new emission with the right of vote for
 nominal value of 1 (one) lat.

 17.   On 29.10.2009 core capital of the bank was increased by 24 300 000 lats.

 18. Since for the time being the Parex does not have sufficient liquid resources to
 make financial operations without assistance in full amount without limitation of
 liabilities, on 13.11.2009 the FCMC Council decided to extend the deadline for
 limitation of liabilities imposed by the decision of the CoM and FCMC on 01.12.2008
 "On limitation of JSC Parex Banka liabilities" till 30.06.2010.



                                           32
19. On 17.11.2009 the Government has achieved conceptual decision on launching
restructuring or division of the Parex and has assigned PA by 30.12.2009 to submit to the
Government a new restructuring plan. To ensure receipt of effective consultations the
CoM decided to establish an inter-institutional working group to monitor implementation
of the agreement; the working group will comprise representatives of MoF, FCMC, BoL,
PA and Treasury.

20. On 25.01.2010 a service agreement concluded with an international consultant
"Nomura International plc" according to which "Nomura" will develop a Parex
restructuring plan and ensure implementation of the plan.

21. On 09.02.2010 the Government approved allocation of additional financial
resources to the Parex in a form of new term deposit in amount of 102 million lats for the
bank to repay regular syndicated loan.

22. On 15.02.2010 Parex made regular syndicated loan payment transferring 310
million euro (218 million lats) to lenders.

23. On 15.02.2010 Parex has emitted euro obligations in amount of 17.68 million euro
(12.4 million lats). The first set of emission of "Parex Banka" debt securities was closed
by obligations in amount 17 680 000 euro and according to appropriate provisions the
deposit contracts for two years were concluded in amount of 130 million euro (91.4
million lats).

24. On 23.02.2010 the Government approved the decision to increase the Parex core
capital ­ up to 261 527 295 lats.

25. On 23.03.2010 the Government made a decision on the Parex restructuring model
envisaging perspective division of "Parex Banka" in a new company (new bank)
consistent with future business profile of the bank. According to the chosen model the
restructuring plan for the bank was also approved and MoF shall submit the plan for
approval to the EC.

26.   On 31.03.2010 Parex restructuring plan submitted for approval to the EC.

27. According to the Parex restructuring plan "Separation of the new bank" approved
by the CoM, on 01.06.2010 the Government assigned PA to establish a new credit
institution with 100% of capital belonging to the state in a person of PA. Government
assigned PA after the receipt of permission from the EC regarding the "Parex Banka"
restructuring plan to increase core capital of the new bank up to the amount envisaged
for the state aid in the restructuring plan.

28. To avoid unexpected drainage of the money from the Parex, thus maintaining
moderate deposit changes, ensuring stability and solvency of Parex and not endangering
successful implementation of the restructuring plan, on 11.06.2010 the FCMC Council
decided to extend the deadline for limitation of liabilities imposed by the decision of the
CoM and FCMC on 01.12.2008 "On limitation of JSC Parex Banka liabilities" till
31.12.2010.

                                           33
 29. To implement the CoM decision of 01.06.2010 to continue the work at Parex
 restructuring and stating that PA shall establish a new credit institution with a core
 capital of 4 million lats, on 18.06.2010 a contract between the MoF and PA was
 concluded on provision of a loan to finance the core capital of the "New Bank". For the
 loan a part of previous deposits in the "Parex Banka" was used thus decreased total
 deposit of the Treasury in the bank by respective sum.

 30. On 29.06.2010 FCMC Council decided to grant a licence to JSC "Citadele Banka"
 for credit institution work. JSC "Citadele Banka" is the newly created bank within the
 framework of JSC "Parex Banka" restructuring plan, and its founder is PA.
 Commission's Council decided to confirm that duties of the chairman of the board of
 JSC "Citadele Banka" will be performed by Juris J kobsons, duties of board members
 will be performed by Guntis Be avskis and Valters bele, duties of council members
 will be performed by And s belis, Juris Vask ns and Kl vs Vasks, but Amanda Bikse
 will perform duties of the Head of Internal Audit Service of JSC "Citadele Banka".

 31. On 30.07.2010 FCMC Council decided to allow JSC "Parex Banka" to hand over
 to JSC "Citadele Banka" the company of credit institution "Parex Banka".

 32. On 30.07.2010 "Parex Banka" has also submitted to the court claims against
 former co-owners and board members Val rijs Kargins and Viktors Krasovickis
 requesting to cover losses caused to the bank at the time they were operating. Having
 evaluated loan and deposit agreements concluded within the time period from January 1,
 1995 till December 5, 2008 between the bank and both former bank's board member,
 who were also majority shareholders of the bank, as well as associated persons, the
 "Parex Banka" has concluded that many deals were concluded in conflict with bank's
 interests and at provisions unfavourable to the bank which differ significantly from the
 provisions at which agreements would be concluded with not associated persons.

 33. On 01.08.2010 the bank "Citadele" ­ established in the result of "Parex Banka"
 restructuring ­ started to work.

 34. On 15.09.2010 EC approved Parex Banka restructuring plan accepting it
 compliance with EU state aid control principles. EU believes that the restructuring plan
 will ensure long-term viability of the bank Citadele giving also an opportunity to put into
 effect other assets of the Parex Banka.

Recapitalization of Mortgage and Land Bank
 35. In line with current concept "Transformation of the State-owned JSC Latvijas
 Hipoteku un zemes Banka (LHZB) into Development bank" (approved by CoM decree
 No 820 of 3 December 2009) LHZB is to be transformed into an entity with only
 development bank operations. This concept provides that LHZB will be a pure
 development bank and it will gradually phase out its commercial activities. Taking into
 account decisions adopted by the Government of Latvia, commitments undertaken by the
 authorities of the Republic of Latvia and decisions of the EC towards LHZB, commercial
 activities of LHZB must be phased out by 2013.


                                            34
 36. Initial LHZB's transformation plan was considered by CoM on 25.05.2010. CoM
 decided to elaborate the transformation plan in greater detail, paying particular attention
 to the sale options of LHZB's commercial activities. In accordance with the decision of
 CoM, MoF is to invite a consultant to elaborate the proposal for sell-off of the Bank's
 commercial assets. CoM decided that MoF should report on attraction of the consultant
 in August 2010. According to the Letter of Intent with IMF further work is needed on a
 detailed transformation plan for LHZB and a structural benchmark to this effect has been
 set for the end of September. Concurrently on 15.07.2010 (in Riga) and on 20.07.2010
 (in Brussels) Supplemental Memorandum of Understanding with the European Union
 was signed. This document provided for the appointment by the end of July 2010 of an
 independent consultant for the purpose of advising the government in the preparation of
 a comprehensive transformation plan of LHZB, to be submitted to the EC (DG
 Competition) by the end of September 2010. Following the above decisions and
 obligation towards EC and IMF on 10.09.2010, independent consultant (IBS SEB
 Enskilda SIA in collaboration with KPMG Baltics SIA and Kronbergs & ukste
 Attorneys at Law) was hired to elaborate the proposal for sell-off of the Bank's
 commercial assets.

 37. Having performed independent analyses of the possible scenarios of phasing out
 LHZB's commercial activities, the consultant advised to proceed with the asset sale
 scenario. The draft transformation plan has been prepared by the consultant to provide a
 detailed action plan for a market oriented way of termination of LHZB commercial
 activities in line with the strategy accepted by the Government of Latvia. The goal of the
 transformation plan is to ensure most efficient termination of commercial operations in
 compliance with all legal requirements and in particular state aid regulation. In
 particular, termination of commercial operations through asset sale has been chosen as
 the optimal solution.

 38. MoF has submitted the draft transformation plan to CoM, which has been reviewed
 by CoM on the sittings of 14.12.2010 and 04.01.2011 and postponed. On the sitting of
 11.01.2011 CoM took decision to continue reviewing the transformation plan of LHZB,
 after receiving the proposals for optimization of the system of development financial
 institutions in Latvia on the sitting of 08.02.2011 in order to have a full view on solution
 for both commercial and development part of LHZB.

Structural reforms
   A. Supervisory and regulatory framework

 39. The measures to improve the supervision and regulation of the financial system
 have been taken. The FCMC has revised regulations on assets valuation and
 provisioning (effective as of April 2009), has stepped up supervisory guidance on banks
 internal capital adequacy assessment process and calculation of additional capital buffers
 above the minimum regulatory requirements (also effective from April 2009), updated
 regulations on liquidity risk management to incorporate Basel guidelines and the
 recommendations of the CEBS (see paragraph 6).



                                            35
40. Regulations on Assessment of Asset Quality and Provisioning were approved by
the FCMC Board on 25.03.2009. Regulations upgrade loan loss provisioning
methodology. The document stipulates the procedure and responsibilities of banks'
management for ensuring sound valuation of assets carried out at amortised cost. Loan
loss provisions are recognised in the financial statements in accordance with the
International Accounting Standards (IAS). In cases when prudential provisions exceed
those acceptable under the IAS, the difference is deducted from own funds.

41. FCMC Regulations on Credit Risk Management were approved on 28.12.2009,
effective as of 06.01.2010. Banks have to ensure full compliance with the Regulation by
01.07.2010 at the latest. As compared to the previously effective Guidelines on Credit
Risk Management, the Regulations:

  ·   further specify requirements for strategies, policies and procedures for credit risk
      management, including requirement to estimate risk bearing capacity and to set
      risk tolerance limit;
  ·   enhance responsibility of supervisory and executive board for sound credit risk
      management;
  ·   stipulate that concentration limits have to be established by bank, including
      concentration limits on exposures with currency mismatch;
  ·   require that stress-testing requirements are specified. Banks shall have at least 2
      stress-testing scenarios (base case and pessimistic) and assess impact of stressed
      conditions in a short-term (up to 1 year) and protracted phase. Stress-testing results
      shall be analysed and incorporated in credit risk management, capital planning and
      design of contingency plans.

42. FCMC Regulations on Underlying Principles of Remuneration Policies were
approved on 21.12.2009. The Regulations mandate financial and capital market
participants to establish remuneration systems that discourage excessive risk taking and
remuneration for short-term results, without assessing a long-term impact of the taken
decisions and transactions. In 2010 amendments to the Law on Credit Institutions have
been drafted to:

  ·   provide the FCMC with the right to limit or prohibit payout of dividends and
      variable part of remuneration in case there is a need to strengthen bank's capital
      base;
  ·   specify requirements for remuneration policy in a bank benefiting from State Aid ­
      remuneration policies shall be reconsidered immediately; limits on remuneration of
      the Supervisory and Management Boards shall be established; variable
      remuneration to the Management Board is permissible only in exceptional cases;
      variable remuneration for other categories of staff shall be calibrated so as not to
      damage bank's capital base or hinder timely repayment of the state aid.

43. Draft amendments to the Regulations on Underlying Principles of Remuneration
Policies further specify responsibilities of Supervisory Board on remuneration issues and



                                           36
deferrals, as well as set prohibition on the use of personal hedging strategies to
circumvent the regulations.

44. In order to perform more comprehensive analysis of the loans that have been
restructured and to have information on newly granted and newly restructured loans, the
FCMC adopted amendments to the Regulations on the Preparation and Submission of
Information on Loan Portfolio Structure of Banks on 05.02.2010. The amendments have
been fully effective as from 2nd quarter 2010.

45. The FCMC monitors the developments in the banking sector, where banks are
establishing separate structures (regardless of the legal status), whose core activities
include management of non-performing loans or foreclosed collateral (hereinafter ­
transferred assets). To ensure prudential treatment of transferred assets, on 15.02.2010
the FCMC sent a letter to banks to highlight supervisory position and requirements on:

  ·   inclusion of the special purpose vehicles into the scope of consolidated
      supervision;
  ·   assessment of risk inherent in problem assets transferred to other entities within a
      banking group;
  ·   treatment of problem assets transferred to investment funds;
  ·   derecognition of transferred problem assets taking into account continuing
      involvement.

46. Prompt Remedial Action Framework (PRAF) adopted by the FCMC on
21.08.2009 formalized the regularity and content of the reports that FCMC's Board
receives on banks. These reports ensure that FCMC's board members have up to date
information and analysis of the financial situation of each bank and therefore are able to
promptly respond and take appropriate measures if situations in the bank requires
attention or certain actions from the regulator.

47. PRAF also helps to ensure that sanctions or corrective measures applied in a
particular situation are consistent and similar cases are addressed in a similar way (i.e.,
similar sanctions or corrective measures for the same type of breaches or potential
breaches).

48. On 03.12.2010 PRAF was amended in order to establish guidelines for liquidity
