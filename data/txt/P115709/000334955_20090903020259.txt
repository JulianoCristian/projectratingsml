                      assistance is part of a joint IFI initiative, where the EBRD, the EIB, and the
                      World Bank Group have pledged to support banking sectors in Central and
                      Eastern Europe with up to 24.5 billion over a two year period.

Main Policy Areas     The loan supports a comprehensive financial sector reform program,
                      including: (i) short term measures aimed at containing the financial sector
                      crisis, and (ii) long term structural reforms aimed at enhancing the
                      resilience of the system to future potential shocks.
                      The short term crisis management measures include measures to strengthen
                      the banking sector's solvency and liquidity, as well as measures to facilitate
                      the renegotiations of corporate and mortgage debts with the objective to
                      avoid the closure of viable firms and the foreclosure of residential
                      properties wherever possible.
                       · The banking sector strengthening measures include: (i) conducting stress
                         tests of the banking sector under severe macro-economic conditions and
                         requiring banks showing signs of solvency or liquidity problems under
                         the stress tests to prepare capital increase and liquidity contingency
                         plans; (ii) preparing a detailed Contingency Plan for the banking sector,
                         ensuring prompt government intervention as and where needed; and (iii)
                         improving the bank resolution framework to enable swift bank
                         interventions.
                       · The debt renegotiation facilitation measures include: (i) amending the
                         insolvency framework to enable out-of-court corporate restructuring
                         negotiations, (ii) publishing guidelines to facilitate renegotiations of
                         corporate and mortgage debts, and (iii) organizing seminars on this
                         subject to increase awareness of options among borrowers.

Risks      and           Risk     1.     Financial instability - With a contraction of real GDP for 2009 of
Mitigation                        18 percent, and another year of negative growth expected in 2010, banks in
                                  Latvia are expected to suffer from very high levels of NPLs over the
                                  medium term. In addition, with highly volatile deposits, and no access to
                                  market funding, liquidity problems cannot be excluded.

                                  2.      The risk is mitigated by the policy actions supported by the
                                  proposed operation, including reforms in crisis management, bank
                                  resolution, debt restructuring, and supervision and regulation. In addition,
                                  the authorities have completed stress tests, which have increased their
                                  awareness of where problems in the banking sector might arise. This in
                                  turn enables them to intensify their supervision of specific institutions as
                                  needed. A Strategic Contingency Plan is also in preparation including a
                                  detailed strategy for banks that may pose a threat to financial stability.

                                  3.      Macroeconomic risk - The Government is undertaking a very
                                  ambitious economic adjustment program based on a macroeconomic
                                  strategy that includes severe fiscal consolidation measures and wage cuts
                                  under the fixed exchange rate regime. The severity of the measures may
                                  make them difficult to implement. Also, the much higher government
                                  deficits will make it harder to meet the Maastricht criteria and may delay

    These indicators are influenced by other factors, such as the general economic conditions in the region.
                   3

the program's exit strategy of Euro adoption. Deflation may be even
deeper than currently projected, which could also jeopardize Euro
adoption. However, the economy may also recover faster than expected if
global growth resumes faster.

4.     The IMF program framework, reinforced by continued
international support, particularly from the EU, seeks to mitigate
these risks. The risk is also mitigated by the size of the multilateral
financial package, equivalent to 35 percent of GDP, in support of the
Government's program. In addition, the support of Latvia's international
partners, particularly the EU, represents a key safeguard to the IMF
program. The EU's commitment of 3.1 billion under the international
support package has provided important space for implementation of the
programmed reforms. In a July 27 press statement announcing their
disbursement of 1.2 billion, the EU affirmed that it will continue to work
closely with the Latvian authorities and the IMF to ensure Latvia
implements successfully its economic reform program and its timely
repayment of, all loans associated with the international program to
support Latvia. Thus, while the risks are significant, continued current
account surpluses, Latvia's strong commitment to the program, expected
improvements in global financing conditions, and EU support provide key
safeguards.

5.      Political risk - The severe adjustment measures may alienate the
electorate, weaken political consensus on the structural reforms required
for an income-based real depreciation of the Lat, and ultimately lead to
early elections. This could exacerbate an already complex environment for
economic management and sustained and in-depth structural reforms.

6.      This risk is partially mitigated by the adhesion of all coalition
parties to the revised IMF Letter of Intent, wide consultations on the
program, and the implementation of laws and regulations to support
the reforms. The Letter of Intent with the IMF of August 2009 was
signed by all parties of the coalition government, notwithstanding earlier
questions by some of them on the need for a Fund arrangement. In
addition, the 2010 budget reforms have been the subject of wide
consultations, including with line ministries, municipal governments, and
social partners. Finally, many reforms supported by this operation are
being implemented by amendments to laws and regulations that ensure a
solid framework for crisis resolution and structural reforms.

7.     Social Risk - The cuts in fiscal spending create a risk that some
important social services are cut and that the gains Latvia made since
accession in converging with EU welfare standards will be lost.

8.     The risk is mitigated by the provision of funding to social safety
nets and a restructuring of public expenditures partly informed by
analytical work prepared prior to the crisis with support from the
World Bank. In addition, a Social Sector, Public Administration, and
Safety Nets DPL is under preparation, aimed at mitigating the social and
poverty impacts of the crisis and of the Government's fiscal consolidation,
through measures in public sector reform, social protection, education, and
                                   4

               health. Other mitigating factors include the measures supported by this
               proposed DPL to ensure financial stability, therefore avoiding potential
               losses to depositors, and to facilitate debt restructuring and avoid
               foreclosures of residential properties wherever possible.

               9.      Insufficient institutional capacity - The reforms in the banking
               system require an increased capacity of the supervisor to anticipate
               deteriorating trends and undertake the necessary corrective actions.

               10.     The risk is mitigated by the proposed policy reforms to
               strengthen the regulatory and supervisory framework, specifically in
               areas of higher risks (such as asset quality and provisioning). The
               operation supports measures designed to enhance the capacity of the
               supervisor to monitor the banking system and react in a timely and
               effective manner, the conduct of stress tests, the preparation of a Strategic
               Contingency Plan, an improved stress testing framework, the establishment
               of a Prompt Remedial Action Plan, as well as strengthened prudential
               regulations. The Bank has provided and will continue to provide technical
               assistance in these areas relying on Trust Funds.

1.          This document describes a program supported by a Development Policy
Loan (DPL) for financial sector reforms to the Republic of Latvia for an amount of
200 million. The loan is part of an international financial support package of 7.5
billion, to which the International Monetary Fund (IMF) committed 1.7 billion, the
European Commission (EC) 3.1 billion, Nordic countries (Sweden, Denmark, Finland,
and Norway) 1.8 billion, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD)
0.1 billion, and the Czech Republic, Poland, and Estonia 0.4 billion. The Bank's
proposed share in the package is 400 million, to be provided through two DPL
operations of 200 million each. To date, Latvia has received about 3.0 billion from the
rescue package from the IMF and the EC.2

2.         This loan will support crisis management measures and structural
reforms to stabilize the financial sector and increase its resilience to future shocks.
The reforms are to be implemented by the Financial and Capital Market Commission
(FCMC), the Bank of Latvia (BoL), the Ministry of Finance (MoF), the Ministry of
Justice (MoJ), and the Ministry of Economy (MoE). The Bank is also preparing a social
sector DPL that will aim to minimize the social impact of the crisis by ensuring that
safeguards are in place to maintain critical social services (including in health and
education) in the midst of the economic contraction and fiscal adjustment. The loan will
be a Euro-denominated fixed spread loan of LIBOR plus 200 basis points, a front-end fee
of 100 basis points, with a maturity of 10 years.

Growing macro imbalances and buildup of vulnerability, 2004-2007

3.         Following its accession into the EU in 2004, the Latvian economy
experienced rapid economic growth averaging over 10 percent per year. This high
growth was driven almost entirely by domestic demand, encouraged by rapid credit
growth, large real wage increases, and expectations of a progressive catching-up with
European Union (EU) living standards. New investment was concentrated in the non-

meeting of August 27, 2009.

tradable sectors, creating a real estate boom, which culminated in an over 60 percent
growth in housing prices in both 2005 and 2006.

4.          Pro-cyclical fiscal policy contributed to the domestic boom. Real public
expenditures grew by 80 percent between 2003 and 2007 as the authorities spent
cyclically strong tax revenues and began receiving substantial inflows of net EU grants.
However, despite strong revenue growth, the fiscal balance remained in deficit in most
years (except in 2007 when the budget saw a small surplus of 0.7 percent of GDP). High
levels of spending, for example in health and education, did not lead to strong outcomes,
indicating the presence of important spending inefficiencies. Large wage increases in the
public sector contributed both to maintaining a sizeable premium over average wages in
the private sector and to crowding out fiscal space for additional productive spending on
human and physical capital. Pension benefits linked to wage growth rose in parallel,
representing an important source of fiscal risk. Some large-scale, non-EU funded, off-
budget investments, especially at the municipal level, generated contingent liabilities,
while the pace of absorption of EU funds was over-estimated and the recurrent cost
implications of such investment projects were inadequately budgeted in medium-term
fiscal plans.

5.         The boom in domestic demand fuelled large macroeconomic imbalances.
Consumer inflation had been rising since accession, from 6.2 percent in 2004 to over 10
percent in 2007. The labor market showed signs of overheating as migration of Latvians
to the EU15 countries added to labor shortages and wage pressures. As a result, rapid
wage growth outstripped productivity growth undermining Latvia's international
competitiveness. Driven by high domestic demand, the current account deficit widened
from 12.8 percent of GDP in 2004 to almost 23 percent in 2007.

6.         The growth in domestic credit, which fuelled the domestic demand,
resulted in rising household and corporate indebtedness, often in Euros. Much of
the banks' lending was directed towards households in the form of mortgage loans; the
share of households in total bank assets rose to 28 percent by end 2007 (equivalent to 40
percent of GDP, up from 18 percent of GDP in 2004) with mortgage loans almost
doubling each year until mid-2007. As a result, the indebtedness of corporate entities and
households more than tripled between 2004 and 2007, exceeding 80 percent of GDP.

7.         The expansion of credit was largely financed by external borrowing from
private banks resulting in high loan-to-deposit ratios. For foreign banks (which
account for almost 60 percent of the banking system), their parent institutions were the
main source of financing. Domestic banks relied substantially on short term syndicated
loans (as well as non-resident deposits). Overall the loan to deposit ratio at 248 percent
in 2007 was the highest in the region. With the bulk of the loans denominated in foreign
currency (around 86.3 percent of total loans in 2007 were FX denominated, out of which
96 percent in Euros), and much of it unhedged, the banking sector also became indirectly
vulnerable to foreign exchange risk (that is, through the risk of an increase in credit
losses).
                                                     7

8.         As a result, Latvia's external indebtedness increased significantly.
Latvia's external debt to GDP rose from 90 percent of GDP in 2004 to 127 percent by
2007, with short term debt to GDP rising to over 55 percent of GDP in 2007.

9.          Overall, Latvia entered the financial crisis with significant vulnerability,
in particular a large current account deficit, high external debt, and a very high loan to
deposit ratio in the financial sector (see Table 1).

The impact of the international financial crisis

10.         In the second half of 2008, in the context of the global financial crisis,
these vulnerabilities coalesced into a financial and balance of payments crisis. The
large macroeconomic imbalances made Latvia one of the most vulnerable countries by
the time the global financial crisis started to unfold.

11.        Concerns among foreign banks about their overexposure to the Baltic
countries resulted in a sharp slowdown in credit. The slowdown in credit, in
conjunction with a weakening in external demand in the context of depreciations against
                                              8

the Euro of the currencies of some of Latvia's external partners, and deterioration in
economic sentiment, led to a significant downturn in domestic economic activity.

12.         While the current account narrowed by 10 percentage points during the
course of 2008, vulnerabilities to external shocks remained high. The current account
deficit narrowed to 12.6 percent of GDP, following a significant drop in imports on the
back of stagnating domestic demand. Nevertheless, external debt remained high at 128
percent of GDP at end 2008, with debt maturing within one year (including non-resident
deposits at call) exceeding 50 percent of GDP. This exposed Latvia to the risk of a
sudden capital stop.

13.        Moreover, tax revenues fell in the wake of the economic downturn,
resulting in increasing fiscal pressures and a widening budget deficit. For 2008, the
Government targeted a surplus of 1 percent of GDP but with rapidly weakening domestic
demand and related tax revenues, the deficit exceeded 3 percent of GDP, despite attempts
to cut appropriations at the end of the year.

14.         These macroeconomic imbalances led financial markets to become
increasingly concerned about the sustainability of the peg arrangement as well as the
potential fiscal implications of the contingent private sector liabilities. The currency peg
came under substantial pressure in September 2008 and, by November 2008, the BoL's
foreign exchange reserves had fallen by 20 percent to Euro 3.4 billion. Latvia was
downgraded by rating agencies and its Eurobond spread increased to around 600 basis
points, while the 5-year Credit Default Swap (CDS) spread jumped to around 1000 basis
points in November 2008. Liquidity demands from non-resident depositors aggravated
these outcomes.

15.         The banking sector had entered the crisis with good financial stability
indicators (FSIs). At the end of 2007, the capital adequacy ratio stood at 11.1 percent,
the liquidity ratio (liquid assets as a proportion of liabilities maturing in 30 days) at more
than 55 percent (above the regulatory minimum of 30 percent), the Return on Assets
(ROA) at 2 percent, and the Return on Equity (ROE) at 24 percent (Annex 3).

16.         However, the reliance of the financial sector on external financing made it
highly vulnerable to liquidity shocks. As noted, a large proportion of the banking
system in Latvia is foreign owned, involving primarily subsidiaries of Swedish banks
(see Annex 3). The introduction of financial support schemes by home authorities of
these banks boosted confidence and helped stabilize their deposits in Latvia. By contrast,
locally owned banks, which, as noted, relied on more fragile forms of finance --
syndicated loans and non-resident deposits -- faced considerable redemption pressures
given the worsened global liquidity conditions in late 2008. While deposits fell
significantly in the whole banking system, non-resident deposits were particularly
affected, with Parex Bank -- the largest domestic bank and the second largest bank in
Latvia -- losing one quarter of its deposits between end August and November 2008.

17.      The deposit run on Parex Bank led to the state taking a majority stake in
the bank's capital and to a restriction on deposit withdrawals. Parex Bank is
                                            9

considered systemically important (and therefore too big to fail) given its role in the
domestic payment system and in municipal financing, its large branch network and large
market share. In mid-November 2008 therefore, in the face of growing illiquidity, the
Government took a 51 percent stake in the bank. This, however, failed to stem the
outflow of deposits and the authorities had to increase its liquidity support. In early
December 2008, the Latvian Financial and Capital Market Supervisory Authority
(FCMC) restricted withdrawals by corporates and individuals from the bank and the State
further increased its shareholding to 85 percent. New management was put in place to
work out a resolution that would minimize losses for the state and allow for a return of
the bank to the private sector. Further risks to the bank's stability came from the need to
roll-over Euro 775 million of syndicated loans falling due in February and June 2009.
Negotiations with syndicated lenders led to the rescheduling of payments in March 2009.
A due diligence analysis, focused on the bank's asset quality, liquidity and solvency, was
conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers in early 2009, on the basis of which additional
provisions were booked in the 2008 financial statements. In April, EBRD approved the
acquisition of 25 percent plus 1 of the ordinary shares of Parex Bank for LVL 59.5
million (84.2 million) and a subordinated loan of 22 million qualifying as Tier 2
capital.

18.        These developments led the Government to seek external financial
support and to agree to an international stabilization program, supported by the EC,
the IMF, EBRD, Nordic and Central European countries and the World Bank. The
requested rescue package amounted to 7.5 billion; equivalent to 35 percent of GDP.

19.          The international stabilization package is anchored on maintaining
Latvia's exchange rate peg through strong domestic adjustment policies and
substantial external financing. The 27 month program is based on preserving the Lat
exchange rate peg to the Euro within a narrow band. The authorities have chosen to
maintain the quasi currency board that served them well in the past. Among other
factors, they have taken into consideration the balance sheet effect of a potential
devaluation and the risks that this would result in severe corporate, banking sector and
social distress, which could further contribute to output contraction and sever Latvia's
links to capital markets for a protracted period of time. While maintaining the peg,
exceptionally strong domestic adjustment policies, including very substantial fiscal
consolidation and sizable external financing, would be needed.

20.        The key elements of the program focus on measures to stabilize the
financial system, measures to achieve a large fiscal consolidation, and income
policies based on nominal wage reductions, while maintaining unchanged the
exchange rate peg. Financial sector measures aimed at stemming the loss of bank
deposits and international reserves and reforms to restore confidence in the banking
system in the medium-term. Fiscal measures concentrated primarily on spending and
incomes policies aimed at achieving a large fiscal consolidation. Fiscal consolidation
was to be backed by structural reforms, strengthening public financial management as
well as comprehensive reforms of the education system and of the civil service and state
administration.
                                            10


21.         However, the economic downturn proved much more severe than
expected, creating challenges for the implementation of the agreed program and
delaying the disbursement of funds. As discussed below, economic activity data in
early 2009 suggest a sharp deterioration in the economy. During a mission in February
2009, the IMF also identified delays in achieving the originally envisaged fiscal savings.
After the Government failed to pass a supplementary budget in March as had been agreed
in the stabilization program (partly due to political changes), the IMF delayed the release
of its second tranche (200 million), with the expectation that the Parliament would adopt
budget amendments in June 2009.

22.        On June 16, the Parliament passed a supplementary budget with
additional spending cuts of LVL 500 million (US$991 million). The measures include
revenue increases (amounting to 0.61 percent of GDP) through higher excise tax rates,
lowering the threshold of tax-exempt income, and increases in state revenue from
dividends. On the expenditure side, the reductions (amounting to 5.48 percent of GDP)
come from a lower wage bill (reflecting a 20 percent nominal wage reduction and a fall in
public sector employment) and lower social transfers (including a 10 percent nominal
pension cut and a 70 percent reduction of pensions for working pensioners, which are
both challenged in the constitutional court). Mitigating measures to the potential poverty
impact of these cuts are being defined by the Government in coordination with the World
Bank and IMF teams. Based on this supplementary budget, the EC approved on June 26
the disbursement of its second tranche of 1.2 billion (US$1.6 billion). The EC further
agreed on a budget deficit of 8.5 percent in 2010, 6.5 percent in 2011, and 3 percent by
2012; this is the fiscal path that is contained in Latvia's revised Economic Stabilization
and Growth Revival Programme (ESA basis). The IMF has recently concluded
negotiations and the disbursement of the second tranche of about 200 million is
expected to take place soon. The IMF Board meeting is scheduled to take place in late
August 2009. The Czech Republic is also expected to disburse 200 million shortly.

23.          The economy is now expected to decline by 18 percent in 2009 and by 4
percent in 2010. Data from early 2009 suggest a sharp deterioration in the economy,
with output falling 18 percent year on year in the first quarter and retail sales and
industrial production experiencing a larger contraction than originally anticipated.
Construction and consumer durables spending have fallen sharply (car sales were down
by 80 percent in the first quarter), in part reflecting the unavailability of credit. Labor
force surveys indicate a 14 percent unemployment rate in the first quarter, up 4
percentage points in three months. The labor market deterioration is expected to continue
with unemployment rising to about 17.5 percent in 2010. Over the medium term a very
gradual economic recovery is projected. Output growth is expected to return to positive
territory in 2011 when the economy is expected to grow by around 1.5 percent (Table 2).

24.         The measures included in the supplementary budget should contain the
2009 fiscal deficit to around 13 percent of GDP. However, the supplementary budget
relies heavily on one-off measures. The measures also rely on across the board budget
cuts, thus being regressive in nature. In the baseline, the fiscal deficit is expected to
improve marginally in 2010 relative to 2009 to around 12 percent of GDP. In view of the
projected continued decline in economic activity in 2010, achieving a 12 percent of GDP
deficit next year will require further significant fiscal adjustment. The Government has
                                             12

already committed to introducing targeted expenditure cuts and tax measures amounting
to 4 percent of GDP and has broadly identified further measures estimated to yield 2½
percent of GDP should this prove necessary.

25.         Fiscal consolidation has been accompanied by a major redeployment of
public spending. The initial emphasis of the program was to rein in the public
expenditure relative to GDP in the face of the incipient recession. The spending-to-GDP
ratio had increased from 35.6 percent in 2007 to 38.5 percent in 2008 (see Table 3),
mainly as a result of an increase in social transfers and government consumption, and
would have bulged further if the initial, highly expansionary budget had been adopted for
2009. In the event, a new budget law was adopted on December 12, 2008 as an integral
part of the Government's economic stabilization program, with expenditure reductions of
about 5 percentage points of GDP (compared to the baseline) in a bid to keep the
spending-to-GDP ratio in 2009 close to the 2008 level. Major consolidation measures
targeted broad economic categories particularly through cuts in nominal public sector
wage, rationalizing subsidies and outlays on goods and services, while core social
protection and EU-supported project spending were maintained.

26.         This first round of fiscal measures proved insufficient to stabilize the
spending to GDP ratio in the face of the economic contraction and inertial effect of
the generous pension increases granted in 2008. In response to these trends, the
Government adopted additional fiscal consolidation measures that combine further broad-
stroke measures with more surgical interventions to tease out efficiency gains through
structural reform of key government programs (drawing in part on earlier World Bank
PER recommendations) including to increase the efficiency and quality of education,
strengthen efficiency and targeting of healthcare services, make limited and targeted
pension reductions, and reduce less targeted social spending. At the same time, the
amended 2009 program provides funding of some 1½ percent of GDP in 2009 to expand
social safety nets and accelerate the absorption of EU funds and other foreign financial
assistance.

27.          Although the spending to GDP ratio is now set to expand markedly in
2009, the net result of these two waves of fiscal measures has been to change
substantially the composition of spending, with the share of social protection measures
rising from 22 to 30 percent of the budget (8 to 14 percent of GDP), and that of the wage
bill dropping from 20 to 16 percent of the budget (stable in percentage of GDP as a result
of the latter's contraction).

28.         The Government intends to further reduce the deficit in 2010 and
beyond, mostly through further expenditure restructuring. It has established a
consultative Reform Management Group to advise on the drafting of the 2010 budget.
The Government will carry out a broad public service reform to keep the public sector
wages and salaries close 7 percent of GDP through further targeted wage cuts. Moreover,
in order to preserve the sustainability of the pension system, it will also prepare a pension
reform that will include reviewing all special pension regimes. As a result, the structure
of spending is likely to further change in coming years, towards a lower share of public
consumption and limited increase in spending on pension (Table 3).

 29.         From double digits in 2008, inflation is falling rapidly to around 3 percent
 and the current account is expected to show a surplus of 4.5 percent in 2009. The
 faster than anticipated improvement in the current account balance has been driven
 primarily by the collapse of imports rather than improved competitiveness, reflecting the
 continued contraction of domestic demand. The decline in wages in Q1 2009 has
 resulted in a slight depreciation of the unit labor cost-based real effective exchange rate.
 The current account is expected to continue to run a surplus over the next few years.

 30.        The capital and financial account is expected to weaken considerably to
 reach a deficit of 25 percent of GDP in 2009. Outflows result from the repayment of
 Parex Bank's syndicated loans, difficulties in rolling-over syndicated loans faced by local
 banks, a small decrease in the exposure of foreign banks to Latvia, and a continued
 outflow of non-resident deposits. Improvement is expected in the capital and financial
 accounts from 2010 onwards when the capital account deficit is expected to narrow to 18
 percent of GDP. It should be balanced in 2011.
                                                     14


31.        Latvia's balance of payments needs would be financeable under the
baseline assumptions (Table 4). The projected financing requirements of a total of Euro
15.2 billion over 2009-QI 2011 would be covered by the projected current account
surpluses, a partial rollover of amortizing debt, some inflows of FDI and official
financing. The rollover rates assumed under the baseline scenario are relatively
conservative at 0 percent for Government and state banks throughout 2009 and 2010, 90
percent in 2010 for foreign affiliated banks, 30 percent in 2009 and 50 percent in 2010
for other domestic banks. The baseline also allows a cushion for possible repatriation of
35 percent of deposits through end-2010.

32.          Public and external debts are projected to increase sharply. Public debt is
projected to rise to 44 percent of GDP in 2009 and peak at just below 90 percent of GDP
in 2013 before declining slightly (Table 5). External debt is projected to peak at 175
percent of GDP in 2011, entering only then a gradual decline and reaching 164 percent of
GDP by 2013. Even with sharper fiscal consolidation assumptions, public debt would
only enter a gradual decline at the beginning of the next decade.3 The EU has affirmed
that it will continue to work closely with the Latvian authorities and the Fund to ensure
Latvia implements successfully its economic reform program and its timely repayment of
all loans associated with the international program to support Latvia.




3
  Table 5 and Figure 1 are based on what Fund staff consider the more likely scenario--one that involves a
more gradual fiscal consolidation. However, the authorities have announced they intend to pursue a
sharper fiscal consolidation. Specifically, their path towards the Maastricht criterion involves sharp fiscal
consolidation in 2010 and 2011 with the intent of meeting the 3 percent target (ESA terms) by 2012--as
opposed to the 7.5 percent fiscal deficit envisioned in a more gradual fiscal consolidation as the one in this
report. The authorities' proposed fiscal consolidation path could put additional pressure on output but, if a
faster-than-expected recovery were to materialize and the fiscal adjusts more rapidly, then lower level of
debt--close to the debt Maastricht criterion--could be achievable by 2012.

33.         Stress tests highlight the high degree of sensitivity of the debt
sustainability. More rapid and sustained deflation than envisaged under the program
would lead to substantially higher government debt ratios. Likewise, slower deficit
reduction (for example, due to reform fatigue) would also result in government debt
ratios approaching 100 percent of GDP. Overall, the sustainability of the public debt is
most dependent on the size of the primary deficit, and the sustainability of the external
debt would be most affected by a devaluation (see Figure 1). Public debt scenarios are
relatively less sensitive to a devaluation shock, as well as to shocks originating in lower
growth, higher interest rates, or a contingent liability shock. The external debt is less
sensitive to shocks originating in lower growth, higher interest rates, or a non interest rate
current account shock.

34.          In the financial sector, after funding a credit boom from 2004-2007,
foreign-owned banks are now retrenching and deposit outflows continue. In the first
quarter of 2009, foreign banks repaid 0.8 billion, equivalent to just below 10 percent of
their liabilities to the parent institutions, reversing a trend of increased exposure until
2008. Nonresident deposit outflows have continued, albeit at a slower pace than at the
end of 2008. Residents have also begun to accumulate assets abroad.

35.         In addition to tight liquidity, banks are facing a sharp increase in non-
performing loans ( PLs) as a result of the economic recession. NPLs overdue by
more than 30 days have increased from 2 percent of total loans at end-2007 to 15.5
percent at end-May 2009. Loans overdue by more than 90 days increased from 3.6
percent at end-2008, to 10.7 percent at end-May 2009.4 The increase in NPLs is seen
across the board, reaching 15 percent for mortgages, 29 percent for real estate developers,
and 12 percent for corporate loans. A large proportion of household mortgages have
negative equity.5 So far, the need to provision for bad loans has caused system-wide
losses at an annualized rate exceeding 2 percent of GDP. Further deterioration can be
expected.

36.        As a result, lending standards and margins have tightened, so that
overall, credit has fallen by 3 percent since December 2008.

37.        The stress tests conducted by the BoL and the FCMC indicate that
increased capital buffers and robust liquidity contingency plans are needed. As of
January 2009, the total buffer for credit losses stood at 4 percent of the loan portfolio.
However, due to the rapid increase in provisioning, increased capital buffers are needed
for foreign and domestic banks alike. Under the proposed program, the FCMC has
required all banks to prepare solid capital increase plans to address potential
shortcomings as identified by the stress tests. The need for additional capital may lead to
some consolidation in the banking sector.

38.        While the immediate deteriorating conditions in Parex Bank have been
controlled, uncertainties remain regarding its future. Deposit outflows have slowed,
albeit under continuing deposit withdrawal restrictions, improving the bank's liquidity
position. In May 2009, the Privatization Agency made an investment of about LVL 141
million, on behalf of the state, into Parex Bank's capital, and issued a subordinated loan
in the amount of LVL 50 million, bringing Parex Bank CAR to about 11 percent. In
addition, the Cabinet of Ministers approved the bank's restructuring plan. However,
uncertainties remain regarding the banks' future, including: (a) the continuation of limits
on deposit withdrawals -- the authorities have committed to remove the partial freeze as
conditions stabilize; (b) EBRD's involvement as a shareholder -- the EBRD and the
Government have signed an agreement on the purchase of Parex Bank's shares; the
transaction is expected to be concluded in August 2009; (c) the need to develop a plan
that would ultimately allow the re-privatization of the bank; and (d) the European

4
 PDLs at 1 day overdue increased from 15 percent at end-2008 to 22.9 percent at end-May 2009.

 Note that banks in Latvia retain full recourse on their claims, which provides a strong incentive for
mortgage holders to continue serving their loans.

Commission has begun a standard procedure of investigation into the state aid provided
to Parex Bank, in line with EU competition rules.

39.         The overall outlook is subject to exceptional risks and uncertainties.
Achieving a real exchange rate depreciation without a nominal exchange rate
depreciation will depend critically on undertaking strong domestic adjustment involving
sustained wage and fiscal discipline. The success of the program also hinges on the
stabilization of the financial sector, which the Government is addressing through a strong
contingency plan to deal with potential liquidity or solvency problems. A new
Government was formed in March, after budget discussions led to the resignation of the
Prime Minister in February. The announcement of unpopular measures such as a 20
percent salary cut for teachers brought thousands of protestors in the streets of Riga in
early April. And in June, following the newly approved budget amendments that entailed
further spending cuts, the Health Minister resigned on the basis that the new cuts would
undermine the effectiveness of the health care system. The depth of social and other
spending cuts may lead to further social instability, although the Government is putting in
place a number of mitigating measures in coordination with the IMF and World Bank
teams.


             III.    THE GOVER ME T'S REFORM PROGRAM

                           A. THE OVERALL REFORM PROGRAM

40.         The main objectives of the authorities' recovery program of end 2008 and
of 2009 are to: (i) stem immediate liquidity pressures; (ii) restore long-term stability
by strengthening the financial sector, correcting fiscal imbalances and adopting domestic
policies aimed at improving competitiveness while maintaining the fixed exchange rate;
and (iii) strengthen the long-term structural performance of the economy. In the
financial sector, the immediate objective of the program is to stabilize the sector and
restore depositor confidence.

41.        With the severe economic contraction, the Government had to propose
stronger fiscal adjustment measures in June 2009 than originally planned. Under
the updated program, the budget deficit is to be reduced to 3 percent of GDP in 2012 and
the Government is to take all necessary measures to meet the Maastricht criteria to join
the Euro zone in 2014.

42.        As mentioned above, the authorities' recovery program is centered on
maintaining Latvia's quasi-currency board at the current exchange rate parity. The
exchange rate peg has been considered an anchor of macroeconomic stability for more
than 15 years. It withstood the 1998 Russian crisis. When the recovery program was
established, the merits of an alternative exchange rate regime were reviewed. The
Government decided that, while an exchange rate adjustment might lead to a quicker
correction of the real exchange rate, the associated risks and costs would outweigh any
potential benefits: (i) undermining program ownership, (ii) balance sheet effects since a
very high percentage of deposits and loans are denominated in foreign currency, (iii) an
                                             20

insignificant reduction in external financing needs as external debt to GDP would
increase sharply, and (iv) likely adverse repercussions on financial stability and spill over
risks in the Baltic countries and South-Eastern Europe.

43.         The GDP contraction is turning out to be much sharper than anticipated.
The authorities expect output to drop by 18 percent in 2009 and a further 4 percent in
2010. Inflation is expected to fall sharply, to about 3 percent in 2009 with deflation in
the following two years. The current account is projected to show a surplus of 4.5
percent of GDP in 2009. By contrast, the capital and financial account is expected to
deteriorate to a deficit of 24.8 percent of GDP.

                              B. FI   A CIAL SECTOR REFORM

44.         Following the takeover of Parex Bank, the Government has taken
significant measures to ensure stability in the financial sector, including: (i) restoring
immediate stability by resolving the troubled Parex Bank and recapitalizing the state-
owned Mortgage and Land Bank, (ii) conducting a due diligence of the banking system,
enhancing the monitoring of banks' liquidity and capital, and improving the framework
for bank resolution, (iii) establishing a debt restructuring framework, and (iv) stepping up
financial sector supervision and regulation.

Restoring Stability at Parex Bank

45.        Given its systemic nature, the authorities have addressed the immediate
deteriorating conditions in Parex Bank through public intervention and the planned
entry of EBRD as a minority shareholder:

  ·    When a run on Parex Bank started in November 2008, the BoL and the MoF
       provided lender of last resort liquidity to the bank and the FCMC imposed deposit
       withdrawal limits on Parex Bank depositors in Latvia and at its branches abroad.
       Individuals and enterprises with up to 10 employees have been prohibited from
       withdrawing more than LVL 35,000 (US$65,000) a month, enterprises with 250
       employees have a higher limit of LVL 350,000 a month, and no limits exist on
       larger enterprises. Withdrawals are also prohibited for corporate clients if they
       are not for immediate operational activities. The authorities have committed to
       remove the partial freeze as conditions stabilize.

  ·    As these measures were insufficient to stop the run, emergency legislation was
       submitted to the Parliament permitting government intervention and full bank
       takeover. The Law on Bank Takeovers was adopted in December 2008.

  ·    On December 5th, the Government took over 85 percent of the shares from Parex
       Bank strategic investors at a nominal price, diluting the minority to about 15
       percent. It appointed new professional management to run the bank. The new
       management has made progress in stabilizing the bank and preparing for its
       eventual resolution. Deposit outflows have slowed, albeit helped by continuing
       restrictions.
                                           21



 ·     A due diligence analysis, focused on the bank's asset quality, liquidity and
       solvency, was conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers in early 2009, on the basis
       of which additional provisions were booked in the bank's 2008 financial
       statements.

 ·     The new management of Parex Bank, assisted by independent advisors, developed
       a resolution plan, consistent with minimizing losses to the state and depositors,
       considering various options. The plan was submitted to the FCMC in early 2009.

 ·     Dealing with Parex Bank's outstanding syndicated loans presented a key
       challenge, but negotiations with syndicated lenders were finalized in March 2009.
       Both loans (775 million) had been in technical default since November 2008.
       The agreement with the syndicated lenders sets out a repayment schedule of 30%
       in March 2009, 40% in February 2010, and 30% in May 2011.

 ·     On March 24, 2009, the Government decided to increase Parex Bank's capital by
       LVL 227 million. Following the EC's approval, in May, the Privatization
       Agency made an investment in Parex Bank's capital of about LVL 140.7 million
       and issued a subordinated loan in the amount of LVL 50 million, ensuring a CAR
       of about 11 percent.

 ·     The Government and EBRD signed an agreement on April 16, 2009 on EBRD's
       purchase of 25 percent plus 1 ordinary shares of Parex Bank for LVL 59.5 million
       (84.2 million) and a subordinated loan of 22 million. The subordinated loan
       has been extended in July 2009 and the equity transaction is expected to be
       completed in August 2009.

 ·     In the short term, the main remaining challenge is to progressively lift the deposit
       withdrawal limits in order to enable the bank to start operating normally again. In
       the longer term, the challenge will be to re-privatize the bank.

Crisis resolution

46.         The authorities have made substantial progress in managing the effects of
the crisis on the banking system by taking the following measures:

 ·     Adopting operational guidelines for the provision of emergency liquidity
       assistance (ELA) by clarifying procedures for inter-agency coordination, cross-
       border arrangements, and the treatment of collateral.

 ·     Reviewing regulations on emergency liquidity support so that they are consistent
       with international practice and provide for adequate safeguards.

 ·     Recapitalizing the state-owned Mortgage and Land Bank in January. The
       Government has further agreed to refocus the bank on core activities crucial for
                                            22

       the economy (i.e. financing SMEs, business start-ups, infrastructure, and other
       national development projects) and to minimize commercial banking operations.

 ·     Requesting an independent auditor to carry out a focused examination of the
       banking system and assess whether all banks are solvent and have sufficient
       liquidity. The audits were conducted by independent auditor companies in March
       2009 and found that the banks were well-capitalized under the current level of
       NPLs.

 ·     Enhancing monitoring of individual banks and improving supervisory
       coordination with the BoL and home supervisors of foreign banks. The FCMC
       introduced quarterly information on "problem" loans from Q3 2008, and daily
       liquidity reports. It has also increased the frequency of prudential reporting, and
       has had regular meetings with bank top management. FCMC has discussed, with
       external auditors, special audit and annual audit results for all banks and has
       requested external audits of interim financial statements for the first half of 2009.
       From March 2009, FCMC has required banks to submit internal audit results
       regularly and key domestic banks to submit weekly cash flow projections.

47.         The authorities have also amended the legal framework for bank
resolution to allow effective intervention in potentially troubled banks and restore
confidence in the system. The Law on Bank Takeovers was adopted in December 2008.
It sets the legal framework for bank takeovers by the state. The Amendments to the
Deposit Guarantee Law of October 2008, February 2009 and June 2009 increase the
amount of guaranteed compensation to one depositor up to EUR 50,000 and provide a
clearer and faster compensation procedure. Amendments to the Credit Institutions Law
and the Financial and Capital Market Commission Law were adopted in February 2009,
which provided the FCMC with extensive and flexible powers to deal with troubled
banks. The amendments provided the FCMC with the right to appoint an official
administrator to take over the management of a credit institution and to undertake
Purchase and Assumptions transactions on failed banks. A few weaknesses remain in the
law that are being addressed through further amendments.

48.       The authorities have made substantial progress in establishing a debt
restructuring framework:

 ·     Amendments to the Insolvency Law to encourage out-of-court restructurings
       and improve the insolvency framework were approved by Parliament in June
       2009 and became effective on July 1, 2009. These amendments allow for out-of-
       court debt renegotiations through a new out-of-court Legal Protection
       Proceedings (LPP) option. The amendments also streamlined the insolvency
       regime. Further amendments to the Insolvency Law are under preparation to
       further improve these processes. Several workshops were organized to raise
       awareness on these new frameworks amongst practitioners.
                                            23


 ·     Amendments to the Civil Procedure Code to improve the mortgage
       foreclosure process and help the rehabilitation of household debtors have
       been prepared by the MoJ. The process for foreclosing on a mortgaged
       property in Latvia is expensive and time-consuming. The auctions process is very
       lengthy, including 3 separate auctions that are 3 months apart. Foreclosure
       procedures were streamlined in March 2009. Additional amendments have been
       prepared shortening the auction notice period and reducing the number of
       auctions.

49.         The Government has prepared, but put on hold, a state guarantee
program for restructured loans. As small borrowers are afraid to engage in loan
renegotiations with their banks, the Government has designed a guarantee program to
relieve borrowers' debt service to a level commensurate with their payment capacity.
However, taking into account the limited fiscal resources of the Government as well as
other high social priorities in the country the program will be launched only if it is
possible to allocate financial resources for its implementation.

50.        The authorities have also taken measures to improve the supervision and
regulation of the financial system. The FCMC has revised regulations on assets
valuation and provisioning (effective as of April 2009), has stepped up supervisory
guidance on banks internal capital adequacy assessment process and calculation of
additional capital buffers above the minimum regulatory requirements (also effective
from April 2009), is updating regulations on liquidity risk management to incorporate
Basel guidelines and the recommendations of the Committee of European Banking
Supervisors (CEBS), and is in the process of revising regulations on credit risk
management.

                                    C. CO   SULTATIO S

51.        An extensive consensus building process has taken place on the program,
culminating with the formal signing of the revised Letter of Intent to the IMF by all
coalition parties. The underlying consultations have focused heavily on the fiscal, social
and wage aspects of the Government's program. Following a social summit with the
Prime Minister on June 8, 2009, the "social partners" (namely, the Latvian Employers
Confederation, the Latvian Association of Free Trade Unions, the Latvian Association of
Local and Regional Governments, and the Latvian Chamber of Commerce and Industry)
endorsed the revised fiscal strategy for 2009. The same social partners were
subsequently invited to join the Reform Management Group established to advise the
Government on drafting the 2010 national budget and the budget perspectives for 2010-
12. In a separate development, the National Tripartite Co-operation Council (between
Government, employers, and trade unions) has established a Committee to Promote
Wage Restraint with a mandate to (i) monitor the implementation of measures to reduce
and streamline nominal wages (and bonuses) in the public and private sectors, and (ii)
issue recommendations to ensure that the deterioration in competitiveness is corrected
and that compensation evolves in the future in line with the constraints imposed by the
fixed exchange rate. Following a discussion with the full National Tripartite Co-
                                            24

operation Council, the committee's initial recommendations have been recently presented
to the Prime Minister and Parliament.



       IV.    BA K SUPPORT TO THE GOVER ME T'S PROGRAM

                   A. LI   K TO THE COU TRY PART ERSHIP STRATEGY

52.         Latvia joined the Bank in 1992. As a member, it received analytical and
advisory support and loans totaling US$416 million for 19 operations that have supported
Government's actions to implement structural reforms, improve public finance
management, modernize the welfare system and the health, education, and infrastructure
sectors, and reduce pollution in the Baltic Sea.

53.         Latvia graduated from World Bank financing in 2007 and became a
donor to the International Development Agency (IDA) of the World Bank Group
during the 15th replenishment of IDA. The last Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for
2002-2005 was launched during the period when Latvia's overriding objective was to
prepare for accession to the European Union -- a goal which was achieved in 2004. The
Government of Latvia requested the Bank to support priorities, which were not covered
by the EU's acquis communautaire. As a result, the CAS focused on assisting Latvia's
efforts to improve productivity growth, public sector reform, development outside the
capital, and social sector reform. The six lending projects under this CAS closed with
satisfactory outcomes.

54.         Following graduation from the World Bank, Latvia made full use of the
limited free technical assistance available to graduates, which expired at the end of
fiscal year 2009. The Bank provided technical assistance to the Government of Latvia to
help promote development in lagging rural regions, manage public finances strategically
through medium-term budgeting, and develop a public-private partnership framework.
At the request of the Ministry of Finance, a Public Expenditure Review was conducted
jointly with the IMF in 2007. The recommendations from this review are informing the
social sector reforms being undertaken by the Government today.

55.        Latvia also entered into a technical cooperation agreement with the Bank,
on a fee-for-service basis, in the area of climate change. Under this agreement, the
Bank supported the Ministry of Environment's efforts to implement a pilot greening
program financed by revenues from international emissions trading.

56.         The global financial crisis led to an exceptional request by the
Government of Latvia for renewed access to World Bank resources. The proposed
operation is consistent with the Bank's Articles of Agreement. Pursuant to Article III,
Section 4 (ii), the Bank may make loans if "[it] is satisfied that in the prevailing market
conditions the borrower would be unable otherwise to obtain the loan under conditions
which in the opinion of the Bank are reasonable for the borrower." In this case, the Bank
is satisfied that, in the prevailing market conditions, Latvia would have been unable to
                                              25

otherwise borrow under reasonable terms, as confirmed by the very high CDS rates for
Latvia since the beginning of the crisis (although Latvia's CDS went down in recent
months, it remains well above those in neighboring countries and well above its level
before the crisis ­ Figure 2). The crisis has exposed underlying macro-vulnerabilities,
and the deep economic contraction that followed left Latvia with significant borrowing
needs and constrained access to external financing on reasonable terms. In response to
international efforts to stabilize Latvia's economy, the Bank is proposing two
development policy loans totaling 400 million in close coordination with the IMF and
the EU. The DPLs are a part of the 7.5 billion package, which also includes
contributions from the IMF, EU the Nordic countries, the Czech Republic, Poland and
Estonia.

57.         The proposed two DPL operations underpin reform programs in the
financial and social sectors. Building on the Bank's comparative advantage in financial
crisis resolution and in financial and social sector structural reforms, the proposed
financial sector DPL aims to build Latvia's capacity to (i) address financial sector
challenges that arise in the context of the global crisis; (ii) accelerate mortgage- and
corporate debt-restructuring; and (iii) strengthen the regulation and supervision of the
financial sector. The social safety net DPL, which would be presented to the Board at the
end of 2009, will support measures to (i) mitigate short social costs of fiscal
consolidation; (ii) ensure fiscal consolidation creates an opportunity for reform that will
improve long-term performance and outcomes in the social sectors and public
administration; and (iii) protect vulnerable groups during the deep economic recession
with emergency safety net support. The financial sector operation was prepared first in
order to respond to the need for crisis containment in the financial sector. The social
safety net operation and related technical assistance are timed to influence the provisions
                                                26

for social safety net measures in the 2010 budget, due to be presented to the Latvian
Parliament in late 2009.

58.         During the 27-month stabilization program, continued policy dialogue is
envisaged between the Bank and the Latvian authorities combined with technical
assistance to support the implementation of ongoing structural reforms, particularly in
the social sectors and public administration where there is continued interest in capacity-
building.

                  B. COLLABORATIO          WITH THE IMF A D OTHER DO ORS

59.         The Bank program supports and complements the international rescue
package of the IMF, EC, EBRD, ordic countries, and other lenders. The rescue
package amounts to 7.5 billion, of which the Bank would provide 400 million. The
proposed operation would provide 200 million of this amount.6 The proposed Loan is a
development policy loan with customized terms offered by the Bank in response to the
exceptional tightening of financial market conditions resulting from the global financial
crisis and economic recession. The IMF operation was approved on December 23, 2008
and the EC operation on January 20, 2009. The Bank team has collaborated very closely
with the Fund team and discussed complementarities and mutually supportive measures.
Table 6 lays out the measures supported by the WB and the IMF, and shows their
complementarities. The EC has also coordinated its program in the financial sector with
those of the Bank and the Fund.

60.         The Bank's assistance is part of a joint International Financial
Institutions (IFI) initiative, where the EBRD, the European Investment Bank (EIB),
and the World Bank Group have pledged to support banking sectors in Central and
Eastern Europe with up to 24.5 billion over a two year period. The World Bank
Group committed to investing 7.5 billion (2 billion by the IFC in the banking and
infrastructure sector and advisory services; 3.5 billion by IBRD to address banking
sector issues, and 2 billion by MIGA). Thus far, the World Bank Group has approved
688 million, of which 500 million by MIGA for political risk insurance, and 188
million by IBRD for financial sector support. The IFC is focusing on equity and trade
finance, for which demand is expected to pick up later in the year.

61.         The operation includes crisis resolution measures and structural reforms
aimed at strengthening the Government's ability to mitigate ongoing and future
risks in the banking sector. The operation goes beyond immediate support for
stabilizing the banking system and includes structural forward-looking supervisory and
regulatory measures aimed at ensuring long term financial stability (see Annex 3).

62.         This loan is not directly related to any recent Bank operation, but earlier
operations supported development of Latvia's financial sector. The Enterprise and Financial
Sector Restructuring Investment Project (approved in 1994) aimed at supporting the
Government's reforms in the enterprise and financial sector, focusing on enterprise
privatization & bank restructuring; the Financial Sector Technical Assistance Project
(approved in 2001) provided technical assistance for the development of the financial sector;
and the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) Follow-up TA (approved in 2003)
aimed at developing the capital market.

63.         There has also been considerable analytic work on the financial system,
including an FSAP in 2001 that assessed the financial sector's strengths, weaknesses, and
vulnerabilities to macroeconomic shocks, the observance of international standards and codes
on the regulation and supervision of banking, payment systems, insurance, and securities. The
FSAP was updated in 2007, assessing financial sector developments and progress since the
2001 FSAP, regulatory and supervisory responses to rapid credit growth, arrangements for
home-host supervisory coordination and crisis management, contingency planning, as well as
insolvency and creditor rights.

64.         The FSAP update of 2007 provided a strong analytical underpinning for this
operation and the authorities' crisis response preparedness. The FSAP Update of 2007
assessed the overall financial system stability and vulnerabilities, worked with the authorities
to improve stress-testing, reviewed contingency planning, assessed home-host supervisory
coordination, the insolvency system, and evaluated the supervisory procedures for validation of
banks' internal rating-based models. The report also focused on emerging issues including
those related to the fast pace of credit growth. The main issues in the financial sector identified
in the FSAP update remain relevant for this operation: improving the contingency framework,
strengthening the legal framework for insolvency proceedings, creating a favorable
environment for out-of-court restructurings, enhancing the stress-testing framework, improving
bank supervision to mitigate systemic risks, and increasing home-host coordination.

Lessons from previous Bank involvement in Latvia

65.        The Bank has played an important role in supporting Latvia's transition
through lending, policy dialogue, and analytical and advisory assistance since 1992. The
Bank's partnership with Latvia has advanced structural reforms in a number of areas, including
in public administration, the social and health sectors, privatization, and the regulatory systems
for the banking sector and utilities. Many of these reforms were carried out under the
Programmatic Structural Adjustment Loan and helped the country deal with the aftermath of
the Russian financial crisis of 1998.

66.         The capacity to design and implement coherent policies, programs and
projects has been a central factor in the success or failure of previous operations. The
Bank and the EU, during the pre-accession program, have contributed to substantially
enhancing administrative capacity in various areas targeted by the reforms. However, in
general, the capacity of the public sector to prioritize, plan and implement policies in an
effective and efficient manner remains limited. Therefore, technical assistance may be needed
for both design and implementation of complex structural reforms.

67.         Government ownership of the reforms has also been crucial for the successful
implementation of reforms. The proposed reforms need to support the Government's agenda
and priorities and an extensive dialogue with the Government is necessary to ensure acceptance
and ownership of the reforms. In addition, strong leadership from the center of the
Government, i.e. the Cabinet of the Prime Minister, has been important, especially for
politically sensitive reforms. In addition, the operation should support the understanding of,
and the appropriate popular support for the reforms through a carefully planned and
implemented communication strategy by the Government.

68.         Flexibility has been also an important factor in the success of the previous
operations. The policy reform agenda needs to be realistic in terms of content and timing,
avoiding overambitious goals to be accomplished in a short time. Risks, including political
risks, need to be carefully weighed in the preparation of the operation.

Lessons from previous macro-financial crises

69.        Lessons from previous macro-financial crises have been incorporated in the
loan design. IEG recently conducted a comprehensive review into its responses to earlier
financial crises.7 Notably, the largest Bank crisis-response programs for South Korea,
Argentina, Turkey, Thailand, Indonesia and Russia have been reviewed and critically assessed.
Based on the report and other IEG assessments and discussions in a rapidly changing global
context, IEG suggests considering the following points in helping countries to deal with the
crisis:

    ·      The main generic lesson from the Bank's responses to previous crises relates to the
           importance of an early response. The fiscal cost of interventions can be quite large,
           but the cost of inaction can be even larger. The proposed Bank operation comes at a
           time when the Latvian banking system is undercapitalized but still has enough capital
           and potential for new capital increases as to sustain operations in the short-term. The
           value of preparedness is also taken into account in the design, including through the
           preparation of an ex ante contingency plan for the banking sector.

    ·      The speed and focus of the Bank's response are both crucial for good outcomes
           during and after crises. Past crisis support was much more successful when it was
           nested in a results framework (explicit or implicit) that incorporated selective coverage,
           and focused on the Bank's comparative strengths. The proposed operation incorporates


7
    "Lessons from Past Financial Crisis", Independent Evaluation Group, The World Bank, 2009.
                                               31

       this lesson by focusing on policy actions that address directly the immediate needs of
       stabilizing the financial sector.

 ·     The quality of the intervention is crucial. The content of the reform program is
       essential. By supporting a comprehensive reform of the financial sector, including
       short term crisis management and long term structural reforms, the proposed operation
       addresses all key vulnerabilities.

 ·     Coordination among key partners, particularly with the IMF, is critical, as
       differences of views surface quickly during crises and are potentially damaging to
       achieve better results. Collaboration across the World Bank also strengthens program
       effectiveness. The proposed DPL incorporates fully this lesson; the Bank operation has
       been designed with the IMF and other key donors active in the sector, and the team
       includes experts from various departments across the Bank.

 ·     The adequacy of resources is essential, including through efforts to leverage with
       partners. This loan is part of a large coordinated international rescue package
       representing about 35 percent of GDP and leveraging resources from various IFIs and
       bilateral donors.

 ·     During past financial crises, poverty issues did not get sufficient attention. It is
       crucial to factor in the implications for social safety nets from the beginning of the
       crisis, rather than later. In addition, previous crises have shown the importance of
       focusing on public expenditure issues or integrating social safety net programs from the
       early stages of any effort. This is being done through the complementary IMF program
       and the Social Safety Net and Public Administration Reform Development Policy
       Loan.


                          V.    THE PROPOSED OPERATIO
                                 A. OBJECTIVE A     D RATIO ALE

70.         The objective of the proposed operation is to support the Government's
reforms in the financial sector to build a sound financial system able to absorb the effects
of the crisis and the contraction of economic activity and to resist potential future shocks.
The operation will restore and contribute to maintaining financial stability. This will help
minimize the impact of the financial crisis and contribute to economic recovery and growth. It
falls within the objectives of the Joint IFI Initiative to support banking sectors in Central and
Eastern Europe affected by the crisis.

71.        The proposed operation will contribute to the international financial support
package, led by the IMF and the EC. The direct financial contribution of the operation is
modest: 200 million in an overall package of 7.5 billion. However, the overall contribution
of the operation is significant as it strongly complements and reinforces the IMF measures (see
Table 6). The operation supports measures designed to assist the authorities in managing the
                                               32

current crisis and stabilizing the banking system, and in putting in place adequate frameworks
to ensure a sound financial system in the future.

72.         The severe negative impact of the crisis on Latvia's banking sector and real
economy provides a strong rationale for the operation. Latvia is one of the countries most
affected by the financial crisis in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). While Latvia graduated
from IBRD in April 2007, the Government continued an ongoing program of analytical and
technical assistance work with the Bank, and requested Bank support when the crisis curtailed
the country's access to external finance. The operation is consistent with the Bank's mandate
in its Articles of Agreement to provide funding to members when they are not able to access
funding in the market under reasonable terms. By supporting the restoration of financial
stability in Latvia, the operation contributes to reducing the risk of contagion effects to other
CEE countries and the risk of further severe economic and social costs in Latvia. In addition,
the experience gained by Bank staff in dealing with the crisis in Latvia can be usefully applied
to other countries in the region.

                        B. OPERATIO DESCRIPTIO         A D POLICY AREAS

73.         The proposed operation supports the Government's reforms in the financial
sector designed to address immediate problems in the banking sector and ensure longer
term financial stability. Building upon and complementing the measures agreed with the
IMF and the EC, the operation proposes crisis resolution and structural reforms in the financial
sector aimed at: (i) identifying vulnerabilities in the banking sector and request additional
capital and liquidity contingency plans as and where appropriate, (ii) strengthening the capacity
of the authorities to address potential problems that may arise in the financial sector in the
context of the current financial crisis, (iii) accelerating mortgage and corporate debt
restructuring in light of rapidly increasing defaults, (iv) strengthening the regulation and
supervision of the financial system, and (v) strengthening consumer protection in the financial
sector. The prior actions supported by this operation are described in detail below and are
summarized in the Policy Actions matrix in Annex 2.

Crisis Resolution

Capital Adequacy Strengthening

74.       To strengthen the health of the banking sector, the authorities have taken the
following measures:

 ·     The BoL completed stress tests of the banking sector to assess its resilience to a
       potential worst case scenario (Prior Action 1). The BoL, with inputs from the FCMC
       on provision rates for Past Due Loans (PDLs), conducts stress tests of the banking
       sector on a quarterly basis. In view of the current deteriorating conditions in the
       economy and the banking sector, the BoL and the FCMC agreed with the Bank to
       conduct joint stress tests with March 2009 banking sector data using a baseline scenario
       and two severe macro and financial sector scenarios, acceptable to the Bank and the
       IMF. The results of the stress tests have highlighted the impact of such potential severe
       stress events on the banks' capital adequacy and liquidity ratios and have provided the
                                               33

       authorities with a better understanding of where potential problems could arise in the
       banking sector.

 ·     The FCMC required, on the basis of the stress tests, banks in need of enhanced
       capital buffers to prepare a capital strengthening plan by end July. As a result, four
       banks have completed capital increases, and another four are in the process of
       increasing capital. In addition, banks that could face liquidity problems have to present
       the FCMC with robust liquidity contingency plans.

 ·     The Borrower prepared, on the basis of the stress tests, a Strategic Contingency Plan
       for the banking sector (Prior Action 2). If the situation in the Latvian banking sector
       continues to deteriorate, it is critical that the authorities are prepared to intervene in a
       timely manner to maintain stability. The Strategic Contingency Plan includes a
       typology of potential actions and interventions by the FCMC in response to potential
       liquidity or solvency problems in the banking sector, a strategy for the resolution of
       potentially illiquid or insolvent banks according to their systemic importance and other
       relevant parameters; and clear responsibilities for the implementation of, and the
       communication about such strategy. The plan also addresses the case of a systemic
       crisis.

Bank Resolution Framework

75.         The Borrower's Parliament has approved amendments to the Credit
Institution Law with a view to strengthen the legal framework for bank resolution to
enable swift bank resolution if necessary (Prior Action 3). On the basis of an assessment of
the alignment of the Credit Institution Law with international best practices for bank
resolution, inter alia as per the IMF-World Bank Global Insolvency Initiative principles, the
legal framework for bank resolution has been significantly strengthened. This was done in
February 2009 when the Borrower's Parliament approved amendments to the Credit Institution
Law, which enables the authorities to implement a wide variety of strategies to solve potential
problems in the banking sector. A few weaknesses, which remain in the Law, are being
addressed through further amendments.

Distressed Asset Management

76.         In view of the deteriorating credit quality, the authorities have strengthened
the debt restructuring framework. It is critical that proper mortgage and corporate debt
restructurings begin as quickly as possible, inter alia, to strengthen the banks' balance sheets,
reduce uncertainty for debtors, allow economic and financial activity to resume, and avoid
residential foreclosure wherever possible. The authorities have undertaken measures to: (i)
enhance the corporate rehabilitation and insolvency legal framework, (ii) improve the
mortgage foreclosure process, and (iii) prepare guidelines for corporate and mortgage debt
restructurings as well as hold debt restructuring seminars to raise awareness amongst all parties
of proper elements of debt restructurings.
                                                34


     ·      The Borrower has enhanced the corporate rehabilitation and insolvency legal
            framework (Prior Action 4). The insolvency framework was amended in July 2009
            when the Borrower's Parliament approved amendments to introduce an expedited
            corporate restructuring proceeding (the LPP). The Borrower's parliament has
            approved amendments to the Insolvency Law with a view to: (i) removing potential
            obstacles to out-of-court proceedings for corporate restructuring; (ii) allowing pre-
            packaged restructuring agreements; and (iii) introducing further flexibility and
            easier access to insolvency proceedings. A series of subsequent amendments are
            under preparation to: (i) introducing further flexibility to the LPP plan and
            eliminating the settlement and recovery procedures; (ii) make access to insolvency
            proceedings easier; (iii) achieve efficiency in the liquidation of assets in bankruptcy
            cases; (iv) increase the insolvency administrators' efficiency; (v) streamline the
            liquidation procedure; and (vi) solve other issues such as the taxation treatment of
            debt forgiveness, voting rights of secured creditors, and the liability of directors and
            officers where insolvency proceedings are not timely petitioned.
     ·      The Borrower's Parliament has approved amendments to the Civil Procedures
            Law to simplify the mortgage foreclosure process (Prior Action 5). The
            foreclosure process ­ to be used as last resort solution only ­ has been simplified.
            Further measures will include: (i) a reduction in the number of auctions from 3 to 2,
            (ii) a shortening of the auctions notice period, and (iii) the ability to use a bank
            guarantee when bidding for a property rather than have necessary cash.
     ·      The Borrower has implemented a debt restructuring program (Prior Action 6)
            entailing the publication of guidelines for corporate and mortgage debt
            restructuring, addressing, inter alia, rules of engagement for all parties, elements of
            proper restructuring, and debt restructuring options. The authorities have
            committed to organize a debt restructuring seminar in early November 2009 to raise
            awareness of proper restructurings and of the new legal framework amongst all
            parties.

Structural Reforms

The Supervisory and Regulatory Framework

77.        In addition to crisis resolution measures, the Borrower has implemented
structural reforms to strengthen the supervision and regulation of the financial system:

 ·       The BoL has adopted an improved stress testing framework based on multiple
         scenarios and a revised credit risks module, to be operated on a regular basis (Prior
         Action 7). The authorities have enhanced the stress testing framework to identify bank-
         level and system-level vulnerabilities under various macro-economic scenarios. In
         addition, the credit risk module has been revised to be aligned with the revised asset
         quality regulation of the FCMC.
                                              35


 ·     The FCMC has adopted a prompt remedial action framework (PRAF) that sets a
       matrix of triggers and a range of discretionary and non-discretionary supervisory
       actions (Prior Action 8). The FCMC has prepared a PRAF that establishes an
       appropriate range of supervisory actions for use when a bank has not complied with
       laws, regulations, or supervisory decisions. The PRAF provides clear prudential
       objectives and actions to be taken when a bank breaches prudential requirements
       reflecting an adverse change in the financial position of the bank.

 ·     The FCMC has issued strengthened prudential regulations on asset quality and
       capital adequacy, and committed to issue strengthened regulations on liquidity risk
       and credit risk management (Prior Action 9). The FCMC has revised its guidelines on
       asset quality and capital adequacy. In addition, FCMC has prepared a draft liquidity
       risk management regulation, which is to be revised on the basis of CEBS
       recommendations and EC directives, and the FCMC has included the issuance of
       regulations on credit risk management in its action plan for 2009.

 ·     The Borrower has completed a comprehensive review of consumer protection laws,
       regulations, and institutional set-up for the financial sector, in line with international
       good practices (Prior Action 10). Rapidly expanding credit in recent years, combined
       with a lack of financial literacy, has resulted in significant consumer protection issues.
       A thorough review of these issues has been completed by the Borrower, through the
       Consumer Rights Protection Center, in collaboration with the Bank. A workshop was
       held with key stakeholders to discuss the main recommendations of the review relating
       to: (1) consumer disclosure, (2) business practices of financial institutions, (3) dispute
       resolution mechanisms, and (4) financial education.

78.       The proposed operation has               applied   good   practice    principles   for
conditionalities, as described in Annex 5.

                         C. EXPECTED OUTCOMES OF THE OPERATIO

79.        The main outcome of the operation will be to help restore financial stability
and improve the resilience and functioning of the financial sector. The measures proposed
by this operation will contribute to: (i) enhancing the banks' capacity to absorb the impact of
the ongoing economic recession by strengthening their capital buffers (this should enable
banks to adequately provision NPLs while maintaining an adequate CAR); (ii) increasing the
capacity of the authorities to monitor the banking sector and efficiently handle potentially
troubled banks; (iii) increasing confidence in the banking sector (this should help stabilize
deposits and non deposit external funding sources, and contribute to decreasing the credit
default swap rate for Latvia); (iv) improving the frameworks for corporate rehabilitations,
insolvencies, and mortgage foreclosures (this should lead to a higher number of successful
corporate rehabilitations and increased mortgage debt renegotiations); and (v) improving
consumer protection in the financial sector. Table 7 outlines the main objectives, outcomes,
and outcome indicators of the proposed operation.

80.         The design of the program has benefited from consultations with relevant
stakeholders (as required by OP 8.60). As mentioned above, the Government's overall
program has benefited from wide consultations culminating in the formal signing of the revised
Letter of Intent to the IMF by all coalition parties. The Government's financial sector reforms,
including those supported by this operation have also benefited from wide consultations. In
particular, the Latvian and foreign bankers associations, financial sector regulators and donors
engaged in the sector have been consulted at key junctures on the design of the program. In
addition, intensive discussions took place with the Latvian banking association on all key
aspects of the program, leading to their wide acceptance of the financial sector reform program
and their specific endorsement of the guidelines for corporate and debt restructuring.
Consultations were also held with the newly created Latvian Borrowers' Association. The
authorities have also met with banking sector representatives to discuss reform options and
priorities for the banks. Bank staff has also consulted with stakeholders, including banking
sector representatives, borrower's representatives, and representatives of the key foreign
investors in Latvia's financial sector. Open and consistent communication of the program's
objectives and structure remain important going forward.


                       VI.    OPERATIO IMPLEME TATIO

                                A. POVERTY A     D SOCIAL IMPACTS

Poverty and social impact of the proposed operation

81.         The measures supported by this operation are expected to have positive social
and poverty impacts. The deteriorating conditions in the economy and the banking sector are
likely to further strain businesses, increase unemployment, and increase poverty in the country.
However, this operation mitigates some of the negative effects of the crisis on poverty as it
aims to: (i) increase the capacity of the financial authorities to anticipate risks in the banking
sector and avoid a systemic crisis that could be very costly to depositors; (ii) enhance the
capacity of the financial authorities to deal with distressed banks and thus help preserve
taxpayers' money; (iii) encourage viable corporate rehabilitations that would otherwise be
pushed to bankruptcy, thereby contributing to preserving employment and the economic fabric;
(iv) help household debtors renegotiate their debts with the banks, avoiding foreclosures
wherever possible, and (v) facilitate a resumption in lending. In addition, the implementation
of the recommendations of the consumer protection review will improve the laws and
regulations to protect consumers of financial services as well as their means of complaints.

Poverty and social impact of the government program

82.       Simulations show that Latvia will experience a sharp rise in poverty, widening
of the poverty gap, and a rise in income inequality. Analysis of the distributional impact of
the economic crisis on households in Latvia was based on household survey data (Latvian EU-
SILC 2006 database) and focused on the impact of the growth slowdown through labor
                                                        38

markets.9 Assuming 18 percent contraction in GDP (affecting mainly trade, hotels and
restaurants, construction and manufacturing) and 11.2 percent contraction of employment
(concentrated in the same sectors) the percentage of people in poverty will increase from 14.4
to 20.2.10 The poverty gap, which measures the poverty deficit of the entire population, will
increase from 5.9 to 8.3 percent.11 Finally, income inequality will increase, with the Gini
coefficient increasing from 39.3 to 41.3 percent. It should be noted that these simulations do
not include the countervailing measures implemented by the Government to specifically
address the impact on poverty.

83.        There are substantial differences in how the impact of the crisis is felt across
regions and specific population groups. The largest increase in poverty is observed in the
poor region of Latgale where the majority of employed people are likely to have been working
in precarious, low wage jobs. The impact of the crisis is also felt more sharply in households
where a man is the primary income earner, which to a large extent is explained by the
contraction in the male-dominated construction sector. Households in which economically
active members have few skills (education levels of high school or less) suffer relatively more.
Finally, households with children also suffer a greater impact.

84.         The IMF and the Bank have worked with the Government to mitigate these
impacts. With regards to the likely impact of the fiscal consolidation measures included in the
Government's program, the IMF and the Bank teams have assisted the Government to focus
the cuts on reducing excesses and inefficiencies and to improve the quality of spending. In
addition, the increased emphasis and resources devoted to safety nets will mitigate some of
these impacts.

85.        The Bank's package of lending will include implementation of the
Government's cross sector Emergency Safety et Strategy, supported through a parallel
social safety net DPL (expected in December). As structural reforms are implemented, the
Government is also committed to alleviating the social costs of fiscal adjustment, and to
ensuring an adequate level of social service provision is maintained across the country.
Moreover, in the context of the current economic contraction and high levels of
unemployment, this commitment extends to strengthening the safety net to respond to the
immediate needs of vulnerable households. With technical input from the World Bank, the
Government has developed and will implement an Emergency Safety Net Strategy to finance
essential services and benefits delivered by national agencies, and locally by municipal
governments. The strategy aims to ensure that the Government is responding across the social
sectors in a coordinated way, and providing additional resources to municipal governments
who are at the "front line" of responding to increased household vulnerability in the wake of

9
  The impacts quantified are direct short-run impacts, and hence they do not take into account the general
equilibrium effects.
10
   A household is in poverty if its total household income is below LVL 90 per capita, or approximately US$ 6
per person per day. In Latvia, this line is known as the "needy" line.
11
   The poverty gap ratio is the sum of the income gap ratios for the population below the poverty line (z), divided
by the total population (n). It can be expressed as follows:
                                                         39

the economic contraction. An Emergency Social Safety Net strategy is almost complete and
ready to be presented to the Cabinet as part of the 2010 budget process. The Government's
response to the social cost of the contraction is already well underway. With the World Bank's
technical input, the Government has already taken measures to ensure a timely response,
including extension of unemployment insurance (passed in March 2009), allocation of support
from the European Social Fund to an expansion of public employment programs, and
improving the targeting of social assistance.

86.         The Emergency Safety et Strategy underpins fiscal consolidation and
structural reforms by deploying supplementary support to ensure basic social services
are maintained. The strategy will coordinate the efforts of national and local government
agencies to maintain: support for schooling for 5 and 6 year olds; the costs of transporting
students from communities where schools have closed to their new places of instruction; the
costs of maintaining financial support to subsidize the health service co-payments of needy
households; adequate financing from the Health Insurance Fund to sustain and improve general
practitioner and primary health care services and access; and increased financing for the
targeted social assistance benefits and services that municipalities are mandated to provide to
eligible groups, while increasing the income level qualifying for assistance so that it reaches a
higher percentage of poor households. Furthermore, given the extent and likely duration of
economic contraction and resulting levels of unemployment, the Government will extend the
coverage of unemployment insurance. For the growing number of unemployed who are not
covered by unemployment insurance or other social support, the Government will fortify the
Emergency Safety Net by re-allocating financing from the European Social Fund to expand
and rapidly deploy labor-intensive public works/emergency employment programs, to
implement pre-existing local development projects.

                                          B. E    VIRO ME TAL ASPECTS

87.         The policies supported by the operation are not likely to cause significant
effects on the country's environment and natural resources. Latvia has adequate
environmental controls in place. Its environmental legislation is reinforced by EU
environmental directives. Prior to EU accession, Latvia made significant progress in
transposing EU legislation with regards to the adoption of environmental impact assessments,
water quality, waste management, industrial pollution control and risk management, air quality,
nature protection, etc. None of the policy areas described in the operation is expected to have
any significant link to the environment.12

                           C. IMPLEME       TATIO    , MO     ITORI G, A D EVALUATIO

88.         The implementation of this operation will require close coordination with the
institutions responsible for implementation, including the Ministry of Finance, the Bank of
Latvia, the Financial and Capital Market Commission, the Ministry of Justice, and the Ministry
of Economy.

89.         The implementation of the policy actions set forth in the policy matrix (Annex
2) has required technical discussions amongst the Bank and the implementing
institutions. Throughout the operation, the Bank has provided technical assistance to the
authorities, including to: (i) review the credit institution law and assess the adequacy of the
bank resolution framework, (ii) prepare a Strategic Contingency Plan for the banking sector,
(iii) prepare corporate and mortgage restructuring guidelines, (iv) prepare a seminar to raise
awareness about proper elements of loan restructuring, (v) review the Insolvency Law, and (vi)
design a Prompt Remedial Action Framework. Latvia has decided to take advantage of the
Bank-FIAS insolvency TA program to assist it with the corporate debt restructuring
framework. The Bank is likely to also provide TA in public administration reforms.

90.         Specific indicators are being used to monitor the implementation of the
operation. At the banking sector level, the agreed policy reforms are expected to lead to an
overall healthier banking sector. Thus, several indicators are being used to monitor progress in
achieving the desired program outcomes. The Bank, in collaboration with the Latvian financial
authorities, is monitoring, among other, the following:

     ·   evolution of resident and nonresident deposits and of non-deposit funding sources
     ·   evolution of NPLs and provisioning levels
     ·   capital adequacy levels
     ·   percentages of loans that are restructured
     ·   number of effective corporate restructuring
     ·   number of foreclosure processes.

These indicators will serve to evaluate the impact of the policy changes supported by the
proposed operation. Other overall indicators will be monitored as well, such as the spreads on
credit default swaps, as well as the EMBI spreads. These monitoring indicators will serve as
useful market benchmarks to determine if the market is confident that the program is
generating the desired outcomes.

                                           D. FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

Public Financial Management System and Budgetary Resources

91.         The Latvian Public Financial Management (PFM) system is supported by an
established legal and institutional framework. In recent years, Latvia has introduced a
series of PFM reforms and enhancements.13 The most significant reforms were the phased
introduction of a performance based budgeting, the introduction of a medium term framework,
the capacity building of the State Audit Office, and the implementation of the web-based IT
system supporting budget planning and execution. These reforms have resulted in a stronger
PFM system characterized by a centralized cash management within a single treasury account
structure, a web-based on line reporting system updated twice per month, timely preparation
and audit of government financial statements and a strong audit capacity of the State Audit


13
  The most recent World Bank diagnostic work that focused on selected sectors within the Public Expenditure
Review was conducted in 2007.

Office supported by private sector sworn auditors involved in auditing of the BoL and local
governments.

92.         As a result, the fiduciary risk associated with this operation is low, although
further PFM improvements are needed, including to address the following issues: exposure
of the budgetary framework to the economic downturn due to lack of clear procedures on
budget cuts, insufficient implementation of medium-term planning and performance budgeting
(in practice performance indicators focus on outputs rather than outcomes, budget execution is
still monitored on the basis of budget appropriations, there is tendency to use incremental
budgeting), inadequate budgetary expenditures monitoring and enforcement especially at the
local government level, deficiencies in accounting at the ministerial and local government level
resulting in negative audit opinions, fragmentation of the budget into base and special
(earmarked for special purposes), insufficient accountability framework of the sector ministries
related to the overall performance of the sector (including quality of the delivery of services by
local governments).

Foreign Exchange Environment

93.        The BoL is a member of the European System of Central Banks, and its legal
independence is granted by the Law on the Bank of Latvia. The main objective of the
Bank of Latvia is to maintain price stability and the primary tasks include management of
foreign currency and gold reserves. The BoL acts also as advisor to the Parliament and the
Government with regard to the monetary policy, which follows the ECB practice. The BoL
does not engage in any commercial activity, and its operation related to the execution of its
tasks is mainly financed from income on foreign currency and gold reserves management. The
Parliament has supervisory role over the BoL.

94.         A recent Safeguards Assessment of the BoL concluded that the BoL has a
relatively strong safeguards framework in place. A Safeguards Assessment of the BoL was
conducted in October 2001 and an update assessment was concluded on July 8, 2009. The
update assessment confirmed that the BoL has a relatively strong safeguards framework in
place. The BoL financial management and operations are transparently disclosed and
presented on its website. The BoL annual financial statements are regularly audited jointly by
the State Audit Office and reputable independent auditors and the most recent audit reports, for
2006-2008 have unqualified audit opinions.

                               E. DISBURSEME        T ARRA GEME TS

95.        The proposed loan will follow the World Bank's disbursement procedures for
development policy lending. Loan proceeds will be disbursed in one tranche to the foreign
currency account at the BoL.           Disbursement will be made upon meeting tranche
conditionalities, declaration of loan effectiveness and submission of a withdrawal application
to the IBRD. At the request of the MoF, the IBRD will deposit the proceeds of the loan into
the designated account at the BoL, which forms part of the country's official foreign exchange
reserves. The Borrower shall ensure that upon the deposit of the Loan into said account, an
                                                         42

equivalent amount is credited in local currency14 to the Single Treasury Account also kept in
the BoL and that is available to finance budgeted expenditures. Disbursements will not be
linked to specific purchases, thus no procurement requirements will be necessary. The
Government shall maintain accounts and records with respect to the deposit of loan proceeds at
the BoL. If the loan proceeds are used for ineligible purposes as defined in the loan agreement,
IBRD will require the borrower to refund the amount directly to IBRD. Amounts refunded to
the Bank upon such request shall be cancelled.

96.         o additional fiduciary arrangements will be required. The Bank will not
require an audit of the designated account, but will require the Government to provide a
confirmation to the Bank in the form of an official letter from the Ministry of Finance on the
amounts deposited in the foreign currency account and credited to the budget management
system (Single Treasury Account) within 30 days of receiving the funds.

                                        F. RISKS A      D RISK MITIGATIO

97.        This operation involves high risks but supports already implemented reforms
that are crucial to the success of the Government's program.

Risk of financial instability

98.        A key risk to the proposed operation is that of further banking sector
problems. With a contraction of real GDP for 2009 of 18 percent, and another year of
negative growth forecasted for 2010, banks in Latvia are expected to suffer from very high
levels of NPLS over the medium term. Higher unemployment and falling real wages create
pressure on households and the corporate sector, especially small firms. This in turn creates
repayment problems on mortgages and corporate loans. While banks are in the process of
bringing in new capital, it cannot be excluded that some may face solvency problems. In
addition, with highly volatile deposits, and no access to market funding, liquidity problems
cannot be excluded.

99.         This risk is mitigated by the operation's proposed policy reforms. The program
includes reforms in crisis management, bank resolution, debt restructuring, and supervision and
regulation strengthening. This should enable banks and the corporate sector to handle better
future potential problems should the economic situation deteriorate. In addition, the authorities
have completed stress tests, which have increased their awareness of where problems in the
banking sector might arise. This in turn enables them to intensify their supervision of specific
institutions as needed. In addition, banks have been required to bring in additional capital and
prepare liquidity contingency plans. Finally, a Strategic Contingency Plan is in preparation
including a detailed strategy for banks that may pose a threat to financial stability.

Macroeconomic risk

100.      There is a risk that the Government's macroeconomic strategy is not
sustainable. The Government is undertaking a very ambitious economic adjustment program
based on a macroeconomic strategy that includes severe fiscal consolidation measures and
   14
        The Bank can also agree that the proceeds of the loan will remain in loan currency (EUR).
                                                43

wage cuts under the fixed exchange rate regime, in spite of which a substantial rise in the
public debt-to-GDP ratio is expected. The severity of these measures increases the difficulty of
implementing the Government's program. In addition, there is a risk of more prolonged need
for extraordinary official financing support resulting from potential fiscal financing constraints,
and the need for further measures to limit the deficit so as not to exceed Latvia's financing
sources and setting debt on an unsustainable path. In the worst case, if the contraction proves
deeper or the authorities prove unable to deliver on the fiscal adjustment, the resulting high
deficits would raise risks to debt sustainability and capacity to repay donors. Also, the much
higher government deficits will make it harder to meet the Maastricht criteria and may delay
the program's exit strategy of euro adoption. Deflation may be even deeper than currently
projected, which could also jeopardize Euro adoption. Other things equal, more rapid deflation
will result in a greater competitiveness improvement, and better prospects for sustainable
growth. However, in the absence of precedents it is unclear how the European institutions will
judge continued deflation in the context of requirements for price stability, creating further
uncertainty for euro adoption.

101.         The IMF program framework, reinforced by continued international support,
particularly from the EU, seeks to mitigate these risks. The risk is also mitigated by the
size of the multilateral financial package, equivalent to 35 percent of GDP, in support of the
Government's program - although this will add substantially to Latvia's indebtedness. In
addition, the support of Latvia's international partners, particularly the EU, represents a key
safeguard to the IMF program. The EU's commitment of 3.1 billion under the international
support package has provided important space for implementation of the programmed reforms.
In a July 27 press statement announcing their disbursement of 1.2 billion, the EU affirmed
that it will continue to work closely with the Latvian authorities and the IMF to ensure Latvia
implements successfully its economic reform program and its timely repayment of, all loans
associated with the international program to support Latvia. Thus, while the risks are
significant, continued current account surpluses, Latvia's strong commitment to the program,
expected improvements in global financing conditions, and EU support provide key
safeguards.

Political risk

102.        The viability of the program may be undermined if the political consensus on
the structural reforms weakens. A centre-right coalition government led by Prime Minister
Valdis Dombrovskis was formed in March 2009. Parliamentary elections are due in October
2010. However, the severe and politically risky adjustment measures may alienate the
electorate and lead to early elections. This could exacerbate an already complex environment
for sustained and in-depth reforms. All five governing coalition parties supported the passage
of the revised 2009 budget. However, tensions over spending cuts are rising among the
political parties, which affect the previously broad political consensus supporting the program.
The resignation of the health minister over the cuts in the health sector indicates that support
for the drastic measures may be starting to erode.

103.      This risk is partially mitigated by the adhesion of all coalition parties to the
revised IMF Letter of Intent, wide consultations on the program, and the implementation
of laws and regulations to support the reforms. The Letter of Intent with the IMF of August
                                              44

2009 was signed by all parties of the coalition government, notwithstanding earlier questions
by some of them on the need for a Fund arrangement. In addition, the 2010 budget reforms
have been the subject of wide consultations, including with line ministries, municipal
governments, and social partners. Finally, many reforms supported by this operation are being
implemented by amendments to laws and regulations that ensure a solid framework for crisis
resolution and structural reforms is in place.

Social Risk

104.        The deep austerity measures create a risk of disruption in social services and of
social unrest. The cuts in fiscal spending create a risk that some important social services are
cut and that the gains Latvia made since accession in converging with EU welfare standards
will be lost.

105.         The risk is mitigated by the preparation of a social safety net DPL, aimed at
mitigating the social and poverty impacts of the crisis and of the Government's program.
The DPL proposes measures in public sector reform, social protection, education, and health
aimed at mitigating the poverty and social impacts of the crisis and of the spending cuts. Other
mitigating factors include the measures supported by this proposed DPL to ensure financial
stability, therefore avoiding potential losses to depositors, and include measures to facilitate
debt restructuring and avoid foreclosures of residential properties wherever possible.

Insufficient institutional capacity

106.      The reforms in the banking system require an increased capacity of the
supervisor to anticipate deteriorating trends and undertake the necessary corrective
actions.

107.        The risk is mitigated by the fact that the proposed policy reforms aim to
strengthen the regulatory and supervisory framework, specifically in areas of higher risks
(such as asset quality and provisioning). The operation includes measures designed to enhance
the capacity of the supervisor to monitor the banking system and react in a timely and effective
manner. It also includes the conducting of stress tests, the preparation of a Strategic
Contingency Plan for the banking sector, an improved stress testing framework, the
establishment of a Prompt Remedial Action Plan, as well as strengthened prudential
regulations. In addition, the Bank has provided and will continue to provide technical
assistance in these areas.

Crisis resolution

                                      1. The BoL, with inputs from the FCMC, has completed stress tests of the banking sector in order to
                                                                                                                                                 Well-capitalized banks
                                      assess its resilience to potential worst case scenarios.
Capital adequacy strengthening
                                      2. The Borrower has prepared a Strategic Contingency Plan for the financial sector on the basis of the Preparedness to handle specific bank problems or a systemic
                                      results of the stress tests referred to in paragraph 1 above.                                          crisis

                                      3. The Borrower's Parliament has approved amendments to the Credit Institution Law with a view to
Bank resolution framework                                                                                                                        Adequate legal framework for the resolution of banks in distress
                                      strengthen the Borrower's legal framework for bank resolution.

                                      4. The Borrower's Parliament has approved amendments to the Insolvency Law with a view to: (i)
                                      removing potential obstacles to out-of-court proceedings for corporate restructuring; (ii) allowing pre-   Enhanced capacity of viable companies to reorganize and

           A      EX 3. OVERVIEW OF THE LATVIA BA KI G SECTOR

1.      Latvia's financial sector is dominated by the banking sector, which is largely
foreign-owned. Banks account for about 90 percent of total financial sector assets. The
banking sector comprises 21 commercial banks (of which 19 private and 2 state-owned)
and six foreign bank branches. Over 60 percent of the banking system is owned by banks
from Sweden and other Nordic countries. In total, 77 percent is foreign owned.

2.      Between 2004 and 2008, bank credit in Latvia expanded at one of the highest
rates in the region. Annual growth in bank loans to the private sector increased by an
average of 50 percent from 2004 to 2007. As a share of GDP, lending to the private
sector increased from about 40 percent in 2003 to 89 percent in 2007 (the highest ratio
among the new EU member states), and to about 90 percent in 2008. During that period,
loans have grown faster than deposits: deposits increased by an average of 34 percent
from 2004 to 2007. Deposits increased from about 26 percent of GDP in 2003, to 36
percent in 2007, and to 31 percent at end-2008.

3.      Credit growth has been funded primarily by external borrowing from
private banks, exposing the banking sector to substantial liquidity risks. The rapid
credit expansion has been largely financed by external borrowings from private banks,
resulting in a high loan to deposit ratios. The loan to deposit ratio in Latvia was the
highest in ECA at about 287.8 percent at end-2008, up from 168 percent in 2004.
Foreign parents of Latvian banks have provided an increasing share of the external
funding, from 67 percent of total non-deposit borrowings in 2005 to 78 percent at end-
May 2009. From 2005 to end-2008, borrowings from parent banks increased by about
260 percent to more than LVL 7.2 billion ­ but decreased to about LVL 6.5 billion at
end-May 2009. While foreign banks relied on their parent banks for funding, the
domestically owned banks relied mainly on short-term syndicated loans and non-resident
deposits for financing (from Russia, Ukraine, and other CIS countries).

4.     Much of banks' lending was directed to households. Household loans
increased by 85 percent in 2004-2005, 76 percent in 2005-2006, 39 percent in 2006-2007,
and 7 percent in 2007-2008. Its share in total banking sector assets reached 28 percent at
the end of 2007 and over 28 percent at end-2008 (equivalent to over 40 percent of GDP,
from 18 percent of GDP in 2004). Mortgage loans grew particularly fast, almost
doubling each year until mid-2007, which fuelled a construction boom and real estate
asset bubble. Mortgage loans increased from about 12 percent of GDP in 2004 to 32
percent of GDP in 2007, and about 31 percent at end-2008. Corporate loans increased
from 32 percent of GDP in 2004 to about 50 percent of GDP at end-2008. As a result,
indebtedness of corporate and households almost doubled between 2004 and 2007,
exceeding 80 percent of GDP.

5.     Much of the lending has been in foreign currency, primarily to unhedged
borrowers, exposing the banking sector to foreign exchange risk. The share of FX
loans as a proportion of total loans has increased from 70 percent in 2005 to 87 percent at
end-May 2009, one of the highest in ECA countries.15 From 2005 to end-May 2009, the
share of FX household loans (mortgage, consumer credit, and other loans to households)
increased from 70 percent to 88 percent, the share of FX mortgage loans increased from
73 percent to 96 percent, and the share of FX corporate loans increased from 69 percent
to 91 percent in the same time period. The high volume of foreign currency denominated
loans exposed the banking sector to a foreign exchange risk as most borrowers do not
generate income in foreign currency.

6.      Since the financial crisis, growth of the banking sector has slowed down
starting in mid-2007. From 2006 to 2007, total financial sector assets grew by 38
percent, loans by 36 percent, and deposits by 31 percent. From 2007 to end-2008, total
assets grew by 6 percent, loans by 12 percent, and deposits decreased by 6 percent.

7.      The banking system entered the crisis with adequate prudential ratios, but
much vulnerability has emerged. The capital adequacy ratio stands at 12.75 percent as
of end-May 2009. While the banks remain well-capitalized, rising non-performing loans
are straining capital buffers. Non-performing loans (overdue by more than 90 days) rose
from 0.4 percent of the loan portfolio at end-2007 to 3.6 percent at end-2008, and to 10.7
percent as of May 2009. In response to increasing NPLs, banks' provisioning has also
increased from 0.5 percent in 2007, to 2.2 percent at end-2008, and to 4.4 percent as of
May 2009. Banks report a strong liquidity ratio of about 50 percent in May 2009 (above
the regulatory minimum of 30 percent). However, funding liquidity risks are high,
especially for local banks that have been facing increasing difficulties in rolling over
syndicated loans and other short term financing.

Condition of the banking sector since 2007

Balance Sheet Characteristics

8.       Reported liquidity is strong, with a liquidity ratio (liquid assets to short term
liabilities) of about 50 percent at end-May 2009. Since 2007, the liquidity ratio has
been at over 50 percent, above the regulatory minimum of 30 percent. However, funding
liquidity risks are high given the high reliance of banks on non deposit, mostly external,
sources of funding.

9.      Capital adequacy is adequate, albeit with rapidly increasing non-performing
loans. The capital adequacy ratio increased from 11.1 percent in 2007, to 11.8 percent at
end-2008, and to 12.75 percent at end-May 2009. The Tier 1 capital ratio has also
increased from 9.8 percent in 2007, to 10.5 percent in 2008, and 11.1 percent at end-May
2009. The banks are thus well-capitalized, although rising non-performing loans are
straining their capital buffers. Loans more than 90 days overdue have increased from 0.4
percent in 2007, to 3.6 percent in 2008, and to 10.7 percent at end-May 2009. Loans
overdue by more than 30 days have increased from 2 percent in 2007, to 7.8 percent in
2008, and to 15.5 percent at end-May 2009. The increase in NPLs is seen across the
board, with loans overdue by more than 30 days reaching 15 percent for mortgages, 29
percent for real estate developers, and 12 percent for corporate loans.16 Banks'
provisioning has also increased, from 0.5 percent of total loans in 2007, to 2.2 percent at
end-2008, and to 4.4 percent as of May 2009.




16
  Loans overdue by more than 90 days averaged 10.5 percent for mortgages, 21 percent for real estate
developers, and about 9 percent for corporate loans. Loans at 1 day overdue (an indication of future NPLs)
averaged 23 percent for mortgages, 38 percent for real estate developers, and about 16 percent for corporate
loans.

Income Statement Characteristics

10.    Profitability of the banking sector has declined drastically since 2008. The
Return on Equity decreased from 24 percent in 2007, to 3.6 percent in 2008, and to a
dramatic -19.7 percent as of May 2009. The Return on Assets has also declined from 2
percent in 2007, to 0.27 percent in 2008, to -1.54 as of May 2009. As of May 2009, the
Latvian banking sector incurred losses of about LVL 146 million, mainly due to the need
to provision for non-performing loans.

Likely evolution of the banking sector

11.     Latvia's banking sector structure is likely to be affected by the crisis. Firstly,
the Government has committed to refocus the activities of the public Mortgage and
Landes Bank on its core developmental mandate. The new public bank Parex should be
re-privatized in the medium term. Secondly, some consolidation could take place among
smaller banks. Finally, foreign banks active in Latvia could review their strategy in
Latvia and beyond.

               Republic of Latvia--Staff Assessment Letter for the World Bank

                                         August 24, 2009

This note provides the IMF staff's assessment of recent macroeconomic developments and
prospects in Latvia. The assessment is based on findings of the May and July 2009 Review
missions under the Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) as well as recent data releases.




Recent Developments and Outlook

1. The downturn is much deeper than anticipated at the launch of the program. Real GDP fell
   by just under 20 percent year-on-year in the first half of 2009, compared with the program
   projection of a 5 percent decline for the year as a whole. The main causes have been the bursting
   of the credit and real estate bubble, a collapse in domestic demand, and the much worse than
   expected international environment. Registered unemployment reached 11½ percent by end-June,
   up from 7 percent at the end of last year, but labor force surveys show an unemployment rate of
   14 percent in the first quarter. As a negative output gap has emerged, inflation has declined
   sharply to around 2½ percent in July (from a peak of 18 percent year on year in mid-2008).

2. Falling domestic demand has led to a rapid correction in the current account while the
   capital account has weakened considerably. The decline in exports induced by weak global
   demand has been more than offset by a collapse in imports, which fell nearly 40 percent year-on-
   year in the first quarter of 2009. Together with the emergence of an income account surplus due
   to losses on FDI investment in Latvia, the import collapse has resulted in a current account
   surplus of 740 million (4 percent of annual GDP) through June. However, the capital account
   has weakened as domestically owned banks have made larger than expected loan repayments,
   foreign banks have reduced exposure to their Latvian subsidiaries and residents have
   accumulated assets abroad.

3. The banking sector is suffering strains caused by the downturn, lower real estate prices,
   and global deleveraging. The stock of credit has fallen by 3 percent since end-2008. A large
   proportion of household mortgages have negative equity and the share of loans reported to be at
   least 90 days overdue has risen above 10 percent. The need to provision for bad loans has caused
   system-wide losses at an annualized rate exceeding 2 percent of GDP. However, the FCMC
   reports that the banking system is adequately capitalized.

4. Fiscal deficits rose above program targets in the first half of 2009, reflecting both the
   sharper-than-expected downturn and weak program implementation:
                                                      60

·       Although all the tax increases (about 2½ percent of GDP) announced in December 2008 were
introduced, only around one third of the 4½ percent of GDP in originally planned expenditure cuts
were implemented in the first half of 2009. Significant cuts were instead made on mandated
expenditure including EU-financed spending and transfers to local governments, which will later
need to be reversed.

·      Tax revenues fell sharply in the first half of this year. VAT receipts declined by 30 percent
year-on-year, despite the increase in the VAT rate from 18 to 21 percent and the removal of most
exemptions. Direct taxes have been more robust, reflecting lower than projected declines in officially
recorded wages and the tendency of corporate income tax payments to lag corporate profits.


5. Financial markets have been strained, although the peg has been successfully defended in
   the face of heavy pressure. Since end-December, there has been pressure on international
   reserves including net FX sales to the private sector of 1.8 billion. Numerous shocks have
   contributed to instability, including political uncertainty, press reports of possible devaluation,
   and a failed treasury bill auction in June. However, following the subsequent announcement of
   the 1.2 billion EC disbursement, pressures eased considerably. The lats appreciated within the
   band, and the central bank started to buy foreign exchange. Gross reserves stood at more than 4
   billion in mid-August, above their end-December level. Nevertheless, forward foreign exchange
   rates remain depreciated, and CDS spreads high, implying concerns over the stability of the peg
   and the sustainability of government debt.
6. The recession is projected to continue into 2010. Staff and the authorities forecast a GDP
   decline of 18 percent for 2009 as a whole (a projection made before the Q2 GDP release) with
   the downturn expected to continue until the second half of next year alongside a continued
   increase in unemployment. Consequently, year-on-year deflation is expected by the end of this
   year. As domestic demand remains weak, the current account surplus is expected to widen further
   in 2009 and remain in surplus.


Program Implementation

7.    Latvia faces considerable obstacles on its way to euro adoption, the exit strategy envisaged
     under the program. The general government deficit is likely to exceed 12 percent of GDP in
     2009, and would increase further in 2010 without significant further measures. The authorities
     need to balance their objective of defining a sustainable and structurally sound fiscal reform,
     consistent with the strategy of adopting the euro as early as possible, against the need to
     minimize further pressure on economic activity and to protect the most vulnerable at a time of
     painful dislocation:

·       Fiscal Policy: Implementation of fiscal policy will need to be significantly strengthened.
Although the June 2009 supplementary budget included some courageous decisions, it also has
serious drawbacks including substantial across-theboard and one-off expenditure cuts, and regressive
tax increases. The authorities recognize that fiscal consolidation will have to contend with headwinds
from the output deterioration--and deflation--that are eroding the revenue base. Against that
background, it may take longer than originally envisaged to attain the Maastricht fiscal criteria, with
potential confidence effects from possible delay in euro adoption. In the staff's view, measures
amounting to 6½ percent of GDP in 2010 are needed to reduce the deficit, followed by
approximately 4 percent of GDP in measures each subsequent year until the deficit can be brought
                                                      61

below 3 percent of GDP.

·       Financial Sector: Restoring confidence in the financial sector requires a strategy to
ensure banks remain liquid and adequately capitalized. Preemptive capital increases by two large
foreign banks are welcome and will give them scope to absorb the loan losses likely in the coming
months. The authorities are seeking to minimize the contingent liabilities from domestic banks,
particularly those in state ownership, and restrict issuance of new guarantees.

·       Monetary Policy: An agreement to exchange program money off-market will result in a
welcome reduction in the Treasury's influence on the exchange rate. The BoL is committed to
introducing new instruments that will absorb excess liquidity. These initiatives could prevent interest
rate volatility, which is inevitable under a currency board, from being excessive or destabilizing.


Relations with the Fund

8.       Staff level agreement for completion of the First Review has been reached and is now
pending Board approval. The Second Review of the program is expected in the fall of 2009.
Discussions will focus on an update of the macroeconomic framework; the size and phasing of the
required fiscal adjustment, including the 2010 budget; financial sector stability; and structural
reforms.

       A     EX 5. GOOD PRACTICE PRI CIPLES FOR CO DITIO ALITIES



Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership
There is ownership and commitment at the executive and parliamentary level as evidenced by a number of
policy actions taken under the multilateral package. The Bank's contribution is based on analysis conducted
during preparation and accepted by the authorities as the basis for further policy actions to add to and
strengthen the set of reforms underway. The Bank team includes experts with field experience in the country
and knowledge of the executive, parliamentary, and other consultative and consensus building procedures.

Principle 2: Agree up front with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated
accountability framework
The program is very closely coordinated with the other collaborating donors/partners, namely, the IMF and the
EC. The accountability framework delineated in the policy matrix contains very specific actions with
associated indicators for measuring results to determine success of the program.


Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
circumstances
The policy measures are specifically geared to support the government's reform program and mitigate future
risks generated by the financial crisis. The funding is earmarked for potential gaps with a view to ensuring
financial stability.

Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement
The policy actions focus only on those that are considered crucial toward strengthening the financial sector.
The actions are those which contain key added value features as contributions from the Bank to the policy
agenda. Other actions, already agreed with the other partners, are essential to the overall basis of the program
and complement the policy measures developed by the Government.

Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based
financial support
As this is a single tranche DPL, all the conditions will be implemented prior to Board approval and thus
monitoring will take place prior to Board approval. Monitoring will take place during loan implementation.
