Financial Sector\n            Development Policy Loan (DPL) Project for Latvia were as\n            follows: outcomes were highly satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was substantial, the Bank performance\n            was moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the\n            Financial Sector DPL was guided strongly by the\n            internationalization of the stabilization package anchored\n            to the Government strategy. The coordinated policy dialogue\n            with bilateral and multilateral donors helped Latvia to\n            define coordinated programs along the lines of the\n            Government strategy and designed synchronized policy actions\n            adequately. Another contributing factor was the coordination\n            and consensus building among the relevant implementing\n            agencies. The success of the reform program depended also\n            significantly on the continued involvement of all banks\n            operating in or with Latvia, including foreign-owned banks.\n            In a coordination meeting held on September 11, 2009 in\n            Stockholm, the parent banks of the four key largest\n            foreign-owned banks (DnB Nord, Nordea, SEB, and Swedbank)\n            operating in Latvia reaffirmed their commitments to support\n            their branches and subsidiaries in the country and to\n            promote financial stability in the Baltic region. These\n            commitments, along with the international package have\n            cushioned the effects of the financial crisis and\n            strengthened international investor's confidence.\n            Overall, the program suggests that internal devaluation can\n            work in terms of restoring lost cost competitiveness, while\n            maintaining a fixed exchange rate regime. However, the\n            social and financial costs of this policy approach have been\n            very high. The key elements of the program focused on\n            measures to stabilize the financial system, measures to\n            achieve a large fiscal consolidation, and income policies\n            based on nominal wages reduction, while maintaining\n            unchanged rate peg. The banking sector has stabilized in\n            2010 and to this matter, the Financial Sector DPL is\n            considered to be a successful operation."}, "docdt": "2010-02-24T00:00:00Z"}
