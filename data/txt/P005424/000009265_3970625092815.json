Project\n            will pursue the Government's sectoral objectives being\n            supported by the Bank through the recent Agricultural Sector\n            Adjustment Loan.  The project will:  (i) increase\n            institutional credit penetration in rainfed areas to help\n            increase agricultural production and to assist Morocco\n            towards reaching self sufficiency in food stuffs, and (ii)\n            augment non budgetary financing of agriculture through\n            increased credit extension to small farmers.  This is aimed\n            at increasing production and farmers' income.  In\n            addition, it will (iii) upgrade the technology being used by\n            small farmers in rainfed areas and increase land\n            productivity by financing more intensive use of chemical\n            fertilizers, high yielding seeds and small scale\n            mechanization; (iv) generate value added by financing\n            individual and cooperative on-farm storage, small- and\n            medium-size agroindustry, as well as construction and\n            equipment of greenhouses.  Lastly, the project will provide\n            for (v) institutional development already started during\n            CNCA V by:  strengthening Caisse Nationale de Credit\n            Agricole (CNCA) management structure; improving its lending\n            appraisal procedures; completing the installation of its\n            management information system and increasing domestic\n            resources mobilization activity."}, "docdt": "1986-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
