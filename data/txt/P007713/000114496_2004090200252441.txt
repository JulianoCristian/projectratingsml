Re:
Loan 4050-ME (Water Resources Management Project) 
Amendment to the Guarantee Agreement
Dear Sirs:
We refer to the Loan Agreement between the International Bank for Reconstruction 
and Development (the Bank) and Nacional Financiera, S.N.C. (the Borrower), and to the 
Guarantee Agreement between the United Mexican States (the Guarantor) and the Bank, 
each dated September 28, 1996, both as amended, with respect to the above-captioned 
Project.  We are pleased to inform you of our agreement to amend said Guarantee 
Agreement as follows:
1.
Part C.1 of Section I of the Schedule is hereby amended in its entirety to read 
as follows: 
“Goods estimated to cost less than $350,000 equivalent per contract or 
per bid 
package (up to an aggregate amount not to exceed $15,000,000 
equivalent) and civil works 
estimated to cost less than $2,5000,000 per 
contract or per bid package (up to an aggregate 
amount not to exceed $8,000,000 
equivalent), may be procured under contracts awarded in 
accordance with the 
provisions of paragraphs 3.3 and 3.4 of the Guidelines, using standard 
bidding 
documents satisfactory to the Bank.”.
2.
A new Part C.3 of Section I of the Schedule is hereby inserted immediately after 
Part C.2 thereof, to read as follows in its entirety: \0c “Procurement of Small Works
Works estimated to cost less than $350,000 equivalent per contract, up to 
an 
aggregate amount not to exceed $7,000,000 equivalent, may be procured 
under lump-sum, 
fixed-price contracts awarded on the basis of quotations 
obtained from three qualified 
domestic contractors in response to a written 
invitation.  The invitation shall include a 
detailed description of the works, 
including basic specifications, the required completion 
date, a basic form of 
agreement acceptable to the Bank, and relevant drawings, where 
applicable.  
The award shall be made to the contractor who offers the lowest price quotation 
for the required work, and who has the experience and resources to complete the 
contract successfully.”.
Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing amendments by signing and dating 
the three originals of this letter in the spaces provided below, and returning one to 
us.  This amendment shall enter into effect as of January 1, 2000, upon receipt by the 
Bank of the one original of this letter signed by you.
Sincerely yours,
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR  
   RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
