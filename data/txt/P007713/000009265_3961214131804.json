Water\n            Resources Management Project are to: 1) promote conditions\n            for environmentally sustainable, economically efficient and\n            equitably allocated use of water resources in Mexico; 2)\n            support the integrated comprehensive management of water\n            resources; and 3) increase the benefits and reduce the risk\n            related to existing hydraulic infrastructure. Secondary\n            project objectives are to: 1) support groundwater\n            conservation by reducing overexploitation and contamination;\n            2) promote the restoration of surface water quality; 3)\n            improve meteorological services for improved water\n            management and for the society and economy as a whole; 4)\n            reduce flood damages downstream of reservoirs; 5) improve\n            dam safety; 6) improve allocation of water as an economic\n            good; 7) promote decentralization of water resources\n            management through the establishment and strengthening of\n            river basin councils; 8) improve water resources planning\n            through the development of the hydrographic region plans\n            with river basin council participation; and 9) improve water\n            rights administration through registry of water rights users\n            and improved fee collection. The project will comprise the\n            following components: 1) institutional development,\n            technological support and training; 2) water quantity and\n            quality monitoring improvement and assessment; 3) reservoir\n            operation, dam safety and aquifer management improvement; 4)\n            water rights administration; and 5) water resources planning\n            and river basin council support."}, "docdt": "1996-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
