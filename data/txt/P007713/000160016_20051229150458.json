outcome is satisfactory; sustainability is likely;\n            institutional development impact is substantial; and both\n            Bank and Borrower performances are satisfactory. Among the\n            lessons cited were the following: 1) Sustainable water\n            resources management efforts cannot succeed without a\n            holistic integrated approach that deals with irrigation and\n            drainage, water supply and sanitation, agricultural\n            productivity and the environment; these need to be planned\n            and managed at the basin or aquifer level with the direct\n            participation of water users and other stakeholders. 2)\n            Although integrated water resource management projects are\n            inherently complex, care should be taken to limit the scope\n            to the extent possible and to focus on the most important\n            elements. The dam safety and some of the meteorological\n            services sub-components could perhaps have been handled\n            better under separate operations. 3) Climatological and\n            hydrological monitoring networks need to be well designed\n            and have strong operation and maintenance programs. 4)\n            Because of the inability to measure the amount of water\n            usage by each water user, Mexico opted to assign water\n            rights amounts based on declarations by the water users when\n            they registered. This resulted in over-allocations, and this\n            aspect has complicated the effectiveness of the water rights\n            program. 5) The gradual incorporation of the users into the\n            decision-making processes at the River Basin Councils and\n            Aquifer Committees is contributing to addressing the\n            sustainability of the resource. 6) Although the process of\n            decentralization has gained some momentum, it is imperative\n            that additional activities, such as improving regulations\n            and procedures in support of the national water law, and\n            continuing to build capacities are followed up. 7) It is\n            important that the Government provides a clear signal and\n            remains true to the reform process in support of the\n            national water law, to create confidence and political\n            support for integrated water resources management."}, "docdt": "2005-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
