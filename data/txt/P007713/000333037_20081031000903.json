They received less than a third of total\n            runoff. This made these areas extremely vulnerable to major\n            surface and groundwater shortages, with profound\n            implications for further economic development. In the early\n            1990s, the Government of Mexico determined that a major\n            effort needed to be made to improve water management,\n            conservation, and intersectoral allocation of water\n            resources. A new national water law was approved in 1992 and\n            its regulations were passed in 1994. The law sets out broad\n            mandates for the development and implementation of plans and\n            policies related to water resources management and assigns\n            the national water commission, created in 1989, the\n            responsibility to carry them out. The national water plan\n            1995-2000 aimed at ensuring adequate water to satisfy the\n            needs of the population and promote environmentally\n            sustainable economic development. In line with the national\n            water plan, the national water commission set a new agenda\n            to modernize and decentralize the nation's water\n            resources by considering all uses and the preservation of\n            the environment. The Water Resources Management Project was\n            prepared to support these efforts."}, "docdt": "2008-10-01T00:00:00Z"}
