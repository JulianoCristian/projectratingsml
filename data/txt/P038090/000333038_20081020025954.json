outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was high, the Bank performance was\n            moderately unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included: a long period\n            of preparation involving disagreements between the\n            implementing agencies is an indication of potential problems\n            that may arise during project implementation. It is\n            important to assess government and cross-party commitment\n            before designing a complex reform project, as a project\n            without sufficient broad buy-in may not be sustainable.\n            Technical assistance provided by the Bank is still relevant\n            and highly valued in the new European Union (EU) countries\n            provided it is aligned with the country's needs and\n            delivered in a timely and appropriate manner. Pooling of\n            World Bank and EU funds and thereby leveraging EU funds to\n            support social sector reforms could be a useful tool. The\n            probability of success in any reform, including in social\n            sectors, is higher where there is a reform champion, but\n            broader support is needed for sustainability. To\n            institutionalize new systems, processes and practices and\n            ensuring the sustainability of ownership by the implementing\n            agencies is also essential."}, "docdt": "2008-09-29T00:00:00Z"}
