plans for pension reform by\n            improving the policy framework and management of its social\n            protection system. There are three project components. The\n            first finances technical assistance, training, office\n            equipment, hardware, and software to improve the\n            institutional capacity of the Ministry of Labor, Social\n            Affairs, and Family (MOLSAF), the Social Insurance Agency\n            (SIA), and the National Labor Office (NLO). In particular,\n            it assists the MOLSAF in developing a multi-pillar pension\n            reform. The component also targets training on actuarial\n            projections, public information campaigns, policy analysis\n            for other social programs, and human resource training. The\n            second component finances technical assistance, hardware,\n            software, and services to put in place and manage an\n            efficient infrastructure to process the financial flow to\n            and from the social sector agencies, initially, to collect\n            social insurance contributions and employment program\n            contributions. Activities under this component include\n            technical assistance for joint collection system and client\n            services, and for audit and enforcement. The third component\n            develops a client database and information systems to\n            support social sector programs. Activities included under\n            this component include an application environment to support\n            individual client accounting for pensions and sickness\n            insurance; and database migration."}, "docdt": "2002-01-17T00:00:00Z"}
