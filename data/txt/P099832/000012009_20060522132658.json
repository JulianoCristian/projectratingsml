the threat in Armenia posed to humans, by\n            the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), and other\n            zoonoses in domestic poultry, and, to prepare for the\n            control and response to an influenza pandemic, and other\n            infectious disease emergencies in humans. The first\n            component - animal health - will support activities on\n            prevention, control, and eradication of the HPAI; the second\n            component - human health - will focus on activities to\n            reduce the impact of HPAI, building an effective national\n            public health response strategy, within an enabling\n            environment, to include the necessary resources, responsive\n            to nationwide scale, through proven interventions. The\n            public awareness and implementation support component, will\n            support and provide information and communication\n            activities, to increase awareness, and commitment by the\n            government, private sector, and civil society organizations,\n            in order to strengthen the understanding among the general\n            population about the risk and impact of a potential\n            pandemic. Finally, the fourth component - support to\n            critical imports - would finance, under Emergency Recovery\n            Assistance (ERA) procedures, a positive list of critically\n            needed imports, identified as necessary to a response\n            program in the event an AI human pandemic would occur."}, "docdt": "2006-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
