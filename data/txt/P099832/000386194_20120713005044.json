PROJECT,TF058076-ARMENIA - AVIAN INFLUENZA\n            PREPAREDNESS PROJECT", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Avian Influenza\n            Preparedness Project for Armenia were as follows: outcome\n            was moderately satisfactory; risk to development outcome was\n            significant; Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory;\n            and borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned includes: a three-year emergency project is\n            appropriate for quickly building some surveillance,\n            diagnosis, and response capacity to rapidly tackle an\n            immediate threat but is unsuited to a deepening and\n            broadening of institutional capacity for more systemic\n            reforms. An alternative would have been to launch a quick\n            emergency project followed by an overlapping longer term\n            institutional reform and capacity building project with the\n            broader animal disease focus designed in a more measured\n            way. In projects aimed at preventing or preparing for a\n            potential disease threat with an uncertain probability and\n            magnitude of impact, the results frameworks need to\n            anticipate how 'success' will be measured both in\n            the event that the anticipated threat materializes and in\n            the event that it does not. Failure to effectively manage\n            communications can lead to unproductive panic, insufficient\n            public knowledge, and erosion of faith in public\n            authorities. In the case of this project, while the early\n            crisis awareness materials themselves were generally well\n            conceived, there were some unexpected responses and some\n            lessons. Carefully designed, timed and targeted public\n            communication following established protocols and\n            communication principles, drawing on professional\n            communications skills, is likely to facilitate emergency\n            response when there is little time to plan. There is an\n            established science of communications that can be locally\n            adapted and tested to ensure communications readiness and to\n            develop national and sectoral strategies."}, "docdt": "2012-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
