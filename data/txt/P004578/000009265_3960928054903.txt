MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE DEVELOPMENT BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES
FOR AN INDUSTRIAL INVESTMENT CREDIT PROJECT
1.            The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) for US$65 million equivalent
is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would be tor 20 years including
5 years of grace and would carry the Bank's standard variable interest rate.
The Government of the Philippines would guarantee the Bank loan to DBP. The
proposed Project, which would help finance the development of private sector
medium and large enterprises, would be co-financed by the Japan Grant Facility
for US$3.5 million equivalent.
2.            Background.   The   remarkable   economic   recovery   of   the
Philippines in the last two years has been largely led by the industrial
sector which accounts for 33% of GDP, 422 of total merchandise exports and 152
of total employment. The sector, which is mostly private, has benefitted from
comprehensive structural reforms undertaken by the Government, including a
major trade liberalization program and the reform of investment incentives
which corrected two major weaknesses of the past, namely, the favoring of
import-substituting industries over exports and the favoring of capital-
intensive over labor-intensive technologies.    As a result, the Philipr.ne
economy is now more open and transparent in its regulatory and incentive
structure than at any time since 1950. Moreover, the average nominal tariff
is now comparable to that of other countries that have also liberalized in
recent years.
3.            Despite this success, however, GDP in 1988 was barely ahead of
the pre-recession (1983) level and gross value added in manufacturing only
slightly surpassed the pre-recession peak.   This suggests that there is
substantial scope for expansion of the industrial sector. The Bank's growth
projections for 1989-92, assuming continued good policy performance and a
favorable external environment, indicate an average GNP growth of about 6%,
with a rate of 8? for industry.  Achieving this target will necessitate a
gradual increase in the rate of investment, from the 1988 level of 18? of GNP
to at least 22%.  Industry will need term credit to finance its investment
requirements and take advantage of the trade liberalization and incentive
reforms already undertaken.
4.            The  liberalized  policy  environment  has  affected  various
industrial subsectors differently, with firms in some hitherto protected
industries needing time to restructure so as to become efficient and
internationally competitive.   However, the design and implementation of a
restructuring strategy has been hampered by insufficient know-how and
Government's hesitancy to introduce, at this stage, further policy reforms
in some subsectors, out of fear that they would collapse if these reforms were
introduced hastily and without proper sequencing. This applies particularly
to the capital-intensive processing industries with large, sunk investments.
Analysis of the policy and restructuring issues facing these subsectors is
therefore needed to assist the Government, industrialists and bankers in the
formulation of appropriate subsectoral strategies.

5.            Industrial  policy  reforms  in  the  Philippines  have  been
accompanied by financial sector reforms. In 1980, the Government initiated
policies that led to deregulation of interest rates and liberalization of
exchange controls. Following the 1983-85 recession and the resulting distress
in the financial system, the Government undertook measures for rehabilitating
the Philippine National Bank and the Development Bank of the Philippines
(DBP), in the context of the Bank-financed Economic Recovery Loan (ERL: Loan
No 2787-PH, 1987).  With the financial and institutional strengthening of
these two institutions substantially completed, and the health of the
commercial banks having improved, the Government has embarked on a
comprehensive program of financial sector reforms to make the banking sector
more competitive and responsive to the needs of the real sectors.   This
program, with Bank support provided under a Financial Sector Adjustment Loan
(FSAL; Loan No. 3049-PH), would be implemented over the next two years. The
program consists of measures to (a) improve the supervision and regulation of
commercial banks; (b) strengthen the institutional arrangements for protection
of insured depositors; (c) reduce bank intermediation costs and, (d) improve
the institutional arrangements for the provision of long-term credit through
a strategic reorientation of DBP into a wholesale bank that would mobilize and
channel funds to the private sector through retail financial institutions.
6.            The  provision  of  term  credit  to  industry  is  currently
inadequate, despite the availability of domestic long-term funds from
institutional savers like insurance companies, the Social Security System and
pension funds. Given the liquidity crises of the past, banks are unwilling
to assume the liquidity risk inherent in term transformation, and their
present liability maturities are not, nor are they expected to be, long enough
to lend long-term. The need for an institution to bring the sources and users
of long-term funds together led to the choice of DBP as a wholesale bank,
which would play a major role in domestic resource mobilization. Since the
local capital market is undeveloped and the Government is likely to continue
tapping domestic savings through high-yield Treasury bills, DBP can only
assume that role gradually and will have to fund itself to a significant
degree through foreign sources in the near future. In this context, DBP has
been designated by the Government as a principal conduit for official foreign
borrowings, the proceeds of which are to be channeled through retail financial
institutions to finance private enterprises.
7.            DBP's  turnaround  in  the  last  two  years  permits  optimism
regarding its future prospects as a wholesale bank. Its indicators of capital
adequacy, liquidity and earnings performance are sound. It has met and, in
some ateas, bettered the targets set jointly by the Bank, the Government and
DBP in the context of the ERL. It has a new management that has demonstrated
a willingness and an ability to take hard decisions; it has developed a
focused strategy and has restructured its organization to implement that
strategy; it is implementing improved controls and procedures.   Of equal
importance, its operations are to be governed by policies designed to ensure
that it avoids the mistakes of the past. Its new Policy Statement provides
for DBP to have: (a) a private sector orientation with autonomy in decision-
making; (b) an interest rate and fees policy that is consistent with prevalent
market rates and that ensures full recovery of all its direct and indirect
costs, including provisions as required, plus an adequate profit margin; (c)
prudent interest rate and maturity match between its assets and liabilities;
and  (d) a debt-equity  ratio not exceeding 5:1.   These market-oriented



- 3 -
policies, implemented by its now more streamlined organization under new
management, should enhance and speed up the integration of DBP into the
market-based financial system of the Philippines.
8.            Project Objectives.  The proposed Project would help improve
credit delivery for industry by assisting DBP to cairy out Its wholesale
banking function of channeling term funds to retail financial institutions;
fill the gap in the supply of term credit to private sector medium and large
industrial enterprises; broaden the scope of financial services available to
them; help promote development of the capital market by introducing, on a
pilot  basis,  the  financing  of equity  and  quasi-equity  investments  by
participating financial institutions (PFIs); support and develop, within DBP
and the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), capabilities to conduct
analytical and policy-oriented studies on industrial subsectors; and assist
the Government in identifying, in selected subsectors, the policy and
institutional framework which would provide the correct signals and support
for these subsectors to become internationally competitive and efficient.
9.            Rationale for Bank Involvement.       The World Bank and the Asian
Development Bank have been the two major sources of foreign exchange for term
lending in the Philippines, and the Bank's continued involvement is crucial
for private industrial investment.  The Bank's financial assistance under the
proposed Project will (a) help the industrial sector 3xploit the opportunities
and meet the challenges provided by the liberalized policy environment and
improved socio-political climate; and (b) build upon the restructuring of DBP
undertaken under the ERL program.  Moreover, by providing funds to DBP to
enable it to carry out its wholesale banking role, the Project would
complement as well as reinforce the FSAL program. The technical assistance
component dealing with industrial subsectors would provide a vehicle for
continuation of the Bank's dialogue with the Government on industrial
restructuring and lay the groundwork for a program of reforms that may be
supported by future subsector operations.
10.           Project Description.    The proposed Project would have the
following components:
(a)   a Line of Credit to DBP for (i) equipment and working capital
financing; (ii) lease financing and (iii) financing of equity and quasi-equity
investments.  DBP would relend the proceeds of the Bank loan to accredited
PFIs in domestic currency at market rates. The PFIs would in turn on-lend the
funds to their subborrowers at freely determined competitive rates.   The
Government would bear the foreign exchange risk in exchange for a market-based
fee payable by DBP.
(b)   Studies,  Training and Technical Assistance to DBP and DTI,
financed through a US$3.5 million equivalent grant from the Japan Grant
Pacility. This component would provide consultant services and training to
enhance DBP's and DTI's capability to conduct studies which would (i) provide
subsector data and analyses to help financial institutions assess individual
projects and (ii) develop proposals for subsectoral restructuring, including
measures to improve the policy and institutional framework.
11.           The total cost of the proposed Project is estimated at US$114.5
million equivalent with a foreign exchange component of US$68.5 million (60Z).
A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.   A

disbursement schedule is presented in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in the Philippines
are given in Schedules C and D, respectively.  The Staff Appraisal Report,
No. 7823-PH dated June, 1989, is being distributed separately.
12.           Agreed Actions.   During    negotiations    agreement    and
understandings were reached on the following:
(a)   DBP would implement its Institutional Development Plan.
(b)   The Operating Policy Guidelines for the proposed Project would
include provisions for (i) a minimum subloan size of US$250,000 and maximum
subloan size of US$6 million except in the case of loan syndications, where
the maximum is US$8 million; (ii) eligible firms in industrial sectors to have
a minimum asset size of P20 million (before financing); (iii) PFIs to
contribute from their own funds at least 10? of each subloan and a minimum
equity contribution by the subborrower to equal 202 of total project cost;
(iv)  subprojects  to  be  in  compliance  with  environmental  laws;  (v)
accreditation criteria for PFIs and (vii) exclusion of DBP as a retailer of
funds under the proposed Project.
(c) The on-lending rate to subborrowers will be determined by PFIs
based on market conditions.
(d) The relending rate from DBP to the PFIs will be based on domestic
market rates and offered to the PFIs on fixed or variable terms.
Ce)   The foreign exchange risk would be assumed by the Government in
exchange for a market-based fee.
13.           Benefits and Risks.       The Bank loan will increase the long-
term resources available for industrial lending. Based on the experience of
previous projects, it is expected that the Bank loan would finance about 45
subprojects which would create around 5,300 jobs.   The project will also
enable DBP to develop the institutional capabilities to embark on the
wholesale banking role envisaged for it under the FSAL program. The technical
assistance for industrial restructuring studies would assist the Government
in designing the reforms that may be necessary for the efficient and
competitive development of enterprises in specific subsectors. These studies
would also provide the analytical basis for developing subsectoral
restructuring strategies.
14.           The major risk is that investment demand may not materialize as
projected. Commitments could slow down because of slower than expected
economic growth or reluctance by financial intermsdiaries in marketing new
financial instruments that would be introduced under the proposed Project.
To mitigate the impact of these uncertainties, the loan amount has been set
in light of conservative demand projections, and the amounts allocated for
lease contracts, equity and quasi-equity instruments are relatively small.
If this allocation does not match actual demand for leasing and equity
investments, the Bank funds would be reallocated for traditional credit
operations.



15.           Recommendation.   I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
