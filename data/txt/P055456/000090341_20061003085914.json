Lessons learned from the project: Clear\n            leadership, willingness to implement reforms at a senior\n            level, and a broad consensus of priorities are prerequisites\n            for smooth project implementation. Investing in capacity\n            building is key to addressing sustainability: once expertise\n            is developed, institutions become empowered to drive and\n            sustain reforms. Project Implementation Units (PIUs) need to\n            be empowered with the appropriate staff, resources, and\n            authority over the elements that directly affect\n            implementation. The provision of adequate technical\n            assistance at the very beginning to build good project\n            management and implementation capacity in the PIU, could\n            have contributed greatly to the success and sustainability\n            of the project. When projects are complex and the experience\n            in managing such projects is limited, it is essential to\n            appoint a project management consultant early on, and to\n            ensure that there is the appropriate buy-in for their\n            recommendations. In complex systems, when using two\n            subcontractors, it is essential to establish a clear\n            reporting structure, and preferably for one contractor to be\n            subordinate to the other, so that ultimate responsibility\n            lies with a single contractor. In the telecommunications\n            sector where technology advancement is a key driver of\n            change, it is necessary to build flexibility into the\n            project. For a more sophisticated or institutionally capable\n            client such as Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, the\n            Consultants Qualification procurement method was useful and\n            provided significant flexibility and speed in hiring\n            consultants to help with important or urgent issues."}, "docdt": "2006-09-29T00:00:00Z"}
