   follows: outcome was moderately satisfactory; risk to the\n            development outcome was negligible low; Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory; and Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Lessons learned from the projects\n            included: 1) when the experience of the implementing agency\n            in managing projects is limited, and especially when such\n            projects are complex, it is essential to appoint a project\n            management consultant early-on to compensate for any gaps in\n            expertise. Most of the difficulties experienced in the\n            implementation of the Telecom Sector Reform Project,\n            involving the modernization of the country's radio\n            frequency and licensing system, were attributable to\n            inability to take decisions and lack of capacity to find\n            solutions to problems; and 2) in a sector where technology\n            advancement is a key driver of change, it is necessary to\n            build sufficient flexibility and foresight into the\n            projects. In the India Telecom Reform Project, flexibility\n            allowed for project realignment during implementation, when\n            required, thus facilitating a redefinition of needs. An\n            example of this was an unexpected need to gain an\n            understanding of television broadcasting signal technology.\n            However, with regard to the need for foresight, a better\n            understanding of the relationship between rapid\n            technological change and project costs could have avoided a\n            serious overestimate of equipment costs, and this would have\n            saved US$ 331,000 in front-end fees, while the Bank would\n            have better utilized part of its loan. Obsolescence also\n            occurs more quickly in the telecommunications field and so\n            it is critical to avoid delays in project completion."}, "docdt": "2008-11-13T00:00:00Z"}
