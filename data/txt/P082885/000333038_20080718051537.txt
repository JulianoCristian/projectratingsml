F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Program Document)
PRSC I

  PRSC I built on the progress made under the PSAC, which was the first programmatic
credit in support of Nicaragua#s PRSP. The PSAC gave emphasis to the areas of human
development and protection of vulnerable populations, by supporting the passage of the
School Autonomy and General Health Laws, among other measures. The implementation
of both of these legislations was supported under PRSC I. In addition, the PSAC laid the
foundations for some of the institutional reforms in the public sector that were heavily
emphasized by PRSC I. Examples of this are the Civil Service Law, which was a prior
action for PRSC I and whose presentation to the National Assembly was supported under
the PSAC. Similarly, while PSAC supported the establishment of the Superintendency of
Pensions, PRSC I supported the appointment of the Superintendent and the partial
reduction of the fiscal impact of the reform. PRSC I also laid the foundations for some of
the reforms conducive to improved competitiveness and broad-based growth, which were
expected to be emphasized by PRSC II following the approval of the second generation
PRSP and upon conclusion of the DPR and the Investment Climate Assessment.

  In dialogue with the administration and other stakeholders, the activities presented in
the PSAC matrix were prioritized and reorganized and formed the basis of PRSC I and
subsequent credits. PRSC I aimed to support the basic premises of macroeconomic
stability and poverty expenditure while focusing on a select subset of measures of the
PRSP, considered priorities to reduce poverty in Nicaragua. PRSC I included measures in
three subject areas, contained in the four Pillars of the PRSP:

  #     Building Public Institutions and Governance (Pillar IV)
  #     Broad-based Growth and Competitiveness (Pillar I)
  #     Human Capital of the Poor and Vulnerable Populations (Pillars II and III)

  PRSC II

  Consistent with the country´s PRSP II poverty-reduction emphasis, the policy reforms
supported under PRSC II aimed to: (a) maintain macroeconomic stability while
protecting poverty spending, (b) promote international trade, (c) promote registration of
indigenous communities titles, (d) ensure fiscal sustainability of legislation governing the
education sector, (e) strengthen public administration by implementing the legislation
establishing a civil service, (f) improve management of public finances, and (g) promote
regular and financially sustainable maintenance of roads.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Macroeconomic and Political Context

After the restoration of peace in Nicaragua in the late 1980s, important economic policy reforms
were carried out in the early 1990s ­fiscal and monetary policy discipline, a major downsizing of
the public sector, significant reductions of trade barriers and the introduction of currency
convertibility. These measures succeeded in restoring greater macroeconomic stability and
opening up the economy to trade. By early 1998, Nicaragua was well on the way to eliminating
its fiscal imbalances and reducing its dependency on foreign aid. This process suffered a setback
in October 1998, when the damages wrought by hurricane Mitch triggered a massive increase in
government spending, supported by generous flows of additional foreign aid. In this context,
Nicaragua reached the decision point under the Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) initiative
in late 2000. As the post-hurricane reconstruction boom came to an end in 2001, however,
economic activity slowed down and the Government was unable to rein in public spending,
resulting in ballooning fiscal deficits and the loss of international reserves. Meanwhile, the
authorities were reluctant to take corrective measures partly on account of political concerns
linked to the approaching presidential elections in November 2001, with the result that the 3rd
year arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) program had to be
abandoned by mid-2001 and corruption became an important item in the public agenda.

In January 2002, a new administration assumed office and moved quickly to shore up the
country's deteriorating public finances, enabling the approval of a new PRGF arrangement with
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in December 2002 and laying the ground for a new wave
of medium-term reforms. The efforts to improve governance conduced to serious ruptures within
the governing party, which undermined the President's political support in the National Assembly
and weakened his capacity to implement reforms. However, the authorities pressed forward with
their reform program with support of the opposition party.

The medium-term macroeconomic framework of the IMF-supported program was designed in a
context of gradually declining aid levels. Implementation of the program began with the reduction
of total public spending (both current and capital) in 2002, first through administrative measures
and subsequently through the modification of the 2002 budget. This resulted in an overall
expenditure cut of 3.7 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), part of which was offset by an
increase in interest obligations and Central Bank losses. These measures were followed by the
implementation of a two-stage tax reform, which had the aim of improving the efficiency and
equity of the tax system, and raising more revenues. In mid-2003, the economy was already
experiencing a modest recovery, with GDP growing from 1 percent in 2002 to an expected 2.3
percent by end- 2003. Inflation was running at around 6 percent on a yearly basis and private
sector credit was expanding. Although both the fiscal and external deficits were sources of
concern, they were both declining. These findings permitted the IMF to successfully conclude its
third PRGF review in October 2003. It was in this context that the Nicaraguan authorities
requested IDA's assistance in the form of fast-disbursing budget support, to help close the
external financing gap and avoid potential interruptions in poverty-reducing actions due to
funding shortfalls.




                                                1

In January 2004, Nicaragua reached the HIPC Completion Point. This debt relief allowed
additional public resources to be redirected to poverty reducing programs, while the reduced debt
overhang served to boost investor confidence, likely contributing to the growth of remittances and
private investment in 2005. The economy continued to perform well, notwithstanding the adverse
pressure from higher oil prices. Growth accelerated to 5.1 percent in 2004 and 4 percent in 2005,
while inflation picked up to 9.6 percent y/y when the rising international oil prices were passed
through to domestic consumers. Strong export growth, as well as higher-than-expected external
flows, facilitated an increase in reserves of about $70 million in 2005 in spite of the larger oil
import bill. The 2005 budget included large public sector wage increases. However, the tax
reform and spending controls helped to reduce the consolidated public sector deficit to an
estimated 2.2 percent of GDP.

After the HIPC milestone was achieved, relations between the Executive power (which had less
than 10 percent of loyal votes in the National Assembly) and the two major political parties,
(which controlled the remaining 90 percent) became very tense. The National Assembly approved
constitutional amendments and a revised 2005 budget that led to the Fund program being off-
track for a few months. These political situation also affected the disbursement of the second
tranche of PRSC I, due to disagreements over the legally correct way of registering property titles
given to indigenous communities (see section 1.6). However, in November 2005 the
constitutional amendments and related legislation were set aside as a result of political
agreements. The Executive Branch was strengthened and the trade agreement DR-CAFTA was
ratified by the National Assembly. Nicaragua's participation in the Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiative (MDRI) was approved by the IMF in December, 2005 and IDA's Board in March, 2006.
These developments led to a strengthened macroeconomic framework that resulted in the
successful completion of the pending PRGF reviews, the extension of that Program until end-
2006 and the disbursement of the second tranche of PRSC I.. While the extra debt relief provided
enhanced the prospects for future fiscal stability, Nicaragua still has a significant domestic debt
(expected to reach 21 percent of GDP in NVP terms by end 2007) that to this day continues to
burden public finances.

Poverty Reduction Strategies


The first PRSP for Nicaragua ­summarized in Box 1- was completed in July 2001. A first PRSP
Progress Report and its assessment were discussed by the Board in November 2002, establishing
a satisfactory track-record of commitment to poverty reduction, and in March 2003 the Board
approved a Programmatic Structural Adjustment Credit (PSAC).1 Although the operation was not
a PRSC because not all analytical and fiduciary work had been completed at the time, it was an
important precedent to the PRSC series, as it already laid some triggers for subsequent policy-
based lending.

                                          Box 1: Summary of PRSP

 Broad-based Economic Growth and Structural Reform (Pillar I): Achieve macroeconomic
stabilization and economic growth. Growth rate projected to grow at 4.2% on average over 2001-2005.
Emphasis on agricultural expansion directed to rural poverty. Prudent fiscal and monetary policy,
privatization of public utilities and strengthening of financial sector.

 Human Capital Investment (Pillar II): Improve coverage and quality of services in education,
health, nutrition, population, water and sanitation.

 Protection of Vulnerable Groups (Pillar III): Increase access of vulnerable groups, especially
women heads of households, to basic social services through financial incentives, local solidarity and
transfer of responsibilities to communal leaders, civil society organizations and local governments. Protect
social programs from natural disasters, fiscal adjustment and external shocks.

 Good Governance and Institutional Development (Pillar IV): Improve public financial
management, increase access to information, modernize public procurement, modernize the penal code,
judicial process and the CGR as well as regulations and other public servants so as to make Government
more transparent and trustworthy.

 Three cross-cutting themes: Environmental protection, social equity, and decentralization of
decision-making and provision of public services.


A second PRSP progress report of PRSP I was discussed by the Bank's Board in January 2004.
At the same time, the authorities were working on a revised PRSP, whose outlines were presented
to the donor community at the Consultative Group Meeting in October 2003. The Government of
Nicaragua completed a National Development Plan 2005-2009 in November 2005 and presented
it to the Boards of the IMF and IDA in January 2006 as the country's second generation Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP II). The PRSP II (Box 2) built on its predecessor, but put more
emphasis on economic and employment growth than the earlier PRSP, which focused more on
measures to improve social indicators.

           Box 2 : Summary of PRSP II Key Results and Objectives by Strategic Areas

                                    Overall key results 2005-2009

  1. Reach an annual rate of growth of the economy of 5 percent while sustaining macroeconomic
      stability.
  2. Attain the 2009 milestones for reaching the MDGs, emphasizing extreme poverty reduction.
  3. Double the value of exports between 2004 and 2010.
  4. Increase the cement-brick road network by 1,200 km.
  5. Attract additional foreign private investments of US$130 million annually.

                                    Objectives by Strategic Areas

       Economic growth for poverty reduction (Area I): Sustain macroeconomic stability and
       economic growth. Emphasis is on improving the investment climate by making reforms to the
       regulatory framework for businesses to decrease bureaucratic costs, improve property rights,
       broaden financial services, promote exports, support clusters, increase the use of technology for
       agricultural production and promote environmentally sustainable growth.
       Human capital development and social protection (Area II): Improve coverage and quality of
       services in education and health, with an added focus on technical training and labor conditions,
       including child labor. On social protection, emphasis is on improving institutional coordination
       by consolidating multiple projects into key programs to increase access of vulnerable groups to
       basic social services.
       Productive and social public infrastructure (Area III): Increase coverage and quality of
       infrastructure to support economic growth and attain the MDG targets. Emphasis for productive
       infrastructure is on roads, ports and energy. Emphasis for social infrastructure is on education,
       health, water and sanitation, and housing.
       Governance and state reforms (Area IV): Strengthen good governance by emphasizing the
       reform and modernization of the justice system, respect to human rights, guarantee public safety,
       and support participation of civil society. Improve public financial management and modernize
       public procurement to increase efficiency and efficacy of the state, and to deepen transparency
       and accountability. Implement a national decentralization strategy to enhance the provision of
       public services while maintaining fiscal stability.
       Macroeconomic Stability (Area V): Consolidate macroeconomic stability and medium- and
       long-term sustainability while maintaining poverty-reducing expenditures, and increasingly align
       expenditures with the priorities of the PRSP II. Strengthen tax administration by amending the
       tax code, stop deterioration of the pension system, extend the scope of the financial
       administration law, advance decentralization of public spending consistent with fiscal neutrality
       and devolution of responsibilities to the local level, and tackle the energy sector financial losses
       by tariff adjustments while avoiding distortionary interventions.



Country Assistance Strategy

PRSC I was prepared a key element of the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FY03-
05 approved by the Board in March 2003 (Box 3). The focus on programmatic lending aimed to
support the implementation of the medium-term reform agenda through increased donor
coordination, a focus on results and more coordinated and medium term planning while ensuring
a stable macro economic environment.




                                                     4

                           Box 3: Main elements of the FY03-05 CAS

      1. Increased reliance on programmatic lending. The bulk of IDA assistance provided
          through PSAC and PRSC in order to enhance Government ownership and improve
          donor coordination.
      2. A limited number of additional IDA operations of a technical assistance nature to help
          build capacity to implement specific measures in the PRSP and selected small projects
          to test innovative approaches to poverty reduction for further replication.
      3. IDA resource envelope for FY03-FY05 equal to US$ 120 million in the base case and
          additional US$ 40 million in the high case.
      4. IFC and MIGA will emphasize support to PRSP first pillar (growth).
      5. Significant risks includes difficulties in seeing approval of key legislation, weak
          judicial system could undermine private sector confidence, weak financial and
          institutional capacity, fragile banking system and high levels of domestic debt and
          vulnerability to natural disasters and terms of trade shocks.


The CAS allocated US$ 120 million of IDA assistance to Nicaragua over the period FY03-FY05
in the base case and an additional US$ 40 million in the high case lending scenario. After
approval of the CAS, these initial allocations were increased by around US$ 45 million over the
FY04-FY05 period, due to the relatively good performance of Nicaragua among IDA borrowers.
The Nicaraguan authorities requested that US$ 35 million of the additional IDA allocation be
assigned to PRSC I. IDA agreed to this request, provided the operation was designed in two
tranches and contained additional policy measures not originally envisaged under the PSAC. The
larger allocation to PRSC I was in line with the rationale for increased programmatic lending, as
set out in the CAS. The PRSC I (now US$ 70 million in total) was thus prepared in two tranches
to ensure satisfactory implementation of the reform program in a difficult political environment.
Under the high case lending scenario of the CAS, provided the triggers for the high case and the
triggers indicated in Schedule 2 of PRSC I were met, this operation would be followed by PRSC
II (US$ 25 million).

The Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for FY06-07 was designed as an extension of the FY03-05 CAS.
The interim nature of the strategy was aimed at aligning the CAS cycle with the country's
election cycle. In this context, the PRSC II was a focal instrument intended to permit the
Government to proceed on a development path that emphasized increased economic activity and
employment growth for poverty reduction. Although the ISN suggests that new budget support
could have been undermined by the growing political uncertainties that destabilized the country
during 2005, the Nicaraguan Government secured a stronger political mandate in 2006, as
discussed at the beginning of section 1.1 of this ICR.

The ISN amounts and allocation criteria were set apart from the traditional scenario-based
approach and, instead, proposed a matrix of decisions for IDA assistance based on the observance
of certain criteria. Hence, a Second Poverty Reduction Credit was only to be proposed once the
criteria for "excellent" performance were met. Under this approach, a rating of "excellent"
performance would be granted if the country had a satisfactory macroeconomic situation in place,
the first PRSC had disbursed its second tranche, PRSC II performance benchmarks were met, and
the Board had reviewed the JSAN of the PRSP II, all by mid-2006. These criteria were fulfilled
by mid-2006, with the exception of a few PRSC II prior actions, which were accomplished by the
third quarter of 2006.




                                                  5

In addition to being aligned with IDA's assistance strategy to Nicaragua, the design of PRSC I
benefited from the following prior analytical and fiduciary work:

    · Public Expenditure Review, Report NO. 23095-NI, December 2001
    · Poverty Assessment, Report No. 26128-NI, (June, 2003)
    · CFAA, Report No. 27922-NI, (January 13, 2003)
    · CPAR, Report No. 25918-NI, June 11 2003

In addition, PRSC II took into account two additional reports:

    · Development Policy Review, Report No. 29115-NI, (December 3, 2004)
    · PFM Performance Report

Donor Coordination and Consultations with Civil Society

Coordination with the IMF

PRSC I was prepared after numerous consultations with the IMF on the amount, timing and
content of the operation, and followed the IMF's approval of a PRGF. Further, throughout 2004
and 2005 the Bank collaborated very closely with the IMF, including Bank participation in IMF
missions and reliance on each other's findings in order to avoid duplication and ensure
consistency of advice to the authorities. The collaboration was particularly close in the areas of
pension reform, decentralization, public financial management, civil service reform and the
energy sector.

Co financing

German financial cooperation through KfW, helped co-finance the PRSC I's first tranche with
four million euros. Following IDA's disbursement of PRSC I's second tranche, KfW disbursed
another 2 million euros later in 2006. As part of this joint effort, KfW included the prior actions
related to the water sector and municipal investment planning, as well as participated in every
stage of the operation's processing and supervision. Given this positive experience, the German
Government decided to also co-finance PRSC II with 4 million euros, again through KfW.

Budget Support Group (BSG)

At the time PRSC I was being prepared, a Budget Support Group (BSG), comprising nine donors
which provided or were considering providing policy-based lending to Nicaragua, was formed in
the interest of coordination. The group's first joint Performance Assessment Matrix (PAM) took
as its basis the PRSC matrix and a few additional actions or indicators with a more political
content. In May 2005, the Bank and members of the donor community which provide budget
support to Nicaragua, signed a Joint-Financing Arrangement (JFA), intended to help the
Government to become more effective in implementing its policies and upgrading its institutions.
The JFA's Performance Assessment Matrix (PAM) facilitated the monitoring and evaluation of
the Government's policy actions. The Bank's participation in the BSG reflects the importance
being given to policy-based lending and to harmonizing efforts, especially in the areas of public
financial management as well as overall information sharing on budgetary support. PRSC II's
preparation was consistent with the agreed PAM and its monitoring and evaluation provisions
were especially closely coordinated with the BSG.

Other donors and Consultations with Civil Society

During preparation of both PRSC I and II care was taken to avoid duplication with IDB's policy-
based operations. Other donors were also consulted repeatedly during the preparation process,
through the budget support group and a preparation workshop. In addition, a number of
workshops and dialogues were held with government authorities, donors and civil society.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

PRSC I

PRSC I built on the progress made under the PSAC, which was the first programmatic credit in
support of Nicaragua's PRSP. The PSAC gave emphasis to the areas of human development and
protection of vulnerable populations, by supporting the passage of the School Autonomy and
General Health Laws, among other measures. The implementation of both of these legislations
was supported under PRSC I. In addition, the PSAC laid the foundations for some of the
institutional reforms in the public sector that were heavily emphasized by PRSC I. Examples of
this are the Civil Service Law, which was a prior action for PRSC I and whose presentation to the
National Assembly was supported under the PSAC. Similarly, while PSAC supported the
establishment of the Superintendence of Pensions, PRSC I supported the appointment of the
Superintendent and the partial reduction of the fiscal impact of the reform. PRSC I also laid the
foundations for some of the reforms conducive to improved competitiveness and broad-based
growth, which were expected to be emphasized by PRSC II, following the approval of the second
generation PRSP and upon conclusion of the DPR and the Investment Climate Assessment.

In dialogue with the administration and other stakeholders, the activities presented in the PSAC
matrix were prioritized and reorganized and formed the basis of PRSC I and subsequent credits.
PRSC I aimed to support the basic premises of macroeconomic stability and poverty expenditure
while focusing on a select subset of measures of the PRSP, considered priorities to reduce poverty
in Nicaragua. PRSC I and PRSC II included measures in three subject areas, contained in the four
Pillars of the PRSP, with PRSC I giving greater emphasis to the first area:

    · Building Public Institutions and Governance (Pillar IV)
    · Broad-based Growth and Competitiveness (Pillar I)
    · Human Capital of the Poor and Vulnerable Populations (Pillars II and III)

The key indicators for PRSC I are presented in section 3.2 of this ICR.

PRSC II

Consistent with the country PRSP II poverty-reduction emphasis, the policy reforms supported
under PRSC II aimed to: (a) maintain macroeconomic stability while protecting poverty spending,
(b) promote international trade, (c) promote registration of indigenous communities titles, (d)
ensure fiscal sustainability of legislation governing the education sector, (e) strengthen public
administration by implementing the legislation establishing a civil service, (f) improve
management of public finances, and (g) promote regular and financially sustainable maintenance
of roads.

The key indicators for PRSC II are presented in section 3.2 of this ICR.

1.6 Other significant changes

One of the actions for the release of the second tranche of PRSC I was:

       The Borrower has provided the Association evidence that it has completed
       demarcation, titling and registration of at least 5 indigenous territories in the
       Borrower's Bosawas region.

This action was partially completed and a waiver was granted. Nevertheless, in order to
reflect the partial completion of the overall policy actions, the amount of the second tranche
disbursement was reduced by SDR 3.5 million.2

Titling of indigenous lands is key to poverty reduction in Nicaragua, as it would lead to increased
equity, environmental sustainability, and economic growth. Nevertheless, this policy has had a
long and complex history in the country. With the support of PRSC I, the authorities partially
achieved the objective of improving the security of land tenure of the most vulnerable groups. As
the tranche release memorandum noted, whereas key implementation steps, such as demarcation
and significant progress in titling, had taken effect, registration experienced delays. Every stage
of the process required consensus and proved to be more complex, technically, legally and
institutionally, and more time-consuming than originally envisaged. The process of attaining
recognized land rights by the indigenous communities, while avoiding on-going and future
disputes, was fully supported by the authorities and acknowledged by IDA. The additional efforts
and time spent ­which largely explain the delay in the disbursement of the second tranche-, were
critical to maintain support of the process and avoid setting negative precedents for the titling and
registration of the remaining territories.

By the time PRSC II was brought to the Board, this decision had proven wise, as that subsequent
operation included as prior action the registration of the first ever indigenous property title in
Nicaragua, thus bringing access to communal land rights, for the first time in the history of
Nicaragua, to indigenous communities. Consequently, it represented a historical precedent
disproving those voices that found practical and legal obstacles to this achievement. The correct
titling of the first territories is crucial to the sustainable attainment of secure land tenure so as to
avoid setting contestable precedents.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance

PRSC I was successful in supporting the adopting and implementation of key policy reforms as
laid-out in the government's first PRSP. Table 1 summarizes the amount and dates of tranche
disbursements, while tables 2 and 3 summarize the current status of policy actions supported by
PRSC I and II, respectively.

                                         2005



The policy matrix for disbursement of the first tranche of PRSC I contained ten prior actions, all
of which were completed before Board consideration of the credit. As table 2 shows, of these ten
actions seven are considered to have maintained high positive impact, two maintain moderate
impact and one has had low impact.

The policy matrix for disbursement of the second tranche of PRSC I also contained ten prior
actions. Most of these were completed in 2004 and the first half of 2005, but the action related to
registration of titles given to indigenous communities took longer than expected, as discussed in
section 1.6. Even though this lead to delay the disbursement of the second tranche and to reduce
its amount, the final result of the policy actions was mostly positive. As table 2 shows, of these
ten actions four are considered to have maintained high positive impact, five have maintained
moderate impact and one became irrelevant.

Regarding PRSC II, this was a single-tranche operation and all of the prior actions were fulfilled
before the Board approved the credit. Hence, shortly after Board approval on November 7, 2006
the entire credit was disbursed on January 10, 2007. Of the eight prior actions contained in the
operation's policy matrix, six are considered to have had and currently maintain high positive
impact and two maintain moderate impact (Table 3).

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

Two main factors affected program implementation: a) political and legal discrepancies within
branches of government and b) financing shortages. These did not cause pernicious effects, as
they were duly surmounted during implementation, but they did require proactive actions and
caused some delays, as explained below.

a)           Political and legal discrepancies among branches of government

These discrepancies affected mainly the execution of policy actions related to the registration of
property titles for indigenous territories, as explained in section 1.6

b)           Financing shortages

Both PRSCs included support for the implementation of the School Autonomy Regime as prior
actions. This Regime, which had been approved by law a few years before, had the purpose of
granting increase autonomy in decision making to local councils of teachers, parents and
Education Ministry personnel, as well as transfers form the education budget to local schools that
met qualification criteria. The School Autonomy Law mandated the progressive incorporation of
public schools until all of the country's public schools were covered by 2006. By the time PRSC I
was being prepared, 3,033 schools had been incorporated out of a total of 6,500 public schools,
but there had been no new incorporations in the last couple of years. The Bank sought to support
the further implementation of this Law, which was serving as a model in other countries. Hence,
PRSC I included as a prior action the incorporation of 500 additional schools to the School
Autonomy Regime. However, once this condition was negotiated, it was called to the Bank's
attention that incorporation of new schools into the autonomy regime carried a fiscal cost. The
Bank and the borrower took proactive action to address this situation and the Swiss Cooperation
agreed to provide bridge financing to the National Treasury and be latter reimbursed with the
proceeds of the first tranche disbursement. The lesson was latter taken into account and the
authorities made the necessary budgetary provisions before the disbursement of the second
tranche of PRSC I and the single tranche of PRSC II, which included as prior actions further
incorporation of schools into the autonomy regime.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

M&E design

During the appraisal of PRSC I, indicators were carefully chosen not only so that they would
provide meaningful guidance to both the Government and IDA teams on the impact on the
ground, especially on the poor, of the proposed policies, but also so as to make sure that the
indicators were regularly produced in the country. During negotiations, reporting tables were
agreed, as well as precise definitions of each indicator, clarifications and means of verification,
and these were summarized in a matrix attached as a technical annex (annex 4) to the minutes of
negotiations.

Moreover, the accompanying technical assistance operation (PRSTAC, Credit No. 3877-NI)
included support to prepare these tables,

M&E Implementation



                                                   16

In spite of these efforts, for many indicators the data was not provided on a timely basis. This can
be easily seen from the M&E tables annexed to the supervision aide-memoires. The reason given
was that the agency in charge of collecting the data ­the Technical Secretariat of the Presidency-
could not obtain the information needed from the other sector agencies involved in policy
implementation and data collection. In a few cases, for instance the indicator of index of non-
traditional exports, the indicator was abandoned with the change in government authorities,
showing that it was not an indicator commonly used and agreed. Similarly, in the case of the
indicator related to the fiscal savings arising from changes to the Education Law supported by
PRSC II, the government suggested a quantitative indicator, but it seemed to have little technical
basis and it was later clear that it is not a broadly known indicator, and, hence, the ICR team was
not able to obtain its current value.

However, this first series of PRSCs and its accompanying technical assistance operation served to
raise awareness of the importance of establishing indicators to judge progress and monitor them
regularly. As such, a web site to monitor not just PRSC indicators, but also PAM indicators and,
more broadly, PRSP indicators, was established (see www.sinasid.gob.ni) and subsequent
operations, including the preparation of a new PRSC series, are taking this dimension into
account and relying on the work done in the context of the first PRSC series and the PRSTAC.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation:

A follow-up operation, PRSC III, was already envisioned during preparation of PRSC II.
Although precise triggers for these subsequent operation were not agreed because, during
discussion at the Regional Operations Committee (ROC) meeting, it was already anticipated that
this subsequent operation would fall under a new government period and, hence, priorities may
change. Hence, the ROC decided that PRSC II would close the series3 and a new series would
start with PRSC III. On the other hand, it was also agreed during internal discussions that certain
actions supported by the first PRSC series needed to have continuity and, at the same time, by the
time of PRSC II preparations some new policy priorities were already starting to emerge. Hence,
Box 5 of the PRSC II Project Document provided some areas of expected progress for future
PRSCs.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The priority given to poverty reduction under a stable macroeconomic framework, the reliance on
budget support as an instrument for foreign assistance to support it and the coordinated
assessment of priority policy actions and evaluation of progress ­all three of which are basic
elements of objectives, design and implementation of the first PRSC series- are still priorities of
the current government administration and the donor community supporting Nicaragua. This is
clear by the renewed commitment to an IMF program, IDA's on-going preparation of a new series



3 The PSAC (Credit No. 3736-NI), although conceptually part of this first series of operations, was not
formally part of it. The new DPL policy and corresponding policy on a single ICR for programmatic DPLs
had not been approved by the time PSAC closed. Hence, a separate ICR for PSAC was prepared in June,
2004 (Report No. 28321-NI).

of PRSCs and the continued operation of the Budget Support Group. Consequently, the new
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) considered by the Board in October 2007 foresees assigning
a significant share (42 percent) of IDA resources over FY08-12 to policy-based lending, and the
possible scope of policies to be supported by the new series of PRSCs is also building-up on the
government efforts supported by the first series of PRSCs.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

The achievement of PRSC I Program Development Objectives is considered satisfactory.
Table 4 provides the basis for this conclusion, namely: i) all of the objectives, as stated in the
Program Document, were satisfactorily achieved, ii) most of the target indicators were reached
and iii) in many cases there was a direct linkage between the PRSC I-supported policy actions
and the achievement of the development objective. The sub-ratings for macroeconomic stability
and protection of poverty expenditures, and for institution building and governance are
satisfactory. The sub-rating for human capital of the poor is moderately satisfactory, because,
even though two of the indicators were achieved, they deteriorated subsequently. The sub-rating
for broad-based growth is highly satisfactory given the data for the results indicators.

The biggest disappointment has been the little impact on the proportion of people living in
extreme poverty. Yet, this finding needs to be mitigated with two considerations: i) the absence of
direct policy actions foreseen in the country's PRSP that would lead to this outcome and ii) the
time it takes for extreme poverty to be reduced vis-à-vis the life span of a PRSC series. In


                                                 21

addition, as reflected in the latest draft Poverty Assessment4, the poverty gap has decreased, which
implies that even if government policies did not result in a substantial share of the extreme poor
jumping the extreme poverty line, a fair proportion of them moved closer to it. This leads to
believe that if the process of inclusive growth continues, Nicaragua is posed to make accelerated
gains in reducing extreme poverty.

The achievement of PRSC II Program Development Objectives is considered moderately
satisfactory. Table 5 provides the basis for this conclusion, namely: i) only three of the five
objectives are considered have been either satisfactorily or moderately satisfactorily met, ii) only
five of the ten results targets, as stated in the Program Document, were achieved and one almost
achieved, and iii) although all the results indicators were either directly or indirectly linked to a
PRSC II-supported policy action, many of these were not prior actions. Yet, the specific
indicators linked to prior actions supported by PRSC II were mostly achieved and, in many cases,
overachieved (see data sheet at the beginning of this report and footnote, 5 below). The problem
is one of design in that the choice of PDO indicators did not correspond closely to the agreed
policy actions, especially to the prior actions triggering disbursement, Hence, the operation is
considered to have been successful in achieving what it set out to achieve, although moderately so.
A lesson to be drawn for the design of future PRSCs is that the choice of indicators for assessing
achievement of the development objectives should be directly linked to prior actions supported by
the respective operation.

Within this overall rating, the sub-rating for governance and state reform is satisfactory because
two out of three targets have been achieved and, in the case of coverage of SIGFA, for which no
data was reported, the country team has evidence elsewhere that there has been continued
progress. The sub-rating for economic growth is moderately satisfactory because the
administrative simplification efforts have yielded very positive results as evidenced, among
others, by Nicaragua's improved rating in Doing Business. Even though the target for total
exports was not met ­and it was probably too ambitious- exports to the US increased
considerably after the subscription of the DR-CAFTA trade agreement. The sub-rating for public
investment for productive development of human capital is also moderately satisfactory because,
even though the data for some indicators were not reported in the context of preparation of this
ICR, two of the three indicators show satisfactory progress (although in the case of rural
electrification there is no evidence to judge if the improvements were sustained), while in the case
of the rural telecommunications indicator the country team has evidence elsewhere that this
indicator has progressed mostly satisfactorily. The sub-rating for development of human capital
and social protection is moderately unsatisfactory, because two of the results indicators were not
achieved and the one that was achieved deteriorated subsequently. The sub-rating for
macroeconomic stability and protection of poverty expenditures is unsatisfactory, given the
deterioration in the corresponding results indicators, even though macroeconomic stability per-se
was maintained as reflected, among others, in the continued on-track status of the PRGF program.

This conclusion is very surprising because, since PRSC II was a single tranche operation and was
designed so that all of its prior actions were achieved before Board presentation, the indicators
chosen were either already known or very close to their expected values given the closeness of

the expected outcome date.5 Indeed, the only ISR on record for this operation (filed in March
2007) rated it highly satisfactory for achievement of the Program Development Objectives, even
though the same indicators were used to judge progress. The reason for this discrepancy is that
the data reported by the authorities at the time that ISR was prepared has been revised and new
data has been provided for the preparation of this ICR.6

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate risk of maintenance of PDO achievements.

The justification for this assessment is provided in Table 6. Since the objectives of both
operations were very similar and were supported by a continuum of policy actions contained in
both operations, the sustainability risk is assessed jointly and the rating is common to both.

Table 6 - Assessment of Sustainability of PDO Achievements

 PRSC I and II Objectives                 Risk of Sustainability of PDO - Comments
 Protect poverty reduction                This outcome is likely to be sustained. The current government
 expenditure, while maintaining           is committed to macroeconomic stability and maintaining an
 macroeconomic stability                  IMF program. Poverty is an enhanced priority and coordinated
                                          budget support through the BSG is likely to monitor closely
                                          not only the level of poverty expenditures, but improve its
                                          quality so as to achieve greater impact on poverty reduction.

                                          Nevertheless, the continued challenges posed by the
                                          decentralization policy, the pension system and the high
                                          internal debt will need to be closely monitored and addressed.
 Improve quality of public sector         Of the two major areas supported by the PRSC series ­
 employment and transparency and          improved public financial management and civil service
 efficiency   in   public    financial    reform- the first is hihgly likely to be maintained, as
 management and procurement.              demostrated by the continued adherence to the Financial
                                          Management Law and improvement in related indicators. The
                                          civil service reform can be more vulnerable to political
                                          development, which are difficult to forecast, but as of the
                                          writing of this ICR progress has been maintained.




5This issue is common to all single-tranche DPLs and, hence, the added value of the ex-post assessment
provided by the ICR needs to take this into account.

6Two other issues need to be noted in this context. The first is that the PDO indicators in the ISR do not
correspond to the PDO indicators in the present ICR. The PDO indicators in the ISR were incorrectly
entered from the program document. For this reason, the PDO indicators in the Data Sheet of the present
ICR differ from the PDO indicators in section 3 of the ICR, as the data sheet is generated automatically by
the operations portal. For the purposes of assessing progress of PRSC-II in this ICR we have chosen to
adhere to the PDOs and their indicators as per the program document. Secondly, the data used for judging
progress in this ICR is the latest data reported by the Nicaraguan authorities (in November 2007) for the
specific purpose of preparing this report. They differ, in some cases substantially, from data provided in
other Bank documents. Had the data used in other Bank documents been used for this ICR, the results
would have been better.

 Improve quality and coverage of  Progress achieved in this area with PRSC support is unlikely
 social services                  to be sustained. In education, the policy supported by the
                                  operations was abandoned, since the current government
                                  considers the autonomous schools a failed model. The
                                  situation in the water sector is problematic, mostly due to the
                                  financial troubles of the state company, ENACAL, the social
                                  difficulty in raising tariffs and technical and financial
                                  impediments to reducing water loses. In health there has been
                                  very little progress with the implementation of the Health Law,
                                  supported by the PRSC series. The same can be said of the
                                  Social Protection Policy and Action Plan supported by the
                                  PRSC series.

                                  This, however, does not imply that different policies aimed at
                                  improving coverage and quality of social services may not be
                                  introduced. This will only be known once the present
                                  government finalizes its new PRSP in mid-2008, but the
                                  current government has many political incentives and donor
                                  support to advance in this area. The continuous engagement of
                                  the Bank -through a new PRSC series and investment
                                  operations foreseen in the CPS- as well as of other donors
                                  participating in the BSG, will be critical for this purpose.
 Promote inclusive economic       Achievements supported by the PRSC series being evaluated
 growth                           will probably be sustained. The new government has indicated
                                  its support for a favorable climate for private sector
                                  development. The on-going implementation of the DR-
                                  CAFTA treaty provides additional support to this assessment.
 Improve public infrastructure    The developments supported by the first PRSC series in public
 needed for economic growth       roads and telecommunications are likely to be sustained. The
                                  FOMAV Law has been operating very successfully and the
                                  FOMAV has been receiving the necessary financial resources.
                                  Further, the Bank is prepared to continue its support in this
                                  area through investment operations, as reflected in the latest
                                  CPS. Coverage of telecommunications services has increased
                                  and prices have gone down as a result of increased
                                  competition, so that consumers are likely to defend the
                                  achievements so far. In electricity the situation is more
                                  vulnerable, as there are continued structural deficiencies,
                                  discussed also in the CPS and in the latest IGR for Nicaragua.

                                  New challenges are arising, however, especially in the
                                  electricity sector, as a result of the rising price of oil, and in the
                                  transport sector, where recent natural disasters have caused
                                  major damages to the existing road network. In telecom, water
                                  and electricity, but specially in the later two, another challenge
                                  is the need for strengthening the current regulatory regime, as
                                  discussed in the IGR.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry




                                              24

Rating: Highly Satisfactory for PRSC I. Satisfactory for PRSC II.

A Quality at Entry Assessment of PRSC I was done in September 2005 by the Quality Assurance
Group and found Bank performance to be highly satisfactory. The corresponding report of the
panel provides justification for this assessment.

PRSC II took less than seven months to prepare, from Concept Review on April 24, 2006 to
Board approval, on a non-objection basis, on November 7, 2006. The Credit was signed shortly
after, on November 29, 2006, was declared effective only a month later and was fully disbursed
only 12 days later. It encountered no delays nor implementation problems whatsoever as both the
Bank and Government teams had incorporated into its design the lessons learned during
implementation of PRSC I, particularly with regards to financing shortages (see section 2.2) and
making politically-informed decision on what policy actions to incorporate, especially in the area
of property rights (see section 1.6).

M&E design was adequate and relevant, but also mindful of data availability. Technical
assistance from the accompanying PSTAC was sought to accompany implementation of PRSC
policy actions. Yet, there were significant shortcomings in the timeliness and quality of data, so
this is an area for improvement. And, lastly, preparation of this ICR uncovered a design flaw in
the choice of PDO indicators, as discussed in section 3.3.

Donor coordination and consultations with civil society were given a high priority during the
preparation of both operations, as explained in section 1. However, there were virtually no
consultations with potential beneficiaries, except through their representatives in civil society
organizations.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory for PRSC I. Moderately Satisfactory for PRSC II.

Nine formal supervision missions were undertaken for PRSC I, at regular 3 month intervals,
between February 2004 and March 2006. As reflected in the respective aide-memoires, in each
supervision mission the Bank team addressed: i) the status of prior actions, ii) the status of
accompanying policy actions contributing to overall development objectives and iii) the status of
indicators.

In addition, the TTL was based in the field and had access to high-level authorities, donors and
other stakeholders in her dual role as Country Manager. This allowed a virtually continuous
supervision of developments and close coordination with donors in the field and IMF missions.
Furthermore, the PRSC team included the task managers of every investment project and AAA
active in Nicaragua at the time, so long as their tasks were related to policy actions. Hence, their
respective SMOs in every mission included supervision of the corresponding PRSC-supported
policy action.

The operation closing date was delayed by 12 months due to implementation problems related to
registration of indigenous land titles (see section 1.6), but these were outside bank control.
Nevertheless, the Bank took extremely proactive actions to address this issue, including:

    · Convened several meetings among all involved parties (congressmen, Supreme Court
         justices, high authorities of the Secretariat of the Presidency and the Ministry of Finance,
         officials of Cadastre and Registry offices, lead counterparts of the accompanying Bank-


                                                  25

        financed land project, leaders of the indigenous communities and others). These meetings
        were convened at the request of these authorities for the Bank to act as a mediator in
        trying to achieve consensus.
    · The accompanying technical assistance project held several meetings with leaders of the
        indigenous populations, in the indigenous regions.
    · The LAC VP and LC2 Country Director held a meeting at the highest level (President of
        the Republic) seeking a solution to the impasse.

The issue was eventually solved half-way, as explained in section 1.6, but these proactive actions
were essential to a successful project closing and the preparation of the following PRSC.
Moreover, they were also essential to the achievement of the first registration of an indigenous
property title in Nicaragua, paving the way for the future registrations, even after PRSC II closed.

As for supervision of PRSC II, since it was one-tranche operation supervision was limited to
ensuring that the credit was declared effective and disbursed shortly after Board approval and this
was ensured by the key dates mentioned above. In order to asses the sustainability and effects of
the policy actions, a few months later indicators of progress were sought and an ISR was duly
filed on the basis of data reported by the government. Nevertheless, the ISR was incorrectly filled
as it reported results indicators for prior actions instead of PDO indicators. The Bank team
participated in all IMF and BSG meetings after PRSC II was approved to ensure consistency of
donor actions.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory for PRSC I. Moderately satisfactory for PRSC II.

Overall Bank performance is judged satisfactory taking into account: i) its performance in
ensuring quality at entry (see section 5.1.a), ii) its performance during supervision (see section
5.1.b) and iii) the final outcomes (see section 3).

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory for both PRSC I and II.

Government performance is considered satisfactory for both operations. The government named
formally a task team for each operation, led by an influential government authority. This leader
was also the main technical counterpart for IMF missions, thus ensuring coherence and
complementarity of both programs. The task team was small, yet included a representative of
every agency involved in the implementation of agreed policy actions. The presence of this task
team during negotiations, especially in identifying indicators and in spite of their shortcomings,
allowed these negotiations to proceed smoothly. All the members demonstrated a high
commitment to the operation by putting long hours of work.

At the policy decision-making level, the authorities also demonstrated their strong ownership of
the operation by systematically adopting all policy actions, except one. This is particularly
remarkable in the case of PRSC I, which contained no less than 20 policy actions, a large number,
but probably justified by the large amount of resources involved and the two-tranche design.




                                                 26

There were minor shortcomings in the provision of data for some indicators and the definition of
some others, as noted above.

In the case of PRSC I, the borrower requested support for project preparation from a PHRD trust
fund. The task team channeled the request to the trust fund committee and obtained US$ 400,000
(PHRD No. JPN 52689), entirely borrower executed. The borrower spent US$ 267,464.76 and
cancelled the remainder. These resources served to contract mostly consultant services that
helped in the preparation of the first operation in the series.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Agency                          ICR Rating        Explanation / Comments

Ministry of Finance             Highly            This was the lead agency. It was very forthcoming
                                satisfactory      whenever problems arose and sought solutions both
                                                  within the government, other public agencies and with
                                                  the Bank. It provided all the information requested
                                                  and was available for meetings.
Ministry of the Economy         Satisfactory      It implemented the actions related to economic growth
                                                  in a very professional way. It provided indicator data
                                                  timely and accurately. The only drawback is a dubious
                                                  definition of an indicator related to non-traditional
                                                  exports.
Ministry of Education           Highly            It showed a strong commitment to the School
                                satisfactory      Autonomy Regime and was proactive in finding
                                                  solutions to the financial problems entailed by its
                                                  implementation. It provided all information requested
                                                  in a timely way and in great detail.
Ministry of Health              Moderately        Although it did implement the policy actions
                                satisfactory      envisaged, it was not very proactive in suggesting
                                                  stronger policy measures and the results indicators
                                                  reflect this.
Ministry of Transport           Satisfactory      This agency showed strong commitment to the
                                                  operation of the FOMAV, but it did not take proactive
                                                  action in approaching the authorities in the Ministry
                                                  of Finance and in the legislative, who were key to
                                                  agree on the changes to the FOMAV Law that would
                                                  allow the fund to obtain sustainable resources.
                                                  Eventually those problems were solved by the efforts
                                                  of the Ministry of Finance in approaching legislators.
Technical Secretariat of the    Moderately        Although this agency participated in all meetings, it
Presidency                      unsatisfactory    often questioned the agreed policy measures, was not
                                                  well informed of the status of agreed policy actions
                                                  and was disappointing in obtaining, systematizing and
                                                  providing data for the agreed indicators. Moreover,
                                                  the discrepancies between the agency and the
                                                  legislative power acted against the achievement of the
                                                  program's development objectives.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Ratings: Satisfactory

This rating is justified by the explanations given in sections 5.2.a and 5.2.b.


                                                  27

6. Lessons Learned

Basic lesson learned

Even if all prior actions are met, especially in the case of one-tranche operations where all such
actions are met before Board presentation, and yet the number and share of people living in
poverty is not reduced. This leads to three conclusions. First, the impact of prior actions on the
welfare of the poor should include analysis of welfare changes across the distribution of the poor,
as there might be impacts not necessarily reflected in a reduction in the poverty rate. Second,
policy measures supported by PRSCs may take a longer time to produce effects on the number
and share of poor people than ex-post evaluations of these operations might lead to believe. We
should have a better understanding of the timing and mechanisms through which these policies
affect the poor. In some cases, these policies lay the ground for growth to affect poverty, although
by themselves they may not have a direct and immediate effect on the poverty rate. Lastly, policy
actions may not have been relevant to reduce poverty. Since it is Bank policy to support
Government-designed PRSPs, the analysis of these should be reinforced to highlight those
policies that, in the Bank's view, would have a higher probability of impacting poverty rates.

Things to replicate

Close and real coordination with other development assistance partners is essential to the success
and continuity of policy-based lending, as it provides the necessary financial and political
leverage.

Single-tranche operations, wherein all prior actions are accomplished before Board presentation,
have less operational difficulties and provide the right incentives to the borrower, by rewarding
for self-determined and self-decided actions, rather than "buying" policy reforms that can always
be reversed subsequently. Ideally, these should be yearly operations. From the borrower's
perspective, this also allows closer coordination with the national budget cycle and more
predictability of financial assistance. Accordingly, the amount of the operation needs to be
commensurate with its one-tranche design, as well as the timing of intended development
objectives. For this to be possible, the Bank needs to assign sufficient administrative resources for
project preparation. Finally, yearly operations allow closer harmonization with other donors,
particularly those in the BSG which has a pre-defined schedule for supervision agreed in the JFA.

Things to do differently

Closer coordination with political actors and the legislative is essential to guarantee continuity of
policies. A very illustrative case in point is the School Autonomy Regime.

Indicators for achievement of Policy Development Objectives should be directly linked to prior
actions supported by the operation to provide a consistent basis for ex-post evaluation.

The possibility to introduce some incentives for reporting monitoring indicators, including the
possibility of reducing disbursements in cases of non-compliance, should be analyzed by
operational policy staff. The Bank's overall policy of emphasizing results on the ground
otherwise lacks credibility and efforts to measure impact remain de-linked from supported
policies.

The ICR methodology for measuring achievement of PDOs for single-tranche operations merits
some review (see section 3.3 and footnote 5).

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/Implementing agencies

A draft of this ICR was sent to the borrower, first in English and, upon Borrower's
request, later in Spanish. Staff actively sought to receive comments. The delay in final
submission of this ICR is due to time allowed Borrower to submit comments, which have
not reached IDA to the date of the ICR.

(b) Cofinanciers

Similarly, a draft ICR was submitted to KfW and their comments were actively sought,
but did not reach IDA to the date of the ICR.
