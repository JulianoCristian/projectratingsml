NICARAGUA\n            POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT CREDIT", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The Poverty Reduction Support Credit\n            (PRSC) approved in January 2004, provided financial\n            assistance to Nicaragua to implement the country's\n            Poverty Reduction Strategy. The Credit provided support in\n            four areas: a) macroeconomic stability and protection of\n            poverty expenditure; b) public institutions and governance;\n            c) human capital of the poor and vulnerable populations;\n            and, d) broad-based growth. Nicaragua made satisfactory\n            progress in maintaining a macro-economic framework, and in\n            carrying out the Strategy, and, there has also been\n            satisfactory progress in respect of the key results\n            envisaged in this Credit. Section II discusses the\n            macroeconomic situation, Section III assesses progress with\n            respect to the Poverty Reduction Strategy, and Section IV\n            provides an evaluation of the completion of the nine\n            specific actions. Given the delay in the completion of the\n            registration does not adversely affect the implementation of\n            the overall program supported by the PRSC series, or its\n            components, it is proposed that a waiver be granted.\n            Nevertheless, in order to reflect this delay, the amount of\n            the disbursement would be reduced by SDR 3.5 million (as per\n            the Borrower's cancellation of said amount pursuant to\n            Section 6.01 of the relevant General Conditions). In\n            consultation with the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit,\n            FODIEN - Development Fund for the Electricity Industry - has\n            been restructured through:1) the necessary modifications of\n            FODIEN's legal structure based on an evaluation of such\n            structure; 2) the entry into effect of rules and procedures\n            for selection, implementation and monitoring of subprojects\n            supported by FODIEN; 3) the establishment of funding,\n            financing mechanisms and subsidy allocation criteria for\n            subprojects; 4) the entry into effect of rules and\n            procedures for FODIEN's management; and, 5) the\n            adoption of a medium term financing plan of FODIEN,\n            consistent with overall fiscal sustainability of the Borrower."}, "docdt": "2006-03-24T00:00:00Z"}
